[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.520]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.320]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.860]   Now, with open enrollment coming around the corner
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.580]   for so many people, and for some of you,
[00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.980]   maybe it's already started,
[00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.540]   I really wanted to do an episode
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.200]   to help you go through that decision-making process
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.280]   because I've tried to optimize it
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.000]   many, many times in my life,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   and I felt like that's something worth sharing.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.840]   And then on top of that,
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.280]   I did a ton of research, as I always do,
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.520]   to try to help you guys out.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.080]   So the majority of this episode
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.800]   is gonna focus on health insurance,
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.120]   and we'll go really deep there,
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.520]   and we'll share some hacks to save money and optimize,
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.080]   but I'll also make sure to touch on dental and vision
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.780]   and some other open enrollment options
[00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.960]   like HSAs, FSAs, and employer life insurance.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.000]   And then at the end,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.880]   just because I'm recording this from Hawaii,
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.040]   I'll share a few tips from our experience on the Big Island,
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.040]   not too much, but just a few things that we've done
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.220]   that we thought were really fun.
[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.580]   So lots to cover.
[00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.660]   Let's jump in right after this.
[00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.080]   We recently took a trip to Hawaii,
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.520]   and for the first time ever,
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.200]   I felt like I crushed the Sandcastle game,
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.680]   and that's thanks to a class I took on Masterclass
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.720]   all about sand sculptures.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.640]   And that's just one of so many amazing things
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.400]   I've learned from Masterclass,
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.360]   from making better pizza to leadership
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.080]   to negotiating tactics,
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.440]   which is why I love that I'm able to partner with them
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.720]   for this episode.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.840]   And each time I'm watching Masterclass,
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.200]   whether it's on TV, on the site, in the app,
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.800]   or even in audio mode,
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.340]   the quality speaks for itself,
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.300]   and it really feels like the instructors
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.780]   are your own personal mentors
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.740]   that are helping you reach the next level.
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.800]   And just thinking about how much it would cost
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.300]   to take one-on-one classes from the world's best is crazy,
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.420]   but with a Masterclass,
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.100]   annual membership is only $10 a month,
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.820]   and you get unlimited access to over 180 classes
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.940]   with new ones added every month,
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.620]   like the Science of Better Sleep with Matt Walker
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.220]   that's really helped me recharge better every single night.
[00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.440]   So boost your confidence and find practical takeaways
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.000]   you can apply to your life and at work.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.760]   And right now, our listeners will get an additional 15% off

[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.720]   Okay, so I wanna start this episode
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.320]   giving an overview of some of the really common terms
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.800]   you need to understand to make sense of all this.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.380]   So first, I'm gonna just talk about the plan types.
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.040]   There's HMOs, PPOs, and EPOs.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.740]   And for total context, there might be other types.
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.120]   This isn't meant to be a fully comprehensive guide
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.880]   to everything you might ever cover,
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.400]   but I went pretty deep, so hopefully this covers a lot.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.200]   The main distinction here is with a PPO,
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.720]   you can see a specialist without needing help.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.520]   With an HMO, you need to have a primary doctor on file
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.800]   to refer you to be able to go see a specialist.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.600]   So if you wanted to see a dermatologist,
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.640]   you need to talk to your primary care physician
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.040]   and get them to refer you.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.700]   In my personal stance, that's frustrating for me,
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.760]   so I've always gone with a PPO.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.520]   Although recently we switched to what's called an EPO,
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.000]   which is kind of like a hybrid of the two.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.840]   It's really more like a PPO in that you can see anyone,
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.000]   but you can only go in network.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   So if your doctor's out of network with a PPO,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.400]   usually you can do that with a higher deductible
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.440]   or a higher out-of-pocket maximum or less coverage,
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.120]   higher copay, or maybe there's no copay.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.000]   But with an EPO, you cannot go out of network.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.760]   So a lot of HMOs are similar, at least with Kaiser.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.240]   One kind of big caveat if you live in a state with Kaiser
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.860]   is that when you're on a Kaiser plan,
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.080]   it's usually an HMO plan or a PPO plan,
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.840]   but you can only go with Kaiser.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.320]   You can't see a doctor outside of the Kaiser network.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.740]   In general, the most flexibility you can get
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.560]   comes with a PPO plan, and the HMOs and EPOs
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.280]   are usually a little bit less expensive.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.040]   Next is the deductible, which is usually the amount
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.520]   you have to spend before your health insurance kicks in.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.280]   That said, there are a handful of expenses
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.040]   that usually are covered before the deductible,
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.280]   stuff like preventative care, telehealth,
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.200]   pregnancy, and some basic labs.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.860]   One interesting thing that I actually learned
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.900]   in this process, a lot of plans list
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.900]   individual and family deductibles.
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.760]   I'd always assumed that if you had a plan
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.040]   that covered multiple people,
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.860]   your deductible was the family deductible,
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.800]   and it was just you, yours was the individual.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.800]   But in reading the plan details, I actually read,
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.800]   if you have other family members on the plan,
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.720]   each family member must meet their own
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.260]   individual deductible until the total amount
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.160]   of deductible expenses paid by all family members
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.000]   meets the overall family deductible.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.880]   So there are cases where for a family
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.300]   that might work to your benefit,
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.300]   if one person needs a lot of medical care,
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.680]   they're not actually gonna need to hit
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.920]   that entire family deductible first.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.080]   They're actually gonna only need to hit
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.320]   that individual deductible.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.980]   I actually think that could have changed the calculus
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.000]   on some of the things that we've decided in the past,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.360]   but the past is the past.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.600]   Next is co-insurance.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.620]   And so sometimes you'll see a co-insurance
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.360]   listed as 20% or 10%,
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.080]   and that's the percentage you are required to cover,
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.400]   and your insurance will cover the rest.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.760]   So in fact, if you look at the plans, a lot of the tiers,
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.360]   usually you'll see bronze, silver, gold, and platinum,
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.580]   and those tiers usually correlate
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.760]   to the co-insurance amounts.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.240]   So at bronze, you're responsible for 40%,
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.960]   silver, 30%, gold, 20%, and platinum, 10%.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.220]   Now, usually those kick in after your deductible is met.
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.480]   Then you have your co-pay,
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.880]   where for some types of services, there's co-insurance,
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.560]   and then for others, usually like a primary care visit
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.440]   or a specialist visit, there's a co-pay,
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.340]   usually somewhere between 10 and as high as $95.
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.480]   Usually you have to meet your deductible before,
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.860]   but depending on the plan,
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.160]   sometimes those co-pays actually work
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.240]   even for a specialist visit before your deductible is met.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.640]   So that's definitely one thing
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.520]   that when I looked through all these plans,
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.560]   I couldn't actually get perfect clarity on,
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.960]   so I would definitely read into that.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.700]   Next, there's out-of-pocket maximum,
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.560]   and that's the total amount you'll be liable for
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.400]   before insurance will cover everything.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.140]   So once you hit your out-of-pocket maximum,
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.460]   that's the max you're gonna have to spend on health coverage.
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.940]   And similar to the deductible,
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.360]   if you have other family members on your plan,
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.220]   they each have to meet their own out-of-pocket limits
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.520]   until the overall family out-of-pocket limit has been met.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.520]   So again, this is not what I expected,
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.980]   which is actually quite beneficial.
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.180]   If you happen to be in a family
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.780]   where one person might have really high medical expenses
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.160]   and the rest of the family doesn't,
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.420]   you wouldn't actually be subject
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.600]   to that higher out-of-pocket maximum either.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.880]   Many times that out-of-pocket maximum and that deductible,
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.060]   your copayments don't apply towards that,
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.060]   but usually those are pretty small,
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.020]   so I don't think that is gonna be a big factor.
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.600]   In addition to a lot of those criteria of HMO and PPO,
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.700]   there's also what's called a high-deductible health plan.
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.700]   And usually that is a plan
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.060]   that you would get for more catastrophic situations.
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.400]   Many, but not all, high-deductible health plans
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.720]   are eligible for an HSA, and I'll get to that in a minute.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.000]   And the idea is you wouldn't get a lot of coverage
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.220]   for your basic visits,
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.320]   though again, preventative visits are usually always covered,
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.640]   but going to see a specialist,
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.660]   you're gonna pay completely out-of-pocket for that
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.780]   until you hit this very high-deductible,
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.100]   which depending on your plan, could be as low as $1,600,
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.980]   could be as high as $7,000 or more.
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.780]   And so if you have a high-deductible health plan
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.460]   that meets certain requirements,
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.620]   you are also eligible for an HSA.
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.820]   And an HSA is a special savings account
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.040]   called a health savings account
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.320]   that you can put money into pre-tax.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.640]   You can actually, while that money's there,
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.840]   invest that money.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.560]   Many providers will let you open up,
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.600]   effectively like a brokerage account for the HSA
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.440]   and invest it.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.620]   All the gains on that account are tax-free.
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.160]   And then when you take the money out,
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.480]   which you must do to pay for eligible health expenses,
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.120]   you do not pay taxes there either.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.880]   So it's got this triple tax advantage.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.660]   It's one of the most amazing investment accounts out there,
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.440]   but you are only eligible for it
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.680]   if you have a HSA-eligible high-deductible health plan.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.000]   I'll get to a couple tricks with the HSA later,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.680]   but that's just another little overview.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.860]   Next, on plans, you'll usually see two lists of coverages,
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.920]   one for in-network and one for out-of-network.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.840]   And so the way that works is every carrier has a network,
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.320]   but it's not just for the carrier.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.360]   In fact, it's for the plan specifically.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.440]   So you might have had Anthem or Blue Cross Blue Shield
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.120]   at one employer on one plan
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.240]   and go to another employer on another plan,
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.880]   and you might find that that network
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.200]   is not actually the same.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.040]   So definitely need to make sure that your doctors
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.840]   that you want covered are in the network,
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.260]   even if you think they might be.
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.560]   And that's a really important thing
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.960]   because some plans have no out-of-network coverage,
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.760]   some plans have out-of-network coverage,
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.160]   but it's at a much, much higher deductible,
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.240]   out-of-pocket maximum, coinsurance, et cetera.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.340]   So definitely, when I'm ever, I'm looking at any plans,
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.480]   if there are doctors that you're really tied to,
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.860]   you can go in there and search for whether those doctors
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.380]   are part of the network or not.
[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.320]   And then last, where you even get these plans.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.840]   So if you work at a company that provides health insurance,
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.320]   then it's pretty straightforward.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.800]   You usually get the insurance from your employer.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.000]   It's usually a much better deal to do that
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.160]   than any other place, and so that is an easy option.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.120]   However, if your employer doesn't offer health insurance
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.400]   or you don't have employment, there are a few options.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.640]   So one is from the exchange.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.120]   So as part of the Affordable Care Act,
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.960]   there are healthcare exchanges in every state,
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.100]   and you can go and enroll in insurance.
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.320]   You can go on COBRA.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.000]   If you've left your previous employer,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.840]   you can stay on their health coverage
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.560]   as long as you cover it fully at the full cost
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.080]   for up to 18 months.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.240]   Or if you own a business,
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.240]   you can actually shop for plans for your business.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.760]   Or if you're over 65, you're eligible for Medicare.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.600]   This episode is not gonna go deep on Medicare
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.200]   since I'm not very familiar with it,
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.320]   but I will say that in addition to Medicare,
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.940]   you can get supplemental policies
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.920]   to go above and beyond what Medicare offers.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.440]   And we're gonna go back to things
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.240]   that are kind of broadly applicable to everyone,
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.120]   but just for the people looking on exchanges
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.360]   or trying to figure out what to do,
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.420]   there are also brokers who are there
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.200]   to help you find those plans,
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.280]   either as an employer looking for plans
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.840]   or just someone looking for a plan on the exchange.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.400]   Typically, you're not paying them
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.720]   and your health insurance costs aren't gonna be higher,
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.760]   so there's not necessarily a downside
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.760]   to working with a broker,
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.900]   but having talked to three or four brokers
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.040]   going through this process for us this year,
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.800]   because we both left our employment
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.640]   and we were both looking for health insurance
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.600]   for the whole family,
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.080]   I couldn't find a broker that had access to any plans
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.280]   that I couldn't easily get access to myself.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.420]   As an employer, you can usually go
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.700]   on a lot of these websites.
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.580]   So for all the hacks,
[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.020]   we went onto these small business plans and looked at them.
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.920]   Some of the HR platforms we use,
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.480]   Gusto is a broker and can give you access to plans.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.000]   So maybe as an employer,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.160]   the brokers might be able to give you plans,
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.440]   but I don't think it's really worth shopping around
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.540]   to lots of brokers because at the end of the day,
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.820]   I didn't find anything unique from any of them.
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.580]   And on the individual side,
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.940]   I didn't find anything I couldn't have found on my own
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.140]   on the carrier websites or the exchanges.
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.020]   A couple notes, if you are looking at starting a business
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.000]   or getting insurance for your business,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.380]   a lot of the carriers have a requirement.
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.980]   You need to have at least one non-spouse, non-owner employee.
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:34.140]   Now, in some plans, Kaiser and Blue Shield in California,
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.560]   you need a non-owner, but they can be a spouse employee.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.280]   So you need a minimum of two employees.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.240]   So it could be you and your spouse
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.420]   if they're not an owner in the business.
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.000]   And by owner, I don't mean, you know,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.040]   through California joint property kind of law,
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.080]   I mean, owner on the LLC.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.440]   If you're both owners, usually you need a third employee
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.000]   to be eligible for a lot of these plans who is not an owner.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.080]   So definitely something to look into there.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.360]   And one important thing to consider,
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.960]   when we were looking at all these plans,
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.960]   we were actually really surprised that certain doctors
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.840]   were just not in network anywhere.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.360]   And so I have a few doctors at Stanford Medical,
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.840]   and I was trying to figure out
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.800]   which plans they would be under.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.420]   And I went through over a dozen plans
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.800]   on the Covered California Healthcare Exchange site,
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.680]   and I couldn't find anyone that had our doctors in coverage.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.280]   And so I called and I asked them,
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.840]   "What insurance do you guys take?"
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.120]   Because I'm so confused.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.480]   And Stanford actually said
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.320]   they don't accept non-group policies,
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.400]   meaning they don't accept health insurance
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.280]   that is not through an employer.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.000]   So none of the Covered California Exchange plans
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.120]   would work at Stanford.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.960]   So if you're getting a little confused,
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.960]   it might be that maybe the doctor or the hospital
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.840]   or the medical provider you work with,
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.760]   maybe they don't take non-group plans,
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.480]   and that's definitely something to consider.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.160]   In fact, for us, it put a strong, strong advantage
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.760]   to the COBRA plans and the small business plans
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.320]   because we want it to be able to continue seeing the doctors
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.320]   that we were already looking at.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.060]   And then last, all of that, there are a few other options,
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.680]   things like medical sharing plans.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.960]   I'll come back to that later
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.560]   because I guess the idea here was to give an overview
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.800]   of just the terms and the things you're gonna run into.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.160]   But medical sharing plans
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.240]   are an alternative to health insurance
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.360]   that is eligible for the requirements
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.960]   that you have coverage from the Affordable Care Act,
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.360]   but they are very different and I'll get to them.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.980]   Now that I have kids, I wanna be more focused at work
[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.720]   so I can spend more time with them.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.840]   And I wanna have a stronger immune system
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.120]   for all the crap they bring home from school,
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.800]   which is why if you're a long-time listener,
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.040]   you might know I've been drinking AG1 for about two years.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.740]   When I started drinking AG1 daily,
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.340]   it was to help with daily nutrition,
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.040]   but I also felt a real difference
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.820]   in the energy I had every day,
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.960]   so it's been in my routine ever since.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.280]   And that's because AG1
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.200]   is a foundational nutrition supplement
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.280]   that supports your body's universal needs
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.840]   like gut optimization, stress management, and immune support.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.460]   Since 2010, AG1 has led the future
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.960]   of foundational nutrition,
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.960]   continuously refining their formula
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.720]   to create a smarter, better way
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.880]   to elevate your baseline health.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.100]   Most of all, I love that AG1 takes all the guesswork
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.440]   out of trying to combine the right supplements
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.640]   and provide multiple products in one easy scoop.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.280]   Not to mention, it tastes great,
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.240]   especially shaken with ice,
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.420]   which is why I trust it to provide my body
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.080]   the support it needs daily,
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.640]   and also why I'm excited
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.960]   that they've been a partner of the show for so long.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.660]   If you wanna take ownership of your health,
[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.400]   it starts with AG1.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.200]   Try AG1 and get a free one-year supply
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.480]   of vitamin D3K2 and five free AG1 travel packs
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.900]   with your first purchase.
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.480]   Go to allthehacks.com/AG1.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.960]   That's allthehacks.com/AG1.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.800]   Check it out.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.420]   If you're like me,
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.960]   you already know how amazing Notion is,
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.660]   the sponsor of today's episode.
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.820]   I use it every day for taking notes,
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.360]   tracking tasks, managing this podcast,
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.640]   and really organizing everything in our lives
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.280]   from the kids to travel,
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.800]   and even tracking all of our credit card perks
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.360]   to make sure we use them all.
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.700]   So I was excited to learn
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.880]   that they've launched a new AI tool called Q&A.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.620]   It's like a personal assistant that responds in seconds
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.160]   with exactly what you need.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.440]   So if you have an urgent question
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.580]   you'd normally turn to a coworker to answer,
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.500]   just ask Q&A instead.

[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.360]   So when I go through this process,
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.620]   there's kind of two axes.
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.600]   There's the carrier and the plan.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.880]   And so you might be looking at,
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.480]   especially if you're on the exchange,
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.520]   there's two or three carriers that all offer a bronze PPO.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.560]   So you need to decide which carrier do I want
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.160]   and then which type of plan do I want.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.600]   If you're employed by a company,
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.180]   you might not have a lot of choices.
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.200]   You know, in California,
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.300]   I've typically had companies where there is a Kaiser option
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.700]   and then an other option,
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.600]   whether that's Cigna or UnitedHealthcare
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.960]   or Blue Cross or Blue Shield,
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.000]   but there's usually not a carrier choice
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.920]   other than Kaiser and non-Kaiser.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.740]   So you don't really have to think about the carriers,
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.120]   but if you're on the exchange
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.800]   or you're picking as an employer,
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.860]   it can be tricky to decide which carrier makes sense.
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.560]   In fact, if you look at the ratings in California,
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.040]   only Kaiser has more than three stars.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.760]   Every other carrier on the exchanges in California
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.560]   is a two or three star carrier
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:49.000]   by whatever system Covered California uses for stars.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.380]   There's not an obvious way
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.560]   to decide which carrier makes sense.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.400]   It kind of feels a little bit like airlines.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.600]   Some people have their favorites
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.780]   and then other people have had terrible experiences
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.600]   with what could be someone else's favorites.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.040]   And so for every person that's probably said,
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.560]   "Oh, UnitedHealthcare was great.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.480]   They covered everything."
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.960]   There's certainly gonna be a person who said,
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.120]   "Well, they wouldn't cover anything
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.040]   and it was so frustrating to deal with them."
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:09.960]   So at the end of the day,
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.640]   I'm really focusing on just the plans that are there
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.060]   and picking a carrier that seems reputable,
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.920]   but it's a little bit for me a crapshoot
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.380]   as to which carrier is the best.
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.860]   And, you know, I kind of wish that it was a situation
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.820]   where I worked at a company and I didn't get to pick
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.540]   because honestly, I don't think there's an easy way
[00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.360]   to know which one is going to be the best
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.940]   for your circumstance in advance.
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.740]   So ultimately, what it really comes down to
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.640]   is picking a plan.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.300]   So first, you've got that question of EPO, PPO, or HMO.
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:38.400]   And I think that if you have a primary care doctor
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.520]   and you're okay having them be the point person,
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.600]   you can save some money going to an HMO.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.140]   But if you really prefer to be able to have the flexibility
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.520]   to go see a specialist and not need anything,
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.840]   then a PPO could be great.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.400]   And then when it comes to EPOs,
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.100]   I think the really important thing
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.960]   is that you do an exhaustive search
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.900]   to see if every doctor or provider
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.360]   you might want to go to is covered.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.240]   And so what we did was we went in
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.080]   and searched for all the doctors we've seen,
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.680]   but then we also went to like the 20 best medical facilities
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.840]   all around the country
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.480]   in case some crazy extreme thing happened.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.240]   What if we got a rare form of cancer
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.220]   and we wanted to go to Johns Hopkins or Mayo Clinic
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.360]   or some other very specialized center,
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.120]   but we looked and all those doctors were covered.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.800]   And so we felt really good about the EPO we were going to.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.640]   And in a lot of cases, the EPO plans are really great.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.000]   Ours has no deductible, no co-insurance,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.440]   basically co-pays only for everything.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:32.800]   So ER visit is $150, hospital, surgery, that kind of stuff,
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.200]   zero dollar co-pay, zero co-insurance.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.720]   You have no expenses.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.880]   Most doctor's visits are $20, $30,
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.500]   but you can only go in network.
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.720]   So it's a huge issue if the network wasn't good.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.560]   And then the question is,
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.200]   do you want the high deductible health plan or not?
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.720]   I used to think a high deductible health plan
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.680]   only made sense if you weren't gonna be spending
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.760]   that much on coverage.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.560]   But actually, now that I did the math,
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.040]   having to pay for these plans on our own,
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.480]   the increased premiums,
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.900]   and I guess I never defined premium,
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.520]   but premium is the amount you pay each month for your plan.
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.400]   The increased premiums on plans with much lower deductibles
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.320]   often are so high that it makes up entirely
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.360]   for the cost savings on the deductibles,
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.480]   meaning you're almost cost shifting.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.120]   So if you had a lot of healthcare expenses in January,
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.800]   with the really expensive plan,
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.720]   you're paying a high premium every month
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.680]   throughout the year,
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.400]   but you're not having to pay a ton of money
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.520]   up front in January.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.180]   Whereas if you paid a much lower premium,
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.120]   but needed a lot of care in the beginning of the year,
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.480]   you'd have really high bills.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.240]   So I thought maybe I would just try to give you an example
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.640]   of two plans that are on Covered California for us,
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.520]   that we considered,
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.680]   that's the Bronze and the Platinum PPO from Blue Shield.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.180]   A lot of these plans aren't gonna make sense
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.440]   if you don't live in the state in the same exchange,
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.700]   but I think the overall comparison is helpful
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:43.760]   no matter where you are.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.880]   So the premiums for us as a family of four
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.200]   were $2,000 a month and $4,000 a month.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.480]   So significant extra cost.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.840]   The deductibles were $0 on the expensive plan,
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.260]   but they were about $6,000 for an individual
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.880]   and almost 13,000 for a family on the Bronze PPO.
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.880]   So really high deductible that you're gonna have to hit.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.140]   However, if we have to spend an extra $2,000 a month
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.720]   for that Platinum PPO plan,
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.900]   that's gonna cost us $24,000 a year.
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.600]   By the way, yes, health insurance in California
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.240]   for two people that are 39 years old and two kids
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.200]   is really, really, really expensive.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.360]   So that $24,000 of extra premium
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.200]   could more than cover the deductible.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.120]   In fact, the out-of-pocket maximum
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.480]   was $8,000 and $16,000 for individual and family,
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.520]   which we could absolutely completely cover
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.120]   with the total cost of the premiums
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.440]   for the Platinum Plan also.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.220]   And so while the Platinum Plan had no deductible
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.840]   and a four and a half or $9,000 out-of-pocket maximum,
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.820]   it just didn't seem to make any sense.
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.040]   And that was after really digging.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.120]   At the beginning, I thought,
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.960]   well, yeah, let's pay up front a lot
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.920]   so that we don't have all these ongoing expenses.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.800]   But when I actually dug in to do the math,
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:55.280]   I was totally surprised that the increased premium cost
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.160]   just negated all the benefits.
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.600]   Now, if you work at a company
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.700]   where your employer is giving you both options
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.400]   and you don't have to pay any extra,
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.800]   then sure, I would much rather have the Platinum Plan
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.520]   because all my ongoing expenses are gonna be much lower.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.320]   For these two plans, they had the same network.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.200]   And while the PPO had 10% co-insurance
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.420]   and the Bronze had 40, it was a bit strange
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.640]   because the Bronze 40 doesn't actually kick in
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.820]   till you hit the deductible.
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.240]   So it didn't really matter that much.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.280]   But on the PPO, it definitely kicked in.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.120]   As an example, the Bronze Plan to go to the ER
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.180]   was a 40% co-insurance after you hit your deductible
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.120]   and the Platinum PPO was $150.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.480]   So again, if you don't factor in the cost of the premiums,
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.160]   then the Platinum PPO feels like a much better deal.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:39.360]   Co-pays were $15 and $30 instead of $65 and $95.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.120]   So very, very different.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.960]   The one cool thing that I learned
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.200]   that I'd never seen before until I dug in
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.840]   was that the Bronze PPO actually had a feature
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.520]   called First Dollar Coverage.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.840]   And I'd never seen this before,
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.400]   but basically they cover the first three visits,
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.000]   whether they're primary care, specialist, urgent care,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.020]   before you need to meet your deductible.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.800]   So that's definitely something to look into
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.220]   if you're considering one of these higher deductible plans
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.560]   because you might not realize
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.720]   that something else is covered.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.600]   That Bronze PPO was actually, despite the high deductible,
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.120]   not actually eligible for an HSA.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.640]   There was a Bronze High Deductible Help Plan
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:17.120]   that was eligible for an HSA, slightly higher deductibles,
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.520]   but surprisingly lower out-of-pocket maximum.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.200]   That said, there was no co-insurance, no co-pays,
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.560]   no First Dollar Coverage for visits.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.980]   Other than preventative care,
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.560]   you are on your own for absolutely everything.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.880]   That said, you're also eligible for an HSA.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.000]   The HSA contribution limits for a family this year
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.200]   are $8,300.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.080]   For an individual, it's $4,150.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.240]   And by this year, I mean for 2024.
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.400]   So depending on your tax bracket,
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.540]   let's say you're at the 35% tax bracket,
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.840]   putting that money in that HSA
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.640]   is actually probably gonna save you about $3,000.
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.960]   And on top of that, it's gonna grow over time,
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.200]   you're not gonna pay tax on that, and when you withdraw it.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.140]   And honestly, one of the hacks
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.800]   that I've heard so many people use for an HSA,
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.800]   instead of just using it to meet the deductibles
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.360]   and the costs in the year that you're contributing to it,
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.800]   if you have the cash flow, use your savings,
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.960]   use your salary to pay your medical expenses,
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.000]   and just let that account grow as long as it can,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.040]   tax free until maybe you're in retirement
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.400]   and need that money for other medical expenses,
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.980]   and you've built up a massive, massive amount
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.560]   because it could compound for 30 plus years.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.880]   And by the way, if you wanna create a Dropbox
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.840]   or Google Drive folder
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.420]   and put all your medical receipts and expenses there,
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.460]   just in case you don't have medical expenses
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.160]   like you think in the future, or maybe healthcare changes,
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.960]   you can actually reimburse yourself.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.040]   There's not actually a limit
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.800]   to how long expenses are eligible to be reimbursed.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.840]   You could save those receipts from 2024,
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.320]   but reimburse yourself for them 30 years from now,
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.400]   assuming nothing else changes, of course.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.800]   And so the HSA is great.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.240]   I wish I could contribute to it.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.380]   Ultimately for us,
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.480]   we actually ended up going with the Cobra plan.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.400]   I'd always in my mind assumed Cobra
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.640]   was the most expensive thing.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.040]   For whatever reason, people kind of had just made me feel
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.160]   like Cobra is so expensive,
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.040]   but for us, we could get a plan that was as good or better
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:01.800]   than the top $4,000 a month plan on the exchange,
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.040]   and the Cobra pricing was about $2,200.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.980]   So way, way, way more cost-effective for us.
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:08.980]   It was an EPO, which we love
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.320]   because we don't have to think about the expense.
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.920]   I think that's the other challenge
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.880]   when you pick a high deductible health plan
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.760]   that you have to really process is,
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.300]   is there a psychological effect
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.560]   that's going to change how you get care?
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:24.040]   So for example, if you know that going to the pediatrician
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.860]   when your child is sick is gonna cost $400,
[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.280]   do you go or do you kind of hold it out for five days
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.840]   because you don't wanna spend that cost?
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.880]   At the beginning of the year, of course you said,
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.920]   well, it's way cheaper
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.400]   even if we go to the doctor every single time
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.960]   than to pay these higher premiums,
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.800]   but in the moment, are you gonna do it?
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.640]   So for example, I had this crazy pain
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.240]   in my upper abdomen area, and I had no idea what it was,
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.740]   and it was so incredibly painful.
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.200]   I ended up on a Saturday just going to the emergency room,
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.880]   and because my health insurance plan
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.560]   covered everything other than $100 deductible,
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.240]   I thought, I just need to get this solved.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.440]   It's Saturday, I don't wanna wait until the morning,
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.280]   and so I just went.
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.080]   And the bill for that ER visit,
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.840]   when I actually looked at the bill,
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.360]   obviously I didn't have to pay it,
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.880]   but when I looked at what the insurance company paid,
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.640]   it was over $10,000,
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.480]   which could be a whole 'nother conversation
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.580]   about how ridiculously expensive that was.
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.600]   I saw a doctor, did one test.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.600]   I have no idea how that's justified,
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.840]   but I didn't have to pay it,
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.680]   and so I didn't really need to fight back.
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.420]   But knowing that cost,
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.280]   if I had a high deductible health plan,
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.600]   I definitely wouldn't have gone.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.100]   And maybe you could argue that's better.
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.040]   Maybe I didn't need to go, maybe I could have held out,
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.620]   but I think there are a lot of circumstances
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.840]   where because we don't have to pay so much for each visit,
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.240]   we're a little bit more liberal with how much care we get.
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.600]   And I know that even sometimes Amy and I
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.520]   have caught ourselves saying,
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.000]   do we wanna run to this doctor's visit?
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.280]   And all we had was a $35 copay,
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.600]   and we were like, is it even worth it?
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.240]   Which, yes, $35 should never get in the way of health.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.080]   For frugal people, sometimes I know it will,
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.440]   but if it was four or $500,
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.520]   I feel like it would get in the way every time.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.960]   And so in a way,
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.620]   getting on a plan that doesn't have that high deductible
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.480]   kind of forces us to do that.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.540]   I wish I just had the mental ability
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:03.780]   to not get caught up there,
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.780]   and that psychological pressure didn't affect me,
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.700]   it would be much easier.
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.120]   But for me, that was really tricky.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.820]   So that's just something to consider.
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.420]   It's a big impact on all of this.
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.060]   That said, financially, the Platinum Plan
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.060]   seems to almost never make sense in almost any scenario.
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.340]   So I started doing some research.
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.440]   Does the Platinum Plan ever make sense?
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:23.380]   And there are tons of articles that point out the math
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.140]   that no, it doesn't really make sense.
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.420]   The only arguments would be if that is the only way
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.520]   to get in network doctors that you want,
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.660]   or if your employer is covering the cost of it,
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:33.500]   that's great,
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.360]   or if you really need that spread out cashflow.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.620]   If having a $10,000 expense in the beginning of the month
[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:41.300]   would really be a problem,
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.140]   but paying an extra thousand or $2,000 a month
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:45.460]   over the course of the year wouldn't,
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:46.620]   then maybe that makes sense.
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:47.700]   And one thing I should point out,
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.260]   if you are paying for this as a business,
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.920]   the cost of health insurance is often deductible.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.100]   So this is not an episode on tax advice, I am not a CPA,
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:57.900]   but that's definitely something to consider
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.780]   as you factor in how much you're gonna be spending
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:02.220]   on medical coverage, how much of it's tax deductible,
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.140]   maybe the plans are, but the medical expenses aren't,
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.300]   and that might change the calculus there a little bit.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.180]   And then the psychological thing is real.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.620]   I was actually looking into this and now I'm like, hmm,
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.420]   I started thinking platinum made sense,
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:14.820]   now I'm thinking gold.
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.540]   Fortunately, because we're on COBRA for 18 months,
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.220]   we have about 14 more months
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.860]   before we have to think about any of this.
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.320]   But in 14 months,
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.700]   I honestly can't tell you what I think we're gonna do.
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.820]   I would have told you something completely different
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.420]   two weeks ago, and instead of trying to figure it out,
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.300]   I thought, let's just wait until then
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.580]   and share everything I've learned.
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.980]   But if one thing is for sure, it's that going into it,
[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.900]   I thought the platinum plan was for sure it,
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.600]   and now I'm not sure I agree.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:43.420]   I got so fed up with ridiculously expensive razor blades
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:45.220]   that I had to search for a better option,
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.860]   and I not only ended up saving a ton of money,
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.260]   but I'm now getting an even better shave,
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:52.460]   which is why you've gotta check out Henson Shaving,
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.880]   who I'm excited to partner with for this episode.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.800]   First off, Henson Shaving is an aerospace parts manufacturer
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.000]   that decided to bring their precision engineering
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.160]   to a razor.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.220]   Why does that matter?
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.600]   Well, it turns out razor blades
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.480]   are kind of like diving boards.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.800]   The longer the board, the more wobble,
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.780]   which leads to nicks and cuts.
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.860]   So a bad shave isn't actually a blade problem,
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.560]   it's an extension problem.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.840]   And by using aerospace-grade machines,
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.240]   Henson makes metal razors that extend out
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:25.240]   just .0013 inches, less than the thickness of a human hair,
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.720]   which means a secure and stable blade
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.000]   with a vibration-free shave.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.600]   I actually spent the first few weeks
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.120]   using my Henson razor on one half of my face
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.920]   and my old overpriced cartridge razor on the other,
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.320]   so I can very confidently say it's a much better shave.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.920]   And the best thing, once you own a Henson razor,
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.520]   it's only about $3 to $5 a year
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.780]   to replace the standard dual-edged blades.
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.800]   It's time to say no to subscriptions
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.880]   and yes to a razor that will last you a lifetime.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.680]   Visit allthehacks.com/henson to pick the razor for you
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.480]   and use code ALLTHEHACKS
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.760]   to get two years worth of blades free with your razor.

[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.720]   Money can be stressful,
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.320]   but if you wanna find some inner peace
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.600]   from actually knowing how much you're spending and on what,
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.160]   so you can be more intentional
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.640]   about your financial decisions,
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.640]   you have to check out Copilot,
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.720]   which is one of my all-time favorite apps.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.440]   I check it almost every day,
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.940]   and I'm so excited to finally be partnering with them
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.480]   on this episode after being such a huge fan.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.800]   Copilot makes it seamless and easy to track your spending
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.080]   and in my case, boost your savings.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.460]   I've tried dozens of apps for tracking spending
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:46.280]   and Copilot is the only one I've kept using.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.480]   You can link it to accounts at over 10,000 institutions
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.680]   and their automatic expense categorization
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.600]   is the best I've ever used
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.780]   with custom Amazon and Venmo integrations
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.220]   to make it even better.
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.800]   You can completely design your spending categories
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.260]   and subcategories and easily set up rules
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.940]   to assign transactions to them in the future.
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.520]   Thanks to Copilot, I have never had a better grasp
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.380]   of our spending and cashflow,
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.840]   which honestly has probably resulted in hundreds
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.660]   or maybe even thousands of dollars of savings each year.
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.900]   So for the best app to track your spending,
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:19.680]   subscriptions, investments, and now real estate,
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:23.800]   go to allthehacks.com/copilot on an iPhone or Mac
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.080]   to download Copilot and enter code HACKS2
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.040]   during onboarding for a two-month free trial.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:33.000]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/copilot
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.480]   and the code HACKS2 for a free two-month trial
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.720]   of my favorite personal finance app.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.440]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.920]   and supporting the show.

[00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:59.080]   I also wanna talk about some hacks.
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.900]   So that's a lot about how to think about this,
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:02.980]   how to make decisions, but there are a few things
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:03.820]   if you're looking at this and saying,
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.080]   wow, it's really expensive, how do I bring costs down?
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.580]   How do I do things a little differently?
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:10.640]   And there are a few really interesting tactics I've heard.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.960]   So one is enrolling in college.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.580]   And this might seem a little crazy,
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.060]   but there are a lot of universities
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.520]   that offer really, really, really compelling
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.140]   health insurance plans for students,
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:21.580]   even some community colleges.
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:23.780]   So definitely take a look in your area,
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.480]   or maybe there's an online university
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.360]   where you can enroll and take a few credits,
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.140]   learn something, and in return,
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:33.420]   save way more on the health insurance that you might need.
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.580]   And some of those do include family plans.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:39.060]   So I saw someone posting in a long thread on Reddit
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:42.660]   about how they ended up spending like $500 a semester
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:43.900]   or something for college,
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:47.060]   but in return, saved $10,000 a year on health insurance.
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:47.900]   So that's one.
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.420]   Another one, which may or may not be something
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.220]   you're interested in, but there are really great
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.940]   health plans at much, much less cost to you
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.540]   if you are part of the military reserves.
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.460]   So if you wanted to join the Army Reserves,
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.660]   Marine Corps, any of the military reserve programs,
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.820]   great healthcare there.
[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.300]   If you have the kinds of expertise
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.000]   that you could be a part-time teacher
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.420]   or professor at a university,
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.620]   again, you could get some similar coverage there,
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:09.260]   or even a part-time employee.
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.900]   If there's a company that might employ you,
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.020]   give you health insurance as a part-time person,
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:13.940]   that's interesting.
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.740]   So those are some hacks on getting plans.
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.220]   Now we'll talk a little bit about medical sharing plans.
[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.260]   So this is a really interesting one,
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.660]   and it's quite controversial.
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.780]   There's a John Oliver, last week tonight,
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:25.720]   entire episode devoted to this.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.220]   I'm not gonna try to re-summarize all of that,
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.700]   but I will make it clear
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.740]   that these are not health insurance.
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:35.140]   So the way these plans work are that members contribute money
[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:38.720]   to a organization, and that organization has rules
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.180]   about how they will contribute to members
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.720]   who need expenses paid for medical services.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.460]   They don't guarantee the payment,
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.900]   and they certainly aren't held to the same standards
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.240]   and consumer protections as health insurance plans.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.140]   For example, the Affordable Care Act
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:56.100]   requires insurance companies to spend at least 80 to 85%
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.900]   of their premium dollars on medical care.
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.460]   No rules like that here.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.780]   Most of these companies are private,
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.940]   so seeing how their operations work is almost impossible,
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.620]   but there have been a few court cases
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.340]   that resulted in some learnings,
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.480]   and at least one of these medical sharing companies,
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.400]   it turns out they spent something less than 20%
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.600]   of the premiums they collected on medical care.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.320]   So really a weird space.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.220]   I have some friends that have been on these
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.000]   and have had great experiences,
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.320]   but again, very different sets of rules.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.120]   They're not required to cover any preexisting conditions.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:28.720]   They can place lifetime or annual caps on things.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.440]   A really catastrophic health event
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.080]   could easily exceed your sharing plan limits.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.440]   And also, many of them are very tied into a religion.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.320]   And so if that's not something
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.700]   that is part of your lifestyle, it can be a bit strange.
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.840]   So if that's not something that's part of your lifestyle,
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.400]   it might not be a good fit for you.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.120]   I know there are some medical sharing plans that,
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.640]   for example, if you have a child out of wedlock,
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.720]   not covered by insurance, things like that.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.840]   And so definitely, definitely worth reading into them.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.200]   I do think that if you're earlier in your life
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.720]   and there's really low costs,
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.320]   maybe it could be a way to save money.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.400]   But for me, I don't want something
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.840]   that might have some limit,
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.760]   might require me to jump through hoops,
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.800]   or just might require me to spend a lot of money
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.040]   because I didn't get covered,
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.120]   or even have to go through a lot of hassle.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:15.220]   Many of these plans require you to pay on your own
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:16.880]   and request reimbursement.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.720]   Not all of them.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.320]   The general idea of these plans is interesting.
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:23.360]   The idea that we would basically group self-insure
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.660]   is definitely interesting.
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.240]   But the more that I read into them,
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.640]   the more I think that it's something
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.440]   that I'm not personally interested in.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.880]   That said, if anyone listening has experiences,
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:32.960]   would love to hear about them
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.840]   because I don't feel like I have enough
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.080]   firsthand experience.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.040]   But from what I've read,
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.260]   it's not something that we're considering at all.
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.220]   When it comes to saving,
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.440]   two other big areas that I thought I'd focus on.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:46.000]   One is if you're on a plan with high deductibles
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.520]   and you wanna cut the cost down of your medical care,
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.360]   there are two things.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.960]   So one is direct primary care.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.340]   There are a lot of doctor's offices
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:53.920]   and doctors around the country
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.580]   that have started creating a direct relationship
[00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:57.420]   with their patients.
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.520]   So someone wrote in that they use PartnerMD
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.000]   in the Northern Virginia, DC area,
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.240]   where you pay a usually a monthly or annual fee.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.240]   And that covers your ability to get primary care visits
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.280]   or message your doctor if you're sick
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.120]   and get a prescription
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.440]   or any of the kind of basic things
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.880]   you'd see your primary care doctor for
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:17.240]   without having to pay out of pocket each time.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.200]   It's not quite concierge medicine
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.360]   in that they're not focused on crazy testing and longevity
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.440]   and coming to your house,
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:26.280]   but they are creating kind of a fixed cost
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.180]   to cover all of your primary care needs.
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:30.740]   In the past, I've also talked on the pediatric side
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.500]   about two companies that we've tried out.
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:33.880]   One's called Summer Health
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.740]   and one's called Blueberry Pediatrics.
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.580]   And they're effectively direct primary care for pediatrics.
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:41.180]   So you pay a fixed cost of $20 a month
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:44.460]   and they will be on call through mostly text message,
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:46.860]   but also you can schedule calls with Blueberry
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.380]   to be able to talk to a doctor
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.180]   to help with situations related to your kids.
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:51.780]   Obviously, if you need to go into the office
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:53.420]   and do a test, they can't do that,
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.940]   but it really would cut down on that cost.
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.660]   So if you have a high deductible health plan,
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.340]   definitely something to look into
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:01.740]   to lower the cost of your health insurance
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.660]   so you don't have to hit those deductibles.
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:04.740]   On the more expensive side,
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.660]   there are concierge medical practices
[00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:09.100]   where you'd spend anywhere from thousands
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:11.220]   to tens of thousands of dollars a year
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.140]   and have access to doctors
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:14.700]   and that would cover all of your visits,
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:16.980]   usually cover all of your testing as well.
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:19.300]   But that I will save for another episode
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.140]   outside of the scope of open enrollment.
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:22.780]   And then finally, if you are paying
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.460]   for a lot of your own medical expenses
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.340]   because you have a high deductible health plan,
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:27.940]   definitely worth negotiating,
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.060]   definitely worth asking for cash rates.
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:33.140]   I know that some hospitals and facilities even publish
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.940]   if you're paying cash, we'll give you a discount.
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:37.340]   I did a whole episode with Marshall Allen,
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:39.100]   episode 34 of all the hacks.
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.860]   He wrote an amazing book called "Never Pay the First Bill"
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:43.380]   that's all about fighting back
[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.180]   and pushing back against healthcare costs.
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:47.140]   And so if you are paying on your own,
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.420]   you should always be negotiating with your providers
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:52.180]   and with any facilities and asking for cash rates.
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:53.660]   If you're paying for your own prescriptions,
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.380]   there are sites like GoodRx or RxSaver
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:59.140]   that you can use to get discounts on prescriptions as well,
[00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:01.860]   or at least shop around and find the best prices.
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.660]   That is definitely something worth doing
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.100]   if you are paying on your own.
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.140]   So I think that mostly covered everything I've learned
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:08.420]   on the health insurance side.
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:09.780]   I'm sure more will come up.
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.740]   If you have other things to share, let me know.
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.340]   We're gonna probably do an episode like this
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.700]   every few years so we can cover whatever's changed.
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:17.880]   But I also wanna talk about some of the other things
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.380]   that you're gonna be doing for open enrollment.
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.260]   So when it comes to dental and vision insurance,
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:22.620]   there are a lot of mixed opinions
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.660]   because dental insurance, for example,
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:27.340]   often doesn't cover that much and has a cap.
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.700]   And so really it's kind of 50/50
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.340]   whether it makes financial sense.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.180]   If your employer covers it completely,
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:34.540]   then it seems like a no-brainer.
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.780]   If you are someone who's regularly
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.020]   going to get your checkups,
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:40.040]   sometimes it can just be a break even there.
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.500]   If you have a filling every now and then
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.420]   or something like that, it seems to make sense.
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:44.740]   And then vision insurance,
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.780]   I actually have not ever used my vision insurance,
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:50.380]   but it's usually only cost somewhere on the order
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:52.460]   of one to $2 per pay period
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:53.620]   at whatever company I've worked with.
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:54.980]   So I just kept it on there.
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.500]   I haven't looked a lot into private vision insurance,
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:58.900]   so I don't have a lot there.
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.340]   So I'm sorry to leave you guys hanging
[00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.140]   if that's something that's really important to you.
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:05.100]   That's one where I'm gonna lean on someone
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:08.220]   that maybe knows more about doing private vision insurance
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.760]   if you're on your own or from an exchange
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.860]   and whether that makes sense versus from your employer.
[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.220]   But I did actually on the dental side,
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.700]   so when I went to the dentist recently,
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:16.660]   I was talking to my dentist
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:18.220]   about a lot of the cost of medical care,
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:20.540]   and he pointed out that he has a membership
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:22.780]   that is effectively like dental direct primary care.
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:26.260]   So for $375 a year, you can be a member of their practice.
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:29.220]   There's no deductibles, no maximums, no waiting periods,
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:30.500]   no pre-authorization,
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.540]   and that covers two cleanings and x-rays a year.
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:34.640]   And then on top of that,
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.140]   you get 25% discount on all treatment.
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.660]   So if you are without dental insurance
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.100]   or you decide that doesn't make sense,
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.940]   but you do wanna get cleanings done,
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.740]   it looks like at least one practice in the Bay Area,
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.380]   if not more around the country,
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.100]   have programs that might make it
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.920]   a little bit more predictable and affordable
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.220]   to be able to go in and get the basic care you want
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:55.980]   without having to rely on spending out of pocket
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:58.100]   every single time you do it at a higher cost.
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:59.180]   So that's dental envision.
[00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.740]   A few other things that you often go through
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:01.580]   in open enrollment.
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.340]   So one is FSAs.
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:06.540]   So similar to an HSA, there is an FSA for health,
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.220]   which is a flexible spending account.
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.020]   However, very different is that unlike an HSA,
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:12.760]   where you own the HSA,
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.240]   the FSA is something your employer owns.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.980]   And so there is a little bit of a hack around this
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:20.120]   in that when you contribute to an HSA,
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.960]   if you leave halfway through the year,
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.200]   you actually aren't eligible
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.560]   for the full contribution amount.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.400]   With an FSA, if you contribute to an FSA,
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:31.160]   most employers fund that FSA account January 1st,
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.140]   and then you pay for that amount
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.320]   over the course of the year.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.600]   So if you were gonna leave a company at the end of January,
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.960]   let's say you wanted to quit your job
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.020]   after you got your bonus,
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:41.920]   as long as your medical expenses happened
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.300]   in that time you're employed, so in January,
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:47.640]   you could conceivably use the entire limit in January,
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.920]   but have only contributed 1/12 of the amount.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.240]   So a little bit of a hack there,
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.680]   if you're planning on leaving your job
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.540]   in January or February, fully fund your FSA,
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:39:00.380]   use it up, go get LASIK, or go do a full body MRI,
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:03.080]   or do some diagnostic testing, whatever you want.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.480]   And that's a little bit of a hack there.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.640]   On the flip side though,
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.100]   because the company owns the plan,
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.520]   many people don't use up all their FSA dollars,
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:10.840]   and then their employer actually gets
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.820]   to keep all that money.
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.240]   Depending on how you engage with your FSA,
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:15.400]   it could be beneficial to you,
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.800]   it could be beneficial to the employer.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.560]   I will say never let your FSA dollars go unused.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.660]   While you can usually not roll all of them over,
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.000]   there are lots of things that they're eligible for.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.760]   If you're having children, you can buy baby monitors.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.920]   I know the Oura Ring, I think I just got an email
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.940]   that the Oura Ring is now an FSA eligible expense.
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:34.200]   I love my Oura Ring, so that would definitely
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.160]   be a good way to use it.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:37.420]   A lot of the diagnostic testing that you can do,
[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.600]   whether it's blood tests or different things,
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.960]   those are often covered.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.040]   23andMe, genetic testing is often covered.
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:45.360]   I'll put a whole list together in a future episode
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.720]   about end of the year stuff and in a newsletter.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.720]   But there is definitely enough things.
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.460]   And if you have nothing that you wanna do,
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.480]   you could always buy things and donate them
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.480]   to a local shelter for people who need them.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.580]   So definitely make sure you use those FSA dollars
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:58.460]   before the end of the year.
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.540]   There's also an FSA for dependent care,
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:04.160]   which if you pay a nanny, au pair, childcare,
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.580]   daycare, anything like that,
[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.160]   then definitely worth contributing
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.600]   to the FSA for dependent care.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.280]   Though I will make one caveat.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.920]   I would email your HR team or ask someone
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:16.640]   how often the FSA for dependent care gets clawed back.
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.120]   There are some rules around eligibility.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.120]   And if certain types of employees who make more money
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.120]   or are more senior put in more money,
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.060]   but other employees who aren't in that group put in less,
[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.040]   then they have to claw back the contributions.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.360]   I know when I was at Wealthfront,
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.600]   it seemed like every year we contributed the max
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.080]   to our FSA for dependent care,
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.600]   and it got clawed back at the end of the year.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.400]   So we actually were like loaning money
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.920]   to our employer for the year and getting nothing for it.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.400]   So I would ask your employer
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.760]   if that's something that happens regularly or not.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.840]   And if it does, then maybe think twice
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.240]   about whether it makes sense,
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.080]   or maybe ask them what they expect might happen next year.
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.760]   And then HSA, we talked a lot about the HSA before.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.200]   The only thing that I'll mention is
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:57.040]   you don't actually have to use the HSA provider
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.440]   your employer offers.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.720]   If your employer is willing to contribute
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.320]   to your HSA for you,
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:04.920]   and a lot of employers will put money into your HSA
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:08.100]   as a perk because usually to be eligible,
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:10.160]   you chose a high deductible health plan
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.720]   that has a lower monthly premium.
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.520]   And so you're saving your employer money.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:15.600]   And so in return, they're willing to give you money
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:17.520]   in the form of an HSA contribution.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.680]   Oftentimes they'll only do that with the HSA provider
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:21.640]   that they've partnered with,
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.680]   but you can open an HSA anywhere.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.440]   So in the past, I've had whatever the HSA,
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.760]   I think it was health equity that came with the company,
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.600]   and it was terrible.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.000]   The investment options had high fees.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.520]   And so we actually moved it over to a company called Lively.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.440]   I've also tried a company called Starship.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.840]   So you don't need to keep your HSA
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.440]   at whatever HSA provider your employer offers,
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.840]   but you might need to leave it there
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.080]   if your employer contributes.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:44.520]   A few other things through open enrollment.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:45.480]   Pre-tax transit.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.680]   A lot of employers offer the ability for you to buy
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.460]   your local transit cards,
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:51.800]   or even sometimes parking at pre-tax rates.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.640]   So if those are things
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.960]   you're gonna spend money on already,
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.160]   definitely worth contributing
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.720]   and saving money on the taxes there.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.100]   And then the last one is around life and disability.
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:01.680]   So many employers include some basic amount
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:02.800]   of life and disability.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.500]   Usually don't get to even opt into it, it's just there.
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:07.360]   Definitely no harm in just accepting that,
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.920]   but there's also sometimes the option
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.160]   for supplemental life and disability insurance.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.880]   And I think the one thing to consider
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.240]   when it comes to supplemental life and disability,
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.160]   it's a plan that's tied to your employer.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.880]   So let's say you have life insurance at your job,
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.240]   you're 40 years old, you worked there for 10 years,
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.140]   and you have no health problems.
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:25.880]   So you just get it through your employer.
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:27.900]   And oftentimes it is a little cheaper,
[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:29.880]   but let's say in that period of 10 years,
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.460]   you have an underlying health condition,
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.960]   you quit your job, now you need to go somewhere else.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.280]   They don't offer supplemental life or disability,
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.660]   and now you need to go get your own term life insurance.
[00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:41.640]   And now you're not eligible for the best rates
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.000]   because you have some health issue
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.440]   or because you're 10 years older
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.680]   and it's just more expensive.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:49.040]   And so unless you have a job that's very, very stable,
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.560]   maybe you're a government employee
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.160]   and you have no plans to leave for the rest of your life,
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.800]   or maybe you have a preexisting condition,
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.040]   it makes it so expensive or even impossible
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.840]   for you to get your own life insurance coverage elsewhere.
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.080]   Maybe in those two scenarios, it could make sense.
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:06.080]   Otherwise, I would make a strong, strong recommendation
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.160]   to look for your life insurance separately
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.640]   and outside of your employer.
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.600]   So it's something that can stick with you
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.920]   for as long as you need it
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.320]   and isn't bound to being stuck in one particular job
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.920]   with one particular employer.
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:19.840]   So I think that covers everything open enrollment.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.080]   I hope this was really helpful.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:24.000]   Finally, I did say I was gonna give a few tips for Hawaii.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.120]   We're here on the big island for a week.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.240]   I'm here for a conference,
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.000]   but we decided to make a family trip out of it.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.480]   I actually don't have a ton of tips
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.880]   'cause it's only been two days,
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.880]   but I did wanna share a couple things.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:37.240]   One, we had a family dinner at the Lava Lava Beach Club,
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.420]   and I would highly recommend it for anyone.
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:40.760]   I would go back without kids,
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.640]   but I would definitely go back with kids.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:43.720]   It was just great.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:46.980]   They had live music, good food, very kid-friendly,
[00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:48.040]   right on the beach.
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.800]   Definitely a recommendation that I would give anyone.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.700]   And then last night, we left the kids at home
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.820]   with our au pair, and we went to the canoe house
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:58.480]   at the Auberg Monolani property, which is beautiful.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.400]   We're staying at a rented house,
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.360]   so we're not staying at a resort right now,
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:03.480]   but it was wonderful.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.720]   The corn ribs and the pork jowl were just incredible,
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:07.280]   so I would highly recommend those.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.720]   Also the maitake mushrooms.
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.160]   So those were two tips.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.080]   I was hoping to tell you
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.700]   about the amazing snorkel adventure
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:14.680]   we went on with Ocean Sports.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:16.440]   However, they canceled this morning
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.200]   because there's a lot of swell in the water,
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.360]   so we didn't get to go on that.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.680]   But I did learn something that works really well
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:22.720]   if you have young kids.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.040]   So we went over to a place called Snorkel Bob's,
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.360]   and they rent these boogie boards
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:30.000]   with cutouts and a clear screen,
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.360]   and it actually has a cylinder that comes up
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.280]   almost like a paint can made of plastic,
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.040]   so your kids can stick their face on it
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.080]   and look underwater.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.480]   It's like a glass bottom boat
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.200]   built into a little boogie board.
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.300]   So we did rent one of those for Quinn
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.400]   so she could kind of go out
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.680]   and be able to look underwater.
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:46.160]   We're trying to teach her how to snorkel,
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.400]   but at three, it is a little trickier than you'd expect,
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.760]   or maybe it's equally as tricky as you'd expect,
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.960]   but that was a cool little hack that we found.
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.120]   And then also, one thing we always do
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.720]   is we just go on Target whenever we're going to Hawaii,
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.200]   and we pre-order all the groceries that we might want,
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:02.720]   all the things, some diapers,
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.000]   whatever the stuff you need is,
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.400]   and then we just pick it up at the Target before we go.
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.160]   We did this in Maui, we've done it in Kona.
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.240]   It just makes it so, so much easier,
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.600]   and you just don't have to worry about a lot of hassle.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.440]   Those are my quick three tips from our trip right now.
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.260]   And actually one more,
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:18.440]   we're staying right near the Fairmont Orchid,
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:19.680]   which I've been to a lot of times
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:22.020]   because the conference I'm going to is hosted there,
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:23.680]   and I think most people know this,
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:24.760]   but just in case you don't,
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:26.920]   all beaches in Hawaii are public,
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.440]   so you can access the beaches at resorts
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.960]   without having to stay at the resort.
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.880]   And so we've gone over to the Fairmont Beach,
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.080]   we've hung out on the beach, swam out on the water,
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.200]   but also most hotels, yes,
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.000]   they have overpriced drinks and food,
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.560]   but they also know that
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.040]   and don't care if you're staying there.
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:43.760]   So we were able to go to the beach,
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.200]   order drinks, order food, hang out,
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.720]   and not have to worry at all
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.600]   about staying at the properties.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:51.480]   We could save money staying very nearby,
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.960]   use the beach, but also be able to get drinks at the beach
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:55.780]   just like you would if you were staying at a resort.
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:57.720]   So there's a little hack for Hawaii.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.880]   Probably doesn't work in most other places
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.760]   where beaches are kind of owned and operated
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:02.840]   maybe by the resort,
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:05.400]   but in Hawaii, they are all public.
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.500]   That's all I've got this week.
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:08.080]   I hope this episode was really helpful
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.660]   for anyone going through open enrollment.
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:12.040]   I really hope that you guys can figure it out
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.280]   and get the best deal.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.880]   I really wish that this entire health insurance process
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.720]   in the States wasn't as complicated and confusing as it is,
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.480]   but hopefully this has been helpful
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.760]   and makes it a little bit easier for you
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:23.920]   as you go through this period.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.720]   So if you ever wanna get in touch,
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:28.560]   you can send an email to podcast@allthehacks.com.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.640]   I will read every single one of those emails,
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:31.840]   and if you have questions,
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.480]   they will all be considered for a future mailbag episode.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.640]   I might not be able to respond to your email,
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.040]   but it doesn't mean I'm not reading it,
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:39.140]   and I don't love hearing from you.
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:41.000]   So thank you everyone for reaching out.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.160]   That's all for this week.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.060]   See you next week.
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:45.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:48.380]   (birds chirping)
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:58.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
