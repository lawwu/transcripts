[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:17.760]   Thanks for joining us for the next phone call. I've been looking for about a year, year and a half, and I find you're inspirational. I have one question, and one thing I'd like you to expound upon, based on things you've said in the past, and I'd like to hear your opinion on it. But first up, the question is, I was curious, I was going to give you whatever numbers you wanted for this, but am I spending...
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.860]   Thanks for joining us for the next phone call, you can go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.

[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:46.180]  , but I'm not sure if we're paying an amount commensurate to what we make, versus what we potentially need, so I'm just curious on what your thoughts on that are.
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.240]   Okay. Tell me about the insurance policies that you have, how much they're worth, how much the premiums are, and I'd like to hear your opinion on that.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.280]   Okay. Tell me about the insurance policies that you have, how much they're worth, how much the premiums are, and I'd like to hear your opinion on that.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.380]   Okay. Tell me about the insurance policies that you have, how much they're worth, how much the premiums are, and I'd like to hear your opinion on that.
[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:56.540]   gun
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.200]   can. H. out,
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:15.540]   see in cÅ©ng
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:44.740]  ÑƒÑ‡a. Right now, the totality of the premiums that we pay is about $1,000 a month. And that goes towards two term benefits, one for each of us. One has a 370,000 death benefit and one has a $1.1 million death benefit. And those are 150 and 563 per year. And the whole death benefits are 495,000.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:52.160]   And the total is about $495,000 and 408k. And the those add up to about $11,000 a year in premiums.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.680]   Okay, how old are the policies?
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:06.260]   We started that will be getting into this, I believe the fourth anniversary of that in this year, this spring.
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:13.880]   And how are the policies structured? Is it universal life insurance, whole life insurance over funded whole life? How are the policies
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.160]   structured?
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.780]   structured?
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:22.640]   find
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.640]   be the is
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:05:10.940]  ere you know I think it's 55 when we're paying those premiums until so if I say something like it's whole life paid up at 65 does that sound like probably about what it is yes okay so then that kind of policy is a traditional whole life insurance policy it will last for your entire lifetime but you are scheduled under the policy schedule to pay premiums until the age of 65 how old are you and your wife currently
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.940]   I think it's 65 is when we're supposed to be paying those premiums until
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.940]   It will last for your entire lifetime but you are scheduled under the policy schedule to pay premiums until the age of 65 how old are you and your wife currently
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.940]   It will last for your entire lifetime but you are scheduled under the policy schedule to pay premiums until the age of 65 how old are you and your wife currently
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.940]   It will last for your entire lifetime but you are scheduled under the policy schedule to pay premiums until the age of 65 how old are you and your wife currently
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:40.960]  , we're both 31 like this year okay and tell me about your general wealth plan how do you plan to become wealthy I'm actually extremely comfortable with the current we're very very comfortable with our current income situation and so I I focused heavily on the invest wife currently we're both 31 and this year okay and tell me about your general wealth plan how do you plan to become wealthy I'm actually extremely comfortable with the current we're very very comfortable with our current income situation and so I I I focused heavily on the invest wife currently
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:06:10.980]   and as far as getting wealthy it's by putting a significant amount of funds into different investment portfolios so how much are you investing outside of this life insurance policy how much are you investing per year and what are you investing in
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.980]   and as far as getting wealthy it's by putting a significant amount of funds into different investment portfolios so how much are you investing outside of this life insurance policy how much are you investing per year and what are you investing in
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.980]   and as far as getting wealthy it's by putting a significant amount of funds into different investment portfolios so how much are you investing outside of this life insurance policy how much are you investing per year and what are you investing in
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.980]   and as far as getting wealthy it's by putting a significant amount of funds into different investment portfolios so how much are you investing outside of this life insurance policy how much are you investing per year and what are you investing in
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:41.000]  ,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   you mentioned that you're putting five percent into your 401k
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:07:11.020]   you mentioned that you're putting five percent into your 401k and how much is your wife putting away
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.020]   I believe she does five percent as well okay so right now then in general excuse me a moment I need to sneeze
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.020]   in general then right now you are spending sorry you're saving about fifteen percent
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.020]   in general then right now you are spending sorry you're saving about fifteen percent
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.020]   you're saving about fifteen percent of your 401k
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.020]   you're saving about fifteen percent of your 401k
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.020]   you're saving about fifteen percent of your 401k
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.020]   you're saving about fifteen percent of your 401k you're saving about 15% of your 401k
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:41.040]   and the way I got to that number is you're putting about five percent into whole life insurance on a two hundred and five thousand dollar income eleven thousand dollars of annual premiums is about five percent you're putting five percent into your 401k funds and you're putting twelve thousand dollars per year which is again about five percent into your other investment pursuit is about fifteen percent is that accurate
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.040]   Yeah that sounds about right
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.040]   So
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.040]   if
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.040]   you're saving about fifteen percent of your 401k you're saving about fifteen percent of your 401k
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.040]   so if you're saving about fifteen percent of your 401k you're saving about fifteen percent of your 401k
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.040]   so if you're saving about fifteen percent of your 401k you're saving about fifteen percent of your 401k
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.040]   so if you're saving about 15% of your income is about 15% of your income
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.040]   so if you're saving about 15% of your income is about 15% of your income is about 15% of your income
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:50.720]   at
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.840]  del. I, like,

[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.280]   to keep it up to around
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.560]   $150,000 range. And if
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.420]   move to Maine, what would
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.120]   would it cost you to live
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:34.760]   I have not calculated th
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:34.760]   it would be a little bit
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:34.760]   probably less. But we, I
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:34.760]   probably less. But we, I
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:34.760]   probably less. But we, I
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:34.760]   probably less. But we, I have not calculated that. It probably would be a little bit less.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:34.760]   have not calculated that. It probably would be a little bit less.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:34.760]   probably less. But we, I have not calculated that. It probably would be a little bit less.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:34.760]   probably less. But we, I have not calculated that. It probably would be a little bit less.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:34.760]   probably less. But we, I have not calculated that. It probably would be a little bit less.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:09:01.820]   I have not calculated that. It probably would be a little bit less. So, to answer the question specifically,
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:01.900]   So, to answer the question specifically,
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:02.820]   So, to answer the question specifically, no, I don't think that you necessarily
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:02.900]   no, I don't think that you necessarily
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:03.920]   no, I don't think that you necessarily have too much whole life insurance.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:03.960]   have too much whole life insurance.

[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:28.420]   Because where I don't think life insurance works well is it doesn't work well as a primary investment solution.
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:31.420]   The returns are simply too constrained.
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:44.420]   The potential returns are just too constrained by the market of what the life insurance companies are investing in that you're not going to get really wealthy just investing through whole life insurance contracts.
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:48.400]   So there I think you need some money that's much more aggressive.

[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.880]   and in a traditional 65 life, traditional whole life insurance
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:00.900]   traditional whole life insurance
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.460]   traditional whole life insurance contract, that won't be a major
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:03.820]   contract, that won't be a major problem.
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:07.880]   Have your insurance agent show you the projected values of it,
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:13.280]   but if you just simply redirect your dividends to reduce the premium instead of the purchase paid up insurance,
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.760]   that will start to decrease.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:19.000]   And in time, the insurance policy will become less and less impactful.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   And in time, the insurance policy will become less and less impactful.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   And in time, the insurance policy will become less and less impactful.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   But if you just simply redirect your dividends to reduce the premium instead of the purchase paid up insurance,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   that will start to decrease.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   That will start to decrease.
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:49.020]   That will start to decrease.
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.020]   The second thing is you may be able to take a small amount of the insurance paid up.
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.020]   It's a little bit early in terms of four years to do that.
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.020]   But in fact, I don't want to go into any more options than that. Just simply say that if you do adjust it, you can just make a minor adjustment if needed and still retain the policy. Because four years into the contract, if you just bail out of the whole thing, you will come out having had very expensive life insurance. So you always need to, of course, assess it. But the same reasons that you bought it for are the same reasons that you bought it for.
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.020]   But if you just simply redirect your dividends to reduce the premium instead of the purchase paid up insurance, that will start to decrease.
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.020]   So you always need to, of course, assess it. But the same reasons that you bought it for are the same reasons that you bought it for.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:18:19.040]   Unless something has substantially changed, they're probably the same reasons why you still want to have it.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.040]   So if it's just a temporary thing, you just change the dividends, readjust the dividends for a couple of years, and then maybe your income goes back up. In that case, you can go ahead and pick up those dividends.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.040]   Next time you buy a life insurance contract though, what I would encourage you to do is try to make sure that at least some of your premiums are what are called additional premiums.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.040]   Make sure that at least some percentage of it is there with additional premium. That gives you a lot more flexibility.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.040]   So if you buy a life insurance contract though, what I would encourage you to do is try to make sure that at least some of your premiums are what are called additional premiums.

[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:48.960]  , and sometimes you can just do that temporarily.

[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:19.140]   it like

[00:37:39.000 --> 00:38:08.940]  Å‚ych the computer program can't give you a useful answer. You don't need the income because between your real estate and your social security, you don't need any money. You've got it taken care of. So the second way that they address this issue is they go with what's called a risk profile questionnaire. And so they'll give you a 10 or 15 question. Um, document. You can take one of these online and probably should if you haven't recently, and this document will go through different scenarios and they'll say, are you more comfortable with this outcome?
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:08.940]   The
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:08.940]   For
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:08.940]   It
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:08.940]   It
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:08.940]   It's
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:38.880]   It's a good question. And then they'll ask you questions about when you intend to use the money and et cetera, and then the computer will assign a score to you that's supposed to be your risk profile tolerance. Now that can be useful, but it's going to be minimally useful for you because number one, the bulk of your assets are not going to be reflected in that questionnaire. You have a real estate and it's not going to be useful for you because you can't answer all the stuff.
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:38.880]   So
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:38.880]   It's

[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.540]   and I think that's valid okay but now what is the scenario that could happen to you in which you would not be able to pay your mortgage payments?
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:44.980]   if we couldn't if all my renters in Denver moved out and we didn't have that income but I that's not very likely.
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.480]   yeah it's not very likely and I agree with you in fact that's what I would point to to say that you know I'm not a renter.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:47.980]   yeah I'm not a renter.
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:48.480]   yeah I'm not a renter.
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:22.640]   and I think that's the scenario that could happen to you in which you would not be able to pay your mortgage payments.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:36.480]   yeah for you to have three properties in in Denver emptied out is very unlikely and even if it did happen you still are going to have your Social Security income so you still could probably make a mortgage payment out of your Social Security income what's your mortgage payment Oklahoma and what will be your Social Security income when your wife also files for it?
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.580]   and I think that's the scenario that could happen to you in which you would not be able to pay your mortgage payments.
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:48.520]   it's about twenty one hundred dollars but all of my houses in Denver are totally paid for and the rents are there and it's really hard to get a house that's not going to be able to pay for it.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:48.520]   I think that's the scenario that could happen to you in which you would not be able to pay your mortgage payments.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:46:18.540]  , but what's any one of those houses pay for it?
[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:48.560]  , but what's any one of those houses pay for it?
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:48.560]   and I think that's the scenario that could happen to you in which you would not be able to pay for it.
