[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.800]   How can I serve you today?
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.800]   Hey, Josh Ross.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.800]   Thanks so much for taking the call.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.800]   I appreciate it.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.800]   I've been listening to you for about a year, year and a half.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:01.440]   I find you inspirational.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.560]   I have one question and one thing I'd like you to expound upon based on the thing that
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.040]   you said in the past and I'd like to hear your opinion on.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.080]   But first up, the question is, I was curious, I was going to give you whatever numbers you
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:26.560]   wanted for this, but am I spending too much on life insurance?
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.760]   I know I got oversold.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:37.920]   I do like the product as a whole, but I'm not sure if we're paying an amount commensurate
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.840]   to what we make versus what we potentially need.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.320]   So I'm just curious on what your thoughts on that are.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.320]   Okay.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.160]   So can you talk a little bit about the insurance policies that you have, how much they're worth,
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.400]   how much the premiums are and your household income?
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.400]   Sure.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:02.280]   So starting off with the income situations right now, before taxes, we grossed about
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.960]   205K last year.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.800]   We are looking to potentially downsize that to shift our life situation a little bit.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   It might be very significantly downsized, but we're not really sure.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:25.720]   Right now, the totality of the premiums that we pay is about $1,000 a month.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.640]   And that goes towards two term benefits, one for each of us.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.480]   One has a $370,000 death benefit and one has a $1.1 million death benefit.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.760]   And those are $150,000 and $563,000 per year.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.760]   And the whole death benefits are $495K and $408K.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.040]   And those add up to about $11,000 a year in premiums.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.040]   Okay.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.600]   How old are the policies?
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.760]   We started that, we'll be getting into, I believe, the fourth anniversary of that in
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.760]   this year, so this spring.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.920]   And how are the policies structured?
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.960]   Is it universal life insurance, whole life insurance, overfunded whole life?
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.360]   How are the policies structured?
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:26.520]   They are mostly whole life and they're augmented with the two term policies that I refer to
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.160]   as well.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.300]   Okay.
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.240]   So on the whole life policy, is this, describe the policy to me a little bit.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.840]   How long are you scheduled to make premiums, et cetera?
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.840]   How long does it last?
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.360]   I mean, it obviously lasts forever, but how long are you scheduled to make premiums under
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.920]   your current schedule?
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.520]   I think it's 65 is when we're supposed to be paying those premiums until.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.940]   So if I say something like it's whole life paid up at 65, does that sound like probably
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.360]   about what it is?
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.360]   Yes.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.360]   Okay.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.600]   So then that kind of policy is a traditional whole life insurance policy.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.720]   It will last for your entire lifetime, but you are scheduled under the policy schedule
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.760]   to pay premiums until the age of 65.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.840]   How old are you and your wife currently?
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.000]   We're both 31 later this year.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Okay.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.560]   And tell me about your general wealth plan.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.160]   How do you plan to become wealthy?
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.800]   I'm actually extremely comfortable with the current, we're very, very comfortable with
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.120]   our current income situation.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:48.000]   And so I focus heavily on the invest wisely piece as well as living, like you say, I'm
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.520]   very comfortable with, I probably overspend, but we have a lot of fun doing it.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:03.200]   And as far as getting wealthy, it's by putting a significant amount of funds into a different
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.760]   investment portfolio.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.540]   So how much are you investing outside of this life insurance policy?
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:14.280]   How much are you investing per year and what are you investing in?
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.120]   So I put about 7% or I put about 5% with a match to into my 401k.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.880]   My wife has a fee that she puts in.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.840]   Those are already up to about a hundred thousand together.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:36.600]   And I put about another, I'd say 12 grand into different ventures like Fundrise and
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.140]   Acorns and that kind of stuff.
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:47.680]   You mentioned, so you're putting 5% into your 401k and how much is your wife putting away?
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.960]   I believe she does 5% as well.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.960]   Okay.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.560]   So hers is matched because it's a federal government.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:07.640]   So right now then in general, excuse me a moment, I need to sneeze.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:13.880]   In general then right now you are spending, sorry, you're saving about 15% of your income.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.840]   And the way I got to that number is you're putting about 5% into whole life insurance
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.560]   on a $205,000 income, $11,000 of annual premiums is about 5%.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:30.560]   You're putting 5% into your 401k funds and you're putting $12,000 per year, which is
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:36.640]   again about 5% into your other investment pursuit, which is about 15%.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.640]   Is that accurate?
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.320]   Yes, that sounds about right.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:50.480]   So if your income goes down, how much do you think your income might go down?
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:56.800]   So we're looking to potentially move back closer to family because our life situation
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:03.080]   has gotten a little chaotic with just where we live now because we live in Maryland.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:10.400]   I'm trying to drag up to Maine and as you might imagine the employment opportunities
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.680]   are a little bit different up here.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.920]   And so it could go down as much as half, but hopefully we try to keep it up to around the
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.320]   150, the joint $150,000 range.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.360]   And if you were to move to Maine, what would you do, how much would it cost you to live?
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:34.360]   How would it be your annual living expenses?
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.080]   Probably less, but I have not calculated that.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:44.240]   It probably would be a little bit less, probably about two thirds of what ours is now.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.760]   So to answer the question specifically, no, I don't think that you necessarily have too
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.400]   much whole life insurance.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:55.480]   I don't think your current plan is unreasonable.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:00.120]   Although I can see how if your income goes down, it can become difficult.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.400]   So let me get to how do I get to the point of reasonable or unreasonable.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.880]   What I'm imagining your thinking was when you bought these policies, as you said, I
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.640]   like the idea of having some life insurance that lasts forever.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:20.760]   I like the idea of having some cash value that builds up.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.400]   It's attractive to me perhaps because it's safe and it's stable.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.080]   It may not do as well as some of my other investments do, but it's safe and it's stable
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.560]   and I know it's going to go up and it's accessible to me with all the benefits of a life insurance
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.560]   policy.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.320]   So hopefully that was kind of what you were thinking when you bought it.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.880]   I would guess that's what you're thinking because you made a sizable commitment to your
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:47.440]   whole life insurance policies in terms of $11,000 a year is nothing to sneeze at, but
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.640]   you didn't put 30% of your income into those kinds of policies, which tells me you're not
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.360]   pursuing a bank on yourself, infinite banking type of concept.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.160]   You're just saying this is a useful pot of money.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:05.320]   And under those constraints, I personally am very comfortable with that approach to
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.680]   whole life insurance.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.760]   I would imagine this policy is probably with a decent company that's decently run.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:17.320]   When people wind up owning traditional whole life insurance, especially life paid up at
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.400]   65, that usually tells me there was one of the traditional mutual life insurance companies
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:26.280]   because most people who are working with some of the more aggressive companies, usually
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:31.080]   they'll wind up with some kind of universal life insurance contract versus a traditional
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.720]   whole life insurance contract.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.040]   So I like a traditional whole life insurance contract for young couples like you.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.080]   I like a life paid up at 65.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:48.240]   I think it's a very reasonable difference.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.580]   It gets you a little bit better cash value than a traditional ordinary whole life paid
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.400]   up at 120.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:59.560]   It's not quite as aggressive as an overfunded life insurance policy, which I sometimes would
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.080]   prefer, especially given this situation that you're in.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.280]   But I don't dislike your program.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:11.240]   So the first thing is I don't think it's unreasonable in my assumptions, unless you need to correct
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.360]   any of those assumptions.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.960]   I think you're not in a bad place.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.260]   Now the second thing that I want to look for is do you have enough money invested in things
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.520]   that are going to really make you wealthy, which is why I asked what your wealth plan
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:28.000]   is because where I don't think life insurance works well is it doesn't work well as a primary
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.160]   investment solution.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.560]   The returns are simply too constrained.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:38.820]   The potential returns are just too constrained by the market of what the life insurance companies
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:44.160]   are investing in that you're not going to get really wealthy just investing through
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.100]   whole life insurance contracts.
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.840]   So there I think you need some money that's much more aggressive.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:57.040]   And so when you told me that you've got 5% of your income invested in going into a life
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.280]   insurance contract and you've got upwards of 10% plus employer matches going into more
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.860]   aggressive investments, as long as you're still keeping that ratio, then I think that's
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.440]   a sensible ratio.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.640]   Now the biggest problem is the affordability.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:16.400]   And so the big drawback of a traditional whole life insurance contract, such as the one that
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.200]   you have, is it's pretty inflexible.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.800]   You can't just willy-nilly drop the premiums in half.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.900]   You can always adjust a contract.
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.600]   So there are different things that you could do if you have to take it down.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:36.680]   And I would strongly encourage any listener who does need to adjust a life insurance program,
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:42.000]   then you need to make sure that you know all the options because you don't just have to
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.600]   cash it out and cancel it.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.960]   There are lots and lots of options under the non-forfeiture benefits of a life insurance
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.320]   policy.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:54.560]   But the disadvantage of the structure that you've chosen is that it's not particularly
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.660]   flexible.
[00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.760]   And when I used to sell life insurance, one of the things that changed was when I was
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:04.640]   getting started, I was extremely aggressive to sell as much premium as I could into a
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.440]   situation like yours.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:12.640]   In time, I learned that I needed more flexibility because people's lifestyles and circumstances
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.940]   could change.
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:18.260]   And I learned that I could be very effective at selling life insurance and sell somebody
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.520]   too much and then they might not be able to afford it if they were going to go through
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.480]   some kind of life transition.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.400]   Now based upon what you're telling me, I wouldn't make any changes to my life insurance program
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.400]   at this point.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.100]   There's no rush to it.
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:35.200]   Do you, Derek, additionally have cash savings, emergency funds, accessible liquid money that's
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.040]   not in a retirement account, that's not in a life insurance policy?
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.040]   Yes, sir.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:47.440]   Yeah, it's also been, it's come in handy twice already.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.440]   We usually keep about a $20,000 cash reserve.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.440]   Okay, good.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.160]   So you've got plenty of money to move.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.220]   You've got plenty of money to rent a new place, first, last security, that kind of thing.
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.300]   And you've got wiggle room while you find a new job.
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:04.960]   So I guess in summary, I would not immediately try to change my life insurance policies.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.400]   Rather what I would do is I would try to get very well employed in Maine.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.240]   I would try to get settled in Maine because there's no reason why your income has to go
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.240]   down.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:20.000]   Yes, there are certain circumstances in which you move from one job market to a new job
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.040]   market and your income goes down.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:28.040]   It's hard to move from New York City to Papua New Guinea and expect to make the same salary
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.220]   with that move.
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.600]   But in many circumstances, if you'll just spend a little more time looking, a little
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.480]   bit more time networking, a little bit more time doing a really intelligent job search,
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:41.600]   there's no reason why your income can't go up because there are jobs in Maine that are
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.680]   paying $250,000 or $300,000 per year.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.040]   So look for those.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.480]   The second thing is your actual spendable income may not go down because of the tax
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.800]   changes from Maryland to Maine.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.680]   I don't know exactly what those numbers would be, but I would encourage you to calculate
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.680]   that.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:03.720]   And then also when you make a lifestyle transition, given that you now have some years of experience,
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:08.200]   you and your wife have a chance to make new decisions, you might choose less expensive
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.200]   housing.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.000]   You might have just costs go down because of lower taxes, lower car insurance rates,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   etc.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   You might sell a car.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Who knows?
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.680]   And so it may be that your actual expenses are lower.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:25.320]   So even if the percentage of income dedicated to a life insurance contract goes from 5%
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.160]   to 7%, that might be okay.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.680]   What I would be careful of is if you find after you move that you start to be very pinched
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:40.440]   and you're not having enough money exposed to investments with higher potential and all
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.760]   the money is going in the life insurance policy, that's when I think you might need to adjust
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:50.040]   it because it's just too conservative for someone as young as you to be putting huge
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.840]   percentages of income into a life insurance contract.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:57.240]   So as long as you still have other investments that are going to give you really big wins,
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.300]   I think the life insurance is fine.
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:03.240]   If it's becoming all-consuming, I get concerned about that and I'd like to see you have a
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.960]   little bit more risk and opportunity for growth.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:06.960]   Great.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:12.000]   I never thought about it that way.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Can we give you a couple of other tips as well?
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.200]   I don't want to go through everything that your life insurance agent will have to go
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:23.920]   through but if you need to adjust your life insurance program, there are many options
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.760]   and especially now that you're starting to get four years into it, you will be able to
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.200]   change options within the contract.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:37.880]   But the challenge with a traditional whole life insurance contract is you can't, the
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.760]   challenge with that contract is there aren't as many options as there are with some other
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:42.760]   kinds of insurance.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:48.480]   So the first thing that I would do is check how your dividends are being credited.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.160]   If you need to put less money into the contract, the first thing that you should do is redirect
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.840]   your dividends and instead of using those dividends to buy paid up additions, just use
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.040]   those dividends to reduce the premiums.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:04.280]   And in a traditional 65 life, traditional whole life insurance contract, that won't
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.680]   be a major problem.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.960]   Have your insurance agent show you the projected values of it.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.160]   But if you just simply redirect your dividends to reduce the premiums instead of to purchase
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:19.760]   paid up insurance, that will start to decrease and in time, the insurance policy will become
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.320]   less and less impactful.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:25.080]   The second thing is you may be able to take a small amount of the insurance paid up.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.920]   It's a little bit early in terms of four years to do that.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:32.320]   But in fact, I don't want to go into any more options than that.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:37.600]   Just simply say that if you do adjust it, you can just make a minor adjustment if needed
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.840]   and still retain the policy.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:44.600]   Because at four years into the contract, if you just bail out of the whole thing, you
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.840]   will come out having had very expensive life insurance.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.400]   So you always need to of course assess it.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.640]   But the same reasons that you bought it for, unless something has substantially changed,
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.200]   they're probably the same reasons why you still want to have it.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.840]   So if it's just a temporary thing, you just change the dividends, readjust the dividends
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.320]   for a couple of years, and then maybe your income goes back up.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.560]   In that case, you can go ahead and pick up those dividends.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.360]   Next time you buy a life insurance contract though, what I would encourage you to do is
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:15.760]   try to make sure that at least some of your premiums are what are called additional premiums
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.880]   and make sure that at least some percentage of it is there with additional premium.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.640]   That gives you a lot more flexibility because with a policy that has additional premiums
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:31.040]   on it, let's say that 15% of it is 15 or 20% is additional premium, you can just simply
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.280]   drop those additional premiums without impacting the underlying contract and you get all the
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:41.220]   benefits of the whole life insurance contract over a universal life contract which has almost
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.040]   infinitely flexible premiums.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:47.800]   You still have the benefits of whole life, but you have the ability to lower your premiums
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.840]   if you need to and sometimes you can just do that temporarily.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.160]   So next time you buy a whole life contract, try to make sure there's at least some additional
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.720]   premiums on it and I would encourage anybody who sells life insurance, try to always sell
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.260]   your contracts with at least some additional premiums so that if somebody goes through
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.760]   a life change like this and they need to reduce premiums, they have that chance to do it as
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.760]   well.
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:07.760]   So that's my suggestion, Derek.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.280]   Go ahead with your second question or comment, please.
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:15.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:24.920]   So about a year and a half ago, during 2017, you were talking about preparation for storms
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:30.280]   because it was during the hurricane season and it was part of your avoiding catastrophe
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.000]   series.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:42.440]   You had started to make a comment that you stopped yourself from making because you considered
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:48.440]   that you were rambling, but you started saying something interesting about how, in your opinion,
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.440]   Walmart has done.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.520]   I don't remember the exact quote, but you started to say that Walmart had done almost
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:20:04.560]   as much as the Catholic Church or whomever for lowering prices.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.720]   I don't really remember what you were saying, but I was hoping that you would expound upon
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.720]   that point.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.880]   Do you know what I'm talking about?
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.880]   Sure.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:21.200]   So basically, the position that I hold and that I defend is that, so first for context,
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.960]   Walmart is an easy target for many people, especially in the political sphere.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.760]   When you are a big player, you're going to be targeted.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:35.000]   And so whether it's Walmart or Amazon now taking on the brunt of that targeting, etc.,
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.840]   large companies are targeted.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.820]   And one of the most common attacks that is made against Walmart, there are a few of them.
[00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:48.160]   So the first one would be that Walmart has destroyed local businesses, local companies.
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.800]   Mom and Pop franchise locally was run out of business by Walmart.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.120]   And so that really is, Walmart's a bad influence there.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:00.440]   Another thing is, well, Walmart's just a bunch of greedy capitalists and all they do is make
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.440]   money.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.600]   And so as they start to pack up more money, then things are worse.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:10.280]   And so that was the primary one that I was identifying, is that many times people look
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:16.240]   and say, "Well, you need a charity, somebody that gives money away or gives things away,
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.920]   and that's going to be the most effective way to help people who are in need or who
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:20.920]   are poor."
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.600]   We'll come back to that in a moment.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.320]   In the modern world, of course, also, there are many other things such as Walmart.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:31.840]   Walmart employees are being subsidized by Medicaid or by other government welfare benefits.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:36.240]   That's what allows Walmart to pay the lowest price, to pay lower labor costs, etc.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.080]   So there are many attacks that come against Walmart.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:44.320]   And I think there are legitimate lines of critique against a company like Walmart, just
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.480]   like with any other company.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:53.080]   But the one that I was zeroing in on there was the idea that charity is better than business.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:58.680]   And my contention, although I don't know how I would prove it, my argument is Walmart has
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:04.720]   done far more for poor people than almost any large, than the Red Cross has or any large
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.000]   charity.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.520]   And there, I think, there would be a number of lines of reasoning for that.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:14.240]   So first, Walmart has revolutionized, single-handedly revolutionized retail sales in the United
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:21.760]   States and brought a tremendous diversity of low-cost products and made them available
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:26.440]   to anybody who wants to get them in the United States of America.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:30.840]   Now most of us who have a little bit more money and who are probably a little bit more
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.960]   hoity-toity, most of us don't love shopping at Walmart.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:37.680]   Frequently I've avoided going to Walmart because I don't want to stand in line in the checkout
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.360]   just to save a few dollars.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:44.000]   I don't like a lot of the inventory that Walmart sells in terms of just junk, just Chinese
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.040]   junk.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:51.100]   But at the end of the day, Walmart has made a world of incredible things available to
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:55.900]   people without much income all over the world, but especially in the United States.
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.880]   When you look at the selection that is available at a Walmart store, when you look at the products
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:06.860]   that are conveniently available, when you look at the prices, even just simple things
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:09.280]   like having those in one place.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.120]   Let's say that you're a poor person, you don't have a car and you've got to ride a bus to
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.620]   go to the grocery store.
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:18.040]   It is so much more efficient for you to go to Walmart and do all your shopping in one
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:22.360]   place and then go home on the bus or take a taxi home or ride a bike home than it is
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.400]   for you to go to seven or eight little mom-and-pop stores.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:30.400]   And the prices that Walmart brings are far lower than what any of the mom-and-pop stores
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.540]   that Walmart drove out of business were charging.
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:38.660]   And so for a poor person today who only has $1,000 a month to spend or $1,500 a month
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:44.320]   to spend, if they shop intelligently, they can have everything they need from one store
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.620]   at insanely low prices.
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:50.240]   And if you travel a little bit around the world, you start to see how incredible that
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.240]   is.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:56.060]   It is easier to live on a low income in the United States of America than almost anywhere
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:24:01.760]   else in the world, at least that I have been or observed or studied, because, largely because
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.860]   of the massive amount of inexpensive products that are available.
[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:10.840]   And it is nothing like where you go to a local convenience store in some neighborhood in
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:16.300]   another country and have a limited selection, high prices, whereas Walmart, low prices,
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.300]   ready to go.
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.300]   Now there are other benefits as well.
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:24.180]   If you look at the way that the number of jobs that Walmart has added and the jobs that
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:31.180]   are available to relatively unskilled people and the opportunities that are there for workers
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:36.180]   that simply were not there before, you can make this argument from the corporate opportunity.
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:40.180]   And let's pick on that argument about what happened to mom and pop stores.
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:44.380]   Let's assume that you were going to go and you're a relatively unskilled person, you
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.500]   don't have a lot going for you in your earning ability, you can go and work at a mom and
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.660]   pop store, but what are you going to do?
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.060]   It's basically a dead end job.
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:57.300]   You're not going to take over the store because the mom and pop store is going to be, they're
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:00.640]   not going to give over their store, it's their store.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.740]   You're not going to have opportunity for advancement.
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.180]   If you're sweeping the floor and stocking the shelves, that's what you'll be doing for
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.940]   the next 30 years as you live there.
[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:10.560]   You're not going to have access to many of the benefits of a large company.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.320]   But if you go to Walmart, I mean go back to my show, How I Became a Millionaire on a Minimum
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.220]   Wage Job at Walmart.
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:24.480]   Walmart offers a motivated, modestly intelligent, but unskilled entry-level worker an opportunity
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.960]   to completely transform their life.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.480]   So that would just basically be the basic component.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:35.920]   And then if you look at just what the company has done in terms of the wealth that the company
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:41.060]   has created for its shareholders, how that wealth gets reinvested back into the economy
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:46.740]   and new enterprises and new businesses, how the wealthy owners of Walmart redirect their
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:49.900]   charitable funds into other things as well.
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:53.800]   I don't think everything is a matter of this or that.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:59.260]   I think there's a place for non-profit organizations and I think there's a place for for-profit
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.260]   companies.
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:03.220]   I think everything can be done well by one or the other.
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.580]   They have different roles.
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:09.520]   But if I had to choose between them, I would a whole lot rather have Walmart than just
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:13.240]   a non-profit organization in terms of the actual good.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.260]   Walmart doesn't talk about much good that it does.
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:19.200]   Of course they have their corporate PR arm, but in reality they spend more of their time
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.860]   trying to defend themselves than anything else.
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.600]   They don't talk about the good that they do.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.980]   You and I as consumers just take it for granted.
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:29.500]   Meanwhile you have most charitable organizations, non-for-profits, talk all day long about what
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.940]   they do and they actually do very little.
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:38.300]   But if I were poor, I want Walmart because Walmart is going to be my single-handed best
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:43.420]   source of the things that I need to keep my life going effectively and efficiently and
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:47.340]   Walmart is the most sensitive thing to my needs.
[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:53.960]   I appreciate and I'm sympathetic to the challenges that storekeepers have faced, independent
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:58.340]   mom and pop storekeepers in the United States as Walmart came in.
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:59.340]   I appreciate that.
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.580]   I'm sympathetic to them.
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:06.140]   But the fact is they were put out of business by Walmart because they did not serve their
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.860]   customers effectively as Walmart did.
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:14.140]   And specifically for Walmart, I often wish that more people would spend time investigating.
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:19.700]   Sam Walton was an incredible guy and he went where no one else wanted to do business.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:23.780]   The thing that people forget is there have always been large supermarkets and large big
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.140]   department stores across the United States.
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:31.560]   But Walton went to the communities where other people didn't want to do business and he transformed
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:37.540]   those communities and brought his idea of retail service to there.
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.620]   And the customers are the ones who chose.
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:47.500]   The end of the day, as long as Walmart didn't engage in bribery, going into a local place
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.740]   and saying, "Hey, we'll give you some extra money, the politicians, to give us this prime
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:56.920]   location of government owned land," or things like that, as long as Walmart didn't engage
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:01.740]   in bribery and as long as they engaged in simple competition, I am happy to trust the
[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:02.740]   market.
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:07.420]   And the market has said that the mom and pop store owners did not serve their customers
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:10.660]   as effectively as Walmart and that's why Walmart has won.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:15.860]   So that's just some of the lines of argument that I would present to say Walmart has helped
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:23.100]   more poor people and helps poor people in the United States to live better than any
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:25.620]   other organization I can think of or come up with.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:29.860]   And I need just clarity because it's such an abrasive argument in the modern world.
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.740]   I would just clarify, that doesn't mean that everything is perfect.
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.340]   But Walmart sells what people want.
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:38.780]   I don't buy, I don't want the majority of what Walmart sells.
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:43.140]   I don't want most of the stuff that Walmart sells in their food.
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:46.460]   I spent, when my wife and I were traveling around the United States, we spent quite a
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.460]   bit of time in Walmart.
[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:53.060]   I did a lot of shopping at Walmart because of sleeping in their parking lots.
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:57.780]   And Walmart is so kind to allow travelers to stay overnight in their parking lot and
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:02.700]   so they have a lot of loyalty of customers who say, "I want to support Walmart."
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.500]   I'm giving Walmart a pretty massive plug here because having enjoyed their parking
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:06.500]   lots.
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:11.580]   But I basically skip all of the aisles of packaged foods in Walmart because I don't
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.780]   eat the stuff.
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:17.340]   But I can still go to Walmart and find what I need and what I want of high quality food.
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:21.620]   And what Walmart does is when they get into something, even let's say you're going to
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.740]   buy organic yogurt.
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:27.580]   When Walmart started selling organic yogurt, it transformed the price of organic yogurt
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:32.940]   for everybody because they're so massive that when they bring their merchandising arm to
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:37.340]   something that you want, it transforms the market and brings the prices down and we all
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.900]   benefit from that.
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:45.140]   So I'm sure that there are many complaints that we could collaborate on against Walmart,
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:48.220]   but those are some of the arguments and I'll stand by them.
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:54.380]   Walmart has done and does more for poor people across the United States and maybe the world
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.940]   than almost any organization I can come up with.
[00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.940]   >>JAMES: Thank you.
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:08.820]   Yeah, I was intrigued with what you were saying and I was really glad to hear you.
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.820]   >>ADAM: My pleasure.
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:14.740]   The big thing for me is just simply I always want to look for results.
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:19.260]   I want to look for what actually happens, not for people who say nice words about what
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.340]   they think should happen.
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:24.980]   And so for me, if we measure by results, Walmart wins.
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:25.980]   We now go to Colorado.
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:26.980]   Welcome to the show.
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:27.980]   How can I serve you today?
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:28.980]   Okay, I can hear you now.
[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:29.980]   Go ahead.

[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.980]   on your rents from your real estate?
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:45.420]   - No, not quite.
[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:49.640]   We could live our normal lifestyle
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.140]   on the two Social Security incomes
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.640]   and our rental real estate.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.680]   - You have already filed for Social Security.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:03.020]   What's your plan as far as filing for Social Security?
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:06.740]   - Yeah, I filed just last year
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:11.740]   and I've started receiving my benefit.
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:14.340]   She obviously won't file for a couple of years.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:15.720]   - Okay.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.320]   So one more question.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.680]   What do you want to happen with your wealth
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.480]   that you don't spend during the next few decades
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.320]   of your life?
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.140]   What's your plan?
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:28.940]   What are you trying to accomplish with that wealth?
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:36.900]   - So we'll probably leave a portion of it to our kids.
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:38.900]   We've got six kids between us,
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:43.900]   so it'll get divided up pretty easily there.
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:48.660]   And we will probably find a,
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:53.540]   through one of our mission organizations
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:57.400]   that we contribute to or our churches or whatever,
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:01.220]   we probably won't give it all to the kids,
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:02.700]   but we might.
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.060]   - Okay.
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.100]   So first let me talk to you about
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:09.400]   what answers the financial planning industry provides
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.900]   on this question.
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:12.620]   And then let me talk to you about
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.200]   just some thoughts about that
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.860]   that I hope would be more useful.
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.140]   So answers to this question.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:21.540]   So first, the standard approach that you will get
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.420]   if you sit down with a financial advisor,
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.240]   a licensed financial advisor,
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.100]   the way that that financial advisor
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.780]   will try to figure out your asset allocation strategy
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:34.500]   is basically one of two methods.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.160]   Method number one is to try to figure out
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.880]   what asset allocation you need
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.740]   in order to meet your goals.
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:44.500]   And this is the most common
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.500]   when you are trying to get a certain amount of money
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.180]   out of a portfolio.
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:53.100]   So you say, I've got $300,000 of,
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:55.800]   let me just say, I've got a million dollars of money
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.540]   sitting here in these assets.
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:01.740]   And I'm trying to spend X number of dollars per month.
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.060]   How can we get there?
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.220]   And so the financial advisor
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:07.220]   will plop that into a computer program.
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:12.220]   And the computer program will spit out a portfolio
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:16.620]   and address, and that portfolio will have certain likelihood
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.420]   if historical indicators or any indication
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.100]   of what might happen in the future,
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:25.020]   that that portfolio will have a probability of success.
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:28.060]   And by dialing up or dialing down
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:30.060]   the risk level of the portfolio,
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.340]   and risk is measured by percentage of money
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.460]   that's allocated to stocks, equities,
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.460]   as compared to fixed income,
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.520]   they'll find that either there's a possibility
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.460]   for you to have more money than you need,
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:45.900]   but yet have some lesser chances of running out of money,
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.340]   or there'll be a possibility of having
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:52.060]   a more certain future one way or the other.
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:55.420]   And so that's how they address it when solving for need.
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:58.500]   To answer that one, that one doesn't apply to you.
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.660]   And it doesn't apply to you right now for two reasons.
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.020]   The first reason is the bulk of your money
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.180]   is currently invested in real estate.
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:09.420]   And financial advisors are generally very poorly equipped
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:10.300]   to deal with real estate.
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.340]   It's not what they do, they deal with stocks.
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:14.420]   And so real estate doesn't fit neatly
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.340]   into the computer models.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.500]   The real estate doesn't fit neatly
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.060]   into the asset allocation model.
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:24.300]   It can be modeled in terms of a portfolio,
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.660]   they can model what 5% of your portfolio
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.500]   invested in REITs would look like,
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:31.820]   but they can't model actual real estate income.
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.820]   And it's not, all they do is they put it in
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:35.780]   as a cash flow for you.
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.860]   And since you don't need the income,
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.940]   that whole exercise is basically worthless for you.
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.780]   The computer program can't give you a useful answer.
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:46.700]   You don't need the income because between your real estate
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:48.660]   and your social security, you don't need any money.
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.300]   You've got it taken care of.
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.180]   So the second way that they address this issue
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:57.220]   is they go with what's called a risk profile questionnaire.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:01.060]   And so they'll give you a 10 or 15 question document.
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:04.340]   You can take one of these online
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:06.420]   and probably should if you haven't recently.
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:08.860]   And this document will go through different scenarios
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:10.020]   and it'll say, are you more comfortable
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.060]   with this outcome or that outcome?
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.140]   And then they'll ask you questions
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:16.020]   about when you intend to use the money and et cetera.
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.820]   And then the computer will assign a score to you
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:22.620]   that's supposed to be your risk profile tolerance.
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.500]   Now that can be useful,
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.060]   but it's going to be minimally useful for you
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.060]   because number one, the bulk of your assets
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.500]   are not gonna be reflected in that questionnaire.
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.220]   You have your real estate
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.820]   and it's not gonna be useful for you
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:40.140]   because you can't answer all the stuff accurately.
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:43.700]   So usually for example, where clients would get into trouble
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:45.140]   when I used to do this stuff,
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:46.780]   is you would answer something like,
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.180]   well, when are you gonna need the money?
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:49.020]   And you're thinking,
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.220]   I'm gonna need the money for retirement
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.180]   because I'm 65 years old,
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.660]   but realistically you just told me
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.660]   you're not gonna need the money for retirement.
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:59.740]   So the risk profile questionnaire doesn't help you much.
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:02.140]   So the mainstream financial advisor approach
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.300]   in your situation is not gonna be particularly helpful,
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.420]   which I assume is why you're calling me.
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:11.420]   So let me get to some things that will help you.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.860]   So the first thing to think through
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.660]   is what you're trying to accomplish
[00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.820]   and what you're actually gonna need the money for.
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:18.660]   And in your case,
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.180]   I think you have to separate your pots of money
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.620]   into specific buckets and ask yourself,
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:25.500]   what am I gonna do with this money?
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.620]   That's gonna be dependent on what happens
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:31.420]   with your wife's employment income.
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:34.100]   That's gonna be dependent on what happens with your startup.
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:37.660]   That's gonna be dependent upon what you actually want
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:40.400]   to spend and what you would wanna spend it on.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.060]   From what you're describing to me,
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:45.540]   I'm kinda guessing that you actually
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:47.740]   aren't ever gonna spend this money.
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.660]   Now, I think there could be exceptions to that,
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.660]   but most people who are in your situation
[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:53.920]   don't wind up spending this money,
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.500]   or at least not for a long time.
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.340]   And here's why.
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:59.260]   First, you currently have employment income
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:00.780]   coming in from your wife.
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:03.980]   Now, if she's actually gonna quit a year from now,
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:05.640]   then you need to factor that in.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.140]   If she's not actually gonna quit,
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.800]   then that will make a big difference,
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.540]   but that adds to your life.
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.220]   You have social security income,
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.620]   and I'm projecting the fact that you're pretty restrained
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:15.820]   with your expenses.
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.140]   You live in Oklahoma.
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.380]   There aren't usually a lot of flashy people
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.500]   that are trying to spend all their money
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.140]   who choose to move to Oklahoma.
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:24.460]   If you were calling me from Miami, that would be different,
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:27.340]   but most Oklahomans, that's not a big priority for them.
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:28.940]   So when you have your real estate income
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:30.020]   and your social security income,
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:32.180]   you probably don't ever need any more money.
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:35.480]   The additional thing is your startup might generate income.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.840]   Now, you would have to assess the likelihood of that,
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.060]   but if that starts generating income for you,
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:43.100]   you should spend that money before you wind up
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.800]   pulling money from your investment accounts.
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.100]   So then the real question comes down to
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:50.740]   what do we need the $300,000 for?
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:52.500]   If you think that there's going to be
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.460]   some kind of short-term expenses with it,
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:58.260]   such as, well, we wanna take all our children,
[00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:02.060]   grandchildren on a big, giant family vacation to Europe
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.100]   and it's gonna cost us $50,000.
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:06.540]   Well, in that case, you should put $50,000 in the bank
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.900]   and not invest it at all.
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.680]   So your asset allocation is simple.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.640]   If you have any short-term uses for the money,
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.980]   less than five years, less than 10 years
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:17.300]   even in your situation, you should take the money
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.580]   and basically not invest it.
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:23.420]   Basically just simply have it available for those expenses.
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:25.540]   If you think you're gonna be doing something with it
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.100]   in the medium term, that's where things get difficult,
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:30.540]   is, well, I think I might wanna do something
[00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:33.220]   with this 10 years from now, but I'm not sure what.
[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:34.100]   That's the hardest.
[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.120]   The easiest is if you think you're just gonna leave this
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.940]   behind as an inheritance, I think you should invest the money
[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:42.740]   in the highest returning investments that you can find,
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:45.300]   whether that's an aggressive all stock
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:48.940]   or mostly stock portfolio in the stock market,
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.180]   whether that's in something that you think is better
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:53.180]   than that, that you have connections to.
[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.460]   I think you should invest the money
[00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:56.540]   in the most aggressive thing you have
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:58.880]   because if you don't wind up spending the money
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.500]   and you're just gonna leave it behind when you die,
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.740]   then the best thing you can do with it
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.460]   is grow it as big as possible.
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.420]   And in that case, aggression is your friend
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.980]   because you have now a 30-year time horizon
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:12.620]   and the difference of rate of return on the money
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:14.820]   or amount of money you have, if you can get 8%
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:18.660]   on your money versus 4% on your money is massive.
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.740]   So in general, I would try to nudge you
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:23.660]   in the direction of saying, what is the best investment
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:27.420]   that you have access to and can you invest it into that?
[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:34.920]   - Oh, all of that is actually really helpful.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:40.940]   I hadn't thought about the fact that we might not have
[00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:44.260]   the fact that we might not actually ever need that money.
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:51.140]   I'm afraid I'm gonna probably fall more
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:54.900]   in the medium term use of that money,
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:59.460]   but it sounds to me like it really doesn't really matter.
[00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.360]   Did I say really?
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:09.380]   So let's just wander around a bit.
[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:13.980]   So when we moved out here, we kept our main house,
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:15.740]   turned it into rental property.
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:19.340]   We got a mortgage on this house
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:24.340]   because I didn't wanna touch the investment accounts,
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:31.460]   2% tax, I'm sorry, like a 2% interest rate
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:33.540]   on our home mortgage here.
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:36.180]   And certainly the investment accounts
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.420]   will do better than that.
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:41.660]   Would there be a point in time where you would say,
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:45.620]   cash it out and pay off the mortgage?
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:47.500]   - I can't imagine the scenario in which I would say that,
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:50.940]   no, because you would be doing two things if you did that.
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:54.500]   First, so before I get to the two things,
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.100]   let me give just the background.
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:44:00.940]   What is the benefit of having a paid off mortgage
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:02.180]   on a house that you live in?
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.540]   What's the benefit of that?
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:07.860]   - Just some security.
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:09.900]   - Right, some sense of security.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:12.940]   Now, and I think that's valid, okay?
[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:17.100]   But now what is the scenario that could happen to you
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:20.460]   in which you would not be able to pay your mortgage payment?
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:35.740]   - If we couldn't, if all my renters in Denver moved out
[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:41.060]   and we didn't have that income,
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:44.860]   but that's not very likely.
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:47.460]   - Yeah, it's not very likely.
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:48.340]   And I agree with you.
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:50.460]   In fact, that's what I would point to to say
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.940]   is one of your biggest risks.
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:57.340]   But that particular risk is not very likely.
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:01.580]   To have three individual properties all empty
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:06.740]   is very unlikely unless something catastrophic
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:07.780]   has happened in Denver.
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:10.100]   Yellowstone is blown up or something like that
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:11.620]   and Denver just empties out.
[00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:13.940]   But in that situation, we've got big problems.
[00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:18.060]   It's just we're in the extreme scenario circumstance.
[00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.340]   So for you to have--
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:20.220]   - Yeah, not likely.
[00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:23.060]   - Yeah, for you to have three properties
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:27.620]   in Denver emptied out is very unlikely.
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:29.300]   And even if it did happen,
[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:32.140]   you still are gonna have your social security income.
[00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:34.820]   - So you still could probably make a mortgage payment
[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:36.060]   out of your social security income.
[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:37.260]   What's your mortgage payment in Oklahoma
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:38.700]   and what will be your social security income
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.420]   when your wife also files for it?
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:44.940]   - It's about $2,100.
[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:49.460]   All of my houses in Denver are fully paid for
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:53.060]   and the rent on any one of those houses--
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:55.740]   - So your social security income is $2,100.
[00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:58.300]   And how much is your mortgage payment?
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.740]   - No, mortgage payment is 2,100.
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.380]   My social security income is more like 25.
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:05.340]   - Okay, perfect.
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:07.860]   So we can confirm that you could at least
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.380]   pay your mortgage payment on your social security income.
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:13.260]   And since your social security income
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:16.540]   is as guaranteed as anything else we can have,
[00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:19.060]   then we know that you're gonna have income.
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:20.380]   And since your mortgage payment
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:23.420]   is a fixed rate low interest debt,
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:26.140]   we know that it's going to be able to be paid.
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:28.860]   So you may have to sweep some floors
[00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:30.820]   to have enough money to buy food
[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:32.220]   if all of your properties are empty,
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.980]   but you can still pay your mortgage payment.
[00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:35.540]   So with that in mind,
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:39.420]   I don't see any risk for you in having the mortgage.
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:42.260]   Now that's different than if you were 20 years old,
[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:43.740]   but you're not 20 years old.
[00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:46.020]   I'd like to have 20-year-olds have debt-free houses
[00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:49.300]   because their risk is losing their income.
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:51.020]   You don't have any income risk
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.700]   at this stage of your lifestyle.
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:56.660]   So what's the point of having a paid off home mortgage?
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:59.380]   Now, what would actually happen
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:02.300]   if you cashed out investments and put it into real estate?
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:03.740]   Well, you would make a big difference
[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:05.180]   in your asset allocation.
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:07.460]   'Cause right now, 3/4 of your income,
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:09.980]   or 3/4 of your assets are in real estate.
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:12.140]   If you cash out 1/4 of your asset
[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:13.300]   to put it into real estate,
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.340]   now you move in a direction of 100% of your money
[00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:16.300]   being in real estate.
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.980]   And now I don't like that
[00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:19.860]   from an asset allocation perspective.
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:23.260]   I would much rather you keep less money in real estate
[00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:25.260]   and more money in stocks
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:28.340]   so that if real estate falls apart,
[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:30.740]   especially Colorado real estate falls apart,
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:31.860]   new governor is elected
[00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:34.660]   and the governor imposes a 50% state income tax
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:37.020]   and all of a sudden your houses have in value,
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.820]   at least if you have a portfolio of stocks,
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:40.300]   you have another pot of money.
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:43.620]   So I think paying off your mortgage in Oklahoma
[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:45.180]   would be exactly the wrong move
[00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:47.660]   from an asset allocation perspective
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:49.660]   because it puts too much money in real estate.
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:53.220]   And then finally, I think if you're gonna have a mortgage,
[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.660]   it's much more sensible for you to have that mortgage
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:58.540]   on your home in Oklahoma
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:00.900]   than on your rental properties in Colorado
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:04.420]   because you're gonna get a lower rate on your home in,
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:06.140]   in Oklahoma, you're gonna, sorry,
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:09.020]   you're gonna get a lower rate on your home in,
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:12.620]   on your home mortgage because it's your residence
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:14.660]   than you are on a rental property.
[00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:16.660]   And if you can't pay it,
[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:19.260]   you're going to get better treatment
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:21.740]   being just a normal homeowner
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:24.420]   who's going through foreclosure than is,
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:27.020]   than you are if you're a greedy real estate investor
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:28.740]   who's just losing another property.
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.380]   So I'd rather have, in your situation,
[00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:32.700]   I'd rather have the rental property paid off
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:34.820]   and have the mortgage on my home residence.
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:38.580]   And then final piece of data in favor of my argument here
[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:39.740]   would be in Oklahoma,
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:44.140]   my understanding of your asset protection laws
[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:46.620]   is that you don't have any significant
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:49.580]   homestead exemption from asset protection.
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:51.020]   I think you only have a few thousand dollars.
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:53.020]   Is that right for Oklahoma?
[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:54.020]   - Right, right.
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:55.100]   Yeah, I believe that's correct.
[00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:57.580]   - So then you being a rich person,
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:00.060]   which is a problem because you're a millionaire
[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:01.220]   and you've got all this real estate
[00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:03.140]   which exposes you to certain risks there,
[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:05.460]   then you want to equity strip
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.140]   any asset that's not protected.
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.540]   And so in this situation,
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:10.380]   a good home mortgage at a low rate
[00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:11.940]   is your best and simplest way for you
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:14.340]   to equity strip your house in Oklahoma
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:16.180]   rather than having it paid off
[00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:18.140]   and exposed to the claims of creditors.
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:22.380]   - Yeah, yeah, cool, cool.
[00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:24.660]   All right, all that's good confirmation
[00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:27.420]   'cause that's where I am and it's where I want to stay.
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:37.300]   Things, if I've got midterm use for that money,
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:45.220]   I'd like to build a barn.
[00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:52.500]   I'd like to spend 100 grand,
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:57.340]   but I don't want to waste that money to do that.
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:59.700]   But I might need it for this business
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:03.300]   and so I might get to build a barn anyway.
[00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:07.900]   So would you, if it's fairly short term,
[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:09.860]   like three to 10 years,
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:13.220]   would you put a bunch of this money in bonds
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:15.900]   so that it'll be there in five years?
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:17.900]   - Yes, I would.
[00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:18.740]   - Okay.
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:25.580]   - And any particular kind of bonds?
[00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:27.580]   I don't know anything about the bond market.
[00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:29.020]   I've got a few T-bills
[00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:32.300]   and I don't know what kind of government bonds,
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:37.300]   but can you help me out there?
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:39.140]   - Yeah, so let me explain.
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:43.140]   Probably your safest move is to put money
[00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:45.940]   that you think you might need to spend,
[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:50.540]   your safest move is to put it into a cash fund.
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:51.780]   So it could be a money market,
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:53.660]   could be cash account,
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:57.220]   could be some kind of CD structure, et cetera.
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.780]   Bonds would be fairly safe,
[00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:02.460]   but you do still face some risk with bonds.
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:04.460]   Your biggest risk with bond mutual funds,
[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:07.340]   and let me just ask one question as I get to the answer.
[00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:10.980]   This all $300,000, this is all within an IRA at this point,
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:13.940]   a traditional IRA because it was a 401k rollover,
[00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:14.780]   is that right?
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:20.780]   - Yeah, there's some traditional IRA, 1K,
[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:31.220]   like 200 grand of this is in my wife's 401k
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:33.660]   and 403b accounts.
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:39.620]   And I tend toward permanent portfolio
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:41.340]   'cause I can set it and forget it,
[00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:46.340]   but I'm not very good at the balance thing
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:48.460]   and actually sticking to an asset allocation.
[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:51.060]   So some of it is a money market,
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:55.980]   and some of it, there's a few bonds.
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:52:00.500]   Most of it is in total market index funds.
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:02.900]   - Okay, when you say permanent portfolio,
[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:05.580]   are you actively pursuing the permanent portfolio
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:09.300]   with all of your investment structure,
[00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:13.300]   the 25% portfolio, or are you just using that
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:14.780]   in the sense of I'd like to buy an index fund
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:15.740]   and leave it alone?
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:21.100]   - Well, I'm only using that for the stuff
[00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:22.620]   that's in the market.
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:24.620]   The fact that I've got so much real estate
[00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:27.700]   really hurts my brain when I start thinking
[00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:29.900]   about permanent portfolio
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:34.900]   'cause there's not actually a real estate 25% in there.
[00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:39.660]   Real estate is outside of the traditional
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:41.020]   permanent portfolio structure.
[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:43.820]   So the traditional, original permanent portfolio
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:47.060]   is to have 25% in stocks,
[00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:50.260]   25% in long-term treasury bonds,
[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:54.620]   25% in gold, and 25% in cash, money market.
[00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:56.940]   And the idea of the permanent portfolio
[00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:01.140]   is that it withstands the various macroeconomic risks
[00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:02.780]   that you face.
[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:04.740]   And so therefore, because it withstands
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:08.300]   the macroeconomic risks, when fiscal policy
[00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:09.620]   or monetary policy is changing,
[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:12.900]   you always have one asset that is adjusted,
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:15.700]   that it's an appropriate solution there.
[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:17.660]   Now, it's hard with real estate
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:18.900]   'cause real estate doesn't fit into that.
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:21.740]   So if you're actually pursuing permanent portfolio,
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.540]   then you should adjust your,
[00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:26.740]   you'll have to start moving in that direction.
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:29.940]   And just to be clear, I think it's reasonable for you
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:33.340]   to move in that direction, to reallocate your portfolio,
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:35.980]   to make sure that you minimize the amount of real estate
[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:37.500]   that you own in time.
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:41.540]   So as an example, you could go ahead and,
[00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:43.380]   and there are pros and cons to this.
[00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:45.140]   I just want, I don't wanna get too deep.
[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:47.140]   You'll have to make this decision.
[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:48.620]   But you could go ahead and just even
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:51.540]   with your current portfolio of real estate,
[00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:53.660]   if you don't, if there's a property that you don't like,
[00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:55.860]   maybe at some point you go ahead and sell it.
[00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:58.260]   If the market, you should always be analyzing your market
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:00.100]   to see if it's a good time to sell.
[00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:03.500]   And if you see that prices start to become overvalued,
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:06.860]   sell a house or two and take that money
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:09.140]   and then readjust that into your other,
[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:10.860]   to your permanent portfolio approach.
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:12.460]   Or go ahead and take out a mortgage
[00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:13.940]   on one of your rental properties.
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:16.780]   And so that mortgage, so you can refinance some money
[00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:21.300]   out of real estate and into some of these other asset classes
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.740]   and I think you could do that very, very safely.
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:28.020]   So for example, let's say that you're concerned
[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:29.620]   and you decide, I'm gonna go ahead
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:31.580]   and refinance property number one.
[00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:33.660]   Go ahead and take out a mortgage on property number one,
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:36.500]   then use those funds to go and buy gold
[00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:38.940]   for your 25% in gold or something like that.
[00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:41.140]   So that way you minimize your exposure to real estate.
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:42.620]   You still own the property.
[00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:45.340]   In time, your tenants may pay off that debt for you,
[00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:49.140]   but now you have another asset class that is set aside.
[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:51.020]   So there are some ways to readjust.
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:53.900]   Back on target.
[00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:55.780]   If you are pursuing the permanent portfolio,
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:57.080]   then you need to make sure that you have
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:59.660]   those long-term treasury bonds in your portfolio.
[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:01.820]   That's different than the money
[00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:03.140]   that you might wanna spend though.
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:05.220]   So the benefit of long-term treasuries
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:07.620]   is they will provide that smoothing effect
[00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:09.580]   in your asset allocation strategy.
[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:12.780]   The downside to bonds, to answer the question you said
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:14.060]   of what you should do with it,
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:18.500]   is you face a risk on bonds that if interest rates rise,
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.680]   bond values will decrease.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:23.340]   And especially when you're investing in bond mutual funds,
[00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:26.460]   that risk, especially for long-term bonds,
[00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:28.300]   that risk can be significant.
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:31.560]   And so if you think that interest rates will rise,
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:33.020]   then that means that the values,
[00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:35.640]   especially for long-term bond funds,
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:37.860]   those values will decline.
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:42.140]   And because a mutual fund of bonds has,
[00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:46.340]   it never matures, you have a duration,
[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:48.520]   you can measure the duration of the portfolio,
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:49.980]   but because the bonds never mature,
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:51.820]   because they're always being sold out and traded,
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:53.420]   then that's a very high risk.
[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:55.340]   And so if you look forward and you said,
[00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:56.620]   well, five years from now,
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:59.960]   I think I might be using this money to build a barn,
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:02.620]   but I'm also thinking that in five years,
[00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:04.900]   interest rates might rise substantially,
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:07.260]   then you definitely wouldn't wanna have that money
[00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:08.920]   in a long-term bond fund,
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:10.180]   because if interest rates rise,
[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:12.180]   those portfolio values will drop,
[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:14.760]   and then you won't have the money to build the barn.
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:16.020]   So cash is much safer.
[00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:18.960]   Cash does, of course, obviously expose you to inflation,
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:21.180]   but that's a little bit easier for you to watch.
[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:23.420]   And if you're gonna use it to buy a barn,
[00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:26.380]   to build a barn, if you see inflation start to tick up,
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:27.960]   well, you would go ahead and start to move it
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.060]   out of cash anyway and build the barn fast,
[00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:32.980]   where you can get cheaper prices on your durable goods,
[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:37.140]   then you would just keep it all in cash.
[00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:40.220]   - Right, right.
[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:44.580]   All right, that helps.
[00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:45.740]   That discussion helps.
[00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:50.460]   I have one more question on my list here,
[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:53.620]   and that is, I listened to one of your podcasts
[00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:56.820]   a couple of years ago, I think,
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:57:01.820]   and you were talking to a man in the South at some church,
[00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:05.300]   and they had some program where they,
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:11.980]   they invited young people,
[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:16.620]   from the umbrella of their church,
[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:21.620]   to meet with entrepreneurs and businessmen in their church,
[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:26.340]   and they taught those guys how to build a business,
[00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:31.100]   how to start up a business, how to become a one-trucker,
[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:33.300]   plumber, or HVAC guy.
[00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:35.580]   And do you remember that show?
[00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:37.100]   - I do, I do.
[00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:41.660]   Yes, and it's, I absolutely do.
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:46.020]   Now, that episode was episode 398,
[00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:49.540]   and it's called How to Invest in Your Local Community,
[00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:51.580]   How to Invest in Your Local Community
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:54.900]   for Financial Profit and Community Gain,
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:58.300]   Interview with Businessman and Investor Tim Yarborough.
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:01.700]   So, if you look it up there, you'll find it.
[00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:03.500]   And right now, it's off the website.
[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:05.860]   I need to transition that one onto the new website.
[00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:07.500]   But if you just go back in your RSS feed
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:11.300]   on your podcast player, you'll be able to find episode 398,
[00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:12.260]   and it's still there in the feed.
[00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:13.940]   You'll just have to flip back quite a ways
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:15.100]   'til you get to it.
[00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:16.460]   But yes. - All right, so.
[00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:17.580]   - Yeah.
[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:22.580]   - Yeah, I wanna play that for our group at church
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:28.820]   who invest in that sort of thing.
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:32.780]   We do a Jobs for Life thing, and I participate in that.
[00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:36.340]   But this thing that you talked about,
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:41.940]   I think would be much more in line
[00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:44.820]   with my skills and resources.
[00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:48.020]   - And I would, you're punching my buttons.
[00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:49.780]   I'm so glad you brought that up.
[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:50.860]   Earlier, when you were asking me a question
[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:51.780]   about what to invest it in,
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:54.180]   here's what I would love to see.
[00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:57.140]   I would love to see guys like you
[00:58:57.140 --> 00:58:59.660]   take the money that you've had
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:03.820]   and stop investing in stocks of big companies
[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:05.220]   that don't need your money,
[00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:08.540]   and figure out how to invest it in your local community.
[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:12.340]   And I think guys like you have a huge opportunity
[00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:14.900]   to do far more good and potentially profit as well,
[00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:15.860]   but you don't need the profit.
[00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:18.540]   That doesn't matter at this point in time.
[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:19.940]   I mean, obviously you wanna profit,
[00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:22.380]   but in terms of the impact of the money,
[00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:24.780]   I would much rather see guys like you
[00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:28.620]   take that $300,000 and commit to investing that
[00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:31.180]   into the young men in your community.
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:34.420]   And you gotta think through how to do that,
[00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:35.780]   which is so difficult.
[00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:40.300]   It's far easier to buy a total stock market index fund
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:41.140]   than it is to figure out,
[00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:43.260]   how do I invest 300,000 bucks
[00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:45.460]   into the guys here in my community?
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:47.340]   But that is a--
[00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:48.180]   - No kidding.
[00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:49.540]   - But I mean, it's really hard,
[00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:52.140]   but I have been working and working and working
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:56.540]   on solutions of how that can be done and what to do.
[00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:58.620]   I don't have many good answers,
[00:59:58.620 --> 00:59:59.780]   but here's what I would say to start with.
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:03.400]   First, go see, so Tim Yarborough, he's in Alabama.
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.420]   I'd encourage you, get in touch with him, find him online.
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:08.020]   He's not easy to find, but he's not hard to find.
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:11.060]   Go find him and go visit him in Alabama,
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:13.940]   reach out to him and go and see what they're actually doing
[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:14.780]   and check it out.
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.460]   Don't just stick with the podcast,
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.300]   but go and check it out
[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:20.040]   and see what lessons they would have.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:23.580]   The biggest problem with investing in that way
[01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:27.080]   is it's hard to make use of big amounts of money.
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:29.900]   But the great thing is, if you have the time,
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:31.940]   and this is what men like you have,
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:34.200]   if you have the time and the freedom,
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:36.480]   you can invest small amounts of money
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:39.380]   into many other people and then start to see
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:41.940]   how is it gonna pay off, how's it gonna pay off.
[01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:45.300]   And especially if you're part of a local church
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:47.020]   where you can start to work together,
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:50.620]   I think what Tim is doing is the most important thing
[01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:52.660]   for guys like you to be doing with your money
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:57.420]   is finding people who need some resources
[01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:00.860]   and who need some wisdom and who need some mentoring
[01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:03.420]   and starting to develop those systems
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:05.360]   and investing alongside in them
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.620]   where you put up some capital and you gotta be careful
[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:09.400]   because you can't give too much.
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.120]   You gotta keep people hungry.
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:12.460]   But you put in capital,
[01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:13.900]   you partner in their business with them,
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:15.940]   you help connect them, you help mentor them,
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:17.620]   you help them in the community.
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:20.860]   And the great thing is I think that those profits
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:24.460]   could be far more than whatever Coca-Cola
[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:26.140]   pays out in their dividend.
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:28.420]   Because if you are, like Tim,
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:32.220]   if you're a minority stakeholder or a 50% stakeholder
[01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.220]   in dozens and dozens of businesses,
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:36.520]   I mean that flow of cash is pretty significant.
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.800]   So I'm glad that you heard that.
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.600]   It's one of the things that I would dearly love
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.840]   to figure out more people who are doing that,
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:43.920]   learn from what they're doing
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.440]   and try to get guys in your stage of life
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:50.880]   to stop putting money into stocks
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.920]   and start putting money into your local community
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:56.880]   and investing alongside people who need it.
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:01.840]   Now I'm rambling on that one, but I love it.
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.520]   So yeah, episode 398.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.060]   And I would just say reach out to Tim,
[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:07.160]   get in touch with him.
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:10.340]   - Yeah, that's great.
[01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:14.840]   That was one of my all-time favorite podcasts of yours.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:17.140]   And I'm definitely resonating.
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:18.180]   - Good, good.
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:19.020]   Well, for the last few years--
[01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.900]   - I could ramble forever, but I think I'm done.
[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:21.740]   - Good.
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:22.860]   For the last few years, I've been working hard
[01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:24.660]   to try to figure out how it can be done.
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:26.980]   I think just a couple things that I have come up with.
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:30.500]   Number one, I think it's important to
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.080]   be established in an area that you're gonna work in
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:38.280]   because geographic stability, I think, is really important.
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:39.560]   You have to be in a place.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.220]   Tim's advantage, one of his big advantages,
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:45.600]   is he is stable in a local, stable community.
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.480]   He lives in the same place he grew up in.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:50.000]   He's been there all of his life.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.200]   He's in his, I don't know, 60s at this point, I would guess,
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.880]   but he's stable in that community.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.100]   And so he knows the people.
[01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:58.480]   He's been very active.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.780]   He's stable in terms of the local church
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:02.480]   that he's involved in.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.180]   You've gotta have people.
[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:05.380]   You've gotta have a network.
[01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:10.380]   And so you need that stable local body to be behind you.
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:12.940]   You can't just go to wherever the latest,
[01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:14.120]   which doesn't sound like you are,
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.360]   but many people, they just go to whatever
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:18.620]   the latest fad church is, where it's a nice church meeting,
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:21.200]   but there's no stable body of people working together.
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.500]   So you need that.
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:25.020]   Then in addition, you need local businesses
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:27.360]   that are tangible, where you can find people
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:30.520]   who are experienced and pass them along.
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:35.100]   So it's one thing to, it's easier to help somebody
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:40.100]   who's gonna learn to be a fence installer to say,
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:44.740]   let's go work with a senior fencing person,
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:48.920]   versus just, with technology, it's not changing that much.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.860]   And so it's stable.
[01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:51.800]   And I think those local businesses are important,
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.120]   and especially if you're trying to change
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.560]   in the local community.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:59.560]   I think for very smart, high IQ, high cognitive ability,
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:05.400]   high technological ability, I think that demographic
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.160]   is really well served right now.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:10.400]   For somebody who has those basic abilities,
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.320]   there's enough available online to find that.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.980]   But the people that I see who are really hurting
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:16.640]   are the people who are more tactile.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:20.820]   Their skills are not in digital everything.
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:22.800]   Their skills are personal up front.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:25.040]   And they don't have somebody to come along
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:26.640]   and pave the way for them.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:29.320]   And so if that's a lawn maintenance company,
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:32.260]   or if that's an oil change shop,
[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:35.740]   or if that's a tile installer, those kinds of things,
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:37.160]   those things are more important,
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.320]   and provide more opportunities for the,
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.600]   especially the men who are getting left behind
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.760]   in today's world.
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:46.040]   So I think it has to be done locally, and it takes time.
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:48.380]   It can't be done, you can punch a few buttons
[01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:50.680]   on the computer and buy stocks, that's great.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:54.240]   But you can't figure out how to work with somebody
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:57.400]   and invest $10,000 in their lawn equipment business
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.240]   to get them going.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:00.660]   It takes time, and so you gotta be willing
[01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:03.160]   to invest time and money.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.760]   That's not a complete list, but those are some
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.000]   of the constraints that I've seen.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.040]   That if those things fit, and I'd love to see
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.960]   thousands of men like you working all over the country.
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.460]   And if you get in touch with Tim, what I would say is,
[01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.900]   try to develop more connections with people.
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:18.600]   Find out who he would recommend you to,
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.920]   and try to develop some best practices
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:23.000]   for those of us who are younger.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.240]   I can't dedicate time to this, but help guys like me
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:30.600]   figure out how guys like you can make that happen.
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.600]   So thank you for calling in, great questions today,
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.760]   I really appreciate it.
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:38.920]   All right, before we wrap up today's show,
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.600]   I'm gonna take one more question from a patron
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:42.300]   who couldn't call in, but asked this question,
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:44.040]   and who writes in and says this.
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:47.100]   Joshua, have you ever discussed using private foundations
[01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:49.320]   or a family foundation for wealth planning?
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.400]   As someone who donates a lot anyway,
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.020]   they seem to have the added benefit
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:56.400]   of compounding wealth tax-free for future giving,
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.480]   and even the possibility of taking a salary
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:01.840]   for managing it someday, should the growth be sufficient.
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:03.940]   The money is also completely separated from the founder,
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:07.080]   and protected from things like bankruptcy, lawsuit, et cetera.
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:10.140]   A family making $300,000 per year could donate,
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:12.600]   tax-free, $90,000 per year.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:15.600]   An optimistic look on stock returns could compound this
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:18.540]   to over $6 million in 30 years, at which point,
[01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:21.180]   the foundation could have donations and expenses,
[01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:23.780]   for example, a management salary, office, et cetera,
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:27.040]   totaling as much as $300,000 per year,
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.620]   and only be at the 5% annual minimum requirement.
[01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:32.560]   So Andrew, in short, no, I have not talked,
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.600]   at least that I can remember on Radical Personal Finance,
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:37.620]   about using private foundations or family foundations.
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:41.460]   I have very modest exposure to them
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:43.820]   in my previous professional life,
[01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:47.420]   but I do think they can be an effective,
[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:52.380]   they can be an effective use of funds
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:54.100]   for somebody who is wealthy.
[01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:55.500]   Now, the biggest challenge, I think,
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:58.300]   is figuring out the proper scale
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:00.300]   at which establishing a private foundation,
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:03.220]   or a family foundation, makes sense.
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:05.900]   The big trend has been in the direction
[01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:07.720]   of investing in donor-advised funds
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.540]   through a local community foundation,
[01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:14.420]   and the reason is it's just a much more cost-effective way
[01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:17.860]   for most normal people who are putting aside
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:19.840]   tens of thousands of dollars per year.
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:22.660]   The costs to properly establish a family foundation
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:25.540]   and run one are not insubstantial,
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:27.500]   and so you gotta be careful and say,
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:30.860]   what's my actual goal here in establishing one?
[01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:33.280]   What are my actual, what benefits am I getting,
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:37.620]   and what are the costs that are being incurred?
[01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:40.420]   And when you actually go through that list,
[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:42.860]   I think you can find substantial benefits,
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:44.660]   but you're gonna be paying significant amounts of money,
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:47.620]   and legal fees, you're gonna be spending
[01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:49.140]   significant amounts of money.
[01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:52.980]   Now, for somebody who is at the higher end of wealth,
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:54.300]   and I don't know that number,
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:56.540]   I probably need to start talking to some attorneys
[01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:57.940]   and try to figure out that number.
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:00.820]   I just know it's more than, it's higher end.
[01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:02.640]   If you can make those donations, then yes,
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.580]   a family foundation does provide you
[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.500]   with the ultimate flexibility,
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:10.500]   and it does provide you with some potential for benefits.
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:12.780]   So yes, if you are making a lot of money,
[01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:16.700]   you have a lot of money, and you want to have your,
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:19.380]   to figure out how to transfer money
[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:21.540]   to a family member or a friend,
[01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:25.180]   absolutely, start a private foundation,
[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:28.060]   donate money to that, take the income tax deduction,
[01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:31.060]   hire the family member to work for the private foundation,
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:32.740]   they get paid by the private foundation,
[01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:34.240]   and you've accomplished effectively
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:37.740]   a very decent wealth transfer.
[01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:40.680]   And you can do that, you can amp up the retirement benefits,
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.940]   you can amp up all kinds of things, you can do it.
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:46.340]   Now, what I always try to be very careful of
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:49.820]   is I think the general, you always need to follow
[01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:51.260]   the general thrust of the law.
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.260]   So I get nervous when things are abused,
[01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:56.420]   and I don't want to see people abuse
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:58.300]   private foundations or family foundations.
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:00.760]   Yes, you could set one up, and you could put in
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:02.380]   some massive retirement programs,
[01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:03.900]   make massive contributions to them,
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:04.980]   is it possible?
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:05.820]   Maybe.
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:09.620]   But I'm not confident enough to recommend that.
[01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:12.100]   Maybe if there's an attorney who's actually studied
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:16.460]   what the bright line tests are and what the case law is,
[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:17.980]   maybe they would be much more confident.
[01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:19.860]   I don't have the knowledge in that area.
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:22.940]   I just think that the best thing is to,
[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:25.700]   the best thing is you have to look at it and say,
[01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:28.220]   am I at the right stage for this?
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:31.060]   Now, where I do think it's really powerful
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:32.900]   is even just for the previous caller
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:35.060]   who was talking about what they're trying to do.
[01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:36.900]   I do think that in general,
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:39.740]   we need to become much more familiar with using
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:42.420]   private foundations, et cetera,
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:45.460]   to accomplish change in our communities.
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:50.460]   So to your point, let's go with the facts outlined
[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:52.060]   with that previous caller.
[01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:54.540]   If that previous caller is seeking to establish
[01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:59.540]   a local community organization
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:06.260]   that is going to be helping young men in the community
[01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:08.420]   to establish businesses, et cetera,
[01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:12.580]   I see no reason at all not to take advantage
[01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:14.700]   of the tax structure and do that
[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:16.420]   through a family foundation.
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:21.380]   When you establish a private not-for-profit organization
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:23.540]   or a foundation, you have the ability to direct
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:25.220]   that document exactly as you want.
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:27.140]   And so you can establish the purpose
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:29.020]   just how you want it to be.
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:31.260]   And that's exactly what you should be doing
[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:32.300]   in that circumstance.
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:37.300]   And so even in that previous caller,
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:40.540]   what I would do is sit down and figure out
[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:42.140]   if he's got a team of people that can work
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:43.140]   as a board of directors,
[01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:45.620]   does he have the willingness to do it,
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:47.020]   but establish the foundation.
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:48.700]   And in his situation, I would keep the money
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:52.100]   in the ERAs or the 401ks for the asset protection standpoint
[01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:54.100]   but I would refinance one of the rental properties
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:56.500]   and then put that money into the private foundation.
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.660]   That gives additional asset protection,
[01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:02.140]   gives him a nice tax deduction on the contributions,
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:03.620]   gives him the ability, maybe he goes ahead
[01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:06.020]   and hires his wife inside the private foundation,
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:08.140]   works together there,
[01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:09.860]   maybe there are other people in the community.
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:13.380]   Absolutely, that is the way to go.
[01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:18.140]   Now, beyond the concept, I'm not confident enough
[01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:20.260]   in all the details to give good advice on that.
[01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:22.100]   So I would need to become much more competent
[01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:22.940]   on the details.
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:24.860]   If any of you are attorneys who are actively practicing
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:27.540]   in this or if you wanna recommend a good attorney,
[01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:29.940]   this is one that I would enjoy having a conversation
[01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:32.260]   with an interview person.
[01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:34.460]   So go ahead and email me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com
[01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:35.700]   and put me in touch with somebody.
[01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:37.460]   And as soon as I can schedule some more interviews,
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:38.940]   I would be happy to do that.
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:43.940]   But we need to take advantage of these things.
[01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:46.820]   And it's a good example of just, I say all the time,
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:49.860]   there's not two tax codes, there's one tax code.
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:51.140]   There's not a tax code for the rich
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.140]   and a tax code for the poor, there's one tax code.
[01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:55.740]   And you can align your activities in such a way
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:58.660]   that it works for whatever you're trying to do.
[01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:00.780]   And definitely, this is something
[01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:03.860]   that I should give more discussion to, more research to.
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:06.300]   I should think through exploiting it more.
[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:08.260]   It's not been at the stage of my own wealth
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:10.500]   where it has made sense,
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:12.220]   given the other opportunities that I have,
[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:14.620]   which is why I haven't dedicated as much time to it.
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:16.980]   But I definitely think I will in the future.
