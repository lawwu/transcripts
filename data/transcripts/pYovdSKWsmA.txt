[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.160]   - Well, some of the best questions in our inbox
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.660]   are the ones that I least expect to read.
[00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.060]   I'm a Baptist, so are you Pastor John, you're a Baptist.
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.240]   We kind of take that for granted.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.320]   It's in the background, rarely foregrounded
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.520]   here on the podcast.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.000]   So what is a Baptist?
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.960]   That's our question today.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.780]   And here's the email.
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.560]   Hello, Pastor John, my name is Dennis
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.000]   and I live in the Philippines.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.140]   I would like to know what is a Baptist?
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.400]   I know you are one, but I really don't know what that means.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.840]   Can you explain to me what distinguishes you?
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.120]   Pastor John, how would you approach this one?
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.200]   - The approach I want to take
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.880]   in trying to answer Dennis's question
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.200]   is to describe the kind of Baptist I am
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.040]   in the hope that I'm not at all quirky,
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.400]   but in fact would consider all the defining traits
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.960]   of a Baptist that I'm going to mention
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.360]   as typical of most Baptist churches
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.720]   in the 17th and 18th centuries.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.680]   And the reason I say 17th and 18th centuries
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.100]   is because Baptists, as I understand them,
[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.880]   got their start in the early 17th century,
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.980]   that is the early 1600s.
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.160]   And because in the 19th and 20th centuries,
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.640]   the splintering effect of most churches,
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.120]   not just Baptists, has resulted in so many varieties
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.260]   of denominations that I couldn't claim in the modern day.
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.500]   I don't think that I represent the majority,
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.080]   but I think I can claim that I do represent
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.680]   the majority of the Baptist churches
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.380]   in the early centuries of Baptist life.
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.380]   So I understand my roots and the roots of all Baptists
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.060]   in their earliest centuries to go back
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.560]   to the Reformation itself, namely the renewal
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.600]   and the reform of the church,
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.400]   the Roman Catholic church at the time,
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.740]   the reform, the renewal of the church
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.460]   under Martin Luther and John Calvin and Ulrich Zwingli
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.660]   in the 1500s in Europe.
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.140]   So Baptists would hold in common
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.940]   the five great emphases of the Reformation,
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.940]   justification on the basis of the work of Christ alone,
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.060]   provided and imparted to human beings by God's grace alone,
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.040]   appropriated in a personal and effective way
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.020]   in each individual life through faith alone
[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.020]   so that God's glory alone, not man's, is exalted,
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.420]   and all of that based on not tradition
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.860]   or ecclesiastical authority, but Scripture alone.
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.740]   So those are the five great pillars of the Reformation
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.700]   that Baptists share in common
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.220]   with virtually all Reformation churches,
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.260]   originally Protestant churches,
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.100]   Christ alone, grace alone, faith alone,
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.940]   the glory of God alone, Scripture alone.
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.900]   That's the starting point for Baptist life
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.260]   as well as other Protestant branches of the church.
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.740]   I love these Christ-exalting truths,
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.780]   and I feel knit together with other denominations
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.140]   besides Baptists who cherish these great pillars
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.780]   of the Reformation and biblical pillars.
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.260]   What distinguishes Baptists is that
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.260]   as we pondered the implications of Scripture alone
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.780]   as our authority rather than fallible human church authority,
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.940]   and as we pondered the implications of faith alone
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.180]   as what brings a person into a right relationship with God
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.640]   and makes them part of God's redeemed people,
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.640]   what we Baptists saw, and I'm speaking of people
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.640]   now in the early 1600s, what we saw was that in the Bible,
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:27.220]   the reform of the church hadn't gone far enough.
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.200]   It seemed to those early Baptists, and it seems to me,
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.860]   that the doctrine of justification by faith alone
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.780]   and thus entrance into the new people of God,
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.420]   the church, by faith alone,
[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.380]   implied that we should not think
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.340]   of entering into salvation and into the people of God
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.620]   through physical family connections.
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.420]   In other words, we couldn't,
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.260]   we Baptists could not find in the New Testament,
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.140]   nor did it seem to be implied
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.260]   in the doctrine of justification by faith alone,
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.620]   that children of believers should be considered
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.260]   part of the justified people of God
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.580]   just because there was a physical connection
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.220]   between them and their believing parents.
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.220]   Therefore, since baptism was the outward sign
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.940]   of such acceptance with God
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.340]   and participation in the redeemed people of God,
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.500]   baptism should not be given to persons
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.900]   just because they had a physical connection
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.340]   with saved people, namely their believing parents.
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.300]   This is why Baptists do not baptize babies.
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.840]   And this is the main reason why we're called Baptists.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.460]   We believe that there should be a credible profession
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.460]   of saving faith before a person receives the outward sign
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.580]   of that credible profession and that union with Christ.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.180]   And that sign is baptism,
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.420]   a symbol of passing from death to life
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.660]   through faith in Jesus.
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.940]   Historically, Baptists have understood baptism
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.980]   to be by immersion.
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.460]   That is, you take the whole person in a pool or in a river
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.420]   and you put the whole person under the water
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.760]   rather than sprinkling water on the head.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.320]   And we believe that because one,
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.420]   that's what the word baptizo in Greek meant,
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.780]   dip or immerse, it didn't mean sprinkle.
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.780]   And second, because immersion fits the symbolism
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.420]   in Romans 6 of being buried with Christ in baptism
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.400]   and being raised up out of the water,
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.340]   signifying resurrection life.
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.820]   And third, because it appears that in the early church,
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.740]   that's the way they did it.
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.640]   I mean, Philip, they went down into the water
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.180]   along the road and John the Baptist baptized
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.940]   in the Jordan River.
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.720]   He needed a river, not a font,
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.060]   to put a hand in and sprinkle some water.
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.540]   So we baptize by immersion.
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.360]   So those are two baptism distinctives,
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.060]   only baptize believers and baptize them by immersion.
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.000]   Now, several other marks of a Baptist church
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   follow from this position as an ongoing reformation
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.960]   of the Roman Catholic Church.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.600]   One is that the church is seen as an assembly of believers.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.840]   That's implied in what we've already seen.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.920]   We know that some of those believers may be hypocrites.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.760]   We can't be perfect,
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:58.760]   but the aim is to have a church whose members
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.820]   are truly trusting Christ, a believer's church,
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.280]   not a church that you're part of
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.820]   just because your parents were part of it
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.900]   or you were born into it.
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:14.620]   Another implication of the ongoing reformation among Baptists
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.920]   was that we have tried to take seriously
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.600]   the priesthood of all believers,
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.120]   that each of us has a direct, personal relationship
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.280]   with God through Christ.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.280]   And it seemed to us that this church-wide priesthood
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:39.960]   is why in the New Testament, congregations themselves,
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.900]   the congregation, not just a group of elders
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:47.900]   or a group of bishops, were the last court of appeal
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.540]   in the way the church governed itself.
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.880]   For example, when there was a matter of discipline,
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.140]   Jesus said in Matthew 18, as a final step
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.480]   before you have to put an unrepentant person
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.600]   out of your midst, he said, "Tell it to the church."
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.600]   And then the church makes that rendering, that judgment.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.740]   So that's why Baptists are usually called congregationalists.
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.740]   Another implication of the ongoing reformation among Baptists
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.100]   was a recovered belief in the freedom
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.540]   that Christians have from coercive dictates,
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:33.940]   not only from centralized ecclesiastical authorities,
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.660]   but also from civil authorities.
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.900]   Most of the non-Baptist Reformation churches
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.220]   in their early decades, and longer for some,
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:49.220]   failed to disentangle themselves from civil governments
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:54.220]   so that the people like Baptists were oppressed
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:58.340]   and persecuted even by their Protestant brothers
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.760]   and sisters who thought that state authority
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.740]   should be used by churches to coerce theological
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.660]   and ecclesiastical unity.
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.100]   So perhaps I can sum up the distinctives like this.
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.220]   First, Baptists are Protestants
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:18.000]   who share the great pillars of the Reformation,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.820]   justification on the basis of Christ alone,
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.460]   by grace alone, through faith alone,
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.080]   to the glory of God alone,
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.660]   on the basis of the authority of Scripture alone.
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.740]   Second, believers' baptism, so that the only people
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.380]   who receive the sign of new life in Christ
[00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.720]   are those who by faith have received new life in Christ.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:44.760]   Third, a believers' church in which the members consist
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.420]   only of those who give a credible profession
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.420]   of faith in Jesus.
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.600]   And then congregational governance,
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:59.600]   finally by the congregation and administered practically
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.720]   through elders and deacons.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.700]   Most of the confessions, the early confessions,
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:09.300]   always referred to elders and deacons among Baptists.
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.400]   And then finally, a commitment to freedom
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:17.060]   of religious expression without any external ecclesiastical
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:21.660]   or governmental control over the local congregation.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:26.420]   For myself, Dennis, there are glorious things
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:31.200]   that I share in common with those of other denominations
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:36.020]   that enable me to have very sweet fellowship
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.940]   and camaraderie and mission with others.
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:43.320]   And I don't think that the distinctives we Baptists believe
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:48.320]   in keep us from such fellowship or common mission,
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:53.680]   especially if we share those great Reformation commitments.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.680]   - Amen, very helpful overview, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.960]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.320]   You can ask a question of your own,
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.120]   even the simple and unexpected ones like Dennis did today.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.360]   You can do that and search our growing archive
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.680]   or subscribe to the podcast, all at desiringgod.org.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.100]   Forward slash, ask Pastor John.
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.180]   Well, the book of Ecclesiastes is enigmatic.
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.560]   It's puzzling.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.640]   It's puzzling because it tells us that much of life
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.280]   is vanity, a chasing after wind.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.120]   It says this from the second verse in the book.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.800]   Meaningless, meaningless, says the teacher,
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.880]   utterly meaningless, everything is meaningless.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.280]   But God's providence tells us a different story.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.280]   Everything in life is meaningful.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.400]   So what gives?
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:44.400]   Is life mostly meaningless or mostly meaningful?
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.960]   It's a great audience question.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.240]   Up next, I'm you all sending in some really,
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.560]   really hard questions that I'm grateful
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.160]   to be on this side of the table,
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.280]   simply asking them to John Piper.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.960]   I am nothing but your host, Tony Reinke,
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.420]   and we will see you back here on Monday.
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.420]   Have a great weekend.
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:16.580]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
