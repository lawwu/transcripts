[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   So like right now when you think of prompting,
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.240]   maybe you think about a user putting in a prompt,
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.160]   or maybe you think about some backend prompting
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.080]   that like a template has and then the user
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.400]   kind of interacts with that and then it sends it off.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.320]   I mean, just like a simple thing too,
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.440]   if you have like a store of what you can call context,
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.600]   like a series of pieces of information
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.520]   that the customer cares about,
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.520]   it could be like their voice,
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.040]   it could be a list of their products,
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.560]   it could be their customer's voice,
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.920]   it could be an example of a customer review
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.840]   that somebody left them and was really good,
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.480]   it could be a speech that maybe one of the leaders gave,
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.960]   you could actually just contact up
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.680]   like various pieces of context and then have a prompt
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.240]   and then get like a really cool,
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.880]   like if you think of the generative model as like a remixer,
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.440]   remix these various pieces of context
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.400]   and give me something new,
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.440]   it actually works really well.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.320]   And like, it's nothing super fancy,
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.440]   it's like, you're not fine tuning the model,
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.240]   you're just like doing really clever prompting.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.680]   There's, you know, like I was showing our business dev guy,
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.640]   our business pod leader,
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.280]   and he's been like really impressed with it.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.720]   It's just like this, like these are like little hacks,
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.520]   there's like thousands of these things.
