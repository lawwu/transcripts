[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:15.820]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound.
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.480]   Our email here is askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.540]   Today's show is sponsored by Future Proof.
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.820]   I just did a little video promo this morning
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.980]   for Future Proof.
[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.060]   Someone asked me, "What am I most excited about?"
[00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.740]   I had bullet points, Duncan, 'cause I have so much.
[00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.880]   The location, you know, the beach.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.140]   They have a perfect little running path,
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.300]   a walking path that follows the beach.
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.980]   There's good food, drinks, content is great.
[00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.860]   We have all these different speakers, live podcasts.
[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.380]   Last year, there was professional athletes,
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.300]   your favorite bloggers, social media personalities,
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.620]   financial pundits.
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.380]   You might even see us filming on the beach,
[00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.300]   movie recreation.
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.780]   - I thought of a scene, Eternal Sunshine.
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.620]   How about that?
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.860]   There's a lot of beach scenes in Eternal Sunshine.
[00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.340]   There's also great socializing, ad hoc conversations
[00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.180]   with advisors, investment managers,
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.460]   even normal, everyday investors.
[00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.140]   A lot of people who watch our shows come to it.
[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.500]   We were just actually talking this morning
[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.380]   about what we're gonna do for the live version of this show,
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.980]   to have people who are there ask us questions.
[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.820]   So it's gonna be great.
[00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.540]   Last year was hands down the best financial event
[00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.800]   I've ever been to, and there isn't a close second place.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.180]   But as fun as that was, I think we actually learned a lot
[00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.000]   about how to make it better,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.520]   so it's gonna be even better this year.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.360]   So get your tickets now.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.660]   They tell me prices are going up in 22 days.
[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.820]   It's futureproof.advisorcircle.com to sign up.
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.440]   So do it now.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.940]   - Yeah, it's gonna be a lot of fun.
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.780]   Looking forward to it.
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.860]   - Yeah, great.
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.940]   So Duncan, your hat today,
[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.820]   is that the value of your brokerage account, or what?
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.960]   - Almost, you were close.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.820]   It's the alpha that I have in my account, so.
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.780]   - All right, let's do a question.
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.060]   A lot of questions today. - Today's a rough day.
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.980]   Thanks for picking on me, though.
[00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.140]   Today's a pretty rough day for my stocks,
[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.960]   as you can probably, as you can assume.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.680]   Okay, up first today, we have a fan from Japan,
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.480]   so konnichiwa, or maybe it's more kombanwa
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.360]   this time of day, but big fan of the compound from Japan.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.720]   My 59-year-old mother is one of those people
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.760]   who doesn't believe in putting money in the stock market
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.600]   because she's afraid to, quote unquote, "lose it all."
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.920]   There are a lot of people in Japan who are still traumatized
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.920]   from the stock market bubble collapse in the '90s.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.160]   Now she's got about $300,000 in cash
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.880]   sitting in a checking account, literally earning nothing.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.560]   This year, I was finally able to convince her
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.320]   to open a brokerage account and invest $100,000.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.780]   I managed this account and decided to allocate 60%
[00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.780]   to a 2030 target date fund, that's 40% stocks and 60% bonds,
[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.380]   and the other 40% to an all-world stock index fund.
[00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.200]   I chose this allocation because I want to believe
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.380]   that having an increasing allocation of bonds
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.840]   is prudent for someone her age,
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.960]   but I'm constantly fighting the internal battle
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.640]   to allocate more to stocks so I can improve returns.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.840]   She plans to retire in eight years, has no debt,
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.880]   and expects to have a decent pension,
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.000]   so this money is largely supplementary.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.120]   Should I ditch the prudence and allocate more to stocks?
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.160]   It's kind of a YOLO question, right?
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.160]   - I completely understand where the mom is coming from here
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.000]   as it pertains to being nervous about financial assets,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.080]   if she's thinking about it
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.440]   from a purely Japanese perspective.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.280]   John, throw up the growth of wealth.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.960]   This is the MSCI Japan index since 1990.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.400]   $1 invested in Japan in 1990 grew to $1.32
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.800]   by the end of April this year,
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.400]   and that dollar was underwater for almost 30 years.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.360]   On the other hand, a dollar invested in the S&P
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.560]   would have grown to more than $23 in that timeframe,
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.800]   so we're talking 10% annual returns for the S&P since 1990,
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.280]   85 basis points per year for Japan,
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.760]   and this is actually from the perspective of a U.S. investor.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.600]   If you were in Japan, it was actually worse
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.740]   when we're talking about in yen terms.
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.400]   So why did this happen?
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.480]   I consider myself something of a financial historian.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.040]   Others may disagree with it, but this is my opinion.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.760]   Japan has had the biggest financial asset bubble
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.500]   in history in the 1980s.
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.800]   There really aren't that many books
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.440]   written about it for some reason.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.560]   The best one I've found is this "Devil Take the Hindmost"
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.360]   by Edward Chancellor, and it's basically
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.800]   one of the better books ever written
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.920]   on financial manias and crashes,
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.080]   and he has a whole chapter on the Japanese bubble.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.400]   It's not a whole book, but I've compiled,
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.200]   through this book and some other sources over the years,
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.800]   some of my favorite stats and anecdotes.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.120]   I'm gonna run it through to show
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.620]   how crazy things got in Japan in the '80s.
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.400]   1956 to 1986, land prices in Japan increased 5,000%,
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.200]   even though consumer prices only doubled in that time.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.240]   So inflation doubled, land increased by 5,000%.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.040]   By 1990, the Japanese real estate market
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.040]   was four times the value of the real estate
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.760]   of the United States, despite being 25 times smaller
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.180]   in terms of land mass and having 200 million fewer people.
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.560]   Tokyo itself was on equal footing with the U.S.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.600]   in terms of real estate values.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.640]   There were 20 golf clubs in Japan,
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.400]   and this is in 1989, it cost a million dollars to join.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.200]   The P/E of the Nikkei was, yeah,
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.080]   P/E on the Japanese stock market
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.080]   was 60 times trailing 12 months earning.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.880]   The CAPE ratio was 100 times,
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.560]   which is more than double what it was
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.160]   in the U.S. for the tech bubble.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.880]   Japan made up 15% of world stock markets in 1980.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.380]   By 1989, it was 42%.
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.640]   1970 to 1989, Japanese large cap stocks
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.440]   grew by 22% per year for two decades,
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.680]   small cap stocks in Japan were up 30% per year for 20 years.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.520]   It was just crazy.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.480]   Stocks went from 29% of Japan's GDP in 1980
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.960]   to 151% by 1989.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.440]   Just real estate and stocks at the same time,
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.520]   just a cluster of a bubble.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.040]   If you wanna learn more, read the book
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.280]   to figure out why it happened.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.660]   But there are people who are too scared
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.620]   to invest in the U.S. stock market,
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.680]   and the returns here have been fantastic
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.260]   for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years.
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.840]   Pick your long-term time horizon.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.000]   In Japan, they haven't gone anywhere for three decades
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.720]   because of how out-of-whack things got in the '80s.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.660]   Now, side note here, the MSCI data goes back to 1970.
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.420]   If you take the Japan returns going back to 1970 to today,
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.380]   it still returned 8.6% per year
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.620]   despite going nowhere for 30 years.
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.040]   That's how crazy things got in the '70s and '80s,
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.880]   because things were,
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.900]   so it was almost 9% per year still for the long-term.
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.640]   The big question is, how do you get someone
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.540]   to change their psychology when it comes to the stock market
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.640]   after they've been scarred through something like this?
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.160]   This is kind of like U.S. investors
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.040]   after the Great Depression.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.000]   No one wanted to touch the stock market.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.160]   Stocks for the long run wasn't a thing then.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.200]   So I think you could walk your mother
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.640]   through historical rates of return,
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.200]   and inflation rates, and compounding,
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.480]   and interest, and earnings, and dividends,
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.840]   and all that fun spreadsheet stuff
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.360]   that I like to pay attention to,
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.920]   but numbers and spreadsheets are essentially useless
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.460]   when we're talking about changing someone's behavior,
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.200]   especially when they've been through something like this.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.240]   I think it's hard to change how you do things,
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.880]   especially after you're that old,
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.120]   so I think you have to lean into the emotions here.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.620]   So remember, Duncan, remember the scene in Shawshank?
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.880]   John, throw this up here,
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.920]   where the inmates are all working on the roof,
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.600]   and Andy Dufresne asks Tapp and Hadley
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.540]   if he trusts his wife, right?
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.640]   Awesome, awesome scene.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.960]   And he runs him through the IRS stuff, bought a gift,
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.340]   and he's coming on soon,
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.960]   but I think this would mean Bill Sweet
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.120]   would do amazing in jail, wouldn't he, as a tax guy?
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.240]   That's how Andy Dufresne basically survived jail.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.600]   I think you have to basically ask your mother
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.820]   the same question, like, "Mom, do you trust me
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.420]   "to handle your finances, and investment,
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.260]   "and prudent matter?
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.500]   "I'm not gonna gamble, I'm gonna diversify,
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.260]   "I'm gonna invest, not speculate,
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.000]   "I'm gonna manage your money with an eye on the long-term,"
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.660]   all these things, so I think you have to try
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.980]   to put an element of trust in there,
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.960]   'cause sometimes people are so emotionally scarred
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.300]   when it comes to money,
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.200]   or they just have made so many mistakes
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.040]   that they need to just let it out of their hands,
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.280]   let someone else take care of it,
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.680]   and just, if there's an element of trust there,
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.600]   you let them take the steering wheel.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.760]   I think you also have to help her figure out
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.880]   what the money's for in the first place.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.120]   So you said it's supplementary,
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.100]   so is it gonna end up supplementing
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.180]   her pension income at some point?
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.460]   Will she even need the money?
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.940]   Maybe some of this will just be passed down
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.420]   to kids and grandkids, and that's a way
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.460]   to pull on those emotional strings
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.100]   to help her figure out what to do.
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.020]   So I would appeal more to emotions than the math of it all,
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.540]   and I do like the fact that you're starting out
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.060]   with a target date fund here for simplicity,
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.940]   and diversification, and low cost.
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.860]   - I knew you were gonna love that.
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.260]   - Yeah, it makes, I think that's a pretty good first step
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:06.620]   as opposed to picking individual stocks
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.440]   for her or something.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.340]   So I would go for the emotions of it,
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.700]   but I totally understand where someone in Japan
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.040]   would be coming from in terms of
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.020]   being pretty nervous about it.
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.660]   But I like the fact that if you're handling it for her,
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.220]   that there's an element of trust there,
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.440]   and she can hopefully let go and just go for it.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.980]   - Yeah, that was something when I first started
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.580]   working with you guys years ago,
[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.860]   I had to get used to was all the comments of,
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:28.940]   you know, what about Japan?
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.540]   Literally, that was the response to almost
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.660]   everything that we put out.
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.380]   Someone would be like, what about Japan?
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.780]   And the comments, it's just kind of funny.
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:35.820]   - It really is an outlier,
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.940]   and the reason that returns were so awful
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.460]   is because the bubble was so enormous to begin with.
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.660]   And I think it really was the biggest
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.780]   financial asset bubble that we've ever had.
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:46.900]   And the funny thing is if you read this book,
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.620]   "Devil Take the Hindmost,"
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.100]   Japan really, as a people, as a culture,
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.400]   they have a very conservative nature.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.860]   So the fact that it happened there
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.340]   was kind of crazy to begin with.
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.900]   And again, there's a bunch of reasons why it happened,
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.520]   but it was just an insane, insane bubble.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.240]   - Yeah, crazy.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.020]   - All right, next question.
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:05.860]   - Speaking of Japan, I'm looking forward
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.720]   to the next season of "Tokyo Vice."
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.420]   - That's a good show. - I like that one,
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.820]   that's right.
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:15.820]   - Okay, up next we have a question from Janelle,
[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.140]   I think is how you say it.
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.060]   I'm a single 32-year-old woman
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.260]   that makes $70,000 a year in South Florida.
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.160]   I have a net worth of around $220,000.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.140]   $87,000 of this is cash sitting
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.340]   in a high-yield savings account earning 4% right now.
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.500]   This savings was originally designated for a home purchase,
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.920]   but with rising home prices,
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.240]   it's been tough to find an affordable home.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.940]   It's not worth it to buy where I am,
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.660]   so I'm considering moving to a more affordable area.
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.060]   My question is this,
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.900]   is there a better place to part my cash
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.620]   that is still liquid for the long-term
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.260]   if I don't buy right away?
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.560]   I figure about 50,000 is for a house
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.740]   and the rest is an emergency fund.
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.740]   I think I should just stop saving
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.620]   and continue to invest my future earnings
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.980]   in the stock market through my 401(k) in brokerage.
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.460]   Do you think this would be a good idea?
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.540]   It's a good question. - A few different things
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.580]   are going on in this question, right?
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.500]   Yes, I agree.
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.340]   First of all, yeah, good on you
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.420]   for saving up for down payment
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.420]   and being realistic about the affordability in your area.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.340]   I don't know exactly where you live,
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.740]   but if you look at the house price gains in Miami,
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.200]   for instance, relative to the rest of the country,
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.100]   John, do a chart on here of Miami housing prices.
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.940]   Do the next one, there you go.
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.780]   So this is Case-Shiller Home Price Index
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.060]   for Miami and then nationally.
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.640]   And this is since the start of the pandemic
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.220]   at the end of 2019.
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.500]   And you can see house prices in Miami,
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.520]   they've sort of leveled out,
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.980]   but up way more than the rest of the country.
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.740]   I know a lot of people don't want to move
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:36.940]   to a more affordable area of the country
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.500]   because of friends or family or work or just inertia.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.020]   But if this is an option,
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.780]   I think it's something that you have control over
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.060]   where you could go somewhere cheaper, Duncan.
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.420]   No hints here for you, Duncan.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.820]   But John, throw up the next chart.
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.860]   Lance Lambert from Fortune made this one for me.
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.300]   And it shows the typical median home value by region.
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.780]   And you can see the orange there
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.900]   is a median home value of $350,000 to $500,000.
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.060]   And Florida is filling up with that pretty good.
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.740]   California has more in the 750 and up range,
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:05.860]   which is kind of tough to stomach.
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.940]   But look at all these other places,
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.780]   even in the Southeast where you could potentially move
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.500]   if you want to stick in that area
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.740]   where home prices are more affordable.
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.180]   It, you know, I think if you have that,
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.460]   that makes a lot of sense.
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.540]   So as far as the cash investments go,
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.220]   4% is about average as far as online savings accounts go.
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.740]   I think Marcus up the rate to 4.15% this week
[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.260]   after the Fed raised rates.
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.900]   Most of them should be plus or minus something
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:33.900]   or right around there.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.780]   They're now matching the higher savings account rate, right?
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.020]   Yep, about time.
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:41.300]   You could earn a little more in ultra short-term bonds
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.140]   if you wanted to.
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.420]   One to six month T-bills are yielding north of 5% right now.
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.260]   I think it depends how much
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.440]   that extra 1% or so means to you.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.420]   So you have 87,000 in cash, she said, right?
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.580]   1% on $87,000 in cash is $870 a year.
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.980]   It's not bad, but it's not life-changing money.
[00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.380]   So I don't know, is it really worth it to move it around
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.940]   and buy a short-term T-bill ETF
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.620]   or try to buy T-bills on your own?
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.700]   You could, but I think a savings account
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.120]   and online savings account is probably easier
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.620]   in terms of moving money around and that sort of thing.
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.580]   Part three of the question is how much you should save.
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.820]   So you obviously have a large cash allocation
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:16.860]   relative to your net worth
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.140]   because you're saving up for a house.
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:22.020]   So 87,000 out of 220, we're looking at like 40% in cash.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.260]   So she's got a really big cash buffer
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.940]   relative to her net worth.
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.820]   I think as long as you're comfortable
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.300]   with that amount in a down payment,
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.260]   then yeah, future savings should be funneled
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.340]   towards the stock market of the 401k
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.420]   and tax for retirement accounts.
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.820]   So you could do a quick back of the envelope.
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.600]   You said $50,000 for the down payment.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.460]   If you did 20,000 or 20% down payment,
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.940]   that's a $250,000 house of 50k.
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.300]   If you did a 10% down payment,
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.700]   that's a half a million dollar house.
[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.920]   And if you only did five, that's a million dollar house.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.180]   I don't know what you can afford,
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.180]   but that's kind of how you can think about the down payment
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.600]   and how far it will get you
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.760]   in terms of how much leverage you want to take.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.080]   The good news is you have the ability to save.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.520]   Like the fact that you've put aside that much cash,
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.440]   I think is a good thing.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.080]   Now, yeah, I would, at your age and where you are,
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.080]   start funneling more of that into the market.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.560]   And now that you have that cash buffer,
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.640]   you should feel pretty good about yourself.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.180]   But you've already reached the most important first step.
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.600]   So I think you're in a very good place.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.400]   - You know, something I realized having just moved
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.920]   out of New York City to Connecticut,
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.800]   something that a lot of young people and myself included
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.720]   are guilty of is clinging to like living in a big city
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.880]   for like the name of it.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.360]   And like kind of, there's almost like a prestige, I guess,
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.720]   of being like, "Oh, I live in Brooklyn."
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.280]   Or, "Oh, I live in Manhattan."
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.680]   You know, and I'm sure the same with Miami
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.040]   and a lot of big cities.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.020]   And at a certain point, I just got to where I was like,
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.640]   "I don't care about that anymore."
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.180]   Like, I want to go where like it's livable
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.160]   and where things are more affordable, you know?
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.700]   - And if you're not going to use all the things
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.240]   that are great about a big city,
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.440]   you're just paying up for no,
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.960]   you just take a tax on yourself, right?
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:51.800]   - Right. - Yeah.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.920]   So at a certain point, you want to Costco
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.560]   as opposed to a local little bodega, right?
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.000]   - Right, or drive as opposed to the subway, yeah.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.400]   Okay. - All right.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.080]   Next one. - Up next, question three.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.280]   We have a question from Will.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.840]   "I run a one-member consulting LLC
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.260]   "and was looking at SEP IRAs.
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.380]   "I saw that there's a new Roth option
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.540]   "as part of the December 22 legislation.
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.640]   "I need you to remind me what SEP means."
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.580]   We can wait until after.
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.380]   "Can I contribute to both the SEP Roth
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.160]   "and my own personal Roth?
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.420]   "There's conflicting advice out there
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.500]   "about whether the Roth limits impact one another.
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.920]   "Side note, when I started doing research on the question,
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.680]   "I came across a random internet article.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.720]   "I started reading the article
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.360]   "and I thought I was reading Bill Sweet
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.920]   "because of the Roth gushing.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.260]   "It wasn't him, but it was that giant of personal finance,
[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.260]   "Susie Orman.
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.840]   "Does Bill get confused for her often?"
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.920]   Don't know, compliment or shade, you know?
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.840]   No way to know. - Let's bring in
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.200]   Susie Sweet now, I guess, and ask him.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.820]   Bill, you don't have the bangs of Susie Orman,
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.800]   so I'm guessing not.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.760]   So SEP is what, Simplified Employee Pension?
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.080]   Employer, is that right?
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:58.920]   - Yeah, you've got it.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.140]   Yeah, and I have to tell you,
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.720]   people are always asking me if I know Tyler Durden.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.360]   This is the first time I've been confused for Susie Orman
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.040]   outside of a New York City draft club,
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.560]   so this is the very first time.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.280]   Not a lot of those up in Milford, Connecticut,
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.560]   I'd imagine, Duncan, but I'm not here to judge.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:18.520]   - You helped me set up a SEP IRA four or five years ago.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.280]   I didn't know about this Roth option.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.520]   - Yeah, well, it's new.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.760]   - So what's the story?
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.440]   I didn't know about this, tell me about it.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.680]   - Yeah, so Duncan, SEP is a Simplified Employee Pension Plan
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.440]   and it's basically a way for small businesses
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.920]   to turbocharge retirement contributions,
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.480]   but they're using kind of a hybrid of the IRA structure.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.760]   And the biggest difference between your traditional
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.600]   sort of standard IRA that you or I can contribute to
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.040]   are the income limits.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.140]   This year, we can do about $6,500 per,
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.240]   subject to income limits,
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.600]   but a SEP IRA, A, is not subject to income limits,
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.800]   and then B, you can do up to the 415(c) limit in 2023,
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.840]   that's $66,000.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.200]   Now, you have to have a lot of income
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.560]   to contribute that much.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.120]   It's limited about 20% of your net income,
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.560]   but that's a big one.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.360]   And so what Will is taking a look at here
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.680]   before he went down a really weird rabbit hole
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.100]   with who I look like and don't look like
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:14.800]   is the Consolidated Omnibus Act bill, Ben,
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.520]   in Secure Act 2.0,
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.680]   as it's colloquially known in the industry,
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.560]   basically changed the way
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.420]   that certain contributions could be made.
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.400]   And he's 100% right.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.320]   Will is on it.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:29.280]   You can do now a SEP Roth IRA as of January 1st, 2023.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.320]   And ultimately, I think that's an awesome option, right?
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.620]   I think I have the back tattoo,
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.560]   first episode of Portfolio Rescue.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.600]   Now as a compound, back tattoo says Roth IRA conversion.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.520]   I'm into this stuff.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.660]   So I think ultimately it's a great option.
[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.960]   You just need a way to tax pros and cons.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.500]   And there are some unanswered questions in the legislation,
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.040]   which we'll get to in a second.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.520]   - All right, so they can do the Roth,
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.280]   so they might as well, right?
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.240]   - I mean, I think so.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.440]   You need to know a lot about what's going on.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.020]   But what Will sort of asked is,
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.680]   does this impact my ability to do a regular Roth IRA, right?
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.300]   Because why not have your cake and eat it too
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.800]   if you can dump in $60,000 into a SEP?
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.600]   Why not do the additional $6,500 too?
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.920]   And unfortunately, the answer to that, Ben,
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.240]   is we don't know.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.080]   The omnibus bill was passed I think on December 29th
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.380]   of last year and the IRS, even though it's May now,
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.880]   they haven't gone around to promulgating guidance.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.600]   So we don't actually know if the SEP Roth IRA contribution
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.300]   is gonna be subject to FICA tax, as another example.
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.280]   We don't know if you're gonna need to report that income
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.800]   if it's something that's not a single member LLC
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.400]   on a W-2 or 1099.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.520]   And we do not know if you're able to contribute
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.720]   to a SEP Roth IRA for 2022.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.820]   Because as you might know, Ben,
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.120]   you can contribute to a SEP IRA
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.440]   up to the extension deadline all the way in October.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.880]   So there's a couple of unanswered questions here,
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.360]   but I think all things being equal,
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.640]   more Roth, better than not enough Roth.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.360]   So I would say go for it, Will.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.720]   - See, this is why, did you become a,
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.200]   Bill, did you get into accounting and tax
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.400]   because of Andy Dufresne?
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.400]   Is he your hero?
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.360]   Because I rewatched that scene today
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.120]   and you survived prison pretty well, I think.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.440]   - Well, I appreciate that.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.640]   I didn't know if that was a compliment or an insult.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.800]   I can't tell.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:04.920]   Same thing with Susie Orman.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.280]   Again, I'm not sure what exactly is going on here.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.840]   Or is this an insult to Susie Orman?
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:09.760]   I don't know.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.100]   But no, what was going on backstage was,
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.200]   I love that movie so much.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.780]   It's a foundational film for me.
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.340]   I was so upset when Forrest Gump won the Oscar.
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.880]   I guess I understand, but come on.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.280]   In the annals of film, give me a break.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.560]   Looking backwards in hindsight,
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.760]   which one would you rather watch on a Tuesday night
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.840]   with your kids?
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.040]   The prison scene, obviously, is awful.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.720]   It's the worst part of the film.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.400]   But that said, you didn't see backstage.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.120]   I was trying to smash the unmute button
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.000]   'cause I wanted to chime in and comment.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.200]   But John blocked me.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.080]   He prison blocked me at the time.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.160]   - I'm not gonna get that by John.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.160]   - Nope, nope.
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.000]   - Never.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:42.820]   - All right, let's do another one.
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.500]   - Also, Sean says in the chat,
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.920]   you keep talking about this tattoo,
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.980]   but no one's seen it.
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:47.880]   (laughing)
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.420]   - I did, I was putting my shirt on
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.200]   when the camera turned on today, as you guys know.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.360]   - It's like a Tupac on Roth Life as opposed to Thug Life.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.960]   - I wanna make a shirt that says,
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.860]   "When in doubt, Roth it out."
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.120]   And have people wear that.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.320]   - I like that, I like that.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.800]   - All right, up next, we have a question from Colin.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.200]   I got married last year, and after doing our taxes,
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.720]   it turns out that my wife and I have been phased out,
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.560]   annoyingly, by only $1,000 or so,
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.080]   of being able to contribute to a Roth IRA.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.800]   I had already maxed out my contribution for 2022
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.940]   and was on my way for 2023.
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:24.080]   I have a rollover IRA from a previous employer,
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.280]   and Vanguard is saying that if I don't wanna pay taxes
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.920]   on the total account amount when I transfer,
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.040]   I need to move that rollover IRA to my current 401(k).
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.960]   To do this, I would need to liquidate everything,
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.600]   which I don't wanna do because I like the ETFs I have
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.960]   and I don't wanna give up on the compounding interest.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.920]   What is the easiest way to move Roth IRA contributions
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.480]   to a rollover IRA while minimizing taxes
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.740]   and not having to sell?
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.920]   - This gets back to my idea
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.760]   that we should have one mulligan.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.360]   You get to make one mistake within reason,
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.600]   plus or minus some percentage of your AGI,
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.340]   and the IRS calls it good, right?
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.100]   Especially when you get so close to the Roth thing, right?
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.520]   It's like playing, I played Operation
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.800]   with my kids this weekend,
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.560]   where you get to the side and it buzzes you, you know?
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.320]   - That's a classic, yeah.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.760]   Yeah, so, the other thing is the rollover process
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.560]   from a 401(k) to IRA is a nightmare in this country.
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.040]   You have to sell everything,
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.760]   then they send you a check two or three weeks later,
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.840]   then you have to deposit, it's so antiquated,
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.760]   and I know why they do this,
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.860]   because they don't want you to move money from them,
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.160]   but what is going on here if he's over the limit
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.160]   because their income came in a little higher than expected,
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.360]   and he's doing a rollover, what's going on here?
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.200]   Because I'm confused.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.240]   - Yeah, so Collin forgot to say the magic words,
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.920]   not to brag, this is only a problem
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.600]   if you're earning more than $214,000 a year
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.760]   of taxable income, so good for you, Collin,
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.680]   congratulations, yeah, good on ya.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.640]   So, I think what he's getting at, Ben,
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.980]   is I think he's thinking he wants to set the conditions
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:48.360]   to do backdoor Roth IRA contributions going forward,
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.580]   because as we've discussed many times on the show,
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.320]   there's no income limit to contribute to a traditional IRA,
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.800]   and there's no income limit to convert
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.920]   that traditional IRA to a Roth IRA,
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.940]   but Collin's gonna run into a problem
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.080]   known as the pro rata rule,
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.720]   that if he has a large IRA balance,
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.520]   anything that he hasn't paid tax on
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.720]   is gonna be taxed when he goes in that conversion pro rata.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.000]   So, if he has $60,000 set aside, he contributes 6,000,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.600]   90% of that conversion is gonna be taxable,
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.080]   and that's obviously not advantageous,
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.240]   it kind of defeats the whole purpose, right,
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.580]   of doing that backdoor Roth.
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.920]   So, the solution, Collin already figured it out,
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.680]   use your employer-sponsored 401(k) plan.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.840]   He mentions a fantastic company, Vanguard,
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.880]   and they have a lot of great ETFs, Ben,
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.040]   some of which we are very familiar with here
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.600]   at our company and elsewhere,
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.920]   and I think a very reputable company.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.600]   I would take a hard second look at that, Collin, about that.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.240]   And further to me, I understand,
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.840]   you don't wanna liquidate your investments,
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.080]   you fell in love with your ETFs, you got married,
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.920]   you don't wanna let 'em go, I get it,
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.520]   but you kinda need to balance that
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.680]   versus what you could get on the other side,
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.720]   and Ben, you're right, it's probably gonna take you
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.840]   two to three weeks to make this happen,
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.440]   but two to three weeks in the time span of 40 to 50 years,
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.120]   probably not a big deal in my opinion.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:00.960]   I'd take a second look at it, Collin.
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.960]   - It's annoying, but yes, it's annoying,
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.360]   but it's not gonna be the end of the world.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.200]   - Yep, yep.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.600]   So probably the only other thing I could throw at you,
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.440]   Collin, if you have any self-employment income,
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.800]   you could set up your own solo 401(k),
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.440]   so that's something that you can always consider
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.160]   if you do happen to own a business.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.000]   Unfortunately, if you have a single employer,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.860]   that's not an option, but Vanguard, to me,
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.480]   is among the upper echelon of reputable providers,
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.960]   so I'd look at it, 'cause then you could have your cake,
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.120]   you could eat it, too.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.200]   There's just some confusion.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.620]   He says something about easiest way
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:30.420]   to move Roth IRA conversions to Roth rollover IRAs.
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.680]   That's not a thing.
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.840]   If you over-contributed for a prior year,
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.200]   yeah, you have to take an excess distribution.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.280]   You had to do it by the tax deadline, unfortunately.
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.760]   Hopefully, you filed an extension,
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.440]   and if you don't, you're paying a 6% excise tax,
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.600]   and the IRS can come slap you with up to now a 25% penalty
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.260]   for any excess contributions.
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.840]   So Collin, talk to your tax professional about this,
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.840]   but for what you're gonna get what it's worth,
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.920]   it's free advice, but I would take a strong look
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.760]   at doing an excess distribution,
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.440]   get that out of your account as soon as possible.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.980]   - And so I'm looking at the live chat here.
[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:02.160]   Did I see Duncan's mom is in the chat today?
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.000]   - Whoa!
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.760]   - My mom is often in the chat, to be fair.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:05.600]   - Your mom is proud of you, Duncan.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.440]   - She is?
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.320]   - She wants to see you at work.
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.880]   I think that's beautiful, man.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.720]   - All right.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.840]   - Miss Hill, you raised a fine son.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.620]   We're very proud to have Duncan as part of our team.
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.680]   - People in the comments aren't paying attention
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.240]   to the show, they're just talking to your mom now.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.080]   - It's a family affair, yeah.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.920]   What does she think about rollover Roth IRA conversions?
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.280]   - Well, I think that one thing I was gonna ask you about
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.600]   is the thing about compounding interest.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.780]   I mean, that doesn't stop just because you rollover, right?
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.780]   I mean, your accounts are still-
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:34.620]   - No, let's assume that he's able to replicate.
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:36.480]   - Yeah, you might miss out a little bit.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.180]   Yeah, it's like you go to cash for a couple of weeks,
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.020]   then you get back in.
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:39.840]   So it's not like the-
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.780]   - Yeah, I think that's what Ben highlighted at the onset.
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:42.620]   That's what he's worried about.
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.100]   This process takes, unfortunately,
[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.180]   a month for some providers.
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.900]   Again, I think Vanguard's a very good company
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.980]   and I would take a second look at it.
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.460]   - Also, you can time the transfer, right?
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.300]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.820]   - I could work in his favor.
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:54.660]   I mean, that's true.
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:55.740]   Unfortunately, we don't know.
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:57.460]   It's easy for me to tell what's gonna happen
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.240]   three weeks from now in three weeks.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.360]   - All right, next one.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.440]   - Okay, up next, we have a question from Brad.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:07.060]   I'm 34 years old and I live in a state with no income tax
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.760]   and my salary is in the 22% bracket.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.800]   I started a new job that has a 401(k) with a Roth option.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.920]   I can max out my 401(k) contribution
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.840]   by splitting my contribution between traditional and Roth.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.640]   My employer's plan has a safe harbor match
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.960]   after a year that would add 4%,
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.880]   but I'm not currently receiving a match.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.700]   Am I better off maxing out my 401(k) in multiple buckets
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:31.380]   or saving a lower percentage by having it all in Roth?
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.180]   Can you guys explain safe harbor?
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.620]   I don't know what that means.
[00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:36.420]   - How about it, Bill?
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:37.900]   - Yeah, I think so.
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.840]   - Bill runs the 401(k) at our place, basically,
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.540]   so he can take this one.
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.340]   - I'm your plan administrator.
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.880]   No, the safe harbor, Duncan, is simply that it allows
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.620]   for a certain type of contribution,
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.740]   specifically kind of toward executives,
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.580]   that ultimately, if you give everybody a free 3% or 4%,
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.500]   the safe harbor minimum is 3%.
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.440]   I guess they're a little bit more generous like us.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.640]   They're doing 4%.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.880]   If you're doing that and matching contributions,
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.460]   if actually you can sort of tilt the dial,
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:03.600]   you don't have to go through some
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.080]   of the really complicated Department of Labor
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.880]   high-compensated employee tests.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.560]   And so the 401(k) plan is a people's plan.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.160]   Most plans are, and ultimately,
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.920]   there's a test that applies each year
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.640]   that says, hey, if you have too much money
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.840]   in your highest-paid folks,
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.920]   we're gonna declare this plan not valid,
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.160]   and they're gonna make the distribution happen
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.920]   from the higher-compensated folks.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.400]   So if you go safe harbor route,
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.800]   everybody gets 4% or 3% minimum,
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:28.840]   but you don't have to go through
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:29.680]   some of the more stringent tests.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.500]   - It's a pretty good deal.
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:34.880]   So my guess is as much as you like a Roth IRA or 401(k),
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.800]   if they, for whatever reason, have to split this
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.120]   and gives them a bigger match,
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.560]   you would probably recommend splitting
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.200]   because you can't really get,
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.520]   even the tax benefits of the Roth in the future
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.960]   are not gonna be better than 100% return on the match,
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.800]   right?
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:47.720]   - Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.840]   And Brad says he's not getting a safe harbor match,
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.960]   so I don't know that it really comes into play.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.680]   Most plans would allow for a match
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.480]   on either traditional or Roth,
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.960]   so I don't think that's necessarily a factor.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.680]   But his real question is, should I split this?
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.520]   Should I have a split?
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.880]   Brad, if we could see in the future
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.160]   and know exactly what your tax rate is gonna be at 64,
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.520]   like we kind of know at 34,
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.480]   we'd be able to answer that question very specifically.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.480]   I've got no problem.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.360]   If you don't know the right answer, just diversify, right?
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.120]   I think, guys, I've got the back tattoo.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:16.960]   We talked about Roth.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.780]   I'm pushing Roth.
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.480]   I think the audience of asset compounds
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.620]   skews relatively younger.
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.840]   I could be wrong about that.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.040]   I think early in our career,
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.800]   let's say 20s, 30s, Roth is gonna be the way to go.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.360]   But there's a big case,
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.080]   a huge case for traditional contributions.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:30.960]   And if you're not sure,
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.320]   if you kind of think that my tax rate might be lower
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.160]   in retirement,
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.680]   traditional contributions could be the best option for you.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.200]   And so, Brad, I think if you can't,
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.200]   in the inability to see the future,
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.320]   splitting the baby in half doesn't make a,
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.440]   that makes a ton of sense to me.
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.840]   I'd keep doing what you're doing, Brad,
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.820]   in the absence of perfect information.
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.400]   - It's funny you mentioned the age of people in the chat
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.520]   because the other day,
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.200]   or it's been several weeks, I think,
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.480]   David Wysocki, who's often in the chat on our shows,
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.640]   said something about being 72 years old.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.480]   - That's great, I love it.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.840]   - I just assumed that he was,
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.760]   I was just picturing like a 30-something year old.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.760]   - He's a young man at heart.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.520]   I mean, God bless him, he's got 30 years left.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.240]   So yeah, I'd urge a Roth contribution for him
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.080]   as anyone else.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:12.960]   - Bringing up the averages.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.960]   All right, we got one more.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.640]   - Okay, last but not least,
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.280]   we have a question from Tom.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:21.920]   I'm married filing jointly with $150,000 income.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.360]   I have four to five years of short-term capital losses
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.320]   from 2022 of $13,000.
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:31.360]   I used $3,000 of the losses against our 2022 income.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:35.080]   If I have $3,000 of long-term capital gains in 2023,
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:38.000]   do I pay the lower rate on the long-term capital gains
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.160]   while still deducting $3,000 against our income
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.620]   with the short-term capital losses?
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.840]   Maybe a small potatoes question
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.500]   compared to some of the not to brag questions.
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.400]   - There's no small potatoes on "Ask Joe" now.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.600]   - No, this is a show for the people.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.040]   - All right, so Bill,
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.840]   I got a question about the carrying losses over.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.040]   So you have a certain amount,
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.520]   you have $10,000 of losses.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.080]   This year, you can carry over 3,000
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.200]   from that couple of years.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.800]   Does the IRS just hope that you're gonna forget
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.040]   about those carryover losses?
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.080]   Is that why they do it?
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.680]   Why can't we just take them all in one year?
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.760]   - It happens sometimes.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.200]   My partner in crime here, Bill Arzaroni in CPA,
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.500]   who I have not spent any time in jail with,
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.540]   but he's my battle buddy.
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.560]   He would correct you on that, Ben.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.500]   He would say that you can deduct $3,000
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.920]   against your ordinary income.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.440]   And so then the remainder carries forward.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.480]   And the reason I mentioned him
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.840]   is we see a lot of bad tax work, to be honest, Ben.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.280]   And one of the more common things is they miss some folks.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.840]   Unfortunately, when they pick up a new client,
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.640]   they don't catch that carry forward number
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.440]   from last year or the prior years.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.560]   So if you're meeting with a new tax professional
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.280]   and they haven't in detail reviewed
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.840]   your prior year's tax return,
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:43.200]   massive red flag that they're not doing their due diligence.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.080]   But Ben, to your point,
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.400]   no, they do carry forward indefinitely.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.480]   I mean, I imagine there's some people
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.640]   that lost a lot of money during COVID
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.440]   or maybe in the dot-com era,
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.480]   they're still deducting their capital losses,
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.620]   let's say from 20 years ago,
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.360]   because if you're only able to deduct $3,000 a year,
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.400]   that doesn't go very far in the context
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.980]   of some of the larger losses.
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.480]   So let's talk about ordering.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.640]   So Ben, to answer the question just directly,
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.640]   this is the answer.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.880]   Any losses that are carried forward into a future tax year
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.680]   are considered long-term in nature
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.080]   by the time that next year rolls around,
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.840]   which kind of makes sense, right?
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.840]   If you have a short versus long-term loss,
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.200]   you hold that for a year,
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.680]   anything that you've held a short-term, a year later,
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.320]   is gonna be long-term, right?
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.880]   Because the holding period is a year
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.440]   and we're talking about a year periods here.
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.120]   So the ordering rules work like this.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.480]   Short-term losses offset short-term gains on the tax form.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.760]   Makes sense, then you get a net short-term number.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:40.040]   Long-term losses, less long-term carry forward losses,
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.120]   less offset long-term gains.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.680]   So again, from the prior year,
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.040]   that number is magically transformed into a long-term loss
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.780]   because it happened more than a year ago.
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.400]   Then you get a net long-term gain.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.800]   Then, net short-term losses or gains.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.600]   - I got the Zach Galifianakis numbers going on right now.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.440]   (laughing)
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.760]   And this is why I just let you do my taxes, Bill,
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.280]   because I'm lost.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.200]   - Well, this is why I let the software handle it, right?
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.640]   So I don't even do in this calculus.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.920]   I'm not Galifianakis in this stuff here.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.680]   So ultimately it all goes into a blender
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.440]   and then you pay tax on what's left.
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.680]   And so to give you guys an example,
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.200]   stick with me here for a second.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.040]   Let's say that I have a $3,000 short-term gain.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.120]   I'm not drawing this down.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.620]   Duncan, don't laugh at me.
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:21.980]   A $3,000 short-term gain, a $3,000 long-term gain,
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.440]   and I have $5,000 loss carry forward.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.840]   So the net gain I have there is 1,000.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.040]   Is that short or long?
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.360]   Duncan, which one is it?
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.760]   Based on what I've told you.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.320]   - I wasn't paying that close attention.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.320]   - Okay, that's fine.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.880]   That is gonna be a short-term gain
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.080]   because as I said before,
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.680]   the ordering steps are the long-term carry forward offsets,
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.080]   long-term gains first,
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.400]   and then they get put in a blender.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.260]   So in that instance, in that case,
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.380]   that would be a net short-term gain.
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.820]   Does that answer the question, Ben?
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.680]   - Yes.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.680]   - We do need a whiteboard.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.520]   - I think so.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:57.880]   - On the next Ask the Compound,
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.920]   we'll do this on a whiteboard.
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.320]   - I do have a little bit of a follow-up question.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.600]   I think you basically just answered it,
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.200]   but just to distill it down,
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.360]   I have a friend who I was talking to recently
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.880]   who was telling me he lost quite a bit
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.520]   in the market last year.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.760]   And I was telling him about this very thing,
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.920]   being able to write off up to 3,000,
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.640]   and he was like, "Oh, I don't think my tax guy did that."
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.600]   Is there anything you can do after the fact
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.900]   to like, or is it just too late?
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.800]   Can you amend your return?
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.280]   What are your options there?
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.120]   - Great question.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.260]   So ultimately, take a look at Schedule D, page two,
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:30.720]   and if you see a loss on that page two at the top,
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:34.160]   and then a $3,000 number that flows up through Schedule 1,
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.800]   and then on the front page of the 1040,
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.620]   you'll see negative $3,000.
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.500]   If that number ain't there, you're right, Duncan,
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.160]   your buddy, something went wrong.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.640]   To answer your question directly, yes.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.040]   You can amend a tax return up to three years
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.600]   after the filing deadline.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.080]   And that means right now,
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.140]   tax year 2020 returns are up for amendment.
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.480]   But as you remember, it was all that COVID weirdness.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.040]   The amendment deadline is actually July.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:00.120]   July 15th, 2023 for tax returns filed in 2020.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.360]   So I would advise him to take a look.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.120]   - It seems obvious, but some people think
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.120]   I lost a ton of money last year.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.880]   It depends if you actually locked in those losses too.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.320]   It's not just a paper loss.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.280]   - Very good point.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.800]   - I think some people might misunderstand that,
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.940]   but it has to be something that you sold for a loss,
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:17.760]   not just you were down last year.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.920]   - Yeah, back to the question
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.720]   about CompHunter's interest in ETFs.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.380]   If that's in an IRA, it just keeps compounding, right?
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:25.520]   I mean, your gain just rolls into your account.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.160]   You don't have to realize any gains on it.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.520]   So yeah, Ben, I think that would be something to look at.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.920]   Duncan, get your friend a copy of his 2022 1040.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:33.880]   We'll take a look at it.
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.720]   - Cool.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.200]   - See, this is why we have our own Andy Dufresne
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.040]   on staff here.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:37.860]   - That's what I'm here for.
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:38.700]   - Exactly, yeah.
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.120]   - I'll see you at San Juantaneo.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.240]   I'm on vacation this week,
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.520]   so I am actually heading to the beach.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.160]   - Just waiting until how exciting this all gets
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.120]   when we start taxing and taking into account
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:50.080]   unrealized gains and losses, right?
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:50.920]   That's gonna be fun.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:51.800]   - Yeah, and that's the nightmare, right?
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:52.640]   And that's always the thing
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.040]   that gets thrown in my face on Twitter.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:56.480]   It's like, "What if the IRS taxes your Roth IRAs?"
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:01.200]   Well, okay, what if they start taxing my back tattoo, right?
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.240]   I mean, yeah, we could plan for anything.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.560]   - My comment this morning was,
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.200]   people in the finance world spend 95% of the time
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.980]   worrying about stuff that could happen 5% of the time.
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.280]   - Right, and what about--
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:11.500]   - Let's focus on what's actually happening,
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:12.340]   not what could happen.
[00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.160]   - I like that.
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.800]   - Focus on what drag queen Susie Orman's into.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.040]   - Go enjoy the beach.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:18.880]   - Thanks.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:19.700]   - Yeah. - Thanks, guys.
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:20.540]   - All right, remember, you can email us,
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:21.720]   askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.060]   But also, if you wanna send us a voice memo
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.140]   or a video from your phone, feel free to do that.

[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.420]   If you wanna personalize it a little more,
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:29.260]   if anyone wants. - We're gonna experiment
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:30.080]   with that, yeah.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:30.920]   - Yeah, if anyone wants to do that.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:31.760]   We were thinking about sending them a voicemail,
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.820]   but you can easily do a voicemail.
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.360]   Send us that, or send us a video of yourself,
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.200]   if you're willing.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.520]   Thanks to everyone in the live chat for showing up,
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.080]   especially Duncan's mom.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.320]   We always appreciate it.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.280]   - She did a great job.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.100]   - If you're listening in the podcast form.
