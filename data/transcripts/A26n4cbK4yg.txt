[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   "If I think I want to be on a beach in Thailand right now, well, why do I think that?
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.120]   What do I really want? What do I expect will happen when I get there?
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.400]   Why is it that I need a beach in Thailand? Could it be a beach anywhere?
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.280]   Is it just the quiet that I want?"
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:25.440]   You may keep asking yourself these questions and get to the actual answer, which is
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.680]   that "Yeah, my home is too noisy. I hate all the clamoring here. I live right above a train
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.280]   station or something, and it's too noisy in my home. Really, what I'm pursuing is the silence."
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.800]   "Well, do you need to go to Thailand to get silence? Is that the sustainable solution to that?"
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.200]   "No, maybe I need to soundproof my office."
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.360]   And you might come to like, "Yeah, actually, I don't need Thailand,
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.520]   but the money it would take to go to Thailand, I could soundproof my office.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.800]   And I really do like living here in Toronto or wherever it is.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.880]   And so, in fact, I'm going to stay here, not go to Thailand and soundproof my office.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.480]   Yes, that's what I really want."
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.760]   You know, so if you keep digging into yourself,
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.840]   you might come out with a solution that suits your problem better.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.200]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.680]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.920]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and today I'm talking to one of my favorite authors, Derek Sivers.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.520]   He has a seemingly unlimited arsenal of incredible life advice
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.200]   that comes from one of the most unconventional paths I've ever come across.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.600]   He started his career as a professional musician
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.240]   and ended up joining the circus for 10 years until he started CD Baby,
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.680]   which became the largest seller of independent music on the web
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.440]   in the early 2000s with over $100 million in sales.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.760]   In 2008, he sold the company, giving away most of the proceeds to charity,
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.120]   and has been focused on creating and learning ever since.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.520]   We're all fortunate for that path because of the amazing writing he's done since then.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.160]   So today, I'm going to try to give you a glimpse at that wisdom
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.640]   as it relates to decision-making, aligning your actions with your personal values,
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.920]   living a more satisfying and happy life, creating meaningful experiences, and a lot more.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.800]   We'll even talk about why Derek thinks traveling with children
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.760]   is easier than almost any other parent I've met.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.720]   It's a lot to cover, and I really hope you enjoy this episode.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.520]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:27.040]   Derek, thanks for being here.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.680]   Thanks, Chris.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.040]   From the outside looking in, when I read everything you write,
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.960]   I'm like, "This guy has it all figured out."
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.800]   And for every aspect of life, I'm always like, "Oh, there's probably a post Derek wrote.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.800]   I could just search up about this thing I'm trying to make a decision or be a better parent."
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.800]   Do you feel like you have everything figured out?
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.760]   I'm an explorer.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:55.680]   So at any given moment, I might have figured out right now,
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.960]   or I might have figured out yesterday's exploration and what I want to do about it,
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.920]   but then give it a few days and I'm off to somewhere new.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.560]   I want to make a bit of a theme of this because I think the average person listening
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.040]   isn't comfortable with that level of exploration in their life.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.280]   How do you get comfortable saying, "Well, maybe I don't have to have this job.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.120]   Maybe I don't have to live in this place,"
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.120]   and reframing it around what you want to do in the moment or what you should be doing?
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.280]   Is there a thing, maybe a happiness that you use to guide your exploration?
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:42.160]   Intellectual interest, but also I'm usually led by whatever it feels I'm lacking now.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:53.120]   This sounds weird to put that so bluntly, but say you might be living in the middle of a city
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.840]   and you're too hectic and you're too booked up and you've got too many things going on
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.640]   and you think, "If only I could go live in the middle of nowhere in the country,"
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.680]   and so you do that.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.280]   You make some changes in your life.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.160]   You make your job remote or whatever it may be,
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.880]   and then you move off to the middle of nowhere and you get there and you go, "I've done it,"
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.560]   and after a week or a month you go, "Yeah, I miss a little commotion,"
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.600]   so you start pursuing something to put a little commotion back in your life.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.600]   I think we're often driven by what we feel that we're lacking right now,
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.640]   and so I do that too.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.760]   It's like the pendulum swinging.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.880]   The pendulum goes too far off to one end and it kind of goes,
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.840]   "Oh, I wish I had a little gravity bringing me back to the center,"
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.080]   and so the pendulum swings back to the center,
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.080]   but then it keeps swinging to the other end and it goes,
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.680]   "Oh, yeah, I wish I had something bringing me back there again,"
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.240]   so that's probably driving a lot of my pursuits,
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:03.760]   but let's say that combined with the intellectual curiosity drives to just try something new.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.120]   - Now, if we rewind, you said the person living in the city feels overwhelmed,
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.760]   so they move to the middle of nowhere.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.440]   I imagine that most of those people are actually not going to do the move.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.640]   I think most of the people probably get stuck in a situation
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.960]   saying, "I'm living in the city. Everything's overwhelming,
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.800]   and wouldn't it be nice to go just disconnect for a month,
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.440]   but I just can't do that,"
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.360]   so I want to rewind to that narrative and say,
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.080]   how have you been the kind of person that's been able to do that
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.000]   when so many people six months later are still saying,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.480]   "I'm still in the city. I'm still overwhelmed.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.720]   I'm still frustrated in my job."
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.240]   Is there some thing that you've unlocked that allows you to do what so many people can't?
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.640]   - I think I've always, always pursued that, even since I was a teenager.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.920]   Now, hold on. You said one key thing in there.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.520]   You said three months later or six months later.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.040]   It might take a couple years.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.680]   When I was 25, I was a touring musician playing the college market in the Northeast,
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.600]   and I decided to move to Woodstock, New York.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.640]   I did it, actually, like the little scenario I just described.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.920]   I'd had enough of New York City.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.280]   I'd been living right in the middle of New York City for five years, six years,
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.240]   and I was just like, "I've had enough. I want to move to Woodstock, New York.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.400]   I think that's my place," and so I just did it.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.240]   I just drove up there one day.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.480]   I went straight to the Century 21 real estate office, and I said, "Show me what you got.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.360]   I want to live here now," and she showed me something,
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.400]   and I was like, "I could afford it," so I said, "Okay, I'll take it,"
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:59.520]   and got rid of my life in Queens, New York, and moved to Woodstock, New York.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.680]   About a month later, I was at a gig in Rhode Island somewhere,
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:13.600]   and Renee, this redhead who had hired me for the gig, I had known her from before.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.640]   She had hired me two years earlier, and she said, "Oh, my God, good to see you again.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.280]   How's it going?"
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:26.640]   and I said, "Well, I just moved to Woodstock," and she goes, "Get out. No way. Derek,
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:32.400]   oh, my God, that's amazing," and I said, "What? Why are you?"
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.840]   She's like, "Derek, don't you remember? You told me this."
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.400]   I said, "No, I just moved last week."
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.320]   She goes, "Yeah, two years ago, you told me you wanted to move to Woodstock."
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:48.080]   I said, "I did? I don't even remember wanting to move there two years ago."
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.920]   She goes, "Yeah, oh, my God, two years ago, you told me you wanted to move to Woodstock.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.280]   You did it. That's amazing."
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.360]   I went, "Oh, wow. Wow. I guess I've been wanting this a long time."
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:05.040]   So sometimes I think it goes like that, that it might take a couple years for your
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.440]   intention to turn into reality.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:15.120]   Maybe just accepting that everything doesn't have to move as fast as we expect it to,
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.200]   especially in a professional setting.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:22.240]   I know you are well-known for saying that you try not to just give your first answer
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.880]   if someone asks you a question, not to just quick, immediately react.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:31.280]   I think maybe we live in a world where that's kind of not the way we default operate.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.320]   So if I'm overwhelmed and I feel like I need to move,
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.680]   I don't think, "How could I slowly transition my life to be able to move in a year or two?"
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.520]   I think, "Could I move tomorrow? No, I could never move."
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:51.920]   Okay. But there are some things in life where doing it tomorrow is the right choice.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:59.360]   So here's a more recent example, and I know this doesn't sound like a big deal, but
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:06.800]   I'm living here in New Zealand now, and I was missing social interactions.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:12.400]   New Zealand's quite isolated, and I used to attend a lot of conferences,
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.200]   like whether it was a TED conference or music conferences or tech conferences,
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.280]   and I kind of miss having a bunch of new random people in my life.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.480]   I kind of miss that thing where you'd go to a conference and meet like 50 people in two days.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:32.320]   And because I missed that, I was like, "I'm going to make that happen.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.840]   I'm going to go just do that myself."
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:41.200]   So I booked a trip to India, specifically Chennai and Bangalore,
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.280]   two cities where I know there are a lot of people in my database that I've never met face-to-face.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:50.080]   And I sent an email saying, "All right, I'm coming to Chennai and Bangalore for 10 days.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:50.720]   Who should I meet?"
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:57.040]   And used a little scheduling program, and I booked in like nine meetings per day
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:02.160]   with strangers for six days straight, met with about 55 people.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:09.040]   And I just got back a couple of days ago, and it was intense and wonderful.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.760]   And I came back and I was telling a friend about it.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.760]   And she said the same thing that you said.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:18.560]   I was like, "God, you just kind of have an idea, and then you just go make it happen.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.280]   That's amazing."
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.720]   And yeah, that was a sweet compliment from an old friend.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.680]   And it was kind of funny to hear you just say a version of that right now.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.920]   So I guess this is something like my moving to Woodstock example,
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.320]   that I think I've just made it a priority.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:39.520]   Also, maybe I've always kept my life quite light,
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:45.040]   meaning I try not to get into situations that bind me to a place.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.960]   I try not to own much stuff.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.720]   So it's just dead easy for me to move.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.880]   I can pack up my whole house and move in a day, you know?
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.720]   Yeah, I think I've just tried it.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.240]   That's just been a priority for me.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.520]   But that's not to say that everybody should be like that.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:10.160]   Some people get deep, deep joy out of having a home with their sofa that they love,
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.680]   and their piano, and their things.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.000]   And it would be hard for them to move.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.800]   But that's fine, because they get deep joy out of having that deep sense of home,
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.360]   and all of these belongings that belonged to their grandparents, and all of that.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.840]   So I'm not saying everybody should be nomadic.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.960]   But when you're asking, "How have I done that?"
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.240]   That's my answer.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.040]   But actually, I'll go back and say,
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.680]   what you did with India was something that I think some people might think,
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.760]   "Gosh, I really miss all these people.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.440]   I live in a place that's kind of remote.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.320]   I don't see a lot of people.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.560]   I'm pretty nomadic-capable, and I don't own a lot of things.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.160]   Maybe I should move somewhere."
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.320]   And you said, "No, maybe I'll just take a trip to get that kind of fix, if you will."
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:57.520]   So I want to go and talk a little bit about how you think about making decisions.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.200]   The decision in someone's mind might be,
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.360]   "Oh, I'm not able to do what I want.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.680]   Obviously, I need to move somewhere where I can have more of a balance,
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.280]   let the pendulum go back in the middle."
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.360]   And you said, "Well, maybe there's an alternative.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:16.000]   Maybe I could go get this deep, intense fix for 10 days that'll hopefully give you
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.680]   a little high of human interaction for a period to come and sustain you."
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.320]   When you approach decision-making, it sounds like you don't just look at,
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.440]   "What's the assumed default option of what I could do?"
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.200]   You try to really make sure you're casting a wide net at ways to experience things.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.240]   Yes.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.560]   You've written about this.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.080]   I can't remember the URL.
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:38.880]   I don't either right now.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:45.680]   But it's one of my favorite things, is to be reflective and ask yourself what you really want.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:50.640]   And not just limit yourself to a few options from what you see other people doing,
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:55.840]   but to really kind of dig deep and go, "Okay, what do I really want?"
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.760]   And why do I want that?
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.320]   What's the real point of that?
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.280]   So if I think I want to be on a beach in Thailand right now,
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.560]   well, why do I think that?
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.440]   What do I expect will happen when I get there?
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.760]   Why is it that I need a beach in Thailand?
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.880]   Could it be a beach anywhere?
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.680]   Is it just the quiet that I want?
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:23.920]   And you may keep asking yourself these questions and get to the actual answer, which is,
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:29.600]   "Yeah, my home is too noisy.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.880]   I hate all the clamoring here.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.200]   I live right above a train station or something, and it's too noisy in my home.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.320]   Really, what I'm pursuing is the silence."
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.120]   Well, do you need to go to Thailand to get silence?
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.840]   Is that the sustainable solution to that?
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.240]   "No, maybe I need to soundproof my office."
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.400]   And you might come to like, "Yeah, actually, I don't need Thailand.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:54.560]   But the money it would take to go to Thailand, I could soundproof my office.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.840]   And I really do like living here in Toronto or wherever it is.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:03.920]   And so, in fact, I'm going to stay here, not go to Thailand, and soundproof my office.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.520]   Yes, that's what I really want."
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.800]   You know, so if you keep digging into yourself,
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:15.360]   you might come out with a solution that suits your problem better.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.600]   Is there something you do, maybe it's natural for you, I have to assume it is,
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.280]   where someone asks you a question or you have an idea,
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:29.600]   and you're able to force yourself to pause and think before kind of going all in on this thing.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.960]   Someone says, "Oh, do you want to go here?"
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.960]   And you're like, "And my default is, do I want to do this thing or not?"
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.000]   Not, "Oh, what are these other options?"
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.760]   Someone asks a question, "My default is, do I know the answer or not?
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.400]   And if I think I know it, let's answer it right away."
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:49.440]   I don't have the natural instinct to pause and think before.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.680]   And I'm curious, is there something that you've trained yourself to do?
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.800]   Is it natural?
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:00.720]   Have you thought about how people who maybe don't have that instinct could adopt it?
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.280]   I think it would be beneficial to me, which is why I'm asking.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.120]   I journal like crazy.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.800]   I journal so much.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.400]   And unlike the other things where I say, "Hey, you know, not everybody has to do this.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.520]   Everybody has to do this.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.440]   Everybody should do this."
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:24.240]   It helps so much to pause.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:30.320]   And it doesn't even matter what pen, paper, text file, Google Docs, doesn't matter.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:39.680]   Something where you can stop every day and ask yourself these reflective questions.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.600]   Ask yourself questions like, "Why am I doing this?
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.200]   And what am I really after?
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.480]   What's the point of that?"
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.440]   And then you should doubt yourself.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.320]   You should doubt the answers you give yourself.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:59.360]   So even if you say, "Why do I want this?
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.280]   Because I've always wanted to go to Thailand."
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.680]   Challenge yourself, right?
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.000]   "Really?
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.840]   Have I always wanted to go to Thailand?
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.320]   Really?
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:06.800]   Always?
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.080]   Why do I think that Thailand is the answer?"
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.760]   Push back on your own answers.
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:17.360]   And it can take just an hour of your day.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.120]   And it is so, so useful to...
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:25.040]   And if you say that I don't have an hour in the day, well, the hell you don't.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.320]   Turn off other things and do this.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.520]   Because where it takes you makes all the difference in the world.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.760]   And are there prompts that you use?
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.840]   Or is it just whatever's happening in the day?
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.600]   Yeah, whatever's happening.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.360]   Yeah, they're not like generic prompts that I'm going to, you know,
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.160]   "Hey, everybody, write down these five questions to ask yourself every day."
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:46.880]   No, it's not like that.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.560]   It's just based on whatever your situation is in the moment.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:57.360]   Generally, I think use it to clarify your thinking and to think of other options.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.680]   Like you said, if you think you have no choice, you're always wrong.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.120]   There's always another choice.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.040]   If you think you've only got two choices, well, those aren't options.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.480]   That's a dilemma.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.600]   If you think you only have two choices, you still haven't thought enough.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.600]   You have to keep thinking of other options.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.320]   You know, you can always add some crazy ones in there.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:22.960]   Like, okay, option number three, I quit everything and join a monastery.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:28.320]   Okay, option number four, I go down to my local park and I lay on the bench and I don't leave.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.280]   I become homeless.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.600]   Okay, well, now you've added two more options that you don't like.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.600]   Okay, you can always keep going and then get more creative.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:42.160]   Do the brainstorming approach where you're deliberately thinking of out-of-the-box,
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.480]   crazy solutions for your situation.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.240]   But just keep going until you've got like 10 or 20 options.
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.720]   And many of my best ideas in life, the ones that I've been the happiest with,
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:18:00.960]   the choices I've made have come from this pushing myself to further solutions, right?
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.880]   It's like, it was actually like solution number 18 that got me the most excited.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.160]   And that's the one I pursued.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.600]   Is there an example of, I thought I was going to do this,
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.600]   and this new thing came out that I never was thinking about originally?
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.680]   Oof, yeah.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.160]   What's an example?
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.800]   Well, like actually that trip to India that I just took.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.040]   That was like, that came far down the list.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:32.240]   At first it was like, I think I need to go to the TED conference again,
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.760]   which I haven't been to in 10 years.
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.280]   Then I was like, well, I think I just need to go to any conference.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.440]   And then it was like, I think I need, what about a local
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.720]   class here in Wellington, New Zealand, where I live?
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:51.920]   Maybe I can find like a philosophy course here so I can meet other interesting people
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.320]   that are into this kind of stuff I'm into.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.080]   Um, and then it was like, oh, I could go traveling.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.200]   I could go travel Europe.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.040]   And, and I just kept going.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:07.600]   And then, yeah, way down the list was like, I could go to India.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.360]   That was like, oh, India.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.800]   Yes.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.640]   Oh my God, I haven't been to India in 12 years.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.560]   I know so many people in India.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.320]   And through a weird like thing that I married a woman from India.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.840]   I actually, I'm a citizen of India.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.160]   I have the legal right to live in India for the rest of my life.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.200]   I was like, ooh, see, this one works for me on many levels because
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.240]   this wouldn't just be a travel.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.200]   This wouldn't just be a trip.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.960]   This is like an investment into my future.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.880]   Like it's likely I will live there someday.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:39.040]   And so getting to know it better now, meeting people now would be an investment
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:43.920]   into future long-term friendships, not just a quick, you know, romp at a conference.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.920]   Um, so yeah, that came way down the list.
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.880]   And that's one example.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.280]   And I was, yeah, again, I just got back from this trip.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.480]   So it's on my mind right now.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:59.760]   But I met so many interesting people there and, uh, had so many fascinating conversations.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.520]   It was just what I needed.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.440]   And yeah, that, that solution did, did not come until I had really
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.720]   spent an hour in my journal thinking of different solutions.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.760]   I love it.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.280]   I'm going to propose for people who might be like me thinking, gosh, journaling.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.400]   I want to try, but I'm not sure what.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.880]   Take a, what I hear is take some decision you're thinking about making
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.240]   and maybe just spend an hour by yourself with a notebook, a pen, not a computer.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.920]   And just kind of think of different ways that you could have a different outcome.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.800]   Like brain, instead of journaling, I'm going to call it brainstorming.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.640]   Cause I think we might be more familiar with how to start doing that.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.440]   But at the end of the day, it's just writing things down and thinking about them.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.600]   So you can, you can call it whatever you want.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.440]   Um, but I like this idea.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:49.920]   Um, and so, I don't know, I'm, I'm not a disciplined, I'm not a disciplined journaling
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:54.080]   person, but I feel like I'm going to try to take your advice after this.
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.600]   And at least commit to it.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.160]   I'm not disciplined either about it.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.760]   It is absolutely not a discipline to me.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.880]   It's just sanity.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.200]   It's like, I've been doing this since I was a teenager and I'm 53 now.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:13.760]   So almost every day I hit some point where I need to clarify my thoughts on something.
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.240]   What might even be about somebody like somebody's
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:23.040]   pissed you off and you find that you're all upset and you need to kind of stop and clarify
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.320]   your thoughts instead of just sitting there and feeling angry and like, wait, why am I
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.200]   feeling angry?
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.160]   What's this really about?
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:36.640]   And so instead of just sitting there on your sofa stewing, it just like open your thing,
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:41.200]   whatever it is, your paper notebook, or your, in my case, I just use a plain text file.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.600]   I just open up a plain text file and I just start typing.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.840]   There's no discipline to it at all.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.680]   It's just like, what the hell?
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.960]   I am so angry right now.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.000]   Why am I angry?
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.600]   You know, because this person did that thing.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.320]   Well, so what?
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.360]   Why does that matter?
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.920]   Well, because this, and I'll just kind of have this dialogue with myself, like I said,
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.760]   like kind of challenging and pushing back.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.360]   I hear that.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:08.880]   I don't know much about this, but I've heard that this is similar to something called cognitive
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:17.920]   behavioral therapy, and it is known to be one of the few things that works for people
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.400]   with depression or anxiety or other major life problems.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.560]   Cognitive behavioral therapy works wonders.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.040]   I heard that a couple of times.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.360]   And when I just looked into what it is, it sounds like it's what I've been doing in my
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.720]   journal since I was a teenager.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:41.520]   So I could say it in my very undisciplined way that it's worked wonders for me.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:48.080]   And most of the major life decisions that I've made have come from that process.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:52.560]   It sounds a little bit also like rubber duck debugging.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.560]   I don't know if you're familiar as a way to make decisions.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.920]   Just, you know, I think you wrote a post about getting mentors advice without actually ever
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:02.720]   speaking with them.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.560]   Which we just tell the listeners quickly.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.280]   So the rubber ducking comes from first.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:14.320]   It's from back in the day when people had those big monitors, the big CRT monitors on
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.680]   their desktop computers that you can actually put something on top.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.280]   Yeah, where you could put things on top.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:25.840]   And so computer programmers started a habit of putting a little rubber duck on top of
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.880]   their monitor.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.120]   And whenever they were trying to get work through a programming problem where they're
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.920]   stuck, there's like, okay, tell the duck.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:40.240]   And so you'd say to the duck, like, like, like the reason I'm stuck is because I can't
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:40.720]   figure out this.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.560]   Well, then why can't you figure out that?
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:48.560]   Because what I'm trying to get is the instances table to match with the something table.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.840]   Well, why can't you do that?
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:53.520]   Because it's, and so, yeah, explain it to the rubber duck and it'll help you clarify
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.400]   your thoughts.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.800]   So that's definitely what I'm doing in my journal.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:08.320]   Then changing the subject, you said the mentors that, yeah, I often, when journaling, I'll
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.160]   ask myself, like, what would Seth Godin say?
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:19.200]   Like, he's a hero of mine and he's such a wise guy beyond his marketing that he talks
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:19.440]   about.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.560]   He's just wise in general.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.200]   Like his approach to life is very thoughtful and measured.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:31.440]   And he's a friend that I could call, but before calling him, I asked myself, if I were to
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.400]   call Seth right now, what would he probably say?
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.880]   Like, I know what he would say.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.680]   He would say this.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.480]   And I'd like write that.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:44.320]   And then that ends up helping me get to a good solution for myself without ever having
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.680]   to bother Seth Godin.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.480]   So, yeah, I wrote a post about that, like how to ask your mentors for help or something
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:50.800]   like that.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.960]   And I just basically described this process, like ask yourself what the mentors would say.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.000]   - Yeah, I love it.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.360]   I'll try to find all the links to everything we talk about, put it in the show notes so
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.160]   people can find it.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:06.720]   It's something, I met someone once and I offered to help them with a challenge.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.960]   And they said, no, no, no, I don't want your help yet.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.800]   I need to spend, I have a rule.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.960]   I try to spend 15 minutes at least on my own trying to solve something before I ask for
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.040]   anyone to spend their time to help me out.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:17.600]   Oh, wow.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:23.120]   This person is, to use one of your phrases, this person is saying, making it easy for
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.920]   me to say no on my own.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:31.760]   And so it's something I've tried to do in my own life is I feel like plenty of us are
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.320]   overwhelmed.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:37.520]   We have lots of stuff going on and we could talk in a bit about how to slow down and say
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.840]   no and only focus on the things you care about.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:45.200]   But one way that I can kind of contribute to the problem or relieving the problem is
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:49.360]   just trying not to ask everyone to help me out until I've tried to do some work on my
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:49.600]   own.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:55.920]   And my snarky reply to close friends and family members for years was always the let me Google
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:00.240]   that for you site if you've ever been there, which was someone text you and they're like,
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.640]   do you know a good Italian restaurant in Dallas?
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.120]   And I'm like, yeah, Italian restaurant.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.720]   Like you could just search for these things.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.800]   And I've never even been to Dallas.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:15.600]   And so now I'm hoping that the world will slowly adopt a practice of trying to do a
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:22.000]   little bit of homework before asking people because it's easy for me to text back my sister
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:22.480]   or my mom.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.880]   Hey, why don't you do a Google search before asking?
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:28.800]   It's much harder to text a stranger, a business acquaintance back and be like, hey, could
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.000]   you actually just try before emailing me?
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.400]   But there are a couple of things we talked about that I want to loop back to.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.960]   So it's gonna be a bit of a zigzag conversation.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.880]   Journaling allows you to come up with lots of options.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.040]   You talked about decision making.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.120]   If there's one option, it's not true.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.320]   If there's two, it's a dilemma.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.160]   But you want to get to a place where there's a lot.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.320]   One of the challenges I have, and I think a lot of people listening have, is actually
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.920]   on the other direction, which is getting into this analysis paralysis.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:03.920]   So a few weeks ago, I did an episode about insurance, and I went down this crazy rabbit
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:10.880]   hole of how do I get the best homeowners and auto and umbrella policies for my life, which
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.400]   led to, "Oh, there's all these carriers.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.000]   I should go get a quote from all of them.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.680]   And I should analyze all these details."
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:20.480]   And believe me, I did not have a dilemma or A or B.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:25.360]   It was like, there weren't enough letters in the alphabet to define the options that
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:25.920]   I had.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.760]   And then you're like, "Oh, well, if I go with this one, it's a little bit more expensive."
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:37.280]   But if our SUV breaks down, they guarantee that I could rent an SUV instead of just an
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:37.840]   economy car.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.760]   But this other one offers this other feature.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.840]   And for me, it was a struggle.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:46.240]   I searched to see if you'd written about this, because I was like, "Ah, I know someone who
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:46.960]   might have some advice."
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.160]   Then I tried to think about what would Derek say, and I couldn't really come up with it.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:54.160]   So I'll just ask you, what do you think going the other direction with decision making?
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:59.520]   How do people, or how would you suggest people think about making decisions when there are
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.600]   too many options and they're struggling?
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:14.560]   For me, one option usually leaps out as the one that makes me feel the best.
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:18.800]   And it's not always rational, and that's okay.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:27.600]   And then if it doesn't, I just pick one that seems to rationally work.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:37.920]   And then it's a mindset that picking anything is better than picking nothing, if it's something
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.280]   that you have to pick.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.280]   Okay, so wait, what do I mean by that?
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:47.680]   There's a great value in launching, for example.
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:53.200]   I've met some people that have been working on their book for so long without launching
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:29:00.000]   it, without calling it complete, that they're reaping none of the benefits of having the
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.240]   book out there in the public, right?
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:08.240]   So at some point with anything you're creating, whether it's a blog post or a decision, you
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:12.720]   realize, "All right, well, I just have to finish this thing.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.480]   I have to finish this choice.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.920]   I have to finish this article that I'm working on."
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:26.400]   And once you put great value onto finishing or deciding, then what you do is you just
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:33.360]   get into a different mindset about the benefit of putting it out there, the benefit of finishing.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:44.720]   Like, say, you can make any choice great just through just deciding to make the best of
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:44.960]   it.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:49.680]   Okay, but wait, sorry, that answer was a little mushy.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:56.000]   I think, can I take a stab at the answer that I think, I'm going to interpret what you said,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.760]   you tell me whether you want to go this path, but I want to, I have an idea of interpreting
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:05.440]   what you said, which I actually think would have made what I did much easier.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:13.120]   So I can turn your feedback into very concrete tactic, which was related to this insurance
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:17.680]   thing, I'm looking back and I'm thinking there were two moments where I could have done what
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.760]   you suggested that would have made it a lot faster, and I probably would have felt a lot
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.080]   better.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:28.000]   One was for some reason, and I can't really explain why, maybe it's the positive reviews,
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.480]   maybe it's the word of mouth, the consumer reports rating, just felt like USAA as an
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:36.080]   insurance carrier was where I kind of just wanted to end up.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.600]   You know, you're always like, every time I was about to hit the recalculate button, I
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.720]   was like, "Come on, just be really competitive so I could just be done with this."
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:47.920]   So one answer was, if you have that feeling, just own it and be like, "Yeah, it might be
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.680]   a little more expensive, let's move forward."
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.320]   That was one.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:56.400]   The alternative version, let's say you don't have that, is, well, right now, the problem
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:01.360]   was that we were using one carrier and they just couldn't continue to insure the house
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.000]   because the house had kind of appreciated and it wasn't a good fit.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.440]   So we needed to move carriers.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:11.120]   Instead of making it about the big decision of we have to have a new insurance carrier,
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.840]   so this is not a, "Do I need this or not?"
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:14.800]   We absolutely need this.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:20.480]   But instead of trying to find the best possible thing, I could have picked the first carrier
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:25.360]   that could do what we needed and put that policy into place, be done with the policy
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:31.760]   that I have now that I know is not good, and then decided, "Okay, is it worth continuing
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.600]   to evaluate the landscape?"
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.480]   Because what I was doing was I actually had two problems.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:42.720]   I have something that doesn't work and I need something that works, and I'm also interested
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.760]   in finding the best thing.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:50.960]   And because I was solving them both at the same time, I was actually delaying getting
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.040]   the thing in place that I needed to do more urgently.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.720]   And if I had just picked anything, it might have been more expensive, but I would have
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.880]   been done with problem A, and I probably could have said, "Is it really worth trying to
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.400]   solve problem B right now?"
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:07.600]   But when I put the two problems together, I made it seem like they were equally as important.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.640]   So if you could just pick something, decide whether you actually pick anything that is
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:17.120]   good, and then decide whether you want to go on the quest for great or go on to another
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.480]   quest for good in your life.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.360]   I don't know.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.600]   That's me trying to philosophize your feedback, but I could have completely butchered it.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.440]   No, you nailed it.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.240]   That was wonderful.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:32.320]   All right, Chris, I've got three topics you just brought up.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.680]   Okay.
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.120]   I'm going to name them first so we can remember to come back to them.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.560]   Number one, the coin toss.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:42.000]   Number two, the paradox of choice.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.320]   Number three, theory versus practice.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.200]   Okay, coin toss.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:56.000]   The reason to flip a coin when you're making a decision is not to let the heads or the
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.280]   tails actually decide it.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:01.680]   It's to notice how you feel when the coin is in the air.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:05.520]   Like you just said about USAA.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:10.880]   If you were to do the coin toss with USAA, you would have been like, "Oh, please land
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.600]   on USAA."
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.920]   And as soon as you notice that feeling in yourself, it's like, "Okay, I think I've
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.720]   just decided."
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.040]   It isn't actually the coin that decides.
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:23.360]   It's the pressure of that like, "Oh, God, here it comes.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.720]   Here's the final decision."
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:28.480]   And then you notice which one you're actually leaning towards.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.680]   Okay.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:33.200]   And that is to be valued because emotions matter.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:41.040]   I've sometimes chosen, say, like the more expensive internet service provider because
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.280]   I think they're more ethical or they're cooler.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:47.840]   And I just feel better about giving my money to that company, even though it's more
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.520]   expensive than the other choice.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:53.360]   I'm like thinking with the coin toss, I'm like, I want to create this rule around it
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:59.600]   where I have to commit to the decision of whatever lands on the coin toss unless I stop
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.720]   it midair and decide.
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:05.440]   So it's like, you know, I could flip the coin and if my gut says what it is, I can
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.120]   grab it out of midair and say, "Done.
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.400]   I don't have to abide by the rule.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.120]   I've decided."
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:14.400]   So I'm trying to find a fun way to kind of make the coin toss not something.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:21.440]   I wonder if it loses its value if you don't commit to it being a decider.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.920]   I just say, "Let's flip a coin and see how my gut feels."
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.880]   I feel like I might the first few times, maybe it'll work.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.440]   By the end, I'm like, "Oh, now I just know I'm just flipping a coin."
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:34.080]   And so I'm trying to think of ways to make the coin toss higher stakes.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:38.720]   So it forces that kind of deep-rooted gut instinct out faster.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.440]   It's a fun idea.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.480]   I disagree.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:44.000]   I think you should always go ultimately with the one that makes you feel the best.
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:48.720]   Like we, I think feelings, yeah, your emotions matter.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:49.440]   Your feelings matter.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.920]   You need to feel good about the choices you've made in life.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:58.080]   You can't find yourself working at a job and every day for eight hours a day going
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:01.520]   somewhere where you're like, "Yeah, it's the right choice."
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.680]   The coin said, "Here I am.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.640]   Damn it."
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:14.720]   So you've got to feel good about your choices, even if it maybe wasn't the right.
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:20.480]   You could add rational reasons later, but the feelings are harder to adapt.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.000]   Although, you know, sometimes it's the reverse.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.800]   Sometimes you make a choice because it's the right thing.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.360]   Okay, wait.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.640]   Okay, so Paradox of Choice.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:31.520]   There's a wonderful book about this thing.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:35.360]   You said that you were looking to my site to see if I'd written about this.
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:42.960]   You need to look to the book called Paradox of Choice by Barry Schwartz, S-C-H-W-A-R-T-Z.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:50.880]   Brilliant masterpiece of a book about exactly this, about having too many options and what
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.280]   do you do.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:36:00.400]   And the gist, if you had to narrow the book down to a few sentences, is that when we consider
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:08.960]   every option, we may technically make a better choice, but we will feel worse about it because
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.880]   we're too aware of all of the other choices we could have made.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:23.680]   So the advice, and let me pause to say the advice, which is coming from a PhD psychologist
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:31.360]   who has been studying the science of decision-making for many, many, many years, the advice, after
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:37.920]   all of his studies and research into the subject, is that we should choose to satisfice, not
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:38.960]   maximize.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:44.880]   He said people, when they're making decisions, are either satisficing or maximizing.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.080]   So maximizing is what you were just doing with the insurance where you dive deep down
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:54.800]   the rabbit hole and you look deeply into every option and you really kind of kill yourself
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:59.520]   over it and you maximize to make the best possible decision.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.240]   Satisficing is, in short, it's saying good enough.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.080]   It's like, I need a new insurance policy.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.640]   I'm going to give myself one hour to pick a new one.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.840]   You look at some options, you're like, okay, I'm picking this.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.320]   Good enough.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:19.680]   So what he said is that people who satisfy feel much better about the decision they make
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:24.800]   psychologically, the way our brains work.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:30.000]   We feel better when we just make a decision, stick with it, and don't try to make the best
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:30.800]   possible decision.
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:36.880]   What about people who love, like get intense joy out of that process?
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:41.600]   Because I think that's the crazy thing is when I was going through this, my wife was
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.960]   like, "You have a lot of stuff to do.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.200]   Why are you still researching insurance?"
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.080]   And I was like, "I don't know.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.120]   I built a new table.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.360]   I built a new comparison matrix."
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.960]   And I was loving it.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:55.600]   And what was going through my head wasn't the $500 a year I'd save.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:00.720]   And I don't even know if it was the joy of knowing I made the best outcome.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:07.120]   But I really just, you mentioned earlier, following your kind of intellectual curiosity.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:13.360]   And I was just generally very excited to understand the nuance of this whole space.
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:17.520]   I get a lot of joy knowing that someone could ask me about it.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.040]   I could give them a recommendation.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:23.680]   And I'm very jealous when someone says, "Hey, I'm thinking about this thing."
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.120]   And I'm like, "Oh, I did all this research.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:25.680]   This is what I said."
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:26.560]   And they're like, "Great, I'll do that."
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.000]   I'm like, "That's all you need?
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.920]   You just needed me to talk for one sentence and now you're done and you made a decision?"
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:35.680]   And I'm very jealous of those people, but I do enjoy it.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:40.640]   So it's not totally wasted time if you enjoy the process, fair?
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:42.480]   Yeah, see, it's funny.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:47.200]   You're talking about something different that I think was not included in that book,
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:52.880]   which is the benefit of kind of you taking one for the team in a way.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:57.200]   Like you doing the hard work so that others don't have to.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:04.160]   And getting like a deeper kind of community joy from how much you're sharing.
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:12.400]   Like, yeah, it's wonderful that people like you do all the hard work like that every now
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.160]   and then and dive down those rabbit holes.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.760]   So people like the rest of us can just say, "I need new..."
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:18.960]   Well, Chris already figured it out.
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.240]   So hold on, let me just see.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.600]   All right, Chris chose this.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:22.720]   All right, I'm just choosing that.
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.600]   There, problem done.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:27.280]   It's like, because you maximized, we can satisfy.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.200]   You know, we can say, "All right, I'll let him choose."
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:34.320]   I do that so many times in life with, say, what did you say?
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.160]   The best Italian restaurant in Dallas?
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.880]   That I'll just look.
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.400]   Okay, what did somebody else say?
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:45.120]   Oh, look, somebody's done an article about the seven best Italian restaurants in Dallas.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:45.760]   Which do they choose?
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.040]   All right, I'm just going to go to that one then.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.320]   Problem solved.
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:54.240]   When I moved to Los Angeles years ago, I'd never really been to Los Angeles.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:59.600]   But my girlfriend at the time had just signed up for film school down there.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.720]   I was like, "I'm going to go with her."
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:05.200]   So I emailed 10 people I knew that lived in LA.
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.560]   And I said, "Hey, what neighborhood should I live in?"
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.360]   And everybody had different answers.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:15.040]   But Santa Monica was on nine out of the 10 people's lists.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:19.760]   They'd say, "Oh, you know, Palisades, whatever, Pasadena, Santa Monica."
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:23.440]   Somebody else would say Venice, Santa Monica, Century City.
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.680]   But Santa Monica was on everybody's list.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.600]   So I didn't even look at any other options.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.440]   I just went straight to Santa Monica,
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.720]   went to the real estate office there and just said, "What do you got?"
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:37.520]   And I didn't look anywhere else because I deferred to my friend's choices.
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:40.720]   So yeah, other people did the hard work of living there for years
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.040]   and discovering every neighborhood and learning the hard way.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.280]   I just took the benefit of their work.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.680]   So yes, you diving down your rabbit hole
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:52.800]   and benefiting the rest of the world by doing so is great.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.800]   And I love just using other people's work for that.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.520]   But also you were having fun.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:02.560]   You say that you were sweating it, but part of you was just enjoying it.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.240]   You're like, "This is fascinating.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.000]   Oh my God, look at all these different options.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.120]   I'm going to make a grid.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:12.080]   This is giving me some kind of joy to lay out all my options in a spreadsheet
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:13.440]   and find out about this.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.960]   And wow, this is fascinating."
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:18.400]   This one won't give you an SUV replacement.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.840]   They'll just give you a car.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.880]   This one won't do this.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.560]   Wow, there are so many parameters here I hadn't noticed before.
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:27.360]   So computer programmers do this a lot, of course,
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:31.680]   when you're looking for a tech solution to something.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:35.840]   And you look out to the world of open source software and you're like,
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:42.400]   "Okay, oh my God, there are nine different calendar apps that I could use.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:46.160]   Okay, let me dive into the pros and cons of each one."
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:51.120]   And you might find this less popular one that serves your needs exactly.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:54.320]   But boy, it was kind of interesting to learn about all the different features
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.840]   that you hadn't even considered in these.
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:00.080]   And we might just enjoy that process.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:04.720]   And somebody might say it's a stupid use of your time,
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.800]   but if you're finding it fascinating,
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:12.000]   well, then you're kind of like choosing this over watching a movie, right?
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.960]   Like other people would just sit there and stare at a TV screen.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:19.760]   You're engaging with the world and getting entertainment out of doing this.
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:23.840]   And lastly, my example that I got made fun of a lot for was
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:30.160]   when I was running my company, CD Baby, for 10 years.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.560]   I was the 100% owner.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:33.680]   I was the CEO.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:39.600]   And yet, whenever we needed a new computer for the office,
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:40.960]   which happened about 50 times.
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.840]   I had 85 employees and we had about 50 computers in the office.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.560]   I would build the computer myself.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:50.240]   I would go down to the electronics store, get the motherboard,
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:53.520]   pick out the CPU, the graphics card, the hard drive,
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:58.560]   the case, the power supply.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:03.200]   And I would thoroughly enjoy being in the office at night
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:07.840]   after everybody had left, building a computer while listening to music.
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:11.280]   And once it was all put together, I would install Linux onto it and get it working.
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:15.360]   And then the morning I'd set it up for, you know, at somebody's desk.
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:17.760]   And like, ah, that was fun.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:22.480]   And somebody teased me years later, saying sarcastically, like,
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:25.440]   yeah, that was a good use of the CEO's time.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:28.000]   And I said, it fucking was.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.360]   It was a great use of my time because I loved doing it.
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:35.120]   Like, I wouldn't want to outsource that joy to somebody else.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:38.960]   Like, I really loved those evenings at the office, putting a computer together.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.160]   I find it very peaceful.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:43.920]   Some people do crossword puzzles for that same joy, right?
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:48.400]   You don't outsource the crossword puzzle to have somebody else solve it for you.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:49.920]   You do it yourself because you enjoy it.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:54.000]   Yeah, I think I think it's a message that we probably haven't
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.880]   shared enough in this show is that if you really enjoy that process,
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.000]   sometimes it's stressful.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.760]   Don't you know, I've had moments where I'm like
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:08.400]   an hour into comparing the distribution of one to five ratings on Korean restaurants in L.A.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:11.440]   And like, they're all going to like anyone I could have just picked.
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.520]   I should have stopped and flipped a coin.
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.320]   It wouldn't have mattered.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.800]   And sometimes I think it's too much.
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.720]   But there are times where it's really enjoyable.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:22.160]   And even when it's a lot, it can be fun.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:27.360]   And I like the fact that you've been able to prioritize pursuing things that make you happy
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:30.480]   and that you enjoy and stimulate you intellectually.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.720]   And I think we probably don't do that enough as an average person in society.
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:36.640]   Hey, wait, Chris.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:40.080]   So remember when I named those three things, the coin toss, the paradox of choice?
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.200]   There was a third one.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.640]   Theory versus practice.
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.080]   We haven't done that yet.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:52.160]   So many times I've found myself in my journal thinking, maybe this, maybe that.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:59.600]   And you realize there's so many things in life that in theory sound good,
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:03.200]   but in practice are not or vice versa.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:06.960]   And so I've learned the hard way that you have to just try these things.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.880]   You have to just go do it.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:12.560]   And it even comes with choices like yours about insurance.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.760]   Like I'm really glad that you gave that example of like,
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:20.320]   maybe I'll just pick one now just to get out of my situation.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:24.720]   And then if I don't like it, I'll change again.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.440]   That to me is a beautiful little example of
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.640]   trying something in practice instead of just in theory.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:38.640]   So there have been major life decisions I've made, like moving here to New Zealand.
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.560]   That came from this similar kind of dilemma.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:45.920]   I was sitting in Singapore with my ex who said, I hate it here.
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:49.760]   And I was like, okay, so where else can we go?
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:50.640]   New Zealand seems nice.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:54.240]   We've never actually lived there, but it seems like a nice place to be.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.520]   Like, let's try it.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:00.160]   Like, we'll never know what New Zealand is like unless we just try it.
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:03.360]   And it took a few months of paperwork to become a resident
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.160]   in order to stay long enough to really try living here.
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:09.760]   But you have to do these things in practice,
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:12.400]   not just in theory, just to see what it's really like.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:15.600]   With the understanding that I'm still just trying it.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:17.920]   This isn't like a final, final decision.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:20.480]   This is still just, I'm going to try this option,
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:24.720]   but I need to try it in practice, not just in theory.
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.720]   Has that changed?
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.200]   You talk about moving and living different places.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:31.120]   You have a family or you have a child.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:36.080]   How does that affect your ability to live this kind of nomadic lifestyle
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:39.840]   or put these theories into practice or has it not?
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:43.520]   We let the tangent go earlier.
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.800]   But you said something about, you know,
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:48.960]   the fact that I went to India for only 10 days instead of deciding to move there.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:54.000]   Dude, if my kid wasn't in school in New Zealand right now,
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.280]   and if his mother didn't work for the New Zealand government and needs to be here,
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.360]   I would be living in India right now.
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.680]   I loved that trip so much.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:03.680]   I just wanted to cancel my return flight home.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:06.080]   I met so many wonderful people there.
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:08.240]   It was one of those moments in my life,
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:11.040]   and I've had a few of these, where you go somewhere
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:14.720]   and it's just like everything in you is just a yes.
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.040]   You're like, oh my God, yes, this is where I need to be.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.240]   And so a few times in my life, I've done this,
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:24.560]   where I just was visiting somewhere and I just canceled my return flight and stayed.
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.520]   I was living in Santa Monica, California,
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:32.560]   when I went to New York City for a friend's wedding.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.400]   And it was a three-day trip.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.800]   And I went there with just basically, you know,
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:39.040]   three days of clothes, attended the wedding.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:42.720]   But just something about, like, getting out of the train in Penn Station
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.640]   and walking out into Manhattan and being like,
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.000]   "Rrrr, the energy of the place."
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.440]   I was just like, "Oh, hell yeah, this is what I need right now."
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:52.960]   I was like, I could fly back to Santa Monica to get my clothes,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.720]   but that would put a lot of pollution into the air.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:59.680]   And I think my clothes aren't even worth that much.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.880]   So I just canceled my return flight and bought some new clothes and stayed.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.240]   And I lived in New York for a year.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.840]   And so, yeah, I just had that moment last week in India of just like,
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:11.520]   "Damn, I just want to stay here. This is where I need to be now."
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.880]   But yeah, I've got a kid who's 11 and in school now,
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:18.560]   and his mom works for the government and here we are.
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:23.840]   So instead, I'm just going to use that restriction in my life,
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.560]   that creative restriction to work within that.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.000]   So I'll just go visit more often.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.280]   So I want to come back to parenting at some point.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.720]   I have a lot of these tangents.
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:34.320]   You said something earlier about heroes,
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:37.920]   and I know you have some perspective on how thinking about heroes
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:40.560]   can be valuable to thinking about what you want to do.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:43.360]   Maybe we could touch on that a little,
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:46.000]   because I think it kind of ties together.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.160]   Who are we? What do we care about?
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:51.920]   What do we want to do with our lives and our careers?
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:55.040]   How do you think about that?
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:58.960]   I mean, you're in a place where you've both had success.
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:02.880]   It's given you a lot of creative flexibility with work and life and where you live.
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:05.120]   Maybe not everyone has that.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:06.720]   Maybe people need to work towards that.
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:10.960]   But you've been fortunate to find the thing you love doing.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.880]   And I don't think it was the thing you always thought.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:15.440]   You've said that you feel like you most associate with a writer.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.080]   Now, but I don't think it started like that.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:20.880]   You didn't know that for many years.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.320]   How did you come to that?
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:26.880]   And how might you have come to that sooner with the wisdom you have now?
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:27.440]   Well, it's funny.
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:32.240]   People sometimes say, "Oh, well, dude, you're lucky.
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.520]   You can just get up and go."
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:35.760]   I'm like, but that's not luck.
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:39.280]   That was the life I'm living is the culmination
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:44.640]   of like 180 little decisions along the way since I was a teenager.
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:49.440]   Like at every little point, starting from when I was like 17 years old,
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:53.280]   I over and over again made the choice that gave me more freedom
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:55.760]   because I knew this was important to me.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:50:00.400]   So even if I was, say, like offered a job that was going to pay more,
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:08.560]   but give me less freedom, I said, "No, I chose the choice with more freedom,
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:10.000]   even though it paid less money.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:18.160]   I chose the romantic partner that also wanted to travel the world
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:21.360]   instead of getting romantically tangled with somebody
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:24.080]   who is bound to living next door to her parents.
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:29.360]   I chose the, even when I set up my company,
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.840]   the way that I set up like the organization and how it was run.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:34.400]   I chose the choice that would give me more freedom.
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:38.560]   And God, so many things, even like when I decided to sell my company,
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:44.800]   my number one criteria was like, "This is going to be a cash sale.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.560]   You're going to pay me for this, and then I'm gone.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:47.840]   I'm not going to consult with you.
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:51.760]   I'm not going to stay around because I want the freedom."
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:58.640]   Everything along the way, every choice I made was to get me to this point.
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:01.600]   And so when somebody goes like, "Oh, you're just lucky."
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:04.960]   I'm like, "No, this was very deliberate."
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.360]   In fact, let's rewind even further.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:18.560]   A friend gave me a really good example of this when he said he doesn't believe in luck.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:25.200]   And I said, "Yeah, says the guy that was lucky to be born in a first world country
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.480]   because he was born in America."
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:29.600]   I said, "Yeah, easy for the American to say he doesn't believe in luck, right?
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.200]   Tell that to somebody in South Sudan."
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:33.680]   And he's just like, "Dude," he said,
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:41.440]   "I was born in America because my grandparents left everything they know in Poland
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:47.680]   and got on a ship for four months and sailed all the way to this country where they didn't
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:48.880]   speak the language.
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:52.160]   And it was incredibly hard, but they did it because they felt that that would give their
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.080]   children a better future.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:52:02.240]   And then even their children were like, you know, children of Polish immigrants that lived
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.360]   in a bad neighborhood.
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:11.120]   But worked really hard to save their money and spend nothing on pleasures so that they
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.400]   could save it for their kids.
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:19.920]   And then, yes, I grew up in Chicago or whatever with a nice life, but it took two generations."
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:23.040]   He said, "So I think that's insulting to call that luck."
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:31.680]   He said, "My nice life is the result of like, you know, 80 years of sacrifice."
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:34.800]   And I was like, "OK, all right, very good point."
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:40.800]   You know, so I still believe in luck like crazy.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:50.240]   I still think that most of my success was luck, but a lot of little decisions that you
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:55.920]   make on a day-to-day level can have huge impacts on the direction of the rest of your life.
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:59.200]   Sorry, I think I got off on that.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:04.080]   No, I mean, you knew freedom was something you wanted to optimize for over years.
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:08.720]   I meet lots of people that maybe don't know that thing.
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.800]   You know, the job comes, it offers to pay them more.
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.480]   It doesn't have the flexibility to travel.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.720]   They don't know what they want in life.
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:20.560]   Is the answer to always optimize for freedom because it gives you more options in the future?
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:26.480]   Or is there a time where more financial resources can add more value?
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:33.040]   Or is there a framework you have for thinking about what do I want right now in my life?
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:33.920]   What do I look up to?
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:35.360]   Who do I want to be?
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:36.320]   Right.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:41.280]   Like we said at the very beginning, sometimes you need to ask yourself, "What is my life
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.160]   lacking right now?"
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:45.760]   And I need to steer that direction to get my balance back.
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:55.120]   But more often it helps to look at the common thread in your life so far.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:02.400]   Like your life choices so far, in reality, what has been something that through all the
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.160]   choices has made you the happiest?
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:07.440]   And maybe it's money.
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:16.240]   Maybe it's choosing the option that binds you tighter to people.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:21.520]   Like maybe you're one of those lucky people that at the age of 19 found the love of your
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:28.240]   life and ever since then, like your friends had crazy dating adventures, but you've been
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:31.120]   happy to be with one person since the age of 19.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:37.120]   And you know that that like, that's given you such a deep happiness in life that can't
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:41.120]   compare to all these little digital nomads bragging about their freedom.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.640]   And they're just like, "Yeah, but guess what?
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.080]   I've got something better than that."
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:49.840]   You know, you need to just look back at your life to notice what's made, what continuously
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:54.880]   makes you the happiest and use that when making your future decisions as well.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:55:01.840]   So yeah, maybe for me, it was freedom, but for somebody else, it might be money.
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:03.040]   They might say, "You know what?
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:09.920]   The kind of life I want, I really want a swimming pool and I really want a Ferrari and I really
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.840]   want three houses."
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:17.920]   It's like, all right, then you, for what you really want, especially if that's in practice,
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:23.760]   not just in theory, if you've actually rented a Ferrari for a week and you know that owning
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:28.240]   that Ferrari will make you so much happier, if you know that in practice, not just in
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:32.960]   theory, then all right, you know, this is going to help shape your decisions that you
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:38.160]   need to go for the option that pays more versus the freedom option.
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:43.920]   You shouldn't be a digital nomad if a Ferrari is super important to you because it's harder
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:48.560]   to bring that Ferrari to Thailand and Columbia.
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:53.440]   So no, I think it's not everybody should choose what I've chosen.
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:54.800]   That would be stupid.
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:56:00.080]   You should choose what you've noticed in practice makes you the happiest.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:06.960]   Yeah, and I think for anyone who doesn't know Derek's full story, you had the option when
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:11.040]   you sold your company to take all the money and live the life of Ferraris and swimming
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:16.800]   pools and wanted to kind of take that off the table as a future path that you could
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.040]   even be tempted by and gave it all away.
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:24.160]   So I thought that was kind of an ultimate hack in my mind of, you know, you didn't want
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:29.600]   the chance to ever be kind of turned towards a life that you weren't actually interested
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:29.760]   in.
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:31.040]   You just gave it away.
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:38.320]   Yeah, I just, I noticed from the past that I'm, I'm, I knew that that choice would make
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:38.880]   me happier.
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:41.760]   It was really obvious when I was looking at all the different options of what to do when
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:42.640]   selling my company.
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:49.920]   And when I looked at the option of giving the money away, but in a way where I do continue
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:55.680]   to get a trickle paid out to me for the rest of my life, that, that option made me way
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:57.920]   happier because that made it.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:01.760]   So I couldn't get into this scenario where I had $20 million just sitting in a bank to
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:02.720]   do something stupid with.
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:03.920]   I didn't want that option.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:10.640]   I knew that that option would make me unhappy because that's too much money, but you know,
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:14.000]   having half a million in the bank, that makes me happy.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:14.960]   That gives me freedom.
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:17.920]   But that's not too much.
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:19.200]   It's not stupid money.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.560]   It's just very nice.
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:24.320]   And you mentioned to look back at, at who you've been and what you've done.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:29.360]   There's something that I took away from you that I think has been really valuable is not
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:33.600]   just looking at the thoughts and the opinions you've had, but what you've done, like looking
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:38.640]   at your actual actions and that, you know, you've said, I think that your actions actually
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:39.920]   reveal your values.
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:44.560]   So, so maybe, maybe we could talk about this just for a minute is, you know, it's interesting.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:48.480]   Some people I know say, I'm the person that does this, but if you're not actually doing
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:50.480]   it, are you really that person?
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:50.980]   Right.
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:53.440]   God, thanks for, you know, it's funny.
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:55.920]   I need to read that post again.
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:57.600]   I had almost forgotten about that one.
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:59.680]   I'll tell the little tale quickly.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:09.360]   The article is at S-I-V-E dot R-S slash A-R-V, A-R-V meaning actions reveal values.
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:13.440]   So I remember that short URL I gave it and I should revisit it now.
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:14.080]   Almost forgotten.
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:24.000]   So the story is, I was talking to an old friend of mine and I had been putting off starting
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   this company called Muckwork.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:32.160]   I had this idea, like literally the day after I sold Seedy Baby, I had this idea for my
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:38.880]   next company called Muckwork and I got four months into it and then I paused to go explore
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:39.680]   the world instead.
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:45.680]   And here we are 10 years later and I said to my friend, I really want to do Muckwork.
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:47.280]   I really want to make this happen.
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:49.520]   And my friend goes, no, you don't.
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:52.560]   What do you mean?
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:53.280]   No, I don't.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:53.920]   I'm telling you.
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:54.480]   Yes, I do.
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:55.520]   And he goes, no, you don't.
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:58.080]   I said, dude, you can't just tell me I don't.
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:00.160]   I'm telling you, I really want to do this.
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:01.680]   And he said, no, you don't.
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:02.800]   You don't really want to do this.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:05.520]   If you really wanted to do this, you would have made it happen right now.
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:11.680]   He said, you keep putting it off, which to me makes it clear that you don't really want
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:14.480]   this thing because otherwise you would have just done it.
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:16.320]   You wouldn't be saying I want to do it.
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:18.160]   You would do it if you really wanted to do it.
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:20.320]   Oh, wow.
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:22.960]   He said, yeah, your actions reveal your values.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:28.960]   And that's been so, so useful to me.
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:29.440]   Wow.
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:33.680]   Yeah, actually, Chris, thanks for bringing this up, because that is kind of in theory
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:34.800]   versus in practice.
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:39.440]   Revealed, put into action, right?
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:42.560]   It's don't think about what you want in theory.
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:48.000]   Look at what you've chosen in the past or look at what your actions have revealed your
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:48.720]   values to be.
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:52.640]   Yeah, I've been ever since I read that post, I've just been reflecting it.
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.240]   I've been sharing it with people.
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:56.640]   Someone I talked to was like, I really want to lose weight.
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:58.640]   I really have wanted to lose weight for the last two years.
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.640]   I'm like, do you know how?
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.320]   And they're like, yeah, I know I need to exercise.
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:06.640]   And it's like, well, I don't think you really want to, which is fine.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.000]   I'm not trying to cast judgment.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.160]   I'm just saying, you know how to do something.
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.280]   You say you really want to do it.
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.160]   You haven't done it.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.200]   Maybe you don't want to do it.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:13.840]   And that's OK.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:18.080]   And so it's made me reflect on my own life.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:21.840]   Oh, if I say I really want to do this, I should either do it or stop saying it.
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:25.440]   Like, there's no point in continuing to say you want to do something if you're not
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:26.240]   willing to do it.
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:32.000]   And and that simple phrase of, you know, your actions revealing your values has made it
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.800]   easy for me to make one of two decisions either.
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.000]   Yes, let's do it or let's stop.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.720]   And let's not not kind of put it at the top of the priority list and just continue to
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:43.280]   push it down.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.360]   So that's been really helpful.
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:45.680]   Thank you.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:52.400]   Yeah, you know, I'm just thinking about how you could use that to do tests of something
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.280]   you think you want.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:56.640]   See if you actually want it in practice.
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.120]   Like if somebody says, I really want to lose weight, it's like, all right, well, let's
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:07.040]   spend at least one week where you eat nothing but protein twice a day and that's all you
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:07.360]   eat.
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:09.760]   You know, let's make sure that that's what you really want.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.960]   Or I really want a Ferrari.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:19.520]   OK, well, rent one, rent one for a week and see if it really makes you so much happier
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:25.600]   or I want to be a minimalist like, all right, well, leave everything behind and go spend
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:34.400]   a year living in Lithuania with nothing and see if you like it in practice, not just in
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.120]   theory.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:38.560]   And yeah, you got to try these things.
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.640]   And it's sometimes it reveals itself to be a lot easier.
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.840]   So thinking about.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:49.040]   It's really hard starting this podcast for me was one where I was like, I always wanted
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:54.320]   to do something, I tried to blog, I tried a newsletter and I never really found the
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:54.960]   thing.
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:02:01.120]   And once I put the podcast out, there's oh, it's actually it's not as hard as I had
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:01.680]   thought.
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:06.400]   So but it wasn't until I realized that if I didn't do it, then I didn't really want to
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.280]   do it in the first place.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.600]   So why not just force yourself to try and say, oh, it's actually, you know, I'm more
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:16.240]   capable of doing this, it's easier, it's, you know, so for me, I think it's just that
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:19.680]   framework has helped make it easier for me to do things that probably would have been
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:23.200]   harder before thinking that with that perspective.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:30.320]   And then I think there are two things that are to come back to on parenting and travel.
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:35.600]   But there's one, there's two things that we haven't hit on that I think are really
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.240]   important lessons.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:41.040]   One, you've written an entire book that I would encourage people to read about, you
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:43.040]   know, when when to say yes and no.
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:46.720]   And I think someone might look at the title, which is hell, yeah, or no and say, oh, you
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:50.560]   should always either be fervently excited or say no to everything.
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:54.800]   I actually know that your perspective is, it really depends on where you are in life.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:03:01.520]   And if you are very overwhelmed with things, a philosophy of hell, yeah, now, or no, is
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.160]   great.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:05.680]   But if you're earlier in your career, maybe you just say yes to everything.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:09.680]   And I've written posts in the past about earlier in my career, why saying yes is just
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:14.160]   this magical thing that opens all these doors and lets you have new experiences.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:19.680]   Is there is there any kind of clarifying things you want to say on the on the kind of
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:25.280]   spectrum of say no to lots of things versus say yes to everything that might help people
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.120]   overwhelmed right now?
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:30.320]   I'm really glad that you said that.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:36.080]   In fact, you might be the first person that's ever introduced that book by also giving that
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:37.440]   clarifier right away.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.320]   Because, yeah, you're right.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.400]   Almost everybody looks at that and says, yeah, man, hell yeah, I know.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.640]   I'm just going to follow that from now on.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:47.840]   And I get these emails from people that are like straight out of college going, yeah,
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.040]   thanks for saying that, man.
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:52.720]   I'm just saying no to everything I don't feel hell yeah about.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:53.760]   I'm like, wait a second.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:54.320]   Hold on.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:58.400]   Like it's it's a tool for a specific situation.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:01.520]   You know, it's in the toolbox.
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:07.040]   It's that really unique wrench in case you need to get into the hole and do a Phillips
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:07.600]   head screw.
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:18.240]   Um, in general, I think it's better to switch strategies for your correct situation.
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:24.880]   So, yeah, straight out of college or if you're young and you're safe, you're you want more
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.480]   opportunities than you have right now.
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.880]   You want more success than you have right now.
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:33.280]   Um, yeah, very often the best solution is to go say yes to everything.
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:37.040]   Go like take on as much as you can take on.
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:37.840]   Try it all.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:44.720]   Overcommit yourself and say yes to everything because it's a little bit like lottery tickets,
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:44.960]   right?
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:52.000]   Like you never know which of these 12 things you're doing at once is going to reward you.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:59.360]   And then when one of those 12 things you're doing simultaneously rewards you, then you
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.880]   can like double down on that.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:05.360]   Get rid of the other 11 and throw everything you've got into this one thing.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:12.880]   And then if like that's when you should raise the bar because hell, yeah, I know basically
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:17.280]   just means that it just means raise the bar all the way for what you'll accept.
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:22.400]   So you want to do that if you're overwhelmed with opportunities and everybody wants a piece
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:28.640]   of you and you've got so much success coming your way, then that's when you need hell,
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:29.360]   yeah, or no.
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:34.640]   As a reminder to raise the bar, uh, to let go of these other options because you've got
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:37.200]   so much going on, um, so yeah.
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:42.640]   So thanks for mentioning that, uh, that it's the very first sentence of the article, but
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.000]   it often gets lost in that point.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.520]   It could also apply to just so much going on in life, right?
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:54.640]   You have two young kids, you have a job, you have a family and you kind of never, it wasn't
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:57.280]   that there were new business opportunities or financial opportunities.
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:02.000]   It's just life got so busy that to maintain sanity, you have to raise the bar.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.600]   And I found that as a, you know, 20 something single person, you know, people say, Hey,
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:08.400]   you want to go to this thing?
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.360]   Yeah, I want to go to this thing.
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:10.400]   Yeah, I want to do this.
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.360]   It's easy.
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:17.440]   And then now, you know, we have two kids, we can't, my wife and I can't go out to every
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:17.760]   dinner.
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:19.600]   We can't go to every concert.
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:25.360]   Some of our friends without children are like, Oh, do you guys want to go to, you know, Belize
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.000]   for the weekend?
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.040]   We're like, no, that's not a thing we can just do on a whim.
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:33.040]   Uh, and we've created an intentional life that we're happy with, but it just means we
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:34.000]   can't do those things.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.760]   And so I think right now, this year is a little bit more of the year of the hell yeah or no
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.360]   than the say yes to everything.
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:44.240]   But it's not necessarily because of opportunity.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:47.440]   It's just because the overwhelming nature of life with young children.
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:48.560]   Yeah.
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:54.160]   And thanks for mentioning that because I, sometimes I think in terms of like business
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.880]   career choices with hell yeah or no, but you're right.
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:04.640]   It's when you've got a kid, um, that's a, you've, that's a big, big, like that's your
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.160]   hell yeah, or your kids.
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:12.640]   Um, and so that helps you say no to everything else and it helps to remember that you'd be
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:20.640]   better off putting more attention into your kids instead of spreading yourself thin with
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.000]   other things like that.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:28.640]   In fact, that's sorry, I, I feel like I've unfairly mentioned moving too much in this
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:37.360]   conversation, but I was living in Singapore when my kid was born and Singapore is a very
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:41.360]   exciting, distracted place or distracting place.
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.200]   Um, I knew a lot of people there.
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:44.320]   I was super social there.
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.160]   There's so much going on.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:50.160]   And even its location within Asia, it's just a short hop to so many interesting places.
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:56.560]   And I noticed that the first few months of my kid's life, um, I was too distracted and
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:57.920]   I was being pulled different directions.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:05.200]   So a big part of the choice to move to the middle of nowhere in New Zealand was to create
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:12.560]   an environment where I've just by a side effect of my location, I've said no to everything
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:13.120]   else.
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:18.880]   So from age for my kid, from age zero to 10, uh, here in New Zealand, I was basically a
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:19.760]   full-time dad.
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:26.800]   I was in the middle of an Island in the Pacific ocean, uh, where just everything else in life
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:31.200]   became a no, uh, because I'm just, I'm here with my kid and this is my hell.
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:31.700]   Yeah.
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:37.200]   So I want to get to children, but I have one quick question, which is, can you talk about
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:37.680]   the same?
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:42.160]   No part, because I think it's very easy for a lot of people to say, this is the hell.
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:42.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.040]   Thing.
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:45.920]   And then they get an email from someone's like, Hey, I'd love to pick your brain about
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:46.480]   this thing.
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:48.320]   Uh, you know, do you want to grab a coffee?
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:54.480]   And I think saying no is something people find very hard and they almost feel like I'm
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:58.640]   going to look bad by saying no, it's going to make me, you know, people are going to
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:59.600]   think that I don't care.
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:03.840]   And you've said a few things that have given me perspective there.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:08.080]   And so that I think it would just be helpful for people to understand why saying no might
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:12.160]   be, you know, in some weird way, polite or, or, or a better way to do it.
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:20.800]   My number one tip is write a form letter, take 20 minutes and write a very nice generic.
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:23.360]   Uh, no.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:28.720]   With a little elaboration, like, Hey, I'm so sorry.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:31.760]   I'm completely focused on what I'm doing right now.
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:36.480]   Uh, my new book isn't finished yet and I need to put everything I've got into finishing
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:36.720]   this.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:42.400]   I hope you'll understand, uh, this isn't a permanent no, maybe at some point in the
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:42.800]   future.
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:47.760]   Uh, I really appreciate that you thought of me for this.
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:54.320]   I'm honored that you invited me, whatever, like take 20 minutes and write a nice, uh,
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:10:02.000]   form letter, uh, response, and then keep it handy in, in a word file or a text file or
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.680]   whatever you use so that it might even be five times a day when you get people wanting
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:13.280]   to pick your brain or come to this thing, or, Hey dude, you got a minute to jump on
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.000]   a zoom call.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:20.640]   Uh, you could just, you know, copy paste, select all tab control V send.
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:25.520]   Um, I do my form letter so many times a day.
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.120]   I just have a generic no.
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:32.640]   And what's nice is that, uh, people respond to it every now and then going, wow, that's
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:35.200]   the nicest no I've ever received.
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:39.600]   And dude, you're actually kind of inspiring how, uh, yeah, you just, you're keeping your
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:40.640]   head down in your work, man.
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:41.920]   I should be more like that.
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:46.880]   Like you think people are going to be mad, but actually people often get inspired by
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:49.520]   how you say no to their random things.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:50.560]   Yeah.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:54.160]   The other, I wouldn't necessarily put this in a form letter, but I heard you say once
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:11:00.560]   that, you know, you say no, so that you leave your calendar open to say yes.
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:05.280]   And, and if, if someone's calendar is always full, it's almost like, oh man, this person
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.160]   isn't leaving enough time for, for exciting things.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:13.120]   When I just said that, like for 10 years, I was basically a full-time dad, dude, for
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:16.640]   10 years, I didn't even have a calendar.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:21.760]   Like I didn't, there was like literally nothing on my calendar.
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:27.280]   I mean, maybe like once a year we would take a flight to go see his parents or grandparents,
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:32.400]   but, um, yeah, for 10 years, I had nothing on my calendar app.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:36.480]   And when somebody would want to schedule, they're like, Hey, can I call you next Thursday
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:36.880]   at three?
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:42.560]   I'd go, eh, I'm not going to like bust open the calendar app.
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:46.640]   You'll be like the only thing in 2018 on my entire calendar for the year.
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:49.200]   Like, no, just, just call whenever you want to call, just call.
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.160]   I'm not going to schedule.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:51.920]   I don't do scheduling.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:54.240]   I mean, now I do.
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:57.200]   I'm just, you know, my kid's 11 now and he's playing with friends.
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:59.440]   He doesn't need me around so much.
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:02.320]   So I'm not as much of a full-time dad as I was the last 10 years.
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:08.400]   But yeah, for 10 years, that was fun to, um, to, to just say no to all of it.
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:12.880]   And, uh, and to have this completely empty calendar is such a good feeling to wake up.
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:18.080]   God, that's one of my deepest joys to wake up every day or to wake up any day and have
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:20.640]   nothing on my calendar for that whole day.
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.560]   Like the whole day is mine.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.680]   It's such a nice feeling.
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:29.360]   Let's talk about some of the perspective you had for parenting, because I think right before
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:34.320]   we jumped in, I was sharing your post about parenting with my wife and we were both like,
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:38.080]   wow, because a lot, you know, you kind of talk in it and I'll put it in the show notes.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:39.520]   You can talk about it as much as you want.
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:46.320]   It's not very long, but how it seems like sometimes by focusing so much on your child,
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:50.720]   you're just completely selfless and you're, you're just, it can feel like work.
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:55.840]   But if you, you present it in a perspective, that's like, oh, by doing these things that
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:02.000]   many of us wish that we could do more for, or with our children, you're actually doing
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.520]   things that will help you.
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:09.040]   And that perspective, I think makes the task of, you know, I know plenty of people like,
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.400]   oh, my partner's gone.
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:13.600]   And I've got, you know, I've got, I'm on childcare duty for the whole day.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:19.840]   And I think there's a different perspective of ways that you could enrich your own life,
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:24.320]   not just by spending time with someone, but by teaching lessons and acting a different
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:24.560]   way.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.960]   I'm curious how you thought of that, how long it took you to come to those realizations.
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:34.880]   And yeah, whenever I was on daddy duty, because his mom and I always split it 50/50, you know,
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:39.360]   every day or every week, we'd make sure that it was always 50/50.
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:41.680]   We didn't have a nanny or anything like that.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:45.120]   It was always just the two of us and didn't, and we'd live, you know, far, far away from
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:45.440]   family.
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.640]   So there was nobody else to help.
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:49.600]   So it was either her on duty or me on duty.
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:52.080]   And so whenever it was my time, she, okay.
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:53.040]   So she had her own way, right?
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:57.520]   So she, she likes watching things and she likes being inside.
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.400]   Like that's how she grew up.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:59.840]   She's more indoorsy.
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:07.440]   So then I found it my duty whenever I was on daddy duty to, uh, to take him out, no
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.520]   matter what the weather, even if it's raining.
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.200]   Uh, that was like my number one thing.
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:12.880]   Like, let's just get out.
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:19.760]   And so to satisfy my own curiosity, I would pick somewhere on the map that we had never
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:20.000]   been.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.800]   I'd like, look at the map, but I'd see this green patch.
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.320]   I'm like, I don't know what's there.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:25.600]   Like today we're going there.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:30.960]   And so we would go to that green patch, get out of the car and just kind of like hang
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:32.240]   out there for the day.
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:38.400]   And we would spend like, you know, two hours, six hours in this green patch I'd never been
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.040]   to.
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:42.720]   And so I got to know my city really, really well.
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:48.400]   Uh, or I got to know the area really, really well by, um, by doing that.
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:53.360]   And now let's say like, if it's really bad weather, there's some days where I'd say
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:56.400]   like, all right, let's watch a movie.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:03.280]   But instead of just picking the dumbest, you know, hotel Transylvania three kind of
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:10.560]   entertainment, um, I'd go in, like, I do a little work to like, find some like beautifully
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:17.200]   award, uh, some beautiful award winning animated movie from somewhere, ideally in another
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:19.680]   language or another culture that I would find really interesting.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:26.800]   And I'd find this kind of like, I don't know, this, uh, this German animated thing and
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:27.520]   subtitles.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:31.200]   And so my kid who doesn't read is just watching this in German, but I'm like, cool.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:33.600]   The German language is getting into his ears a little bit today.
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:39.280]   And I'm watching, uh, an animated movie that I find interesting, not just like the
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:41.920]   common, the lowest common denominator kind of.
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:49.760]   So I would make choices like that to, um, to enrich his experience by often going somewhere
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:51.360]   new, watching something new.
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:53.440]   Um, sometimes we just listen to music.
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:16:00.240]   We'd kind of like cuddle and listen to say like Indian classical music while, uh, making
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.120]   Lego.
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.160]   Yeah, actually that was a good way.
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:05.040]   It's he, he calls it Lego music, Indian classical music.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:08.960]   He considers Lego music because I just thought like, all right, as long as we're just making
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:13.840]   Lego, um, yeah, let's, let's open his ears a bit and put on a different kind of music.
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:19.200]   Uh, and it had like speakers in the living room, so he could really kind of hear it,
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:22.800]   not just coming out of a teeny little, you know, one inch speaker.
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:30.320]   Um, so yeah, choices like that, I just found to me made being a full-time dad.
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:36.560]   It made it a joy, uh, because I would keep choosing these decisions that were good for
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:37.120]   both of us.
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:40.960]   And I think one of the big ones that you've read about is travel.
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:45.200]   And you wrote a post that says travels best with young children.
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.240]   I was telling my wife about it.
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.320]   She's like, how old are this guy?
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:50.080]   I don't think I said young.
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.080]   I said, he wrote this great post about travel with children.
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.760]   He's like, yeah, but are they 15?
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:59.600]   Like, like, so I think there's this idea of traveling with young children being horrible
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:01.280]   and it being the worst experience.
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:04.960]   And you write the exact opposite.
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:08.640]   And I've gotten so many emails from listeners saying, oh, can you talk more about travel
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:10.480]   with children and how to make it enjoyable?
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:16.240]   And, you know, and I would, as early as this morning, someone emailed me saying, I'm going
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:16.960]   on this trip.
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:17.920]   I can't remember where they're going.
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:20.160]   She's like, I have a six-year-old and a one-year-old and we're nervous.
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:22.160]   How do you have a good trip traveling with children?
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:27.040]   Very few people I know have a perspective of positive experience.
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:32.880]   So I'd love to kind of wind, wrap up a little bit and talk about that because we talk about
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:36.160]   travel a lot on this show and so many people are interested.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:41.440]   How do you travel with your child and have a great experience when doing it?
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:45.040]   And what advice do you have for people about to go on a trip with their children?
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:45.360]   All right.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.160]   I love this subject.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:51.520]   I mean, I wrote that post because I got so frustrated at people acting like it was just
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:54.480]   a truism, like traveling with kids is hard.
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:57.600]   Or once you have kids, you can't travel anymore.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:04.160]   I was like, damn, like the difference between in theory and in practice, some people just
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:07.600]   decide in advance in theory, well, can't travel anymore.
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:08.560]   Got kids now.
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.720]   Just going to have to stay put.
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:12.640]   No more dreaming for me.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:17.280]   But in practice, it's wonderful.
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:21.760]   I mean, maybe you need to just change your mindset about it in advance.
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:30.080]   But I just find that for one, you don't need to pack hardly anything because anywhere you
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.840]   go has stuff for kids.
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:38.800]   I started traveling with our kid when he was three months old and in diapers.
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:42.000]   And you realize you don't need to pack 50 diapers.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.200]   You need to pack like six diapers, maybe to get you through the first day, because anywhere
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:48.720]   you're going to go has diapers.
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:55.280]   You don't need to pack toys because anywhere you go is going to have toys.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:03.920]   And if he's really stuck for entertainment and really needs a physical thing beyond just
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:09.440]   the one or two things that you bring with, then there are new physical things wherever
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:12.000]   you go, and I don't mean like things to buy.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:22.160]   It may just be like random items found in the grass or on the street corner can be fascinating.
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:28.400]   God, he got so much joy out of this like rusty spring he found once in the gutter.
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:33.920]   Forget, we went to Wales and he found this rusty spring in the gutter that he just held
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:36.240]   onto for a week and just loved this spring.
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:41.440]   And that was like his favorite toy for the whole week while we were traveling in England
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:44.720]   that he found literally in the gutter in Wales.
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:48.800]   So, OK, so you don't need to pack much.
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:50.160]   That's a big one.
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:59.840]   As long as you leave early, like, don't forget that the airport itself is a fascinating
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:01.680]   destination for kids.
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:05.120]   Like, oh, my God, it might as well practically be Disneyland.
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.320]   There is so much there.
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:11.040]   So you get to the airport way early, like four hours early.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.160]   There's no rush.
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:18.320]   There's no stress because your kids love to explore the airport.
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:24.800]   Even when he's just a little choo-choo crawling baby, he loved the attention from so many
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:25.360]   strangers.
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:30.880]   Like suddenly there's like hundreds of faces looking at him and he'd be like, you know,
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:33.200]   like so many strangers want to play with him.
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:34.880]   He loved hanging out at the airport.
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:44.160]   So then the flight itself, my number one advice for kids under the age of two or three is
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:47.600]   I know this is going to sound radical, but I actually got this from a great book called
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.600]   Brain Rules for Baby by John Medina.
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:57.840]   University of Washington neuroscientist has been studying brain development in babies
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:58.800]   for years.
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:01.120]   And his number one bit of advice.
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:02.480]   Well, sorry, number two bit of advice.
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:05.200]   Number one bit of advice was help your kids feel safe.
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:07.040]   Like number one, kids need to feel safe.
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.960]   So they can flourish.
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:13.440]   But number two was, he said, no screens before the age of two.
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:18.080]   And in fact, the longer they can go without screens in front of them, the better.
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:24.000]   But he said, like, absolutely do not let your kid stare at a screen before the age of two.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:31.360]   So I heeded his advice and we wouldn't let, we had no screens of the house, no iPads,
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:36.560]   no movies, whatever, before the age of two, but the one exception is when we would get
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:37.200]   on a flight.
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:45.600]   And because he had had no screens at all in his life, you wonder how to keep a kid still
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:46.400]   in the seat.
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:48.080]   If you like it, let them watch the screen.
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:55.360]   Suddenly he was just hypnotized and he would be absolutely still on a flight to the point
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:22:00.640]   where many different times when the flight was done, we'd be getting up, exiting the
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:05.360]   plane and somebody in front of us or behind us would go, whoa, there was a kid here that
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:06.320]   whole time.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:09.760]   And they didn't even know because their kid was so hypnotized by the screen.
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.840]   So I don't know, that was a good hack.
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:13.520]   And hey, that's why we're here, right?
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.160]   All the hacks.
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.880]   So yeah.
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:25.760]   And then when you get to a place, you don't try to force your kid into your adult schedule.
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.920]   You don't say, all right, we're going to Paris.
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:28.720]   We're going to see the Louvre.
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:29.760]   We're going to see the Eiffel Tower.
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:32.160]   We're going to look at the Arc de Triomphe at one o'clock and we're going to get it.
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:34.240]   You just let go of all that.
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:42.400]   Traveling with kids is so nice to just get to a destination and let go of your expectations
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:46.960]   to basically let your kid and circumstance lead the way.
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:51.120]   So you're just going to get there and then you just go out into the world with your kid
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:53.680]   and let them explore and let them lead the way.
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:56.320]   Isn't that a Whitney Houston song?
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:02.160]   Yeah, you just let them lead and be on their schedule.
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:08.560]   And what I love about that is then you get to experience this place through your kid's
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:09.840]   eyes, right?
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:13.760]   So I remember taking my kid to Thailand when he was like six months old.
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:18.080]   And yeah, he was a crawling baby.
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:19.040]   He wasn't even walking.
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:19.920]   He was just crawling.
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:27.760]   And we would just go someplace like a temple that was gorgeous with the big golden stupas.
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:31.440]   And just let him crawl around.
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:34.240]   And he would just be crawling around this temple and everybody's giving him attention.
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:39.360]   He'd play with strangers, a monk, a Buddhist monk picks him up and holds him and he's loving
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:42.080]   this attention and people take his picture and he crawls around the whole time.
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:47.840]   We're just laid back, kind of like enjoying the temple and our baby crawling around.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:54.240]   And same thing with like just going out to a park and he's seeing different things.
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:55.360]   He sees monkeys.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:56.160]   Oh my God.
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:03.840]   You know, like it's all so easy when you let your kid lead the way.
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:08.560]   Yeah, locals connect with you more.
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:10.800]   Everybody wants to come up and interact with the baby.
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:16.000]   So all these locals that you like don't speak English and we can't communicate through language,
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.480]   but you know, the sweet old ladies come up and just they want to play with your baby.
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:24.240]   And I just, I absolutely love it.
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:27.360]   I just thought, I kind of don't want to travel without my kid.
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:31.440]   I think traveling with my kid at any age, and even now, like he just turned 11.
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:34.640]   I just took him to Japan for two weeks.
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:36.400]   His mom had to work, so it was just me and him.
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:40.160]   And it was amazing to go see Japan through his eyes.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:44.320]   I've been to Japan a few times in my life, but like I kept myself out of it.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:50.240]   I just booked a few, like I just took us to Kanazawa on the West Coast.
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:53.280]   We just stayed there for four days and down to Kyoto for four days.
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:59.360]   Then up to Tokyo for four days, stopped at one hot springs resort town on the way
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:02.720]   so I could experience like a real hot springs resort.
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:05.920]   And other than that, like just day to day, we'd like, we'd wake up and I'd say,
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:07.840]   "All right, dude, what do you want to do?
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:10.640]   You lead, I'll follow you."
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:14.480]   And it was so unexpected.
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:18.880]   I thought he'd be overwhelmed by Tokyo, but he loved it.
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:22.400]   In fact, sometimes when I was kind of tired, he's like, "Let's go out again."
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:23.840]   He said, "Let's go down this alley."
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:24.880]   And I just let him lead the way.
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:27.040]   He's like, "Let's go see what's upstairs."
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:28.320]   All right, sure.
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:30.720]   And it was great.
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:32.240]   It introduced so much randomness.
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:34.240]   He chose things I wouldn't have chosen.
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:41.440]   And yeah, he's like my favorite travel partner and has been since he was born.
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:46.480]   So yeah, I think travel with kids is easy and wonderful.
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:52.960]   We went to London and Paris in December with two kids, six months and two and a half.
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:54.720]   We didn't try to cram in the Louvre.
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:59.680]   Fortunately, we picked places that, at least in Paris's case, we'd both been to before.
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:05.200]   I think one of the challenges that I'm curious to hear your perspective on was,
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:08.880]   maybe this gets better after multiple times.
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:12.160]   This is our first kind of trip to a city with kids.
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:17.680]   A part of it was like, "Oh, we're so used to how much we try to accomplish on a trip."
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:20.720]   With children, you just have to cut your expectations way back.
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:25.760]   And so I think if we wanted to have an enjoyable trip each day,
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:28.880]   the goal was, "What's the one thing we're going to do today?"
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:34.640]   Our list pre-kids was like, "Here's the eight things we'll do."
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:35.360]   Now it's one.
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:39.200]   And I wonder now if we went back and had...
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:40.960]   I think we weren't going in with eight.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:44.000]   Maybe we had two and we realized one was more sustainable.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.360]   But if you go all the way, halfway across the world,
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:50.240]   not everyone has months at a time.
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:54.080]   So let's say you're there for a week, and you're only doing one thing a day.
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:57.920]   You might feel like you didn't get as much value out of the trip
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:01.440]   because you spent all this money to travel and stay and eat,
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:02.800]   but you didn't get to do that much.
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:09.440]   I have a feeling that you have a way to rephrase the perspective
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:12.960]   that will make anyone listening realize that
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:15.360]   they got just as much of a trip, even though it was different.
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:17.840]   But I feel like the way you'll say it
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:21.280]   will give people that feeling far greater than the way I would.
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:24.960]   So I'm curious how you would kind of rebut the idea
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:26.560]   that if you're not doing a lot
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:28.960]   because you can't have as much on your agenda,
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:32.720]   you're not going to have the kind of trip that will make it worth it.
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:36.320]   I figure that if I've decided I want to go to Paris,
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:38.560]   and I've got that specific example too,
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:40.720]   I'm just choosing the "where".
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:43.440]   I'm just saying, "We're going to Paris."
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:45.280]   And I'll say, "Okay."
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:47.520]   And so I took us to Paris.
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:53.280]   And once we got out of the train station at the Gare du Nord,
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:54.720]   is that it? The north one, I think?
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:58.560]   I just let him choose.
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.960]   I was like, "Well, we're in Paris now.
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:02.160]   Which way do you want to go?"
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:05.760]   And he was like, "Go that way."
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:06.400]   I said, "Okay."
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:08.720]   And I just followed him.
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:13.200]   And I'm so glad I did because at every turn,
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:14.560]   he just decided where he wanted to go.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:15.600]   He led the way.
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:18.480]   And at one point, he found this huge cardboard box
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:19.920]   that was as big as he is.
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:23.920]   And he's like, "Dad, check out this box."
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:25.840]   And he got inside this cardboard box.
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:27.520]   And for the next half an hour,
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:32.320]   he walked the streets of Paris inside a big cardboard box.
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.080]   And I got such joy out of that.
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:37.840]   I made a little phone movie of it,
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:43.360]   of the streets of Paris, in a busy center part of town,
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.440]   with him taking up the whole sidewalk,
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:47.200]   walking inside this big cardboard box,
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:49.520]   and everybody doing these double takes, like, "What the hell?"
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:54.880]   And me just cracking up at the juxtaposition of,
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:57.760]   not only is my kid taking up the sidewalk,
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:00.960]   walking in a huge cardboard box, but, "OMFG, Paris."
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:02.640]   "OMFG, Paris."
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:04.400]   Like, to be doing this in Paris.
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.800]   And oh my God, there's the Eiffel Tower in the background,
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:10.400]   as my kid is walking in a cardboard box.
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:13.680]   And then, at some point, he sees a huge staircase.
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:14.880]   It's starting to get dark.
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:15.920]   It's dusk.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:18.800]   And he's like, "Whoa."
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:20.000]   He said, "Look at all those stairs."
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:20.800]   He said, "Let's go this way."
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:21.840]   I said, "All right."
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:23.280]   He's out of the box at this point.
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:28.560]   And we go up and up and up and up and up these steps.
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:32.560]   And we get to the top, and we take this turn.
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:36.640]   And it's like, "Oh, one of the most top five beautiful things
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:37.840]   I've ever seen in my life."
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:43.760]   He accidentally led us to Sacré-Cœur, the big giant cathedral,
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:47.600]   which, just because it was dusk, was being lit up by floodlights,
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:49.520]   but the sky was dark blue.
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:52.800]   And it's at the top of the stairs, but you don't expect it.
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:56.000]   You turn up the stairs, and suddenly, it's just staring at you.
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.480]   And it's like, "Oh my God, it looks so surreal."
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:02.560]   And it was one of my favorite things on that whole trip,
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:05.360]   was us accidentally discovering Sacré-Cœur,
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:09.200]   which I had only seen in postcards or photos at that point.
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:10.480]   I'd never seen it in person.
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:12.960]   And it was only because he led the way.
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:16.480]   I don't think, like, that wasn't on my itinerary,
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:18.720]   and I wouldn't have put it on my itinerary.
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:21.440]   I didn't even really know what it was called.
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:22.640]   I had just seen pictures of it before.
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:25.840]   But yeah, letting your kids lead the way
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:28.240]   makes them happy,
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:31.600]   and it leads to so many wonderful random encounters.
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:37.040]   - Yeah, I think it's just about reframing what makes a good trip, right?
[01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:40.720]   In another year, or, you know, in an earlier life,
[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:43.040]   a great trip to Paris might have involved
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:46.080]   ticking off a few restaurants your friends had recommended,
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:47.520]   seeing a few museums.
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:51.360]   And as you were talking, what really clicked for me
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:54.640]   was I thought, "Okay, well, if we're not going to go do all those things,
[01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:56.800]   and we're just going to kind of walk around,
[01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:59.440]   then we could just do that here.
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:00.960]   Why do we need to go all the way to Paris?"
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:05.200]   But there's something about being in Paris, doing that,
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:06.800]   that makes the memories different.
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:10.800]   And the memories are why you're doing it in the first place.
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:14.160]   So I want to challenge myself on the next trip
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:18.880]   to just kind of let go, do whatever, see where it goes,
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:22.720]   and see if we have just a totally different type of memory
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:25.600]   that's equally or potentially even better than we used to.
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:28.480]   It's just uncomfortable, right?
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:31.120]   Because it's not a type of thing I'm familiar with,
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:33.200]   because that's not how we would travel pre-kid.
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:38.160]   So we found the travel logistics to not be as overwhelming
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:41.760]   as much as the trying to find the balance between,
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:44.240]   I don't know, my wife and I, when we're in new cities,
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:48.000]   we're like, "Let's go find a cool bar and have a good cocktail."
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.240]   Or, "Let's go eat whatever the local food is."
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:53.200]   And so it's like, "All right, well, we gotta get to this restaurant."
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:58.160]   But in London, nothing opens early enough to eat before kids' nap time.
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:01.600]   But if we reframed it and just said,
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:03.760]   "We're not going to have the trip we wanted to have
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:05.280]   when we were 10 years younger.
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:06.720]   We're going to have a different style trip
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:08.720]   where our children experience things,
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:11.520]   and we get to watch that unfold."
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:12.560]   I think it would have been different.
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.480]   And I think we maybe had the wrong expectations.
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:15.440]   We still had a great trip,
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:17.280]   but I think we could have had a better trip.
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:21.760]   I find it really important.
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:23.520]   This is just my values.
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:26.640]   Nobody listening has to adopt my values.
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:29.600]   But a lot of the reason I was traveling
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:33.040]   was for him as much as me,
[01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:37.600]   because I wanted him to know that Paris is a place
[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:41.440]   that he's been and has a connection to.
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:46.960]   So when you say, "Why not just stay home?"
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:50.000]   Yeah, the trip was for him as much as me.
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:54.960]   He can identify so many countries on a map now at age 11,
[01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:58.320]   and he's got a little connection to so many of them,
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:32:59.520]   even some that he hasn't been to.
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:02.160]   But I want him to feel a connection to the world.
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:07.040]   So yeah, when somebody says "France,"
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.480]   he's like, "Oh yeah, I've been there."
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:11.120]   And if somebody says "Spain," he's like, "Oh yeah, I've been there."
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:14.240]   I wanted that for his self-identity.
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:16.400]   I want him to feel that the world is his home,
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:19.360]   not just this one country where we're in right now,
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.920]   but all of it.
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:22.880]   The more of it, the better.
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:26.320]   So I generally would take him on trips to places we've never been,
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:28.240]   let him lead the way.
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:31.520]   He gets to feel this sense of autonomy.
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:33.840]   You never have to worry about him being happy,
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:35.920]   because if your kid is leading the way,
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:37.120]   I wouldn't know how to do it with two kids.
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:37.680]   I don't know.
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:41.680]   But if your kid's leading the way,
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:45.200]   then he's happy and you get the randomness.
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:47.920]   But it's more about just your kid feeling a connection
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:49.920]   to this place on Earth.
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:51.440]   That was most important to me.
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:54.400]   I didn't really care what we did in the place.
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:57.920]   But the reason I gasped while you were saying that
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:33:59.440]   is, Chris,
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:02.560]   satisficing and maximizing.
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:06.080]   It comes back full circle to earlier in the conversation
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:11.840]   of you just described a way of travel that was trying to maximize.
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:15.440]   You're like, all right, we've got 72 hours in Paris.
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:17.040]   We are going to go to the best restaurants,
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:18.400]   the best sites, the best museum.
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:20.720]   That's maximizing.
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:24.880]   And I think that's the wrong strategy.
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:28.960]   I think satisficing is the correct strategy for travel with kids.
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:29.600]   You're just like, all right,
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:32.480]   I'm just going to book us a trip to Paris,
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:33.920]   and we're going to get off,
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:35.360]   and we're going to spend a few days in Paris.
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:36.960]   I don't know what's going to happen while we're there.
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:38.880]   We'll see what happens.
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:41.440]   But we're going to spend three days in Paris with no expectations.
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:44.800]   That's probably a better recipe for happiness.
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:48.880]   Yeah, I think it's my eternal struggle is to satisfy.
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:54.720]   But I will continue to try to make gains towards more satisficing,
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:55.680]   especially in areas.
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:56.000]   You should read that book.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:56.640]   Yeah, I haven't.
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:58.400]   Sorry, you should read Hyperoxygen.
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:00.560]   It's going to stack up a bunch of reasons why you should.
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:01.200]   Cool.
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:03.360]   I try not to be distracted and write things down.
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:05.040]   But every now and then in a conversation,
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:07.360]   I'm like, well, that that that deserves to be written down.
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:10.960]   OK, so there's two final things.
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:14.240]   One is around satisfying.
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:18.320]   There is a story of I've somehow managed to hear you tell twice.
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:20.400]   I picked random things, and sometimes I read it,
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:21.840]   and sometimes I'm like, oh, let's just play.
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:25.840]   And, you know, on your site, you read some of your posts and.
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:32.400]   It let it's a perspective that sometimes taking a different path,
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:37.120]   taking the the not the not perfect, optimal maximizing path
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:41.200]   might actually not result in as worse of an outcome as you see.
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:43.600]   So one of the reasons I think a lot of us maximize is that we're like,
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:45.520]   we want the best, we want the optimal outcome.
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:48.400]   And if you don't get it, you know, we in our minds,
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:50.320]   it feels like you'll be spending so much more money,
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:51.760]   but it might actually only be ten dollars.
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:56.960]   Could you talk about this bike ride where you stop to slow down?
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:01.600]   Because I think it's a good way to wrap up the conversation,
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:04.800]   because sometimes just taking a different path,
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:08.480]   it doesn't actually mean that you're getting a much worse outcome
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:10.800]   in terms of, in your case, how long it took.
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:16.800]   OK, so the first the story and then how it ties back into what we've been talking about.
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:22.800]   Because the stories about what happened and then the how it ties back in is
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:28.800]   is about the psychological experience in your mind, not just the physical experience.
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:32.000]   OK, so the the story of what actually happened is when I was living
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000]   in Santa Monica, California, on the beach,
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:39.360]   there is a bike path that goes through the sand there.
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:42.320]   And it's I think it's 15 miles or something like that.
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:48.800]   And for exercise, almost every day, I would at some point stop what I was doing
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:53.600]   and I'd get on my bike and I would do that bike path as fast as I could.
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:57.760]   Like, you know, really like head down and kind of, you know,
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:00.800]   pushing as hard as I could to do this in the name of exercise.
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:05.280]   Like, I'm going to do this track and I would do the 15 miles back and forth.
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:08.000]   And again, sorry, I don't remember if it was exactly 15 miles.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:13.120]   But I do remember that that after the first or second time,
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:19.520]   the time it would take me was almost always exactly 43 minutes.
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:22.320]   If it was a really windy day, maybe a little more,
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:24.480]   but almost never less than 43 minutes.
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:27.760]   So 43 minutes every time.
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:33.600]   But after doing this for a few months, I realized I was getting less motivated to do it.
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.520]   It's like, oh, it's not so much fun.
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:39.120]   This kind of I always get really red faced.
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:41.200]   It would take me like an hour to cool down afterwards.
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:42.640]   I'd have to take like a cold shower.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:46.160]   And even then I would like continue sweating even after a cold shower, you know.
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:51.280]   So so one day I was just like, I just need to chill.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:58.880]   I'm just going to relax and do the same ride, but at like half my normal pace.
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:01.040]   So I get on my bike and I'm just like,
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:06.960]   just going like a granny, you know, sitting more upright,
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:10.320]   you know, looking around and I was just like on my same path.
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:13.440]   But this time I was looking and there were dolphins jumping in the ocean that day.
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:15.440]   I was like, wow, dolphins.
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:16.320]   That's so badass.
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:17.600]   I grew up in Chicago.
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:18.880]   I'm looking at dolphins.
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:27.920]   And and yes, in the Marina Del Rey, I went under Marina Del Rey.
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:34.720]   There were a whole bunch of pelicans that were perching on the the breakwater thing.
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:37.760]   And at one point when I rode my bike near them, the pelicans all went.
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:40.960]   I was like, whoa, pelicans.
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:43.920]   And then like one of them shit in my mouth.
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:47.840]   And I was like, there was like the taste of like digested oyster shells.
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:51.520]   So that was a really unique experience.
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:58.240]   And so then I get back to my starting point where I would always time myself.
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:03.120]   And I looked at my watch and it had been 45 minutes.
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:05.200]   I was like, wait a minute.
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:05.920]   No way.
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:09.040]   Like I'm usually doing it in 43 minutes.
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:11.120]   I thought it would be like an hour and a half.
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:13.120]   I felt like I was going half speed.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:16.800]   But I guess just because of the strength of my legs or whatever,
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:22.240]   I was going about the same pace, even though it felt like half the effort.
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:24.800]   So that just blew my mind.
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:27.280]   And yeah, I double checked.
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:28.320]   Yeah, 45 minutes.
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:29.040]   Oh, my God.
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:36.960]   So like that became a metaphor for how you can just relax and put in so much less effort
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:42.080]   and get almost the same result objectively.
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:47.520]   But psychologically, you feel so much better about it.
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:56.720]   So yeah, full circle to what we're talking about, whether it's travel or decision making.
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:04.160]   To me, the psychological experience matters more than anything.
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:11.360]   So yes, I could force my kid to go to the eight things I want to see in Paris
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:15.440]   and force him to sit next to me at a fancy restaurant that he doesn't like
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:21.600]   because dammit, it says that this has the best creme brulee in Paris.
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:23.680]   And I could make him do this.
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:30.160]   And objectively, I could say that that might cram in more experiences
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:32.480]   and technically make a better holiday.
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:33.040]   But guess what?
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:36.800]   The psychological experience of it would be worse
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:42.240]   than if I just book the flight, get there and just let my kid lead the way.
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:47.760]   I might see less stuff, but the psychological experience of it will be better.
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:54.160]   So yeah, I think I definitely value and prioritize
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:58.240]   the psychological, the inner experience of something.
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:01.200]   To me, you kind of satisfy the bike ride,
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:05.760]   which is you didn't try to get the ultimate maximum output from riding it.
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:08.960]   And in return, you actually got the maximum output you did.
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:11.520]   You actually were able to get 80 percent,
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:16.800]   you know, not even 99 percent of the the output in terms of pure,
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:17.760]   you know, physical output.
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:20.000]   But then you also got to enjoy the bike ride and all that.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.120]   And to the Paris example, the funniest part is.
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:26.640]   To the average untrained American palate,
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:30.240]   I am fairly confident that the average creme brulee in Paris
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:32.960]   is going to be better than any creme brulee you've had.
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:37.200]   So, you know, does it need to be the best croissant or the best creme brulee?
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:40.800]   And I say this as someone who just recently searched for,
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:42.080]   oh, let's go to this bakery.
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:46.400]   They have the best this, you know, we did have one terrible croissant in Paris.
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:50.320]   But for the most part, the random croissant at any bakery is so good
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:56.160]   that I would tell you, even though I find it hard to take my own advice,
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:42:00.480]   that if you just don't track to the best one in the world,
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:04.400]   just track to a good one and like, enjoy that.
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:10.320]   And it will probably be a better experience than schlepping the whole family on the metro
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:13.440]   to go seven stops at, you know, early in the morning.
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:15.440]   So you don't have to wait too long of a line.
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:17.440]   And I say this as as advice.
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:18.880]   It's hard for me to take myself.
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:24.080]   But hopefully the pain I've endured to say it could save people some misery.
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:30.160]   Yeah, I have internalized satisficing so much that when I go to a restaurant
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:32.880]   and I don't even really care what restaurant I go to.
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:35.040]   I don't even maximize that.
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:37.360]   Whatever's nearby, it's fine.
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:38.080]   I'm sure it's fine.
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:42.080]   You know, as long as it doesn't completely suck.
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:45.600]   You know, if I see the one with the little flies and the broken fluorescent light.
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:46.960]   All right, maybe not that one.
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:48.800]   Maybe that one across the street instead.
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:52.560]   I can walk into almost any restaurant and my friends tease me for this.
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:55.840]   Here's how I order at the menu.
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:43:00.720]   I flip open the menu and basically the first thing I see in the first three seconds,
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:01.920]   I'm like, I just closed the menu.
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:02.960]   Like, that's what I'm having.
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:04.800]   And they're just like, you didn't look at everything.
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:07.040]   I'm like, I don't need to look at everything.
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:09.680]   I'm just going to eat something and it's going to be fine.
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:12.080]   Like, I don't even need to order the best thing on the menu.
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:12.800]   Just whatever.
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:16.800]   Or if I don't even feel like looking at the menu and the waiter comes by early.
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:18.880]   I'll just say, what's your best thing?
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:20.560]   Or what, you know, what do you recommend?
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:21.680]   What's your most popular dish?
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:24.560]   And I'll say, oh, the whatever, the chili.
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:26.240]   Like, yeah, give me that then.
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:27.920]   Like, I don't even look at the menu sometimes.
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:34.800]   I really, really deeply internalized the lessons from the Paradox of Choice book.
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:39.280]   Well, I'm going to recommend everyone check out both the writings you've had,
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:40.720]   the books you've written and that book.
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:45.360]   The one thing, I haven't done this as frequently as I wanted to,
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:48.240]   but I ask people because everyone here likes to travel.
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:52.640]   Is there a place, and I'm hoping that you use somewhere in New Zealand,
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:56.560]   since I've been dying for an excuse to go, that you're familiar with enough.
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:00.560]   Feel free to choose anywhere in the world that if someone were heading there,
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:02.960]   you'd recommend a couple of things.
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:06.720]   We don't need to give them eight things per day on an itinerary,
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:10.240]   but a couple of places that are your favorite anywhere in the world.
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:15.120]   Well, the first thing, let me start with a do not do in New Zealand.
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:22.240]   If you come to New Zealand, do not spend a single minute in any city.
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:24.960]   New Zealand is not Europe.
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:28.800]   In Europe, the cities contain the culture of the place.
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:32.480]   In New Zealand, the cities are just dumb generic cities.
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:34.960]   There is nothing special about any city in New Zealand.
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:38.720]   Everything that's wonderful about New Zealand is contained
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:44.320]   in the rural nature countryside or in the cute, small little towns.
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:50.160]   What you must do when you come to New Zealand is just rent a car,
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:53.280]   whether you rent a car at the Auckland airport and drive south
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:58.240]   or connect to Christchurch and just rent a car at the Christchurch airport and drive west.
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:01.360]   Just drive away from the city.
[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:04.000]   Don't spend a single minute in any city in New Zealand.
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.320]   Okay, so that's number one.
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:11.920]   What to do?
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:16.880]   Honestly, I'm just going to leave this open.
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:20.800]   I think the best thing to do then is rent a car,
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:27.600]   install the booking.com app on your phone because every single motel in New Zealand,
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:31.760]   and there are hundreds, maybe thousands of these cute little motels,
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:34.960]   they're all on this app and it will show you your immediate availability.
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:37.440]   So you can just be impulsive.
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:39.040]   You don't even need to book everything in advance.
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:44.720]   You can just go on a drive and see what looks appealing and say like,
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:46.240]   "What's that over there? Let's just go there."
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:48.560]   And then when it's getting late afternoon
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:50.880]   and you're feeling like it's time to pick where you're going to stay,
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:52.960]   you just open the app with the GPS and it says like,
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:55.840]   "Okay, here's the six motels in your area that have availability."
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:57.760]   And you just pick one and they're all good.
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:05.040]   My favourite road trips in New Zealand have been through this method with no plan.
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:11.440]   I just go to a certain direction and the whole country is so safe
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:14.240]   and the people are so nice and there are plenty of motels.
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:21.280]   And yeah, that's more than telling you one destination to go to.
[01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:22.320]   It's that.
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:25.200]   But okay, but lastly, if I had to pick just one,
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:29.600]   if you've got little kids, one hour north of Wellington,
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:37.680]   there is a very special place called Staglands, S-T-A-G-L-A-N-D-S.
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:41.920]   It is an open petting zoo kind of thing.
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:44.560]   The animals are not in cages, they're just roaming around.
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:47.920]   And all of the animals will eat out of your hand.
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:58.800]   And you can just go up to whether it's deer or birds or peacocks, geese, little pigs.
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:03.680]   Yeah, everything will eat out of your hand and you just pet them
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:10.560]   and you're just surrounded in this wonderful valley full of animals.
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:14.560]   And especially if you get to go on a weekday, you'll be one of the only people there.
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:17.280]   It's just it's a really, really, really special place.
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:20.640]   So there's my secret hidden recommendation.
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:22.080]   But actually, you know what?
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:25.440]   Anybody, if you're coming to New Zealand, email me and I'll give you more examples.
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:29.600]   Go to my website, click contact and there's my email address.
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:31.520]   I really enjoy my open inbox.
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:35.840]   And the reason I do interviews like this is because of the people I meet,
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:37.600]   the people who listen to these things.
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:40.320]   And come on, if you've heard my voice for an hour and a half,
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:43.680]   send me an email, say hello, introduce yourself.
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:46.480]   And if you're coming to New Zealand, definitely let me know.
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:50.160]   And I'll give you more detailed tips because I've been here for 10 years now.
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:52.960]   And I know most of the secret places.
[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:54.880]   It's on our list.
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:58.240]   We have kids, stag lands will be on the list as well.
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:00.000]   This has been so much fun.
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:04.000]   I'm sure we could go longer, but I would love to wrap up and just say,
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.880]   is there any final place you'd like people to check out
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:09.360]   or anywhere you'd like to send them before we go?
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:11.680]   Oh, you don't mean physical place it?
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:12.240]   Oh, no, no.
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:17.200]   I just mean, I know you're not promoting a new thing, but.
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:18.800]   No, I'm never promoting.
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:19.840]   I'm post agenda.
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:24.880]   Anybody actually just, I really like hearing from strangers.
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:27.120]   I really enjoy it when people introduce themselves.
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:32.080]   It's like a deepest sense of joy to me to know people from around the world.
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:36.720]   So yeah, any fans of Chris's all the hacks, go send me an email,
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:39.440]   go to my website, S-I-V-E dot R-S.
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:43.280]   And you don't even have to ask me a question, just introduce yourself and say hi.
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:46.640]   Well, I know you enjoy email and you respond because that's how this all started.
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:48.960]   So I'm so glad we got to do it.
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:50.560]   Thank you so much for being here.
