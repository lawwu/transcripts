[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in the first epistle of Peter in the second chapter,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   and reading the second verse and the first part of the sixth verse.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   The second verse and the first part of the sixth verse in the second chapter of the first epistle of Peter.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   As newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that he may grow thereby, wherefore also it is contained in the scripture.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Now I select those two portions out of this entire paragraph which runs from the first verse to the end of the twelfth verse in this portion of this first epistle of Peter,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   because it is to what they convey that I am anxious to direct your attention in particular this evening.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Those who were here last Sunday evening will remember and recall that we begin our study of this great statement.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   And our reason for doing so is this.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Surely the great quest of all thinking people, indeed of all people, in strange and curious ways in the world at the present time,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   is the quest and the search for some resting place, some place of peace, some place of quiet, some place of assurance,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   something which is certain in a world that has become so uncertain.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Now that is all put very perfectly for us in this sixth verse which we looked at last Sunday night and which in its entirety reads like this,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, "Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious;
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded."
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Now that's the thing.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   How to go through this world and through this life without being confounded?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   The passage reminds us that we are but strangers and pilgrims in this world.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   But here's the great question, here's the great problem.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   How to go through without being disappointed, without being put to shame,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   without finding us at some critical hour not knowing what to do nor where to turn,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   and becoming absolutely frantic? That's the question.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   How to get hold of something in this life and in this world that will keep us from being ashamed, confounded, ridiculed?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Now we were able to see last Sunday night that there's only one thing that can do this.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   There's nothing that the world has got to offer us that can put us in that place where we'll never be confounded.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   There's not a single teaching, there is no philosophy, there's no way of life that can give this,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   except this gospel, this sure-tried foundation that God himself has laid, as we've seen,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   and particularly in and through his only begotten beloved Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Now that's the whole business of Christianity, it's the business of the Church to make this known.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   This is the good news, this is called a gospel. A gospel means good news, and that is the good news,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   that it is possible, even in this life, in this world, as it is now, with all its uncertainties,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   with all its dread possibilities, it is possible to be in a position in which you'll never be put to shame,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   never let down, never surprised, never disappointed.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Now I suggest to you that this is the most wonderful thing in the world tonight,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   but that is precisely what is offered us by this gospel.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Now I do hope we're all clear about this. The business of the gospel is not so much to tell us
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   how to just go through this world and stick it, and just manage to get through it anyhow somehow.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   No, no. Its whole message is to tell us that we can be put onto a foundation which will never shake.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I emphasize that never. It doesn't matter what may come. The gospel issues a universal challenge.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   It doesn't care what may come against us. If we are on this foundation, we shall never be confounded.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Now, there is this great message. This, I'm suggesting, is surely the thing that every thoughtful person
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   is longing for and looking for and seeking at this very moment.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Well, now then, here it is. It's possible. It's available.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   There are testimonies in this book itself of people who've been on this foundation, and they say it's true.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   They can look back across a long life, and they say it's absolutely right.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Never disappointed, never let down. And not only that.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   In the subsequent history of the Christian church, from the end of this New Testament canon right up until tonight,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   there have been people in all ages and generations who have been able to testify to the fact that this is nothing but the simple truth.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   They have discovered this, and they've rejoiced in it. They've never been disappointed.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   They've never been let down. So that the question before us is, how does one arrive at this knowledge?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   What is this? And it is to that that I'm beginning to attend this evening in a detailed manner.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   We took a kind of panoramic view of it last Sunday night. We looked at the whole statement.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   But that isn't enough. We must come and look at it in detail, portion by portion,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   because there is nothing that is so true about this message, this Christian gospel as this,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   as that it is a whole, its wholeness. So we must not only look at it as a whole,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   we must look at it in its various parts, and then we'll again arrive at the whole.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Now, here tonight we are looking at what I would call the first step in this whole matter.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   So let me put it like this to you. Have you got this satisfaction? Have you got this place of rest?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Have you come to this position in which you can say confidently that you'll never be confounded?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   In other words, are you understanding life as it is today? Are you understanding what's happening?
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Are you prepared for every contingency? Are you ready for disaster? Are you ready for illness?
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Are you ready for death? Now, these are the things that come. They're bound to come.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   And the whole test, I say, is does our view of life, our philosophy, stand up to this practical test?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   The Bible is very practical. It issues its message in this practical form always.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   So we must ask ourselves that question. Have we got to this position?
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   If not, wouldn't you like to be in this position? How can you get into this position?
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Well, now then, this message tells us that it's got to be taken in its way.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   And therefore the first thing for us to discover is what is this way?
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Well, now, here's the first thing. We've got to start with this book.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   There's the first fundamental proposition.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Here we are, here's everybody in the world tonight with millions of books.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   All around us, libraries packed, books pouring out of the presses.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   And in some way or another, most of them can claim that they are dealing,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   are trying to deal with this whole problem of life and of living.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   But we are here to say that not one of them finally can help us, that here and here alone is the real help.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   The only others that help us are the ones that expound this, or help us to understand this.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Here is the book of books. We've got to start with this.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   And why do we start with this? Well, for the reasons that I shall now put before you.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   But let's be quite clear about that. The Christian message comes entirely out of this book.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   We've got nothing to say apart from what we find here.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   That is what differentiates Christianity from everything else.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   We are utterly confined to this.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   There are other books we don't derogate from their value, but we say that in these matters that we are concerned about,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   this whole business of never being confounded in life, we've got to come here.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   And we submit ourselves utterly and completely to this.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Why? Many people stumble at that. They say, "That's just a trouble with you people. That's being narrow-minded.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   You're confining yourself to just one book." But that's not to be cultured. That's not to be sophisticated.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   They say, "That's a terrible thing to do. In a world that's got so much to offer us, you shut yourself down to one particular book,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   and you won't listen to anything else." But I'm interested in other things as people.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   There are other religions and they have their books. Why shouldn't I read them as well as this?
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Well now, this is my point. As long as you're saying that, you'll never get to the position in which you'll never be confounded.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   It's impossible. Everything else is some kind of escape from the trials and the stresses and the strains of life.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Here is the only answer, complete answer, the only solution.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Very well, let's look at it. You notice what it calls itself.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   The Apostle puts it like this. He says, "As newborn babes that desire the sincere milk of the Word,"
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   or we may prefer another translation which is better, "desire the pure spiritual milk that you may grow thereby."
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   This is milk. This is food. But this authorized translation, it gives us the meaning. It is a word.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   The Apostle Peter in the first chapter has been dealing with this very thing.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   He's been saying things like this. He says here in these previous verses, in the end of chapter 1,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   "Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   For all flesh," he says, "is as grass, and all the glory of men as the flower of grass.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away. But the Word of the Lord endureth forever.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   And this is the Word which by the gospel is preached unto you."
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   That's what I've been trying to say. Then he goes on, "As newborn babes desire this pure, unadulterated,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   spiritual milk, this Word of God, that ye may grow thereby."
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   And later he says, "Now, it is contained in the Scripture." It's the same thing.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   They are both descriptions of this book and its contents.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Now, here is the first proposition, therefore.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   That if in a world in which all the glory of men is fading and withering and drooping and dying, all the glory,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   of course, this modern world of ours is most interesting and extraordinary.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   I suppose there's never been a more interesting time in the whole history of the human race.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   What I mean by that is this. Never, perhaps, has history, or any point in history,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   proved so perfectly and completely the basic statement of the Bible.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   What is that? Well, it's this.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   This curious paradox about men, his glory and his failure, and both at the same time.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   See, here's a world which conquers the force of gravity, can penetrate up into that outer space.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   It's happened again this week, a marvelous achievement, all right, and the papers are glowing in pride.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Quite rightly, it's an astounding achievement.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Yes, but don't forget, that's what you saw in one half of your newspaper, wasn't it?
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   What did you see in the other half? Crisis. Fear, foreboding, what's going to happen?
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   Yes, it's all right.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   All flesh is as grass, and all the glory of men as the flower of grass.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   It may be this very glorious achievement that is going to lead to the final calamity.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   So that as man is building up his glory, he's at the same time beginning to ruin it.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   There's a sort of worm there at the roots, and it's all going to come toppling down.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Now, the Bible's always said that. Now, the modern world is proving it, it's illustrating it.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   And what it says, therefore, is this, that in this world, where all the glory of men is as the flower of the grass,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   and that the grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   and everything is disappearing and vanishing in our sight,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   but the word of the Lord endureth forever.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   This isn't going to end. There's no end to the glory of this.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   There's no corruption here. It's a pure, it's a spiritual world.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   This has got life and vigor and power and substance.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   This is going to last forever.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   And this is the world which by the gospel is preached unto you.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   So you see, if we are looking for this place where we'll never be confounded,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   there's one thing to do, and one thing only. Come straight to this.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   The only thing that's going to abide when everything else has vanished and has disappeared.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Well, what is this?
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Let's look at what it claims for itself. We call this book the Bible.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   What is it? What I want to do tonight is to look at it as a whole.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   People so often miss the whole message of the Bible.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   They're so immersed and involved in particular details, they've never seen the whole message.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   This is a great big book, but it's only one message. It's really only one thing to say.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   It says it in many different ways. It illustrates it endlessly.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   It shows how this one thing has been continuing when other nations have come and have gone.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   That's why this history is so interesting.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   These great dynasties that arose and went down, but something went on all the time.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   What was that? The word of God.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   This pure, unadulterated, spiritual milk.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   This went on when everything else was coming and was going.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   And that's really all the Bible has got to say.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Well, now then, what does it claim for itself?
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Well, the first and obvious big matter is that it claims for itself that it is God's word.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   The word of the Lord, the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   That's what it calls itself. That's what it claims to be.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   It's got many different ways of putting this.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   The apostle Paul, in writing to the Romans, at the beginning of the third chapter, he calls it there,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   the oracles of God.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   These bits of wisdom, these oracles that have come from God.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Now, that's the claim which we make for this book.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   I do trust that this is being quite clear.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   I'm not standing here tonight to put before you my ideas of life,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   or what I think we should do and how we should live, and what I think is likely to happen.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   I'm not an astrologer. I'm not trying to look into a glass and giving some kind of prophecy.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   I'm not a seer. I don't claim that I've got any understanding.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   All I've got to do is to hold the message of this book before you. Why?
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Well, because it is the word of God.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   Now, that's the thing that puts this into a category quite on its own immediately.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   This is not a collection of men's thoughts.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   If you're not clear about this, my friend, I don't expect you to believe its message.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   The only reason for believing this message is that it's God's message.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   It doesn't come from men.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Men wrote it, but the men who wrote it said it wasn't their idea.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   The word of the Lord came, they say to me.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   They were given a message, and they began to write, after having first spoken, many of them,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   this word that thus came to them and that was given to them.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Here is something, I say, that's true of nothing else in the world at this moment.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   All your books, they're very good, but what are they?
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Well, they're men trying to understand.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   It's all right, you read them. I'm not saying you shouldn't read them,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   if you've got the time and the interest and the leisure and the energy,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   and you really are on a sure foundation,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   and you know that you're ready to meet anything that's coming.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   All right, you read them. Read your philosophers, read your poets,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   read all these men who put on paper their thoughts, their imaginations,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   their hopes and fears and ideas. All right.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   But remember, you're only dealing with the thoughts and the theories
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   and the ideas of men and women like yourself.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Nothing else.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Some of them are great, and they stand on tiptoe.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   They can see a bit higher and a bit further than the rest of us,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   but they're only men.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   They can't get their feet off the ground, as it were.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   They can't see into that impenetrable mystery that eludes them.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   It's eluded the centuries.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Neither is this book just a collection of the experiences of men.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   There are people who think that it's that. It isn't that.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Well, what is it?
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   Well, here it is. This is what it claims.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   And this is the truth concerning it.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   This is God himself revealing himself and the truth to us.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   That is why we should thank God for it and prize it tonight
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   above everything else in the world.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   You see, here we are. We've got our own ideas.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   We've been trying to think.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   We've looked ahead, as I was showing last Sunday night.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   But we find we're wrong.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Other men have tried the same. They're no more successful than we are.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   The greatest philosopher the world has ever known, apart from Christ,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   in the end is a fool. He doesn't know. He can't get there.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Now, we should thank God for this,
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   that what we cannot do, God has done for us.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   We want to know, but we can't.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Can a man, by searching, find out God? No, he cannot.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Thousands have tried it, but they've completely failed.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   But here is the message that God, in his own kindness and grace and mercy,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   has been pleased to grant us a revelation.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   He's told us about it.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Here is God speaking.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Not men speaking, not men trying to find out, but God making known.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   That's the meaning of revelation.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   It's like God, as it were, drawing back a veil and giving us a view of something.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   You've sat in a theater, haven't you, and you were just looking at a curtain,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   and you didn't know what was at the back of the curtain.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Suddenly the curtain opens, and you're looking at a scene.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Well, that's a kind of revelation.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   The drawing back of the curtains has enabled you to see.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   That's revelation. What have we got here?
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Well, here is God making known to the human race these vital things
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   that are essential to our happiness,
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   that are essential to our coming into a position in which we shall never be confounded.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   What does he talk about? What is the revelation?
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Well, it is a revelation about God himself.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   And you've got to start with God,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   because there wouldn't be a universe if there were not for God.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   You wouldn't be if there wasn't a God.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   There'd be nothing. There'd be no problem.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   If God himself had not made everything.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   So the first thing we want to know is about God.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   And he reveals it. He's told us things about himself.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   All our ideas about God are wrong.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   We make God in our own image always, and we are terribly wrong.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   God is not like our thoughts of him.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   His thoughts are entirely different, as Isaiah puts it in his 55th chapter.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   But God has been pleased to tell us things about himself.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   He's made himself now.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Not only that, he has given us knowledge and information about the world,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   and about man.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Not only that, he's given us profound knowledge here about history,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   and the meaning of history, and the purpose of history, and the end of history.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Now, my friends, isn't this the very thing you want to know tonight?
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Isn't this the problem of problems?
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   I hope we've all got beyond the stage of just thinking of our own little whims and moods,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   and feelings, and pinpricks, and all the childish complaints that we all suffer from.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   I hope we're getting beyond that and are beginning to ask,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   "Yes, but the great question is not simply how can I be happy,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   but what is the meaning of it all?
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   What's happening in this world?
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   What is this world?
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   What is this whole universe?
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   What's the whole thing about?"
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   That's the question.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   This book is here to answer the question.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Oh, there's no greater tragedy in the world tonight than people's ignorance of the Bible.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   If you only read your Bible and really knew its message, my friend,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   you'd find many of your problems disappearing,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   like the snow before the midday sun.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Here is the whole thing that you need to know.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   Why don't you read it?
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   The trouble is with people, they talk about the Bible instead of reading it.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   They've never read it, most of them.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   They know nothing about its content.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   If you were to ask them, "What is the great message of the Bible?"
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   They don't know.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   And yet that's the thing that is essential to having your feet on this rock that will never shake,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   to being in a position in which you'll never be confounded.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Now, there then is in general the subject matter.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   This is the thing that God has been pleased to reveal.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Let me come and be a little more particular.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   Surely the first urgent question we ask is this,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   "Why are things as they are?"
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   That's the question, isn't it?
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   I have described to you the contradiction in men, the glory and the misery,
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   the phenomenal achievement, and yet the ugliness and the foulness.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   I know it's a great thing that man has done that he can thus master that mighty force of gravity.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   But why is it that he doesn't know how to live?
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   What's the point of conquering the force of gravity if you can't control the force of your own lusts within you?
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   That's the question.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   And here's man, you see, at one and the same time, conquering that and completely failing to master himself.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   There's a very wise word at the end of the 16th chapter of the book of Proverbs.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   It says, "He that controleth his spirit is greater than he that taketh a city."
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Quite right.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   There have been great captains, great generals, great marshals.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   They could take any city you like.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Alexander the Great and others.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   They couldn't control their own spirits.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Alexander the Great died at a very early age, somewhere around about 33 if I remember rightly.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   And according to the authorities, he died as the outcome of lust.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   He could take cities he couldn't control himself.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Now that's men, you see. That's men's whole trouble. That's his whole problem still.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   So the question is, why is man like that?
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Why is the world as it is?
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Glorious achievement, yet terrible possibilities.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   What's the matter?
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Surely that's the great question.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And until we face that question and have an answer to it, there's no point in going any further.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Unless we are clear as to the cause of our ills, what hope is there of our ever dealing with them or curing them?
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   And this is the first thing we all need to know.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Here is the explanation given to us.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   I wrote to you that third chapter of the book of Genesis at the beginning
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   because there is a wonderful summary and synopsis of it all.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Isn't it strange that modern man, in order to understand himself and his world,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   has still got to go back to the book of Genesis and chapter 3?
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   But you've got to, my friend, those first three chapters are still the only adequate explanation of why the world is as it is.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   What is it? Well, here it is.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   I'm giving you a summary tonight of the one great message of this book.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Here it is.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   You start with creation.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that in them is.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   And God created man.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   And everything was perfect.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   God looked at it all and saw that it was good.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   That was the beginning.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   The world hasn't always been like this.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Oh, the world came out of the hands of God and it had got the mark and the stamp, the trademark of God upon it.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   And God's trademark is absolute perfection.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   God never sends out a product that has any blemish in it.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   There's never any fault in any part of anything that God has ever made.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   You can't say that about any human product, can you?
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   You may look at a car, it looks very wonderful, but there may be a bolt missing somewhere.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   There's no such thing in all your manufacturing as absolute perfection, something entirely free from blemish.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   But when God made the universe, including men, he made it all perfect.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   There was nothing wrong at all.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   And men lived in a place called paradise.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   And his life is depicted in the second chapter of that book of Genesis.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Well, there it is.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Well, now then, here's our question.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Why is the world as it is then?
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Why are we all looking for a place on which we can rest?
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Why are we all looking for something which will enable us to say that I'll never be confounded?
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Why is there any danger of my being confounded?
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   What's wrong with the world?
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   What's wrong with me?
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   What's wrong with life?
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   What's wrong with everybody?
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   You heard it in that third chapter of Genesis, didn't you?
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   The devil and evil.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Now, this is a mystery.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   The Bible doesn't answer all our questions here.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   We're not meant to know, obviously.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   But we are given quite enough.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   What happened is this.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   That one of those angelic beings that God had made and created before he ever made this world
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   rebelled against him in pride and in arrogance and fell.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   And others followed him.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   There was a kind of cosmic fall.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   There was a fall in the angelic realm before this world was ever made.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   And what we are told is that this chief angelic being that rebelled against God and fell called the devil
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   entered into this perfect world of God.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   And as you saw, tempted the woman and the man.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   And they listened to the temptation.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   And that is the whole cause of our trouble.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   The universe, the world, men which were perfect have become imperfect.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   That is what is called the fall.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   Now, this is a mystery.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   And we are told that this angelic being that rebelled against God and fell called the devil
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   entered into this perfect world of God.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   And that is the whole cause of our trouble.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   The universe, the world, men which were perfect have become imperfect.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   That is what is called the fall of men.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   Now, there is nothing that I know of that is quite so ridiculous from the standpoint of thought
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   as the way in which people won't even consider that they are ridiculous.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   And yet it's the only explanation of why they are in trouble.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   You can't get away from it.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   You can't explain it in any other way.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   So, what is the cause of all troubles?
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   The cause of all causes?
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   The fall of man?
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   What does it lead to?
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   What did it lead to?
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   What does it mean?
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   It means this.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   That man who has been made for companionship and fellowship and communion with God
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   and which he'd enjoyed so richly in that idyllic, perfect life of paradise,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   man becomes separated from God.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   He becomes estranged.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   And he becomes frightened in the world which he'd formerly enjoyed
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   so that when he hears the voice of God he runs to hide behind a tree.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   He's afraid of God.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   He feels God's against him.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   Isn't that something we all know a great deal about?
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   The fear of life, the fear of God, feeling that he's against...
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   It all began there.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   And here it is, this estrangement from God that always leads to fear.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   But it didn't stop at that, unfortunately.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   When man, in his desire to know, that's always been his trouble, you see.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   He wants to be as God.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   He wants to take of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   He's not content with living a life under God and obeying God and being directed by God.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   He wants to direct himself.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Man's always been a fool.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   He believes he can do it and he always makes a mess of it
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   and brings himself down and brings misery on his head.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   He began doing it there. He's been doing it ever since.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   And he's still trying to do it.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   He won't submit to God.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   That's why the world continues as it is.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Man will not submit to God.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   He still believes he can do it,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   that he's got the knowledge of good and evil that will enable him to do it.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   You see, the result was, I say, that all his powers have become affected.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Man is no longer perfect in any sense.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   This fall from God and distrangement from God
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   affected the highest thing in man, his spirit.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   And because man is meant to be controlled by spirit,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   all else that is in him is now working under a wrong management
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   and is therefore not working properly.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Things are working against one another instead of working together.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   Man was endowed with instincts by God at the beginning
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   and the instincts are very good and very right.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Yes, but the moment your instincts govern you, it's very wrong.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   It's all wrong.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   And that is the position.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   Man's powers have become affected.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   And what does it lead to?
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Well, you've got it all in those early chapters of Genesis.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   It began to lead to selfishness.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   It began to lead to a struggle.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   Thorns, briers came in.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   It began to lead to turmoil.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   It began to lead to sweating.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   It began to lead to insecurity.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   There it is.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   But on top of that, you remember,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   our Lord God said that he'd set enmity between the seed of the serpent
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   and the seed of the woman,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   and it's gone on ever since.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   This is a world of temptation, a world of sin,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   a world in which it's very difficult to go straight and to keep straight,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   a world in which it's very difficult to keep your purity
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   and your chastity and your honesty
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   and your inward cleanliness, isn't it?
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   It's a world that's against us.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   We're having to fight the world.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   All this concern about the moral problem today
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   is bearing eloquent testimony to this.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   The authorities scarcely know what to do.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Well, what's the cause of it all?
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Well, the world has become an evil place.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   There are powers and forces against us.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   We can't see them, but they're there.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   It's the seed of the serpent fighting against the seed of man.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   It hadn't happened until the fall.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   It's been happening ever since.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   Not only that, man has become the slave of this evil power, the devil.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   He's the god of this world.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   He's the prince of the power of the air,
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   We're all, by nature, under the power of the devil.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   We go wrong more easily than we go right.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   It's easier to go down than to go up.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   This is the whole trouble as the result of the fall of man.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   And on top of it all is God's judgment.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   He cursed the ground.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   Man is punished when he doesn't obey God.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   You see, this is the explanation.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   It's no use expecting God to bless us.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   It's no use expecting everything to be all right.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   God cursed the ground when men sinned.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Man's punished, driven out of the garden.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   He's got to work by the sweat of his brow.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   This is all God's punishment of man's rebellion and sin and fall.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   It's still going on, my friends.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   That's why the world is as it is.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   And the last thing I want to remind you of under this heading is this.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   When God drove man out of that paradise, out of that garden,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   you remember what he did?
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   He put cherubims and a flaming sword guarding the entry.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   What's that mean?
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   It means this.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   Man is always trying to get back to paradise.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   That's the whole of history, and especially the history of every civilization that has ever been.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   Man, you see, has got within him a recollection of something that he once was.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   We've all got it.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   It's in every human being that's born.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   We are not always conscious of it, but whether we are conscious of it or not,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   it's a fact about us every one.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   We've all got a feeling that we were meant for something better.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Man's always interested in utopia.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   He's always trying to get back to the paradise of the garden, but he can't.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   God's flaming sword, the cherubim, are still there,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   and man's not allowed to go back and partake of that tree of life.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   He's always trying.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   He believes he can do it.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   He never can, and he will not submit to this, and that's the cause of his difficulty.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   He's trying to do the impossible.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   He can't do it.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   God won't allow him to do it.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   Man can never get this rest apart from God.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   The flaming sword of God is ever there standing between him and it.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Now then, there is the revelation that's given with regard to the cause of our ills.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   Can't you see that you've got there a full explanation of the whole course of human history
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   from the very dawn until tonight?
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   There have been times when men rarely seem to be getting back to paradise.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   It suddenly all goes.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Always like that.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   They believed that they were at the point of entering at the end of the last century,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   the beginning of this.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   Suddenly it all went wrong.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   It's always like that, the flaming sword.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   Man will never make a utopia.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Man will never, by his own effort, find the place of rest and peace and satisfaction.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   That's the great fundamental postulate of the Bible from beginning to end.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Very well.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Thank God I don't stop there.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   The Bible goes on.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   What's it say?
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   Well, it says this, that in spite of everything that I've been saying, God has got a plan.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   He's got a way of enabling us to come back to the place of rest and peace and communion
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   with him so that we shall never be confounded.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   But this is the thing.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   It is God's way.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   It is God's plan.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   And it is only possible to us as long as we submit ourselves to it.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   What is it?
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Well, now let me give you a summary of it tonight.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   Did you notice, as I read this portion of Scripture last week, have you read it since?
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   I hope you have, and I hope you'll study it because the whole explanation is here in these
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   twelve verses.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Did you notice what we read in verses nine and ten?
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   Listen to it.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people"
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   – that's the word, the word "people" – "a peculiar people, or a people for God's
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   own peculiar possession, that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   out of darkness into his marvelous light."
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   Listen.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   "Which in times past were not the people, but are now the people of God."
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   That's the word, the word "people."
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   What is God's plan?
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   Well, God's plan can be put like this.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   Here is the human race, fallen, sinful, warring, unhappy, dissatisfied, ill at ease, the slave
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   of the devil, ever fighting and struggling, hoping, disappointed.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   That's the whole of life.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   That's man as a result of the fall.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   What is God's purpose?
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   Well, here is God's purpose, to make for himself a people.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   He'd made the original man, that out of him he might have a people for himself.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   But it all went wrong.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   There it is, still wrong.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   What's God's purpose?
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   Oh, to make a new people for himself.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   To have this gathering of people who will fulfill his original intention, who will be
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   in a right state of communion with him, a royal priesthood and holy nation, people who
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   have become a temple unto the Lord, to offer up spiritual sacrifice.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   He wants a people.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   God made man that he might have a people, that he might enjoy the communion and the
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   companionship of this people.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   And God is still interested in having a people unto himself.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   Now, that's the great message of the Bible.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   God calling out a people unto himself from fallen, sinful, hopeless humanity.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Let me show you what I mean.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   You find him beginning to do it away back there at the very beginning of Genesis.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   A division comes in.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   All are equally fallen and in sin.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   Yes, but God is going to take some of them out and make a new people for himself.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   Do you know when he began?
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   Well, he began in the case of the two sons of Adam and Eve.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   The name of one was Abel and the name of the other was Cain.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   They were both equally the children of Adam and Eve.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   Born of the same parents, equally sinful, equally hopeless, equally under the curse
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   of God because of sin and the fall.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   Abel, Cain, two brothers, two members of humanity.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   But do you remember what happened?
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   There came a division.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   Abel, the man of God.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Abel belonging to the people of God.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   Cain remaining where he was in the sin and the shame and the failure and under the curse
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   of God, a fugitive, a vagabond, trying to solace himself by building a city.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   Yes, how typical of the whole of the human race, unredeemed.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   Trying to get happiness in this world, this life, by his own exertions and efforts, civilization.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   He never got it.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   Abel, Cain.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   Here's a new people beginning a new humanity.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   Then you go on and read about the birth of another son after Cain had murdered Abel.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   You see, that's it, that warfare, that jealousy, that envy, that spite.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   It's all there, my friend.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   If you want to understand your modern world, go back and read Genesis.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   There it is.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   Same thing at one another's throats, jealous envy trying to get his murder.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   But that doesn't frustrate the purpose of God.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   Adam and Eve had another child.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   His name was Seth.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   And it's through him this line is going to be continued.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   This is the message.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   This new people.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   Let me hurry along.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   You go on, this line of Seth now, this is the line that's developing into a people.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   Then there's a big step in the case of a man called Abram.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   Here's a man called out and God says to him, look here,
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   "Through you and through you a seed.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   I'm going to bless all the nations of the earth.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   It is from you and out of your lines that my people are going to come through thee and thy seed."
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   Very well, it goes on.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   Here is the crucial promise.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   You don't understand your Bible unless you understand this call of Abram
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   and the promise and the covenant made with Abram.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   God's going to produce a people out of him.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Multitudinous as the very stars of the heaven or like the bits of sand upon the seashore.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   This people of God that's going to come out of the seed of Abraham.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   This is what God is doing, this people that he's talking about.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   Then you see Abram has two sons.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   One's called Ishmael, the other's called Isaac.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   Yes, but there's a division again.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   It isn't Ishmael.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   Not through Ishmael is thy seed going to develop.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   It's not out of Ishmael my people are going to come.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   Isaac, in Isaac shall thy seed be.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   In Isaac my people are going to develop.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   So it turned out.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   Then you come to a man called Jacob.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   But then you see over against him you've got an Esau.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   Isaac had two children, Jacob and Esau.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   You might much prefer Esau as a natural man.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   He seems to be much better, much nicer fellow.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   Yes, but you know he isn't God's man.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   He isn't the one out of whom the people of God are going to come.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   It's Jacob.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   Not Esau.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   Jacob have I loved, Esau have I hated.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   God calling out a people.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   This is what he's been doing.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   And on and on and on it goes.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   The whole history of the Jews.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   The twelve sons of Jacob and their progeny.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   This is the people being developed.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   The children of Israel.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   The nation of the Jews.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   God's people.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   They were called that.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   He separated them from all the nations of the earth.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   He made a people for himself.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   They were not like the other nations.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   They were a nation and yet there was a difference.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   They were set apart.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Why?
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   Well they were God's people.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   And he deals with them in an unusual and in a special manner.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   Do you remember how before he gave them the law he uttered these very words to them which Peter is quoting here in the ninth verse.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   "Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, and holy nation, a peculiar people."
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   God said unto those children of Israel,
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   "Look here I'm going to take you into that land of Canaan, a land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   You are my people you know.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   And you're in a very separate position.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   I'm going to do things for you I'm not going to do for anybody else.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   You are my own peculiar position.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   And I'm going to care for you.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   You're going to be like the apple of my eye.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   I'll keep your enemies back.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   I'll feed you in the wilderness.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   You'll never lack water.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   Your feet will never swell.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   I'm going to direct you.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   If only you obey me.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   I'm going to give you ten commandments.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   I'm going to give you a law.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   You keep them nothing will ever harm you."
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   That's what he said to them.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   In other words he said, "Though you're surrounded by enemies.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   Though you're surrounded by other nations that will be jealous of you and try to destroy you.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   You obey me and live as I tell you to live.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   Nothing shall ever touch you or harm you."
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   He gave them these great and glorious promises.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   And he told them that his hand of blessing would be upon them.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   That in spite of everything,
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   they would know a place of safety and of rest in this uncertain life and world.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   It was to them that he said this very thing that Peter is quoting here.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   "Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture."
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   Isaiah 28, 16.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   It was to the Jews he said it.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   To the children of Israel.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   "Behold I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone elect precious.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   And he that believeth on him shall not be confounded."
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   God went to those children of Israel and said,
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   "You needn't be in this trouble you know.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   You needn't be excited.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   You needn't make alliances with Egypt.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   You needn't be building up armaments.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   Come back to me, realize you're my people.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   Submit to me, I'll keep you.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   You'll never be confounded."
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   That's the promise he made to them.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   That's the promise he always makes.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   And in this old book called the Old Testament,
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   you see the history of how God led those people.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   And how he blessed them when they obeyed him.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   Then they went wrong and they got into trouble and difficulties.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   They then realized their folly.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   They went back to God and confessed it.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   And asked him to have mercy.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   And he again delivered them.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   Oh how many times it happened.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   You see that's God dealing with his people.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   And telling them in so many different ways,
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   "It's possible for you to be in a place that you'll never be confounded.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   I want you to be like that.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   I made you for that.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   I've called you for that.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   Listen to me."
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   That's the great message of the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   And then you come to the New Testament.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   And here is the end.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   Here is the big thing towering over everything else.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   All that I've been talking about has but been a preparation.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   It was confined only to the Jews.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   But now comes one who stands alone.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   Jesus of Nazareth, Son of God, Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   Here is the one through whom God's purpose of getting this people to himself is really to be seen.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   All that had happened was really done for his sake.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   They were called in order that he might come out of them.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   He is the seed of Abraham.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   And he came into this world and did what I'm hoping to tell you later.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   In order that God's great purpose might be carried out.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   And the result of his coming was this.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   That unto these Jews were now added Gentiles who believe in Jesus.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   The people now consist not only of Jews but also of Gentiles.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   This is the thing the Apostle Paul could never get over.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   That God's people is not confined to the Jews.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   Anybody who believes in Christ, he whosoever calleth on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   He preached peace to them that are afar off as well as to them that are nigh.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   It's no longer a message to one nation only.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   All the nations of the earth as he promised Abraham can be blessed in this person.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   If they but believe in him, God's people.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   Then what is the meaning of this present age says someone.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   I can tell you.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   This is the age of the church.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   What is the church?
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   It is the gathering of the people of God.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   The church is the place into which God brings these people that he is calling out from this fallen sinful humanity.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   Here are his people.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   The church is his people.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   Peter quotes to the church the Gentiles what God had said to the Jews only in Exodus 19.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Here it is in verse 9 of this one Peter second chapter.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   Here is the people of God.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   The church.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   Jews are in it.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   Gentiles are in it.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   Anybody who believes can come into it.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   It is the people of God.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   And the meaning of this present age in which you and I are living,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   the age that started at Calvary and that is still going on is just this.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   That God is adding unto his people.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   The program of Christianity is not to reform, not to improve, not to change the world.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   No, no.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   What God is doing is to call people out of the world into this people of his,
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   into this kingdom of his.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   You shall be a kingdom of priests.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   You are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a kingdom of priests if you like,
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   a holy nation.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   The nation is the church.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   This is the new nation.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   A people for God's own peculiar possession and that is the meaning of this age.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   The age is not improving.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   And the idea that Christianity is here to improve or to reform the world
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   is a blank contradiction of the whole message of the scriptures.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   No, no.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   The world was doomed and condemned when men fell in paradise.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   And what God has been doing ever since has been to create a new people for himself
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   out of that world of fallen humanity.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   And everyone who believes in Christ, the Son of God,
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   and his death for his sins enters into these people and is added to the nation
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   and is growing and is developing and is going on.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   But for me to close, what is the end?
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   What is the ultimate purpose?
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   The ultimate purpose is this,
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   the restoration of God's world and universe to its original condition.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   That's God's purpose.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   That's why he is preparing this people.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   He is preparing a people that are going to people
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   and live in the renovated, regenerated universe.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   That's the foreview of history.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   That is the end which God has in view.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   Satan and evil are going to be finally defeated and routed.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   Satan is already a conquered foe.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   Christ defeated him completely.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   In his life and still more in his death and resurrection,
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   the enemy is already defeated.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   He is already in chains and he is already doomed.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   His end is certain, it's coming.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   And all evil will be destroyed with him.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   When will that be?
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   Oh, that will be when the Son of God comes back again
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   to judge the world, to make this final separation.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   There will be his people.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   There will be all who are not his people,
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   who have not believed on the Son of God as their Savior
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   and as their Redeemer.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   And they will go to everlasting destruction.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   But he will also purge this world,
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   even the physical universe, of every trace of sin.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   Oh, there's going to be a great purging by fire.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   The elements will melt with a fervent heat.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   And all the dross and the alloy will be destroyed.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   There will be a new universe,
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   And this people that God has been preparing
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   throughout the running centuries shall be living in it.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   And if you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   you'll be living in it.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   You'll be one of his people.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   You'll be a citizen in this new Jerusalem,
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   this new earth, under that new heaven.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   There'll be no evil, no Satan, no sin, no war, no misery.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   There'll be war and all the rest of it until then,
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   but not after that.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   Then men will be back again in paradise,
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   the garden of God.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   You see, the Son of God can admit us back.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   He can deal with the cherubim and the flaming sword.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   Nobody else can.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   Everybody else has tried and failed.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   He has succeeded.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   He's already done it.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   He's gone in.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   And he'll come back and bring us in with him.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   He'll call us in.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   He'll lead us in to the paradise of God,
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   to the restoration, to the favor of God,
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   and the full unmixed blessing of God.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   My friend, do you want to know the point
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   and the place in which you'll never be confounded?
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   It's this.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   It's to believe that.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   It's to believe that whole message.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   That's all.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   That's exactly what it means.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   That is the thing that God has revealed in this book.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   And so, you see, if you believe this,
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   well, it doesn't matter what happens to you in this life.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   If you believe this,
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   you're not surprised at the state of the world tonight, are you?
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   A Christian never expects the world to be better than it is.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   Indeed, the Christian is amazed that it isn't worse.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   Were it not for the restraining grace and the common grace of God,
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   it would be infinitely worse.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   The Christian's not surprised that the world is as it is.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   It must be like this.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   While man is the slave of the devil,
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   and commanded and governed by his lusts and passions and desires.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   It's inevitable.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   So the Christian is not confounded.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   And though things become much worse,
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   though the utter insanity of the use of these bombs may take place,
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   the Christian not only will not be surprised, he won't be shaken.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   His world won't collapse.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   Though he be regarded as a fool, he won't be surprised.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   The Son of God was regarded as a fool.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   Though he be thrown into prison, he won't be surprised.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   It's happened to the saints throughout the centuries.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   Though men spit at him, it won't take him by surprise.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   Though his health may go, though everything may go, he's not surprised.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   The Son of God had no place whereon to lay his head.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   Foxes have earls, he said, but the birds of the air have nests.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   But the Son of God hath not where to lay his head.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   The Christian's never surprised, never disappointed.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   This is what he's been taught to expect.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   He's got a view of past, present and future.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   God has shown it him.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   And what he knows is this,
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   that as long as he's one of the people of God,
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   nothing can ever harm him.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   Nothing can ever rob him of the glory that is coming.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   He knows it's absolutely safe.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   That Christ has gone to prepare a place for him, and has said,
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   "And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself,
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   that where I am there ye may be also."
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   All right, says the Christian, that's all I want.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   As long as you are coming to take me to be where you are,
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   let the wolves and hell do what they like to me.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   It doesn't matter.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   Nothing can ever confound me.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   One of the people of God.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   My dear friend, are you one of the people of God?
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   Do you know that you're one of the people of God?
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   Do you see this plan, this scheme? Do you believe it?
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   Are you in it?
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   Do you see that God sent his only son into the world to make you one of his people?
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   To get rid of your guilt, to adopt you, give you the new nature,
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   make you a joint heir with him.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   Do you believe it?
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   If you do, take it from me, you're one of the people of God,
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   and you're destined for that renovated cosmos.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   Here's the one question that matters.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   Do you know that you're one of the people of God?
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   Do you know that God is your father, your keeper,
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   the one who loves you with an everlasting love?
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   Do you know it?
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   If you know that, it doesn't matter what else happens to you.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   All is well.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   Make certain of it, my friend.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   Recognize the truth of this old book,
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   and believe on the Son of God as your Savior, Redeemer,
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   and surrender your life to him as your Lord.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   Amen.
