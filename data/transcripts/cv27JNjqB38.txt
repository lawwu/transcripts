[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.640]   - Good Monday, everyone,
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.080]   on this day before Independence Day
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.620]   here in the United States.
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.520]   Last time, last week, we addressed sibling rivalries,
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.040]   a common theme in the Bible
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.060]   and a concern we should have for our own homes today.
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.980]   Sibling rivalries was Thursday's theme in APJ 1954,
[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.320]   was the episode number.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.780]   And today we look at forgiving family members.
[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.560]   The question is from a listener to the podcast,
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.360]   a young man who lives in Brazil.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.920]   He writes this,
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.140]   hello, Pastor John, thank you for this podcast,
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.340]   which has been a huge resource God has used
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.260]   in my own sanctification.
[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.960]   My question for you is this,
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.420]   my family struggles to forgive each other
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.100]   and it's been this way for years.
[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.700]   They argue along the line
[00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.960]   that even Jesus was harsh with his enemies.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.680]   So why should I forgive my enemies?
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.760]   How would you answer them in dealing with hurt in the past?
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.820]   What is the difference between Jesus dealing
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.620]   with his enemies like the Pharisees
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.680]   contrasted with what God expects from us
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.760]   in dealing with our own family members
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.240]   who have sinned against us?
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.140]   - This is utterly crucial.
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.340]   It's a matter of life and death,
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.660]   and I mean eternal life and death,
[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.280]   as we will see in just a moment.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.100]   So I take this question really seriously
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.100]   and I hope this family will take the issue seriously also.
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.440]   First, let's clarify what forgiveness is and isn't.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.560]   That's a huge stumbling block for a lot of people
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.400]   when they start arguing about
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.920]   whether they should forgive or not,
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.560]   that they don't pause to define what it is and isn't.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.400]   So let's do that.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.960]   Number one, forgiveness is not thinking or saying
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.280]   or acting as though no great wrong was done.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.380]   A great wrong may well have been done against you.
[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.380]   Number two, forgiveness is not reestablishing
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.060]   a wonderful relationship.
[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.520]   In Romans 12, 18, Paul said, "If possible,
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.380]   so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all."
[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.320]   It may not be possible.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.780]   He also said in Colossians 3, 13, "Bear with one another,
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.420]   and if one has a complaint against another,
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.100]   forgive each other."
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.660]   Now, bearing with one another
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.660]   means literally endure one another, forbear one another.
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.100]   In other words, there will be frustrating, annoying,
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.700]   even hurtful things about others
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.960]   that no amount of forgiveness will fix.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.440]   And they must be endured.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.840]   We must bear with them.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.560]   You'll see why in a minute.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.840]   Third, forgiveness does not mean
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.440]   that trust is immediately restored.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.420]   This is crucial.
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.520]   So many think that to forgive is to restore trust,
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.760]   to give trust to someone who has betrayed you.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.040]   But that assumes that the person has reformed
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.880]   and does not have those same untrustworthy patterns of life
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.280]   that made them do wrong.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.920]   But in fact, they may be worse.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.360]   They may be worse, not better.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.480]   Forgiveness may lead to new and deeper trust.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.680]   It may not.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.240]   Number four, forgiveness can be real
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.240]   even if the other person does not accept it or want it.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.880]   They may not think they did anything wrong.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.500]   That's just a huge problem in marriage, for example.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.800]   You want to forgive and they don't think they've wronged you.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.320]   In those cases, the full transaction of repentance
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.480]   and forgiveness is not possible,
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.480]   but a forgiving spirit is still possible.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.560]   And if that is all we can give,
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.800]   because they don't want our forgiveness,
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.800]   then the Lord counts that, that forgiving spirit,
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.360]   as our forgiveness.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.320]   We've done it.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.560]   We've done what we can do.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.400]   We have shown that we are a forgiving person.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.500]   You can love your enemy
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.480]   even while he remains your enemy, if he chooses.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.480]   So then, if that's what forgiveness is not, what is it?
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.680]   Forgiveness is wanting the good,
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.680]   not the ruin of the one who wronged you.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.640]   In spite of the wrong and then acting for their good.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.760]   You won't let the wrong strangle your love.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.000]   You won't let their sin make you sin.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.160]   You will lay it down and pray for their good
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.860]   and work for it.
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.720]   Okay, with those clarifications in mind,
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.120]   why do I say forgiveness is so crucial?
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:25.040]   Number one, you as a Christian have been forgiven
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.080]   an offense that is millions of times greater against God
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.360]   than any human has offended or sinned against you.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.040]   Ephesians 4:32 says, "Be kind to one another,
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.820]   tenderhearted, forgiving one another,
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.820]   as God in Christ forgave you."
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:51.840]   The outrage of the way you have treated God
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:58.360]   in your sin and unbelief was so great,
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.360]   it cost God the death of his only divine son to forgive you.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.880]   In other words, your debt was infinite.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.880]   Nobody who has wronged you has ever come close
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.960]   to wronging you as badly as you have wronged God.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.340]   And yet we are forgiven.
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.080]   You and I, Christian, are forgiven.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.220]   What would it mean if we refused to forgive?
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.160]   Here's what it would mean.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.160]   It would mean we think God is a fool to forgive us.
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.520]   He's acting like a fool because I'm not gonna act like that.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.920]   I'm not gonna be stupid and foolish like that.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.320]   So God must be foolish to forgive me
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.040]   since I'm not gonna forgive.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.240]   That's pretty serious.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.080]   Let that sink in.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.280]   That's very serious to think God's a fool
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.400]   or act like he's a fool.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.880]   Number two, our friend in Brazil says
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.340]   that his unforgiving relatives say,
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.400]   "Even Jesus was harsh with his enemies.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.540]   Why should I forgive my enemies?"
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.960]   One answer is because Jesus forgave his enemies.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.640]   Hanging on the cross to purchase our forgiveness,
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.620]   he said, "Father, forgive them.
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.480]   They know not what they do."
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.000]   Of course he was harsh with the Pharisees and scribes.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.160]   Good grief.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.080]   And the reason he was harsh with them
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.000]   is because they were so unforgiving.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.920]   But while being harsh, he was on his way to die for them
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.780]   if they would only trust him.
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.180]   So Jesus forgave his enemies.
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.640]   Number three, Jesus said,
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.140]   "If we don't forgive, we won't be forgiven."
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.220]   Matthew 6, 14.
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.860]   "If you forgive others their trespasses,
[00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.100]   your heavenly Father also will forgive you.
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.380]   If you don't forgive others their trespasses,
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.940]   neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses."
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.060]   And then he told a parable to emphasize
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.240]   this shocking reality.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.700]   The king forgave a slave who owed him zillions.
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.780]   And that's a pretty good translation
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.660]   because the amount is like 20,000 years wages.
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.140]   I mean, it is supposed to sound like zillions.
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.660]   They owed him zillions of dollars.
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.660]   Then the slave went out and wrung the neck
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:36.980]   of a fellow slave who owed him $10.
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.620]   And the king said, "Throw him in prison
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.660]   till he pays everything," which means forever.
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:44.500]   Why?
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.260]   Because in relationship with God,
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.220]   forgiveness must go both ways.
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.940]   God gives and we receive.
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:09:01.340]   That slave did not receive the king's forgiveness.
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.180]   He despised it.
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.500]   He mocked it.
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.140]   He scorned it.
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.420]   He trembled it in the dirt.
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:13.680]   When you won't forgive someone else their debt
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.520]   while claiming to love the God who forgave yours,
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.800]   it's just pure hypocrisy.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.300]   You're acting like God was a fool for forgiving you.
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.700]   And so if you keep on thinking God is a fool,
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.320]   you will perish and not be forgiven.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.300]   Number four, when forgiveness seems hard,
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.700]   think about the reward.
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.140]   That's what Jesus said in Matthew 5, 12.
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.500]   "Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.520]   and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.900]   on my account.
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.900]   Rejoice and be glad for your reward is great in heaven."
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:58.980]   So when the hurt you have received seems so great
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.960]   you can't rejoice and forgive,
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.720]   Jesus says, "Remember your reward.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.060]   Remember your reward.
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.700]   It will be very great."
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:15.660]   One more suggestion from Romans 12, 19 and 20.
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.440]   One of the reasons we stumble over the command to forgive
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.560]   those who've hurt us is the sense
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.860]   that if we don't punish them in some way,
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.240]   they're gonna get away with a great wrong.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.380]   They're gonna get away with a real injustice.
[00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:41.380]   So there's a sense in which our very proper love for justice
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:48.060]   makes us hesitant to let the offense or the hurt go.
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.460]   Just let it go.
[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.820]   We feel that if we let it go,
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.660]   justice will simply not be done.
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:56.840]   And that would be wrong.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.700]   So we justify our vengeance.
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.340]   But the problem with that way of thinking
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:06.340]   is that God has told us precisely that justice will be done
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.440]   and that he will do it.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.760]   He will do it far better than we could ever do it.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.520]   And here's what he says in Romans 12,
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.140]   "Beloved, never avenge yourselves.
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.480]   Leave it to the wrath of God."
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.940]   Now that leaving to God to deal with it
[00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.980]   is part of what goes into forgiveness.
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.380]   You leave it.
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.380]   "For it is written, vengeance is mine.
[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.540]   I will repay.
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.100]   Justice will be done.
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.300]   To the contrary, if your enemy's hungry, feed him.
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.300]   If he's thirsty, give him something to drink.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:43.020]   For by so doing, you will heap burning coals on his head.
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.900]   Do not be overcome by evil.
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.220]   Overcome evil with good."
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.740]   Now, the amazing thing about this promise,
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.020]   I will repay,
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.580]   is that it is true for all the wrongs
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:59.060]   unbelievers do against us
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.420]   and all the wrongs believers do against us.
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:08.480]   If a person wrongs us and never turns to Christ
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.060]   and remains an unbeliever till they die,
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.380]   they will go to hell.
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:18.100]   And all the wrongs that they have ever done
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.660]   will be duly repaid.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:25.060]   Indeed, repaid more terribly
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.120]   than anything we could ever do here.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.460]   So we don't need to do it.
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.060]   We don't need payback.
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:38.260]   If the person who wrongs us is a true Christian
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.020]   or becomes a Christian in their lifetime,
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.420]   having wronged us,
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.620]   if they trust Christ,
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.580]   then the wrong that they did to us
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.060]   with all their other sins
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.700]   was punished in the suffering of Christ.
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.900]   Christ bore the punishment
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.900]   for the sins they committed against us.
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.300]   Let me say that sentence again
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:09.520]   because I just think it would have such a vast impact
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.380]   on the way we treat each other.
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.060]   Christ bore the punishment
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:18.940]   for the sins that they committed against us.
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.020]   Think what that means if we are unwilling
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.060]   to forgive their wrong against us.
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.020]   It means we are acting as if the sufferings of Christ
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:27.940]   were not enough.
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:33.300]   We are making light of the horrors he endured
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:38.500]   to bear the guilt of that wrong committed against us.
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.980]   We do not want to be found in that horrible attitude.
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:43.820]   We don't.
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.540]   That's a dangerous attitude to think
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.740]   that Christ's sufferings are inadequate.
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.420]   So dear friend in Brazil,
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:57.420]   I will pray for your family and for you
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.220]   that they would see the seriousness
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.260]   of what's at stake in not forgiving
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.620]   and that you would seek to be a beautiful example
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.220]   to them of what forgiveness looks like.
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.940]   I will pray for you.
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.940]   I hope you will for me as well.
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.340]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.020]   And if forgiving others is a big hurdle in your life,
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:21.060]   especially if a family member has sinned against you
[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.380]   but refuses to repent of that sin against you,
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.180]   see also an episode titled
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.900]   The Major Obstacle in Forgiving Others.
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.700]   Major Obstacle in Forgiving Others.
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:36.460]   That's ABJ 717, ABJ 717, a key episode.
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.400]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.700]   If you want to ask Pastor John, email us your question.
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.380]   Go to our online home at askpastorjohn.com.
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:50.560]   Well, what does it mean to serve God?
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.200]   And when we do serve God, what do we give him?
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.020]   Two exceptionally important questions
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.820]   that we need to ask and answer coming up
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.180]   in the week ahead of us.
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.100]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.820]   Have a wonderful Independence Day tomorrow,
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.500]   and we will see you again on Thursday.
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:21.660]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
