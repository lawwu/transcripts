[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.960]   - Pastor John, we as humans like to share things.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.520]   We're wired to share and rejoice in great things,
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.860]   but what would you say to someone
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.440]   who has a favorite Bible teacher
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.860]   and they love to boast and brag
[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.440]   about that certain Bible teacher?
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.640]   What would you say to someone who has this tendency?
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.120]   - 1 Corinthians 3, 21 to 23,
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.040]   stopped me dead in my tracks or alive in my tracks.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.700]   Again, as I was meditating the other day,
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.400]   it's simply staggering.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.920]   I mean, I don't think, well, there may be,
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.300]   but I can't think of another passage of the Bible
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.840]   concerning the standing or the position
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.840]   or the wealth or the privilege of the children of God
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.600]   in the universe than this one.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.840]   But before I read it, let me set the stage
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.440]   that I was reading it in.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.460]   I know and am reminded every time I read
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.180]   through 1 Corinthians, which I am again right now,
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.300]   that what got this book started was that the church
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.300]   was being divided by boasting in their favorite teachers.
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.220]   Chapter one, verse 12, I follow Paul, I follow Apollos,
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.980]   I follow Cephas, I follow Christ,
[00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.900]   I'm better than all you jerks
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.100]   who only look at human teachers.
[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.780]   And Paul spends the first four chapters at least
[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.700]   working against this boasting, this pride that he sees
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.420]   in these factions that are breaking out.
[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.220]   And he gives numerous arguments.
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.660]   For example, chapter three, verse six,
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.660]   I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.460]   So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.900]   but only God who gives the growth.
[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.060]   So why are you picking up on Apollos and Paul
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.180]   and exalting us and yourselves in us
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.580]   when God is the one who's giving the growth?
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.720]   And if we have any fruitfulness or effectiveness
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.860]   that's different from the other,
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.540]   then it's owing to God and not to us.
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.140]   So that's the kind of argument he's giving here
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.740]   in these chapters.
[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.940]   And then the most amazing argument of all,
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.700]   the one that stopped me in my tracks,
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.700]   was chapter 321, where he says,
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.700]   let no one boast in men for all things are yours.
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.020]   I mean, just ponder that argument.
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.420]   And then he fills it out.
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.740]   Whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas,
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.340]   so you know he's relating to that issue again,
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.860]   or the world or life or death or the present or the future,
[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.860]   all are yours and you are Christ's and Christ is God's.
[00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.180]   So Paul must have felt that the reason,
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.420]   one of the reasons at least, that we boast in men,
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.380]   that we grab ahold of our favorite teacher
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.380]   and have a vicarious self-exaltation in his primacy,
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.860]   one of the reasons we do that sort of thing
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.060]   is because we have a needy ego
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.020]   that's trying to shore up its significance,
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.740]   shore up its power, its shrewdness, its intelligence,
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.740]   some kind of lack we feel in our significance.
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.700]   And Paul is saying, look,
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.000]   consider for a moment who you are.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.780]   The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.800]   that we are the children of God.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.060]   And if children, then heirs, heirs of God.
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.300]   And what does God own?
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.220]   Everything.
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.420]   And so why would you boast in men
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.460]   when all things are yours?
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.360]   So it's a paradoxical kind of argument
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.060]   because you might think if a person starts to think
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.620]   that they're the child of God
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.880]   and that they're coming into the possession
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.580]   of the whole world as their rightful inheritance,
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.300]   that they would be proud and therefore boast.
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.300]   And he said, no, it doesn't have that effect.
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.500]   It removes the need to boast among men.
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.420]   And in fact, it produces humility and servanthood.
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.700]   All things are yours.
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.700]   The world is yours.
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.020]   Life and death are yours.
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.060]   Everything is yours.
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.100]   And what does it do?
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.460]   Chapter three, verse five.
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.300]   What is Paul?
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.260]   What is Paul's?
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.500]   Servants through whom you believe.
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.100]   In other words, the life we can live, Tony,
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.500]   that I see in this verse is an utter, amazed,
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.140]   peaceful, confident life
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.700]   that everything in the universe is coming to us.
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.120]   It's coming very soon, soon for John Piper.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.740]   So let's join Jesus as servants of all.
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.500]   No boasting in man, trusting Jesus,
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.740]   savoring our reward that's coming, serving all.
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.580]   It's just an incredible way to live.
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.420]   - Yes, it is.
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.240]   Thank you, Pastor John.
