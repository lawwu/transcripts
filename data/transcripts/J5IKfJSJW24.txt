[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   What if you could distill 20 years of investing wisdom
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.280]   into just a few important lessons?
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.560]   Today, we are unpacking critical insights that can help you build
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.640]   a more resilient portfolio and make smarter financial decisions.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.000]   As Ben Carlson says,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.640]   I know plenty of investors who have been at this game for decades
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.000]   who still make the same mistake.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.680]   It's really more about having a process.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.360]   We'll explore why even seasoned investors still struggle with risk
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.800]   and how to create a strategy that gives you confidence in any market.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.480]   Whether you're a novice or a veteran,
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.520]   these lessons will transform how you think about investing
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.960]   and your financial future.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.200]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and if you enjoy this video,

[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.480]   Or if you have a question, please leave it in the comments.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.040]   And if you want to keep upgrading your life, money, and travel,
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.160]   consider subscribing.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.240]   Ben, you said that experience is not the same as expertise in investing.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.680]   What did you mean by that?
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.320]   I think I just became annoyed at all the pitch books
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.560]   I was looking at early on in my investing career
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.280]   where it said we have 134 years of combined experience.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.320]   And if that's enough to be like, okay, we'll give you our money, sure.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.120]   And you found that the whole idea
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.120]   of just because you've been in this game for a long time
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.120]   doesn't necessarily mean that you're an expert on something.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.600]   It doesn't give you the just because you've been doing it for a long time
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.120]   that you have this predictive model
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.040]   or this process about how the world works.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.880]   And my whole point is that, yes, experience helps
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.400]   because if you're investing
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.480]   and you live through a lot of these different market cycles,
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.680]   you kind of pick up on some things.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.960]   But I know plenty of investors who have been at this game for decades
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.240]   who still make the same mistakes
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.720]   or they change their investing strategy all the time
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.200]   and make the same mistakes that you would think
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.080]   some noob just starting out investing would make.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.880]   So it's really more about having a process that you'll stick to.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.640]   That matters more than how many years you've been doing this.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.800]   Yeah. And you say expertise is important,
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.440]   but you also had a lesson that intelligence
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.040]   doesn't guarantee investment success.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.760]   So expertise isn't just intelligence, is it?
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.840]   Right. Well, there's the old Buffett quote that like,
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.720]   "Investing is not a game where the guy with 160 IQ
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.880]   beats the guy with 130 IQ," right?
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.560]   He's like, "You can have the leftover."
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.560]   So it's more about the temperament
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.240]   and the ability to control your emotions
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.160]   and that emotional intelligence is the piece.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.560]   Because when I first started in the investing world
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.480]   and I was this wide-eyed young person,
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.320]   I was really impressed by the smart people,
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.600]   the people who use the jargon
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.840]   and the people who sounded like they knew what they were talking about,
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.520]   the people who made predictions all the time.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.000]   And they were very certain in everything that they were saying.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.920]   And I thought, "Oh, man, that's where I want to be someday.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.360]   I want to be in that person's seat where I can have complete certainty
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.440]   over what's going to happen in the economy and the markets."
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.800]   And the longer I was in this game,
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.160]   the more I realized like, "Oh, wait a minute.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.960]   Those people are full of it.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.360]   They don't really know what's going to happen."
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.920]   It's just that people want to have certainty in their life
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.320]   because the future is always uncertain,
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.280]   especially when it comes to investing in the markets and the economy.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.440]   Like no one really knows what's going to happen.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.480]   And I always really was attracted to the people
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.880]   that would say occasionally, "I don't know,"
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.640]   or "I was wrong," or, you know,
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.840]   "And here's how we're going to fix it."
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.320]   So those are the people that really, I thought,
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.680]   had the most intelligence to me.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.280]   The people that admitted, like,
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.360]   "This part of the game is too hard for me to do.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.440]   So here's how I'm going to get around that.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.800]   And here's what I'm going to do instead."
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.280]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.960]   I got a call from a friend yesterday who said,
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.320]   "I'm dumping all my NVIDIA.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.560]   It's AMD. AMD is the winner now."
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.080]   And I couldn't help but be like, "Am I missing out here?"
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.320]   Like this person knows what they're talking about, right?
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.760]   That's why they told me this.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.280]   How do you react when someone says that?
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.240]   Because it's so hard.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.080]   I guess I try to stay in the lane of
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.960]   there are no always or nevers when it comes to the markets.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.160]   There's no 0% or 100%.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.040]   It's a range of probabilities.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.320]   And unfortunately, the probabilities
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.320]   are not like a casino where you walk in
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.680]   and you know these are the probabilities.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.560]   This is the payoff.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.520]   Investing would be a lot easier if that was the case.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.040]   But I think you still have to just think in more
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.560]   in terms of a range of outcomes.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.520]   So that person who says AMD is going to be the winner,
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.840]   they should probably put some sort of, you know,
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.120]   bandwidth on that.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.960]   Like, you know, there's a 70% chance
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.000]   that this is going to happen.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.160]   Here's how I'm going to size my position accordingly.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.840]   But there's also a 30% chance I'm wrong.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.600]   NVIDIA is actually going to be the winner
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.880]   and AMD is going to follow up.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.640]   So I think that's the way you think about these things
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.240]   in terms of a range of outcomes
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.640]   and how willing you're able to make a big bet on something
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.160]   as opposed to just trying to say like,
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.280]   "Yes, this is it. 100%. This is what we're doing."
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.360]   And I feel like it's hard to ever get to that point
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.320]   when you're investing.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.160]   So you had these 20 lessons.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.960]   Number three was that no one lives life in the long term.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.480]   And I think it's kind of relevant here
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.400]   because it almost doesn't matter what your bet is
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.440]   if you can't handle it.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.800]   Why is it important for people to realize that
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.560]   while they might be investing in the long term,
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.160]   they don't live long term?
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.400]   I saw that part of that quote from Daniel Kahneman,
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.520]   who recently passed away.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.560]   And he spent his whole career studying human foibles
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.080]   and human behavior and emotions.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.720]   And when he gave his Nobel Prize speech,
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.880]   he said, someone asked him like, you know,
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.640]   "Why can't more people stay the course for the long run?"
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.120]   He said, "The long run is not where life is lived, right?
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.680]   It's a series of short runs."
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.600]   And I think your experience when you were born,
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.920]   the way you came up, all that stuff,
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.120]   the personality you were given,
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.080]   all that stuff really impacts the way that you save
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.440]   and invest and handle your finances.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.240]   We were talking to a client a couple months ago
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.920]   who worked at Lehman Brothers
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.960]   and had 75% of his net worth in Lehman stock
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.000]   heading into the GFC.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.240]   And it went to zero.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.200]   And he had to slowly but surely,
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.600]   he went to another Wall Street firm,
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.480]   made some more money.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.360]   Now he's making a very good living as a Wall Street trader.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.760]   But that experience, he admitted it.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.400]   He said, "Listen, going through what I went through at Lehman
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.120]   has changed my entire perception of risk forever.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.600]   I'm just not willing to take as much risk as I should be
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.680]   based on how much money we have and how much money I make."
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.200]   And that was actually, I thought, a wise decision
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.080]   'cause someone would say like,
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.840]   "Listen, this person is making a lot of money
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.640]   working on Wall Street.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.080]   They get these huge bonuses.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.520]   They have plenty of money in the bank.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.960]   They have this big portfolio.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.040]   They have the ability to take a lot of risk."
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.160]   But this person realized,
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.400]   "I don't care what that ability is,
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.920]   what the spreadsheet tells me.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.760]   I can't physically or mentally make myself do that.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.400]   So I wanna take a more conservative route with my portfolio
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.160]   regardless of what the results are gonna be.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.600]   I know my results would be better
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.040]   if I could invest more aggressively,
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.800]   but I have this mental block that's holding me back."
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.360]   And actually, I think that's the right decision
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.840]   as long as you don't take it too far, right?
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.840]   And do those experiences change over time?
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.080]   Does someone who is 25
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.320]   feeling like they have a grasp on their risk tolerance,
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.840]   should they be checking in as they get older,
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.680]   get married, have kids, buy a house?
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.960]   How should you evolve your risk?
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.280]   I think the biggest thing too
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.560]   is the difference between dollars and percentages.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.000]   So if you're just starting out and you're young
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.080]   and you have $10,000 in your Robinhood account
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.280]   and you lose 50%, you're down $5,000.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.440]   It stings, but you have a whole lifetime ahead of you
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.760]   of saving and investing that you can make up for that.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.040]   Now, let's say you get to $100,000 and you lose 10%,
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.640]   you're now on $10,000, right?
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.160]   And you say, "Well, that's more money than I lost
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.920]   with a 50% loss at 10,000."
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.680]   Then you get to a million dollars
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.560]   and a 10% loss is $100,000.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.360]   So I think sometimes people have a hard time
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.720]   going from percentages to dollars
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.120]   and realizing that the more money you have saved,
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.680]   the harder it can be to see those percentages
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.360]   or those market values go down, right?
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.360]   So I think that's a hurdle sometimes for people.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.840]   So as you go from like the young investor
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.000]   who has decades and decades ahead of them,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.600]   compounding is the whole thing and saving,
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.080]   where the bear markets don't really matter,
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.880]   the bear markets can sting when you get towards middle age,
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.560]   later age, heading into retirement.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.880]   Even if you know that eventually the stock market
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.560]   is going to come back, it's a lot more painful
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.200]   to view those dollars just evaporate like that.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.920]   Yeah, I was just looking for the sake of an argument
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.560]   I was trying to make at the average S&P return.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.440]   And it seems like over, I don't know, 50, 60, 70 years,
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.520]   it's been over 10%, but obviously in short periods of time,
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.040]   it's been down 30, 40%.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.960]   How do you tell people who are here for the long run?
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.200]   Like they know that it's 10%, they're okay with 10%,
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.920]   but they're struggling in the short term.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.680]   What do you tell them?
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.600]   Well, I think perfect is the enemy of good in a lot of ways.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.520]   I think you have to know yourself first.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.320]   That's the important thing
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.800]   'cause you could make a blanket statement saying,
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.440]   "Listen, all young people should have all their money,
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.040]   "100% invested in equity.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.640]   "Stocks are your best long-term bet
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.080]   "based on expectations and history
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.560]   "and the way that these things should work."
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.560]   But some people just don't have the ability
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.960]   to sleep at night if they know that their portfolio
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.160]   is going to drop 30, 40, maybe 50%.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.880]   I think a lot of people in the first decade of this century
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.560]   realized that there was a 50% crash
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.640]   following the dot-com bubble blowing up
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.560]   and then a 50 some percent crash
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.880]   when the great financial crisis hit in 2008.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.480]   And I think a lot of people realized
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.320]   I was not prepared for this to happen.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.840]   There's only so many like Warren Buffett
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.360]   and Charlie Munger quotes that you can listen to,
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.680]   but hey, if you can't stand a 50% correction,
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.440]   you shouldn't be in stock, that's what they say.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.240]   And for some people, that just means, I don't know,
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.920]   holding more cash or holding more bonds
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.360]   or something that is a little safer
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.680]   so you can actually get to that point.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.480]   That may not be optimal based on the spreadsheet
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.720]   and based on the compound interest formulas
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.200]   and all these things, but if you have to do that
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.240]   so it makes you stay in the game,
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.480]   I think making those suboptimal decisions,
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.280]   it's actually okay.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.280]   - Yeah, last one on risk.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.800]   You said the biggest risks
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.480]   are always the same yet different.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.760]   So a part of me is like, you know what?
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.640]   It always works out, but will it work out this time?
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.640]   I feel like people are constantly thinking,
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.920]   you know, yeah, it always worked out,
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.680]   but maybe this time is different.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.200]   - Yeah, there is this thing in your head
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.080]   where you think, geez, when stocks fell in the past,
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.600]   that was a huge buying opportunity,
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.440]   but what if this time, what if it's not?
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.240]   And sometimes these things do last longer than others.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.600]   There are times when stocks go nowhere for a decade.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.760]   It happened from 2000 to 2009.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.160]   The total return to the S&P was negative 10%.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.760]   You lost 1% a year
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.440]   and that's not even including inflation.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.400]   And so there are times when that can happen.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.840]   And so the long-term for certain people,
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.600]   some people might think a decade is a long time,
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.000]   but there have been handful of instances
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.720]   where asset classes have gone a decade
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.960]   and given you zero return.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.080]   So it can be very difficult to stick it out
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.440]   in the stock market.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.880]   And I think the, I don't know,
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.240]   the simplest form of risk management
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.680]   is probably just diversification.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.200]   And that is, you know,
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.120]   maybe by asset class or strategy
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.520]   or sort of your income streams,
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.520]   or I don't know, however you want to be able to survive.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.920]   'Cause I think the whole point of the long-term
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.240]   is that survival is the key.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.000]   And back to your like experience thing,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.560]   I came up, I started my career a few years
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.760]   before the great financial crisis.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.520]   And I think living through that,
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.680]   seeing what happened and how people,
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.000]   how they handled that situation,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.280]   I think changed my outlook on the markets
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.200]   and investing for the better.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.920]   Because I was young and dumb and naive.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.400]   And I've been reading stocks for the long run
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.920]   and Jack Bogle and Warren Buffett.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.320]   And I just assumed this stuff happens
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.120]   and then it comes back.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.280]   And it did come back.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:47.840]   So that was good for me.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.840]   But I also saw all these people in the industry
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.400]   lose their minds.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.360]   I had a colleague who was one of the smartest people I know.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.040]   We talked about the high IQ thing.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.400]   During the great financial crisis,
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.960]   he told me I'm turning off all my 401k purchases
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.040]   in the stock market and I'm going to money market funds.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.800]   And he says, because I'm just worried
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.480]   that the whole system is going to collapse.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.320]   And I thought this guy is nuts.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.320]   But he's also one of the smartest people that I know.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.320]   And he just, he lost his temperament.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.880]   And I mean, I'm never going to make better purchases
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.400]   than I made in my 401k plan.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.040]   Then during that 2008 period,
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.080]   when stocks were down 50, 60%, you know.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.280]   But it's a lot easier to say in the rear view mirror,
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.400]   of course you should have been buying them.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.880]   Because at the time, people were freaked out.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.520]   And so I think you just have to have some sort of process
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.080]   that helps you understand your time horizon
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:34.880]   and risk profile.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.520]   So if and when those periods happen,
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.560]   and they don't happen very often,
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.760]   you actually have a plan instead of trying to make a plan
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.920]   when emotions are very high.
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.760]   And understand the needs you might have for the money, right?
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.000]   If you really don't need this money for 30 years,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.560]   try not to, you know, like you can't ignore
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.360]   and not look at it.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.240]   That's super hard.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.080]   But you know, when it's down,
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.640]   even if you have a 10-year dry spell, it's okay.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.680]   I do have a sort of rule of thumb, personally.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.200]   And it sounds irrational,
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.760]   but I never look at the balances of my investment accounts
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.800]   when we're in the bear market.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.760]   I just, I don't look.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.840]   I don't want to look.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:13.040]   I know in my head, based on this percentage loss,
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.400]   I kind of know where I'm at.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.280]   But I don't want to look.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.360]   I only look during bull markets.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.040]   And that may be irrational.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.440]   But I think you need some sort of out of sight, out of mind.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.480]   And I think to your point,
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.920]   the time horizon thing is a big one.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.280]   If you are going to put a down payment on a house in five years,
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.200]   I don't know, that money probably,
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.640]   you shouldn't have it all in the stock market.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.800]   Because the stock market, as we've seen these past few years,
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.640]   can drop very swiftly.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.240]   It fell 35% in a month, basically, in 2020.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.800]   If you were holding that money in the stock market
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.920]   and waiting for a down payment,
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.880]   you lost a third of your money.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.960]   So I think aligning your time horizon
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.400]   with your assets makes a lot of sense.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.080]   And I would say,
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.640]   if you weren't around for the great financial crisis,
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.640]   you probably were, if you're listening to this,
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.320]   around during the pandemic.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.880]   And think back to how that felt.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.600]   There were people saying the exact same thing.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.480]   Markets were down 30%.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.240]   And I remember telling people,
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.840]   I was like, "Isn't this a good buying opportunity?"
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.320]   And they're like, "What if we could be going
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.480]   to the world falling apart and everything?"
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.800]   And sure enough, it was a very, very short bear market.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:19.120]   But it didn't feel like that was obvious at the time.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.600]   Which I guess brings me to this lesson you had,
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.160]   which was that optimism should be your default.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.960]   And talk to me about why that's important.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.960]   My whole thinking is if you're pessimistic about the future,
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.240]   what's the point of investing anyway?
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.640]   Investing itself is delaying gratification now
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.360]   so you can have better results in the future.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.040]   So I think...
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.400]   Listen, the world is an unforgiving place.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.080]   There's lots of bad things that can happen.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.600]   And I think the internet has made more people cynical
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.000]   and pessimistic in a lot of ways.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.920]   But when it comes to your portfolio,
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.440]   I think you have to have long run optimism.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.440]   Otherwise, what are you investing in the first place?
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.720]   'Cause the people who aren't very optimistic,
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.600]   they put all their money in gold bars or cash
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.120]   and hide it away under the mattress
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.240]   or in the backyard or something.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.400]   And that's just...
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.760]   I mean, you have to invest in something
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.040]   if you wanna beat the rate of inflation.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.400]   If you want your future to be better than the present,
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.200]   you have to put your money to work and take risk in some form.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.520]   And I think having an optimistic view about the future
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.120]   can help you stay invested even during those tough times
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.080]   when it feels like pessimism is ruling the day.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.120]   You mentioned earlier, if you have these upcoming events,
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.720]   maybe you take it out of the market.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.760]   I think one silver lining for people living right now
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.760]   and investing right now in 2024,
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.800]   we're recording this in July,
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.640]   cash is actually a decent asset right now.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.200]   We've had years where cash would pay nothing.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.400]   And the market is really your source of return.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.400]   But if you need money in 2 years,
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.640]   I can't think of a time in my life
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.800]   where it's been easier to feel good
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.360]   about not investing your money for the short run
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.400]   because you can lock your money up for 2 years right now
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.000]   and earn a pretty good return.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.640]   4% to 5% on your cash is really good,
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.560]   especially where we're in the 2010s.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.320]   And I've always had something of a barbell portfolio.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.280]   On the one hand, I take a lot of risk and equities over here.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.840]   And in all my long-term accounts, it's 100% equities.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.280]   But then over here in my more liquid bucket is cash savings.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.880]   And that's for any sort of rainy day fund or vacations
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.960]   or any other shorter intermediate term
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.160]   thing that we're planning for.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.680]   We're gonna renovate our house in 2 years.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.040]   So we have it in here.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.960]   And I kept that money in cash
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.440]   even when rates were zero for all those years, right?
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.960]   Because I really valued that liquidity
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.000]   and the ease of access
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.200]   and the ability to just take it
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.480]   and know it was going to be there
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.600]   and it wasn't going to fall
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.360]   and it wasn't going to be volatile.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.120]   And now that I'm actually earning something on that,
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.160]   it's, yes, it makes things a lot easier.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.920]   Like the other side of that, unfortunately,
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.840]   for some people is now you see,
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.360]   "Oh, I'm earning 4% or 5% in cash.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.360]   Why do I need to take any risk at all?"
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.520]   I think cash can become a gateway drug to market timing.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.200]   So I think you really have to make a definition
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.800]   in your head of your portfolio
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.240]   of this cash is part of my overall asset allocation,
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.520]   or it's my emergency fund,
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.520]   or it's my intermediate term savings,
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.640]   or whatever it is,
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.200]   and not just get sucked into the fact that,
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.720]   "Well, I'm just going to keep all my money there
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.520]   because it doesn't move.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.760]   It doesn't lose money on a nominal basis."
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.520]   So I think you have to be a little careful there
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.920]   and just understand what the purpose of that bucket is for,
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.920]   because these 4% or 5% rates
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.040]   aren't going to be here forever
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.720]   if and when the Fed cuts rates too.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.680]   - Yeah, and you probably know off the top of your head,
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.040]   this year, if you went into the beginning of 2024 saying,
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.800]   "Wow, cash rates are good.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.600]   Let's just do that.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.440]   I'm worried the market's overpriced."
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.320]   You would have missed out
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.800]   on a pretty monster first half of the year.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.520]   - Yeah, the U.S. stock market's up almost 20%,
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.280]   you know, through the year.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.240]   Yeah, and that's after a 26% gain last year.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.040]   And so that's the problem.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.280]   And then that's when mistakes can compound.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.840]   If you don't have these things bucketed out,
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.360]   if you're just kind of, you know,
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.960]   going out about this without a plan and say,
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.400]   "Yeah, cash rates are high.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.600]   I'm going to put all my money there."
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.200]   And the stock market takes off, then what do you do?
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.200]   "Well, I'm going to wait for a downturn."
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.600]   What if it takes a long time for the downturn to happen?
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.200]   Or when the downturn finally does happen,
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.800]   I saw this a lot after 2008,
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.440]   you know, there'd be a 10% correction.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.880]   And it's like, "All right, buying opportunity.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.560]   No way, I'm going to wait till it's 20%.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.680]   I'm going to wait till it's 30%."
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.920]   And then you get stuck in cash.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.400]   So I think you have to have a plan of attack with that,
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.960]   whether that cash is ever going to be invested,
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.720]   or if it's not, I think you can't just get stuck
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.320]   in the middle where you're trying to guess
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.920]   when a good time to put it back in the market is.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.320]   - It's funny because one of the reasons I think,
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.840]   especially people that are kind of
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.760]   have an optimizing personality,
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.400]   might get stuck trying to put cash to work,
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.400]   trying to pick a portfolio comes to one of your lessons,
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.720]   which is there's just no such thing as a perfect portfolio.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.680]   - No.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.760]   And that's why dollar cost averaging
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.520]   is such a simple strategy.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.920]   And it's probably not the best strategy in the world.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.760]   I'm sure you could think of a way better way
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.080]   to optimize that and make these better rules.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.000]   I'm going to buy when the S&P 500 does this,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.320]   or when this trend line is broken or whatever it is.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.000]   But if you just invest a little bit of money
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.320]   out of every paycheck or every week on a weekly basis,
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.640]   or a monthly basis, or quarterly, wherever it is,
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.720]   and just follow that strategy,
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.440]   we did this with a client in 2022.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.880]   They came to us with a big chunk of cash.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.080]   And unfortunately, they had sold some of their stocks
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.280]   in 2020, right?
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.120]   They got freaked out by the pandemic,
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.120]   and they were sitting on way too much cash
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.400]   for far too long.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.640]   And they came to us at the end of 2021 and said,
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.000]   I need to get this cash back to work.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:26.640]   I know I do.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.640]   I know the data says I should probably
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.000]   just put it back in the market, right?
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.240]   Because on average, 75% of the time over a one-year basis,
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.000]   the S&P 500 is up, right?
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.160]   So that's pretty good odds that it's going to be up again
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:38.640]   in the future.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.160]   So the numbers would tell you, put that money to work today
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.080]   in a lump sum, and just forget about it.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.320]   And most of the time, you're going to have better results.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.960]   But people think through this regret framework, right?
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.400]   Where, well, what if I put it in
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.680]   and the stock market falls 20%?
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.880]   Then I'm going to feel like an idiot.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.360]   So dollar cost averaging from a psychological perspective
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.080]   can help.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.560]   And with this client, we invested in dribs and drabs.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.800]   It was like the 15th of every month for a whole year.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.480]   And the market was very volatile through that whole period.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.840]   And this is the start of the bear market.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.120]   So the tiny worked out pretty good.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.920]   But throughout that bear market, we have wild ups and downs,
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.640]   right?
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.280]   And we set this plan in advance.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.760]   We said, let's just follow it, come hell or high water.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.760]   And this is the plan we're going to stick to.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.120]   But six months in, well, should we put more in now?
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.000]   Should we not put enough?
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.280]   Should we take it back a little?
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.360]   And we said, no, this is the plan we set out to do.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.720]   Regardless of what the market's going to do, let's follow it.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.040]   And after we did it, we followed the plan.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.080]   Things worked out great.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.440]   And looked back and said, this was the right decision.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.720]   But we also told them, listen, this was the right decision
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.640]   regardless of what happened to the market, right?
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.120]   Because the market could have taken off on day one.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.800]   And you would look back and said, why did I do that?
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.280]   And the whole point was, you made the decision ahead of time.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.800]   And you know you can't predict where the market's going to go.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.000]   So just follow your plan.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.160]   And that's the problem a lot of investors have,
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.400]   is even if they have a plan, it's really hard to follow it.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.360]   Which is why I think technology and automation
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.760]   is one of the giant leaps forward for individuals.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.000]   Because you can just make a good decision ahead of time,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.720]   hit a couple buttons, and forget about it.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.640]   And let the system do it for you.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.160]   Yeah, I think one of the most valuable lessons I've learned,
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.120]   and it's hard to even stick to, even though I know it well,
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.520]   is evaluating decisions on the information you had when you made them.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.320]   I remember there was a point in time where there was this kind of
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.840]   optimal tax thing I could do,
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.560]   but it required being out of the market for like three months.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.000]   And it just happened that those three months were an election.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.160]   And I was like, I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:42.240]   But I know that unless the market goes up 10% in three months,
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.840]   like this is a good decision.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.800]   And statistically, the market's probably not going to do that in three months.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.680]   So I'm going to do this.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.200]   And the market went up.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:53.520]   And it went up about on par where it was a breakeven decision.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.600]   And so I was like, gosh, I went through all these hoops
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.280]   to basically save no money.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.880]   However, I just kept reminding myself,
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.960]   I didn't know what the market was going to do.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.400]   And there were a lot of outcomes.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.480]   And so if you evaluate it with saying,
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.720]   "Hey, if I had the information I had at the time,
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.920]   would I have made the same decision?"
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:08.880]   And the answer is yes,
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.160]   then hopefully you could stop overthinking it.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.520]   And that's true in business or life or investing, right?
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.200]   And that's why I think it's important for a lot of,
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.200]   especially if you're prone to making mistakes.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.440]   And this may seem like overkill to people,
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.920]   but a lot of times I think performing that like pre-mortem,
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.760]   pre-mortem instead of post-mortem,
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.520]   where you kind of write down some of your reasons
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.800]   for making a decision ahead of time.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.960]   And we do this with our...
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.320]   I'm on the investment committee at my firm.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.080]   And when we make a decision
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.520]   to either do something or not do something,
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.680]   we take notes, we write it down.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.480]   And like you said,
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.480]   we use the information we have at that time,
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.000]   because we don't know what's going to happen from here.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.400]   There's all these different paths and tree branches
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.400]   or wherever that things could go.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.160]   And we just want to make sure
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.200]   that we're making a consistent decision-making process
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.960]   with the information we have at the time
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.240]   and the understanding that there's this
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.160]   irreducible uncertainty going forward.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.400]   And I think for people that are prone to investment mistakes,
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.000]   writing down those reasons ahead of time,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.040]   and then regardless of which way the market goes from there,
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.480]   or however the decision works out,
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.120]   you can go back and say,
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.440]   "Listen, I use all the information I had at the time.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.120]   Things worked out great.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.000]   If they didn't work out,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.840]   you still made the right decision."
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.520]   I think that's the thing about investing
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.560]   in terms of getting from the short-term to the long-term
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.720]   is just making good decisions over and over again,
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.000]   with the understanding that sometimes
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.360]   they're going to lead to bad outcomes.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.280]   - The decision and the outcome are very different.
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.080]   - Yes.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.120]   - We talked about there's no perfect portfolio
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.920]   and diversification can help.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.160]   There's the whole rest of the world you can invest in.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:36.000]   How do you think about having a simple portfolio,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.920]   but international exposure?
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.320]   - Well, a lot of people do not like
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.360]   international exposure right now
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.600]   because the US stock market is the only game in town
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.160]   for the past 12 to 15 years, right?
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:50.160]   And the US now makes up 60-65% of the global stock market,
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.680]   depending on what you're counting.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:52.960]   So it's a huge, it's like,
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.280]   if you look at a pie chart of the US over time,
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.000]   it's like Pac-Man eating the rest of the globe, right?
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.640]   It went from, I think as low as 35%
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.680]   in the great financial crisis.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.840]   So it basically flip-flopped from 35 to 60-65.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.160]   And the US has outperformed everything.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.920]   And I think the reasons are pretty obvious.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.920]   The tech stock sector is way bigger here.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.120]   We have more innovation.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.560]   And I think part of it is we really value
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.160]   the stock market here more than other countries.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.680]   But the historical returns before 2008
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.960]   for US and international stocks
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.160]   of the previous 40 or 50 years were essentially the same.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.120]   You got like 10% in international stocks
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.800]   and 10% a year in US stocks.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.400]   And there were cycles of outperformance for each.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.520]   International stocks did better
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.600]   in like the '70s and part of the '80s.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.280]   US stocks did better in the '80s, '90s
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.720]   and part of the 2000s.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.280]   And you had these periods where they would flip-flop.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.480]   And now we've had the longest period
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.480]   of US outperformance in history,
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.760]   not just in terms of magnitude,
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.480]   but of duration.
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.080]   It's been like 15 years.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.520]   So I think a lot of people are giving up
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.400]   on international stocks.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.480]   My whole thing is I don't like to go to extremes.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.560]   And so I think the value of international investing
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.160]   is just that there's going to be a period in time
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.520]   when the US underperforms,
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.800]   the dollar gets weaker
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.800]   or these tech companies falter
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.480]   and stocks in other sectors outside of the US do better.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.680]   And I think it just takes away the concentration risk
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.840]   of being invested in the one stock market
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.600]   that underperforms all the other ones
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.600]   because it's happened before in the US
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.800]   and it will probably happen again,
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:23.920]   even if it doesn't feel like it now
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.680]   because the US seems like it's invincible.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.920]   So you had this lesson that you ended your post on
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.440]   with less is more.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.920]   And I keep coming back to every time
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.160]   I've had a complicated investing strategy,
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.600]   I don't adjust it over time.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.440]   I can't really explain it to myself.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.720]   How do you think about what the right amount
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.840]   of complexity is?
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.800]   My whole investing ethos has boiled down
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.560]   to simple over complex.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:50.480]   And I came of age in the investing world
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.320]   in the endowment and foundation world.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.680]   And all of these endowments were chasing Yale
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.240]   and Harvard and University of Pennsylvania
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.320]   and Princeton because they had these extremely
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.440]   complex portfolios.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.360]   And they were really hard to run operationally
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.200]   and they involved hedge funds and private equity
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.520]   and venture capital and hard assets
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.760]   and all these different and very few stocks
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.640]   and very few bonds.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.160]   And so it was a very exciting type of portfolio.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.800]   But I think a lot of these organizations
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.040]   that tried to copycat that didn't realize
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.080]   the complexity involved.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.600]   And those schools had these teams of people,
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.120]   you know, dozens and dozens of people
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.400]   overseeing these funds.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.880]   They had experts in each of these asset classes
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.080]   and strategies.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.840]   Whereas if you try to just run this
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.040]   with a handful of people,
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.200]   it's much harder to do
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.720]   and it's much harder to gain access.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.240]   And that was a good lesson for me
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.480]   in terms of the complex stuff
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.240]   is way more interesting, right?
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:44.800]   It just is.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.800]   It makes an easier sell.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.720]   If you're a salesperson in the investing world,
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.560]   selling complexity is way, way easier
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.440]   than selling simplicity
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.040]   because going simple is harder
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.480]   because it requires you to actually understand
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.040]   what you're doing
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.320]   and make good decisions ahead of time
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.720]   and then kind of just get out of your own way.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.080]   Whereas a complex system,
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.480]   you feel like your hands are on a steering wheel
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.560]   and you feel like,
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.960]   well, geez, this is someone really smart
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.080]   brought this to me.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.280]   It has to be good.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.360]   But I think the problem with complexity
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.360]   is as you said, it's harder to understand.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.640]   The fees are typically higher.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.280]   And I think when you don't understand
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.320]   exactly how something works,
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.840]   it's way easier to give up on it,
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.000]   especially when it inevitably underperforms
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.400]   because everything underperforms eventually.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.680]   So I think a simple strategy
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.760]   is easier to stick with over the long run
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.040]   because you understand it.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.680]   Like when I'm invested mostly in index funds,
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.960]   when the stock market falls,
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.160]   I'm perfectly comfortable
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.080]   putting money back into index funds.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.400]   If you hold a complex strategy
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.760]   or even a strategy of a handful of individual stocks,
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.280]   it's way harder to look at yourself in the mirror
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.040]   when you're down money and you say,
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.600]   well, am I rebalancing into the pain here or not?
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.720]   I think that's the hard part
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.800]   is when it doesn't do very well.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.040]   It's easy to hold a strategy when it's doing well.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.480]   I think that's the problem with complexity
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.560]   is that it makes it harder to double down
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.640]   and stick with it over the long run.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.160]   And that's why most people fail then
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.840]   because the first sign of trouble,
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.480]   they get out of it
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.840]   and then they go to another complex strategy
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:06.960]   that I think is gonna do even better
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.560]   and you just end up hopping around
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.480]   and it just doesn't work over the long run.
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:15.120]   - Yeah, I remember when we had the crash in the pandemic,
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.000]   I had some percentage of my portfolio
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.400]   in a risk parity fund that Wealthfront had launched.
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.320]   And I was like, I remember best I can explain risk parity,
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.080]   which by the way is way more complex
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.000]   than I'm gonna even attempt was like,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.280]   you're levering up your bonds
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.360]   to try to get similar returns to stocks.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.760]   But unfortunately, during the pandemic,
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.000]   bonds and stocks both went down.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.880]   And I remember being like,
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.600]   "Wow, this strategy got just hammered."
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.120]   And my wife asked me, she's like,
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.360]   "Was it gonna go back up if the market recovers?"
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.160]   And I was like, "I don't know how to answer this."
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.880]   Like when something really levered goes down,
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.920]   can you ever recover?
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:50.880]   I'm not sure.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.120]   And the solution for me was like, just get out.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.080]   Even though it's down,
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.600]   fortunately, there'd been enough tax loss harvesting
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.960]   to kind of just make it feel like
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.120]   selling at a loss was worth it.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.080]   But I can't tell you how much better I feel
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:09.280]   just being able to explain why everything is what it is
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.960]   and why I'm doing it and how it works.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.960]   Because I think I read that risk parity white paper
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.880]   four times and I still don't feel like
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.560]   I could explain it to someone.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.400]   Yeah, setting expectations is a big part of it.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.240]   So if you're invested in the stock market,
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.280]   on average, once every year, year and a half,
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.280]   you're gonna experience a 10% drawdown probably.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.960]   Once every three or four years,
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.320]   you're gonna have a bear market.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.000]   Once every, I don't know, 10 or 12 years,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.680]   you're probably gonna experience some sort of crash.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.880]   That could be like a 30, 40% or even worse.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.080]   And it doesn't run on a schedule like the trains,
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:43.200]   but you can build that into your expectations
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.320]   of losses are going to happen.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.240]   I'm not just gonna hope that they're gonna go away.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.600]   And I think that can help set your asset allocation
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.120]   and help set your different strategies
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.960]   if you actually have some expectations
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.640]   of the potential range of outcomes,
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.440]   even if you can't predict
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.640]   when they're gonna happen ahead of time.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.120]   - Yeah, yeah, I mentioned this other lesson
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.120]   about overthinking, being debilitating.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.040]   How do you get past that?
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.280]   I mean, you know, I have an optimizer's personality.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.800]   I think maybe you have a little bit less,
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.000]   but probably there's some in there.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.960]   - It was helpful for me to study history
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.800]   and some of the greatest investors
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.560]   and just know that even they go through these periods
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.760]   where they're totally out of favor.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.720]   And I think it's okay to know that.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.240]   Like the only way you can invest
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.320]   in the perfect portfolio is with hindsight, right?
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.240]   It's in the path, the rear view mirror.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.720]   And everyone's really good at fighting the last war
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:27.440]   when investing.
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.040]   This happens a lot during,
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.640]   or in the aftermath of bear markets.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.720]   Like, okay, if this happens again,
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.520]   I'm going to be ready.
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.520]   So in 2008, following that in,
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.920]   I remember in 2009, 2010, 2011,
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:41.280]   I was getting pitched all these black swan funds, right?
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.280]   Just wait, if 2008 happens again,
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.480]   you need to be invested in this.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:48.000]   And it's funny, all of those hedge tip strategies
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.960]   bring in all their money after the crash already happened.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.560]   And all this money comes in
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.160]   and then you have the upswing
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.480]   and then the money slowly goes out.
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:00.400]   And so I think that sort of
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.360]   fighting the last war mentality can help understanding
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.200]   that there really is no perfect portfolio.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.080]   And I think if you get down to the level of splitting hairs,
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.240]   well, geez, should I put 5% of my portfolio
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.200]   in a strategy or 6%?
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.960]   You already kind of won the game.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.800]   I think it's the big stuff.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.000]   If you get the big stuff right,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.720]   the studies show that like the variation
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.240]   of your portfolio and asset allocation
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.480]   explains something like 90, 95% of it, right?
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:26.000]   Your allocation between stocks, bonds, cash,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:26.720]   and other assets.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.440]   Just those right away, just that asset allocation,
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.000]   that's all the heavy lifting for you.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.480]   If you're getting down into the minutia of geez,
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.760]   small cap value makes up 2.5% of my portfolio
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.120]   instead of 4.5, what should I do?
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.880]   Those little levers aren't gonna make as big of a change.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.800]   So I think just getting the big things right,
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.360]   that's the, and for most people it's,
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.440]   how much am I going to have in risk assets like stocks?
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.160]   Just getting that decision right,
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.240]   I think is the biggest one for most people.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:58.720]   And then optimizing from there doesn't matter as much.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.840]   It's funny, I remember when I was trying to understand
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.440]   the nuance of tax loss harvesting and direct indexing.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.720]   So for anyone unfamiliar,
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.160]   we've talked a lot about tax loss harvesting,
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.120]   but direct indexing is instead of buying the index,
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.880]   you buy all the individual stocks in the index.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:18.720]   And one of the advantages that is stated
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.240]   is that because you're invested
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.920]   in all these individual stocks,
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.160]   while the market might be up on the whole,
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.080]   individual companies have gone down.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.840]   And so you can sell them at a loss
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:31.280]   and capture the losses to offset income
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.600]   or other gains much more easily.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.840]   And I remember asking someone,
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.000]   well, in tax loss harvesting normally,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.560]   if you've got an index fund in the S&P and it goes down,
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.560]   you can replace it with another US index
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.080]   so you stay in the market.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.400]   But if you're holding a stock and it goes down
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:50.320]   and you sell it, you can't buy it back.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.960]   And there's not like two things
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.920]   that are perfectly correlated that are AMD
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.760]   or Google or something.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.480]   What happens, and this investor told me,
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.800]   "Oh, well, you're just not in the stock
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.960]   "for the period you need until you can rebuy it."
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.120]   And I was like, "Well, then you're not in the stock."
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.080]   And they're like, "Oh yeah, if you take the S&P return
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.080]   "and you take any individual stock out of it,
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:15.360]   "and maybe NVIDIA and Microsoft and the top 10,
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.240]   "let's leave those aside, it doesn't matter."
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.120]   And so it just introduced this idea to me
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.400]   that you could be out of 10% of the stocks
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.560]   at any given point in time in the market,
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:29.360]   and it'll have almost no impact on the return.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.960]   The returns of those two portfolios
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.440]   are like 99 point something correlated.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.400]   And so it helped me to realize
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:40.800]   that it doesn't really matter what 0.1% of my portfolio,
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.120]   whether it's in Peloton or NVIDIA
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.240]   or Microsoft or anything, it doesn't matter.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:51.040]   And it really helped me stop trying to perfect things.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.960]   - And I do think that the small,
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.120]   the slight edges can compound over the time
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.160]   if you have a bunch of them.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.760]   If you rebalance your portfolio
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.600]   and you do tax-lost harvesting
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.280]   and you do asset location right,
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.440]   I think that stuff can add value,
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.080]   but those are second order decisions.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.400]   And full disclosure on the direct indexing thing,
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.000]   we use that in my firm.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.120]   And it does, getting back to the simple versus complex thing,
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.720]   it does introduce more complexity
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.280]   and it's much harder to run 'cause as you pointed out,
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.160]   if you take out one stock because it's down,
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.760]   you're introducing tracking error.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.880]   So the way that we do it,
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.560]   you have to turn the dial up and down
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.720]   with how much tracking error do you want
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.240]   versus how many losses do you wanna take?
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.240]   And what's your actual tax exposure?
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.840]   And those kinds of strategies require, we think,
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:36.480]   like a financial advisor and a trader
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:40.800]   and a tax person who understands your specific situation.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.560]   It's not something that you can just set and forget
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:43.840]   and turn it on and off.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.480]   You have to say, I sold a business last year
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.120]   and I got all these huge capital gains taxes,
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.080]   I need to offset them.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.880]   So turn the dial way up for me for tax loss harvesting.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:53.840]   And that's the kind of thing
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.000]   where you're trying to balance the investing side of things
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:56.880]   with the tax side of things.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.480]   So one of those types of strategies
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:01.040]   that actually requires more handholding than you think
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.880]   and the automation isn't as easy
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.160]   with that kind of strategy.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.640]   I think tax loss harvesting is super valuable
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.760]   if you have gains to offset with your losses.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:13.040]   And if you don't, and you're earlier in your career
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:17.200]   where you can only offset $3,000 of your income with losses.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.160]   If offsetting the taxes on $3,000 is meaningful
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.680]   'cause you're early in your career,
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.520]   maybe you live in California,
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.400]   you've got a lot of taxes,
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.040]   but you don't make that much money yet, great.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.480]   But if you're not making capital gains every year,
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.080]   especially at short-term rates,
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:36.000]   the losses aren't as valuable as they might seem.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.320]   Right, and the funny thing is about,
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:41.920]   thinking in terms of indexing versus stock selection,
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.840]   if you're an individual stock picker,
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.520]   JP Morgan had this chart that showed
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.720]   like for the last 30 years, the S&P 500,
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.880]   it's up, I don't know, 80% of the time, right?
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.920]   And an annual basis,
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.560]   but on average out of those 500 stocks,
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.320]   150 of them are down every year.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.200]   So there's like these tax loss harvesting opportunities,
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.720]   but also if you're a stock picker,
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.080]   there's a pretty good chance
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.440]   that even if the stock market is up,
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.240]   your stock or a handful of stocks might be down,
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:09.040]   which is one of the reasons I think indexing
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.840]   is just a simpler, easier strategy than picking stocks,
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.320]   but that's another discussion.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.200]   Oh yeah, we've had this discussion a handful of times,
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.480]   I'll put some links to episodes
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.760]   that we've talked about in the past,
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.320]   maybe even one of the times you were on,
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.600]   but I think my advice to everyone is,
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.040]   invest in individual stocks only as much as you need to,
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.200]   to let the rest of your portfolio
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.960]   just ride it in index fund.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.080]   I don't mind people picking stocks,
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.920]   but yeah, size it in a manner
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.400]   and understand how much time and effort
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.720]   you can actually put into it before getting into it,
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.240]   'cause it's not an easy game.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.840]   Before we jump to this last lesson
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.840]   that I think will spawn a really interesting conversation,
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.800]   why did you write this post in the first place?
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.800]   I think one of the reasons I love the market so much
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.680]   is because it's a constant exercise in learning.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.800]   And I feel like I'm constantly learning new things,
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.960]   even though I've been doing this for like 20 years.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.800]   And I just like to get my thoughts down
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.240]   and put them all in one place.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.360]   And I think I was just trying to figure out,
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.560]   like, what have I learned?
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.840]   And then it helps me think through
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.360]   some of the things I still need to learn.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.480]   And for me, a lot of times,
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.880]   it's reminding myself of these things,
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.360]   as opposed to trying to provide this wisdom to other people,
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.680]   because I need constant reminders of the things
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.600]   that I need to do to stick it out for the long term.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.560]   And what do you think the impact of adopting these lessons
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.880]   would be for the average person?
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.680]   I think finances are such a big part of your life,
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.120]   and it's causes stress and problems in marriages.
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:32.160]   And I think having the ability to have a handle on them
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.440]   just can be really helpful to you
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.440]   in terms of your ability to sleep at night
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.120]   and your lack of stress and anxiety.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.120]   And that's the whole thing with me with finances
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:44.160]   is I don't want them to rule my life all the time.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.240]   I love this stuff, and I love paying attention to it.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.400]   I love writing about it and reading about it.
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.000]   But I don't wanna constantly be stressing
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.160]   about my own personal financial situation.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:56.160]   I wanna just make my life easier in that way.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:00.000]   That is a perfect segue to the last lesson
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:00.880]   I wanted to touch on,
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.480]   which was that there's a big difference
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.720]   between rich and wealthy.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.560]   And I think this is something that,
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.480]   I know we've personally talked about
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.480]   impacting our lives a lot the last few years.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.520]   Yeah, I know a lot of really wealthy people
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.160]   who are miserable because they work all the time
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.720]   or their job takes them away from their family
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.440]   or they work on a job that is kind of soul sucking
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.480]   and not happy to them.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.680]   So I think there is really,
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.240]   there has to be some sort of balance
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:30.160]   between looking at this number in my portfolio
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.000]   and the number is the only thing that matters.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.360]   And these are the goalposts
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.400]   versus having a more balanced life.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.240]   And I am like you, Chris,
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.080]   where you're more optimized than me probably,
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.680]   but we're spreadsheet guys, right?
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:45.280]   I have always been a saver my whole life.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:49.040]   Some combination of my upbringing and my parents
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.880]   and then just personality traits that I was born with,
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:52.720]   I've always been a saver.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.120]   And I can remember when I got my first job,
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.080]   I took my salary and I had my budget planned
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.560]   and I did all the compound interest things
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.840]   for by the time I'm 30,
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:02.720]   I should have this much money
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:06.320]   and 40 and 50 and 60, I planned it all out, right?
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.480]   And as you age, I'm entering my mid forties here.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.240]   I guess I can call myself midlife.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.160]   There's things that happen in your life
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.840]   that can change how you view that saving stuff.
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.040]   And obviously everyone's different.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.360]   Some people have a problem spending too much money.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.240]   Some people save too much.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.040]   Some people are in the middle.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.240]   I've tried to bring my financial life more in balance
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.760]   to think of a wealthy life more as enjoying some of it now
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.800]   while still making sure future me is going to be set.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.640]   And I think there's a lot of things that change it.
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.960]   Of course, one of them is just having kids.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.320]   That changed.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.920]   That was a huge change for me.
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.760]   I have aging parents.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.680]   My dad is in his late seventies.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.360]   My mom is in her early to mid seventies.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.320]   It's funny.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.400]   They have this group of college friends,
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.480]   probably 10 to 15 people.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:55.360]   And their whole thing was every kid who gets married,
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.120]   they have to invite the whole group of college friends,
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:59.440]   which was really fun having that conversation with my wife
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.360]   or going through the wedding list on the tables.
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.880]   And oh, by the way,
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:06.480]   we need like a 15 top for my dad and my dad's college friends.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.600]   And it's non-negotiable.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.160]   They have to come.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:12.240]   But I've been seeing all these friends that I've known them my whole life.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.040]   They're part of our family from when I was young.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.960]   So many of them are having life-altering diseases.
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.680]   And some of them have passed away early when they reach retirement age.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.560]   And you see this happen.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:26.080]   And luckily, knock on wood, my parents are very healthy.
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.360]   But you see this kind of thing happen.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.920]   And it changes your perspective on these things.
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.240]   We've had clients in our wealth management firm
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.320]   who plan their whole life.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.800]   And they get to the point where it's retirement time.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.440]   And they dropped out of a deadly disease,
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:42.800]   right as they're about to finally enjoy their money.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:47.760]   So I think having those kind of experiences has shaped and changed me.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:48.960]   Because I think in a lot of ways, people think,
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.720]   "Well, you're one way your whole life.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:54.080]   And it's never going to change in terms of the way you think about money."
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.400]   And that has totally changed me
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:00.320]   in terms of how I think about the balance of spending now
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.360]   versus saving for the future.
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:04.320]   And I'm not totally "Bill Perkins, die with zero."
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.160]   But I think that mentality has seeped into a lot of what I do
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.320]   because of where I'm at in my life.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.640]   After my conversation with Bill Perkins,
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.080]   I remember talking to my wife.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.680]   And we were looking at our combo of our net worth and our savings rate.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.640]   And we usually had these goalposts where it's like,
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.160]   "Gosh, if we can hit this number,
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.320]   if we can save this much, it'll be awesome."
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:29.920]   And now we kind of look at saving too much as a bit of a mistake.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:31.840]   And I know that seems crazy.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.360]   And it probably seems very...
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.920]   I understand the fortunate situation we're in
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.160]   where we've been diligent savers.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:43.760]   But there comes a point where it's just not the most important thing.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.000]   So I wrote a blog post recently where I looked at...
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:46.960]   I have my whole spreadsheet.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.160]   I'm still a spreadsheet guy.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.680]   And I track my savings by year.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.360]   And I put them all in a spreadsheet.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.600]   And I looked and 2021 really jumped out.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.280]   It was like an all-time high savings for us.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.200]   And I looked at it.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.320]   And part of that was the pandemic.
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.600]   We weren't doing as much.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.440]   We like to travel, not as much as you.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.800]   We're not quite as adventurous as you.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.200]   But I looked in that 2021 really stood out.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.360]   And I actually made a point
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.840]   that we don't need to have that high of savings anymore.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.000]   Like once you hit a certain level, it's okay.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.080]   And I wanted to make a point of spending more.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:16.480]   And so the last couple of years, we have been traveling more.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.000]   And we've been spending more.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.720]   And it's easy to spend money when you have kids, as you know.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.040]   But part of it was spending time with them.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:27.040]   And I still remember this conversation we had with a friend a few years ago.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.720]   My oldest daughter, she's 10 now.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.160]   This is when she was like 5 years old.
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.600]   And they said something like, "Hey, listen.
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.200]   We have like 13 years left with them."
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.360]   Before they got into the world.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.640]   And then they're kind of adults.
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.440]   And they're on their own.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.960]   And that kind of thinking really has changed my mentality.
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:44.160]   And we had twins.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.520]   They are 7 now.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.520]   And when they were about 1 year old, my wife and I realized
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:50.880]   as much as we love to travel and take vacations,
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:56.160]   it's really, really difficult to travel with twins and another kid
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.520]   because of all the stuff you have to bring.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.280]   You know, car seats, strollers.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:02.240]   And we like to travel and get away.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.880]   So at that point, we made a decision to buy a vacation home
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:08.400]   in Northern Michigan on the water.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:14.720]   And I could have run all the numbers of missed compound interest
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.400]   if I would have just invested that money instead.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:19.120]   But it's easily one of the best investments we've made
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:23.040]   because we've created so many memories with the kids.
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.880]   And it forces us to be outside and do stuff and be away from screens.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:31.440]   And that kind of thing, I don't know, myself 10 years ago,
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:32.960]   probably wouldn't be able to pull the trigger on that.
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.440]   But knowing that I had kids and I wanted to create more
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.840]   quality time with them and memories
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:40.240]   made it a little easier to make that decision.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:43.200]   Yeah, it's interesting because we did a similar thing, right?
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.600]   We bought a fractional Picasso.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.280]   And we have this vacation home.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:50.960]   And one of the challenges with it, which I think I didn't anticipate,
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.720]   is that when you own a fractional home,
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:56.400]   you have to share it with, in this case, 7 other people.
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.760]   And so I don't think I realized in advance
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:04.480]   how different your schedule of life is once your kids go to school.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:08.640]   So my daughter starts pre-K next year and we got the schedule and I was like,
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:12.640]   "Oh, so she's got summer, spring break, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.880]   And other than that, she's in school every day."
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:18.160]   And so the thing we've realized recently is,
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:21.920]   "Well, how do you get 6 or 7 weeks in your vacation home
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:24.960]   if you have to share it with other people and you can only go twice in the summer?"
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:29.200]   And so we're having a little bit of a struggle here because like you,
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:32.240]   we just realized that when we get away for a week,
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.960]   we have such great experiences, right?
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.320]   Like we're by the pool.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.240]   We're working a little less.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:38.960]   We're having fun.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.440]   My daughter is trying to swim across the length of the pool.
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:42.160]   It's amazing.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.160]   And those experiences will last forever.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:49.680]   And it's so much easier for me, I imagine also for you and other people,
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:56.560]   to make this one-time purchase that then after the fact will just force you to use it.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:58.880]   And it can be small.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.040]   I remember when I lived in New York City,
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.920]   I knew that optimally I should pay for every metro ride.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:09.600]   But I knew that if I just paid what was more for the unlimited metro ticket,
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:12.080]   which was like $70 a month,
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.400]   I would just never think about whether I was going out.
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:18.880]   And this goes back to me being a saver and letting $2 metro rides change what I did.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.680]   But I just knew that sometimes making a decision
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.240]   that might not be the financially best outcome
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:28.000]   will force you to do a thing that would be otherwise difficult.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.360]   And I imagine both of us would have really struggled
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:35.360]   to pay for a bunch of vacations every week during the summer,
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.360]   renting houses, going places,
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:41.760]   as much as we would have spent time in a home that we owned,
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:44.240]   in your case, all of, part of for me,
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:48.000]   which because yours is in Michigan was probably about the same cost.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.840]   Yeah, and we have brutal winters here.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.760]   So I wanted to enjoy the water and be out and stuff.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.120]   But it doesn't have to be something,
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.440]   obviously, that's not something everyone can afford.
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:59.280]   Especially now, we timed it pretty good and got in six years ago or so.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.640]   But it can be other things.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:03.520]   Like I value paying for my time more, I would advocate.
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.080]   So I used to do all my lawn work myself to our house.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.960]   I used to go out and snowplow the driveway myself.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.960]   And now we will pay for time
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:14.400]   because as opposed to me spending an hour every weekend
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.160]   mowing the grass and trimming everything,
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.520]   now I realized, well, wait, I can spend time with my kids
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:20.320]   and have someone else do that.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:23.440]   So I think paying for time and convenience is a big help too,
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:27.440]   if you want to have more time to do the things that you care about.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.800]   I think that's the big change that I've made.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:35.920]   And it's funny because my parents were completely the opposite.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.240]   And I do have some of that element in me.
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.920]   But I also can see myself fighting against that
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.040]   and trying to go the other way.
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.920]   And there are still certain things that I will not spend money on.
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:46.320]   I just, I'm not a luxury car person.
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:48.800]   I don't like going out and spending on fancy restaurants.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.720]   And I'm not degrading people who like to do that.
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:54.880]   I think you just have to pick the things that you care about and prioritize them.
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.640]   And then there can still be these other categories where you say,
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:00.080]   "You know what? As much as I could spend money on that if I wanted to,
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:02.400]   I don't need to. So I'm still okay cutting back on that area."
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.920]   Yeah. Paula Pan has this podcast, "Afford Anything."
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.720]   And she's like, "You can afford anything you want, just not everything."
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:11.680]   It's like, you got to pick what you want to afford.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.080]   But in that post about savings, you said,
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:17.280]   "I prefer to save a reasonable amount of money and enjoy the rest."
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:21.040]   I think something a lot of people struggle with is what's a reasonable amount.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.680]   This is the hard part with retirement planning in general,
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:27.120]   because there's so many variables that you getting back to the uncertainty part.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:28.960]   You don't know what inflation is going to be in the future,
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:30.480]   what financial market returns are going to be,
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.240]   what interest rates are going to be,
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.400]   how your income is going to change over time,
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.200]   if any other life events are going to impact you.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:40.640]   So it's funny, when I started my job and I did this
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:44.080]   linear extrapolation of compounding and saving and stuff,
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:47.760]   I never could have thought about the different events that would happen in my life from
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:51.280]   having kids to buying houses to all these things that happen
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:54.720]   that throw off your plan for a period of time, right?
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.200]   And you have this savings rate you think is going to be there forever,
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:00.000]   but then you need to take those savings and use them for something
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.600]   because life gets in the way.
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:05.360]   So I tell people, my baseline is just,
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.080]   I would love to see everyone at least have a double digit savings rate.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:10.480]   That's a good, I think that's a good goal for most people
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:14.400]   is just to have that as a good starting point.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:18.000]   - Is that double digit net or gross income?
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.160]   - I'm more of a net kind of guy.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:25.040]   So I think having a double digit percent is a good starting point.
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:28.080]   And I think then you kind of turn the dials up
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.080]   depending on how well things are going for you.
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:34.320]   In personal finance, people always talk about lifestyle creep, right?
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:36.480]   This is the biggest enemy is lifestyle creep.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.760]   And I think it's as you make more money and your career progresses,
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:42.240]   I think you should introduce a little lifestyle creep,
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.720]   but have the savings creep up too, right?
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.040]   So have it be a certain percentage of your income.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.720]   So if your income goes up
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:50.720]   and you're still saving a similar percentage,
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.400]   your savings will go up as well, right?
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.200]   So your spending and your savings should both go up commensurately.
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:59.680]   I think that's a good way to sort of give yourself some benefits
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.280]   of your fruits of your labor,
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:03.920]   but also increasing the savings over time.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:05.680]   - Yeah, when I was trying to figure this out,
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:08.640]   I went deep into kind of safe withdrawal rates, right?
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.960]   We've all, you know, the 4% rule is out there.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:15.520]   And I actually had Karsten from early retirement now.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.080]   I don't know if you've read his blog on the podcast.
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:19.520]   And he's written, I don't know,
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:23.920]   probably six books worth of blog posts on just safe withdrawal rates.
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:26.960]   And I went in and tried to use his free template
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.680]   to dial in my safe withdrawal rate
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:32.240]   to try to figure out where I was at for retirement.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.440]   'Cause it was, you know,
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.400]   I think there's kind of multiple levels of tools you can play with.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.800]   I think the two I love the most are Projection Lab
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:41.920]   and this safe withdrawal rate toolkit.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:46.000]   And I realized that the 4% rule was designed,
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.080]   you know, for a 30-year time horizon,
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.240]   but to work almost every time.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.600]   And when I was trying to design-
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.040]   - It's like worst case scenario, right?
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:54.960]   - Yeah, yeah, this is what I realized.
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:58.880]   In his tool, you can actually optimize for a failure rate.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:02.880]   And I found myself optimizing for a failure rate of like 2% to 5%.
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:06.000]   And I realized that, you know,
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.480]   I've been fortunate to do a lot of financial plans.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.720]   And when you look at these Monte Carlo simulations
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:13.200]   of what all the outcomes can be, you know,
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:17.040]   if you're optimizing for a 2% to 5% failure rate,
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:20.000]   you know, you will succeed 95% to 98% of the time.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.040]   But more than 50% of the time,
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:27.280]   you will wildly succeed way beyond your expectations.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.520]   - Yeah, you'll have more money than you thought in the future.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:32.320]   - Yeah, and so I was actually, as I was thinking about that,
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.880]   I found this post you wrote about how you might need less
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:36.160]   than you think for retirement.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:42.560]   And it was crazy how much money some people have,
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.440]   even when they think they're trying to save conservatively,
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.280]   they just don't spend what they think.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.280]   And I think Bill Perkins found the same thing to be true
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:49.920]   in his book.
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:54.640]   And I think it somewhat comes down to this mentality
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:59.120]   that I'm guilty of myself of really optimizing for no failure,
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:02.160]   which means that you're more likely than not
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.160]   going to wildly exceed what you expect.
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:06.320]   - So my experience working with clients
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:08.640]   in the wealth management space is most people
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.560]   probably have more savings than they'll ever need,
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.000]   who get to the point where they can retire.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:12.960]   Obviously, there's certain people
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:13.840]   who just don't have enough.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:17.040]   But the people who are in the wealth management space,
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:17.920]   a lot of times what happens
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:19.520]   is they save and invest their whole career,
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.760]   or they build a business and they sell the business,
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.040]   they have this big lump sum of cash,
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:26.320]   and they get to retirement and they can't mentally
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.960]   switch it around and go the other way and spend it.
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:30.560]   So we get these people who say,
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.320]   "I just wanna live off of the dividend income
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:33.040]   "from my portfolio,
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.480]   "and I never wanna touch the principal."
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:38.720]   And, or, you know, "I just can't get myself to spend any."
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.280]   And I think that's what I've realized
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.200]   is that most people probably need less than they think
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:47.440]   because they just can't force themselves to spend more.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.960]   Right, and people have got around it
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.960]   by giving away to children or giving to charity.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.280]   And some people have to force themselves
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.320]   to go on vacations and stuff.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:55.520]   But I think for most people,
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.840]   you don't realize that your spending
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:00.880]   is probably going to fall as you age.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.320]   Like the first decade of retirement,
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:03.280]   people spend a little more.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.600]   But from there, you know, after 70s, it drops a little
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.520]   'cause you're not as active as you once were.
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.440]   Right, and so I think a lot of people
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.800]   just have a hard time mentally becoming spenders
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.640]   when they, "Well, I don't work anymore.
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:15.840]   "I'm not having income come in.
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.840]   "I can't, these bear markets are harder to ride out
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.440]   "'cause I don't have savings going back into 'em."
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.400]   So I totally understand where people are coming from.
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.840]   But it's really hard to get people to take that nest egg
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:28.320]   they have and see it be depleted over time
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:31.520]   because the biggest risk is I'm gonna run out of money.
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:32.960]   And that's what everyone is worried about.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.400]   So they end up not spending as much
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:35.920]   as they probably can or should.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:37.360]   Yeah, you shared this study.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:41.440]   And it was interesting that at almost all levels of wealth,
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:43.920]   whether it was people with less than $200,000
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.480]   all the way to way more than 500 to a million dollars,
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:50.480]   they all drastically underspent their retirement savings
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.920]   in the first 10 or 20 years.
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.680]   As Employee Benefit Research Institute,
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:56.640]   they looked at 20 years worth of retirement people.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:58.160]   And they looked at all different types.
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:01.360]   People who have less than 200K, 200 to 500 or 500 or more.
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:04.560]   And they found that most people spent the income
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:05.440]   from their portfolio
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:07.200]   and just avoided taking the principal balance,
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.240]   like I talked about.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.000]   And they said after like 20 years,
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   retirees, even with the biggest nest eggs,
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.320]   spent less than 12% of their portfolio.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.760]   So unfortunately, these people
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:19.360]   are probably holding themselves back
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.800]   from enjoying retirement a little bit
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.360]   because they're so worried about spending it.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:27.120]   It's funny, the studies show that someone with an annuity
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.960]   that pays them a regular stream of income
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:32.080]   spend more money than someone with just a portfolio
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:34.080]   trying to create their own stream of income.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.760]   And even if you look at annuities
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.360]   and think of all the bad parts about them,
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:38.800]   the high fees and the liquidity,
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.640]   and there's problems with annuities
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.360]   that some people have.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:45.280]   But if that kind of strategy
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:48.000]   allows you to mentally get over the hurdle of spending money,
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.360]   it probably makes sense,
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:51.360]   even if it is potentially suboptimal
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:52.320]   from a return perspective.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:54.960]   Yeah, or even I could make a case
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:56.240]   if you're not comfortable with annuities,
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:59.600]   it's like shifting into really high dividend investments
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:02.560]   that maybe is not the perfect portfolio
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:04.720]   from a long-term return standpoint,
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:08.560]   but laddering on a bunch of US treasuries
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:09.600]   and dividend stocks
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:11.840]   so that you produce a higher amount of income
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.520]   so you just feel better about spending it.
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:16.320]   But I think my takeaway from it all is
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:22.400]   if you have the ability to flex and go back to work
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:23.920]   or do something on the side,
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:29.520]   if things fall into that 2% to 5% catastrophic level,
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:33.840]   you can probably start spending more now and saving less.
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:37.040]   Obviously, this is all dependent on how much money you have
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.080]   and how much you're saving,
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:40.960]   but it looks like the average person
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:45.120]   who will hit a six-figure retirement balance at some point
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:48.000]   is probably going to oversave,
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.320]   which means underspend.
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:52.880]   And the years that you and I are at right now
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:53.920]   where we have young kids,
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:56.560]   I think there's a case for spending more
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:57.920]   than we're comfortable with.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:02.960]   And I'm glad that you and maybe me to a lesser extent,
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:04.960]   but my kids are still a little younger,
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.480]   are getting comfortable with it.
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:07.920]   And the thing you have to remember too,
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.360]   the kids are gonna be gone someday
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.440]   and hopefully off of the family budget.
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:12.320]   And that's the point where
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:14.160]   if you wanna do the catch-up savings,
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:15.760]   you can make it up at the end,
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:18.160]   especially if we're gonna be potentially living longer.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.600]   So yeah, that's part of it too.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:20.720]   And I think the flex part too,
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:21.840]   if you said be flexible
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:23.920]   with potentially making earnings more income,
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:26.080]   you can be flexible with your spending in retirement too.
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.120]   When there's really good years
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:28.160]   and you wanna spend a little bit more
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:29.840]   and take an extra vacation, that's fine.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:32.800]   If the market does happen to tank early on in your retirement
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:33.600]   and it freaks you out,
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.760]   then you can pull back a little bit, not spend as much.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.080]   So I think you just have to be flexible there too.
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:41.360]   The 4% rule, I think it's a good baseline
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:42.320]   for people to start with.
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:45.520]   It doesn't have to be followed religiously for everyone.
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:47.120]   I think you can also be flexible
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.400]   in terms of how much you spend
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:51.040]   depending on what the environment happens to be.
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:55.040]   'Cause if you retired 15 years ago
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:58.880]   and the stock market is up 12% per year, whatever it is,
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:00.240]   you're probably in a far better position
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:01.600]   than you ever thought was possible.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:02.880]   Home prices are up a lot.
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:04.720]   So I think you have to take all those variables
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:08.160]   into account of what reality fits with your expectations
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.600]   and how they mesh
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:11.760]   and then make course corrections from there.
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:14.720]   - Yeah, I think the biggest takeaway you had,
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:17.440]   which I actually made this tweak
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:19.760]   in the "Safe Withdrawal" spreadsheet
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:20.480]   that I was playing with
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:24.000]   was instead of using the amount of money we need to live
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.080]   as what we spend right now,
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:28.480]   I basically said, "Here's what we spend
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:30.480]   minus everything we're spending on kids
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:31.920]   and school and all this stuff."
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:34.800]   And then I made that like a fixed expense
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.040]   for the next maybe 18 years.
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.960]   And then it went away.
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:41.760]   And then it didn't really factor in the house.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:44.000]   But if you figure, chances are
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.520]   you're probably not gonna upgrade your home in retirement
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:48.720]   once the kids are gone.
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:51.280]   So I also made all the spending on our home,
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:53.680]   at least the mortgage payments,
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:56.000]   fixed things until the end of the mortgage,
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.920]   which meant that my spending post-kids, post-mortgage
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:01.200]   dropped by more than 50%.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:05.360]   And I was mentally planning for,
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:08.400]   I need enough money to support my current lifestyle,
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:12.080]   not I need enough money to support my current lifestyle,
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:15.520]   minus the mortgage, minus the kids,
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:19.040]   which is drastically smaller amount of money
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:20.880]   and requires drastically less savings.
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:22.560]   - Yeah, and the taxes might be lower.
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:24.720]   I will say, Chris, you're far more optimized than me
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:26.880]   because you've already planned out your retirement spending.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:28.480]   I have not gone that far yet.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:29.440]   So you beat me.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:30.560]   - It was interesting.
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:32.880]   But the way I backed into it was,
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:35.360]   how much money do I have to make each year
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:37.200]   to get to the confidence interval I want?
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.960]   And that number, it became my savings rate, right?
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:43.200]   So it was like, if I want to be able to
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:46.880]   stop working at year X and I want a failure rate of Y,
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.160]   what do I need?
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:49.680]   And I just tried a bunch of numbers
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:52.480]   until I was like, this is how much money I need to save.
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.640]   And then anything between that,
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:58.000]   I should almost feel disappointed if we save more
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:02.880]   because there's so many ways that we could use that money
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:06.480]   to live a wealthier, happier life with our kids right now
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.560]   while they want to hang out with us.
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:11.760]   While we have jobs that we do
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:12.800]   that are a little more flexible
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:15.360]   and we could take a little time off and all that kind of stuff.
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.520]   So it's been really eye-opening.
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:18.720]   I'm glad you wrote that post
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:20.880]   because it forced me to think about a lot of these things.
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:23.760]   I'll absolutely share a link to it in the show notes
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:26.400]   and curious what other people's experiences are here.
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:27.680]   This has been great.
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:30.320]   Where can people find everything you're writing?
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:33.200]   A Wealth of Common Sense, sign up for the newsletter there.
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:37.120]   Weekly Animal Spirits podcast drops on Wednesdays.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.200]   And yeah, find me there.
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:40.560]   I probably talked about the podcast
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:41.920]   more than any other podcast.
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:43.680]   It's in my regular queue of listening.
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.360]   So thank you for doing that.
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:46.240]   And thanks for all your writing.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.040]   And thanks for joining me.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.240]   Glad to be here.
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.200]   Thanks, Chris.
