[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.840]   Well, we Protestants don't use confessionals, and apparently Martin Luther thought the confessional
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.680]   booth was a good idea, but of course he was careful to make the practice voluntary and
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.200]   never binding.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.280]   More recently, John Stott commended the practice of regularly confessing sins to a trusted
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.280]   pastor.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.760]   So, maybe a rare Anglican church here or there has a confessional, but on the whole, Protestants
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.760]   don't practice auricular confession of our sins to a minister.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.140]   So the question is, "What place should private confession of our personal sins to others
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.080]   play when we're talking about confessing our sins to fellow Christians?"
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.800]   It's the question that comes from Nathan, who asks this, "Pastor John, thank you for
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.720]   enriching my walk with Christ by your obedience to the truth, faithfully serving the body
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.680]   of Christ with your gift of preaching.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.400]   For the past few years, I have been struggling with a text and a drumbeat sounding in the
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.880]   campus ministry I work for and the church I attend.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.240]   James 5.16 is the drumbeat that we need to confess our sins to each other.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:09.040]   Now I am thankfully aware of Psalm 51.4 and 1 John 1.9, as I have preached on 1 John 1.9
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.040]   many times.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.440]   There is one mediator between God and man, Jesus Christ the righteous."
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.340]   Here are my main questions.
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.020]   What exactly is James commanding us to do in James 5.16?
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.200]   What does it mean that you may be healed, and could you give us a brief theology of
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.880]   relational confession practices on the whole?
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.520]   Okay, let's do the brief theology first.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.320]   Let's begin broad and general and collect some building blocks for the theology of relational
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.240]   confession, and then get down to the specifics of James 5.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.240]   So here we go.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.760]   I would start with the truth that owing to our new birth and our new creation in Christ
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:02.440]   through faith, we are now children of God who is light, and in him is no darkness at
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:10.800]   all, and in him, in union with him, we are children of light.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.600]   Ephesians 5.8, "At one time you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.560]   Walk as children of the light, for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.080]   true and right."
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.120]   Good and true.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.880]   So the fact that we are children of light, and part of light is truth, we will not—the
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.360]   Christian community will not—be marked by secretiveness or cloaking ourselves or our
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.920]   motives so that people don't know who we really are, we won't be hypocrites, we won't
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:55.160]   try to look on the outside what we're not on the inside, and that necessarily includes
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.840]   being truthful about our sinfulness and our struggle with sin.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.240]   It doesn't mean you need to broadcast to the whole world your specific sins.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.800]   That wouldn't be good for them, and it wouldn't be good for you, but it does mean that you
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:21.840]   need to be known as an open book appropriately read by accountable, mature people in your
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.840]   life.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.680]   You're not a secretive person, a hypocritical person.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:35.040]   Ephesians 4.25, "Therefore, having put away all falsehood, let us speak truth with
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.800]   each other, with our neighbors, for we are members of one another."
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.800]   That's going to include doctrinal truth, relational truth, truth about God, truth about
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.400]   others, truth about circumstances, truth about our own souls.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.000]   We are people of truth.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.600]   That would be a foundational building block in the theology of relational confession.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:08.600]   Now what follows from this humble truthfulness about ourselves and others is that we will
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:18.660]   seek to confess and make right any ways that we have wronged others, Matthew 5.23.
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.560]   So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there, remember that your brother has
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.400]   something against you, leave your gift at the altar and go.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.560]   Just be reconciled to your brother.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.960]   Then come offer your gift.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.520]   So confess it.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.640]   Go tell him you wronged him and get it worked out.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:46.440]   Being children of light also implies that we will not be ashamed to pursue reconciliation
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:54.920]   by drawing the attention to the sins of others against us in the body of Christ, Matthew
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.920]   18.15.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.520]   If your brother sins against you, go tell him his fault between you and him alone.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.760]   If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.160]   In other words, get a confession from him if you can, because then you preserve the
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.640]   relationship.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.920]   So we try to help others confess when we know about their sin.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:25.040]   And Galatians 6.1 generalizes it, "Brothers, if anyone is caught in a transgression, you
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.600]   who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.000]   Keep watch over your own souls, lest you too be tempted."
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.680]   So restoring somebody caught in a sin is clearly going to involve helping them confess it.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.640]   If they lie about it or hide it, then nothing is achieved.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.660]   So confession is clearly implied in this brotherly effort to make right wrongs.
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.240]   We have done by confession and make right wrongs.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.320]   Others have done by ruining our relationship by helping them confess.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:07.720]   Then Ephesians 4.32, a real broad application, Paul describes a community spirit in which
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.420]   confession and forgiveness is regularly happening.
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:19.520]   He says in Ephesians 4.32, "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another,
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.960]   as God in Christ forgave you."
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:29.640]   So the words "forgiving one another" assumes confession is happening, because you don't
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.760]   go around the church forgiving people who haven't given any indication that they've
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.760]   sinned against you.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.720]   That would be the most offensive thing in the world.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.600]   I forgive you, I forgive you, and they don't even know what you're talking about.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.940]   So clearly forgiving one another implies there's confession going on.
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:55.120]   People have come to you, they've admitted they've sinned, and you're forgiving them.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.720]   Which brings us now to James 5.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:03.680]   James has just said that the elders are praying over a sick person, and if they are given
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.280]   the gift of faith for that person, they are healed, the person is healed, God will raise
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.840]   them up, and then he adds this, "And if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven."
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:23.720]   So it appears that in the encounter with the elders, sins emerge which were somehow connected
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.720]   with this illness.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.440]   We're not told how.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:35.240]   And it may be that James intends to include in the healing, which is literally the word
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:43.240]   "sozo," saved, you will save the sick man, he intends that healing happen in the fullest
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.160]   sense of spiritual as well as physical.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.840]   That's why sins are brought up here.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:54.760]   So there was physical healing, and then there was an emergence of these sins that were somehow
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:00.400]   involved and those were taken care of as well in this encounter with the elders.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.640]   And then James draws out this inference generally.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:11.080]   "Therefore," that's a key word, "therefore confess your sins to one another."
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.040]   So just like what happened when the elders were having that prayer meeting, you confess
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:21.920]   your sins to one another and pray for one another that you may be healed.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:29.240]   And I take this to mean simply that in the normal life of the Christian, honesty and
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:39.320]   truthfulness and purity of heart involve continual admission and confession of sin to appropriate
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.520]   people in our lives.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.520]   The result will be greater than physical.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:55.080]   It will include spiritual health as well, because Psalm 32 makes the physical and the
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.840]   spiritual clear.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:02.280]   I had a real experience like this with a man in our church, so this text really came alive
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.040]   for me when he used it to describe his misery.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:12.320]   It goes like this, "When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.320]   the day."
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.320]   See what happens?
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:19.400]   I'm silent, I'm not confessing, and it's having this awful physical effect on me.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.680]   "For day and night your hand was heavy upon me.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.720]   My strength was dried up as by the heat of summer."
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:31.760]   And then here comes the solution, verse 5, "I acknowledged my sin to you, and I did not
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.520]   cover my iniquity.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:40.680]   I said, 'I will confess my transgressions to the Lord,' and you forgave the iniquity
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.680]   of my sin."
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.440]   Now, the principle there—I know it's confession to the Lord there, but the principle there
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:54.680]   between physical well-being and a locked-up sin that nobody knows, and you're trying
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:00.080]   to hide from the Lord, you're keeping from other people—the principle is dishonesty
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:09.040]   and hiddenness and privateness about our sins brings both spiritual and physical misery.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:16.240]   And God would spare us that, and so he teaches us to confess our sins to God and to one another.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.480]   Well, that was a brief but robust theology of personal confession.
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.480]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.540]   And thank you for listening and supporting the podcast.
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:28.080]   You can subscribe to our audio feeds and search our past episodes in our archive, and send
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.280]   us an email of your own, even questions related to church practice and how we apply scriptural
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.200]   principles in our lives together as brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:43.120]   You can do all of that through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:48.280]   Well here is the next question on the docket, and it is quite a question.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:53.200]   When it comes to temptations to sexual sin, Jesus says, "If your hand causes you to sin,
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.200]   cut it off."
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:11:00.240]   He also says, "There are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs."
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:07.040]   So in reading these kinds of texts together a bit, does Jesus applaud surgical or chemical
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:12.560]   castration as a winning strategy in the war against lust?
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.480]   That is the question, and the answer should be very interesting.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.760]   For that, I am your host, Tony Reinke, and we will see you on Friday.
