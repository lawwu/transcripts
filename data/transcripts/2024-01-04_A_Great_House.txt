[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   Hey Radicals, as we begin today's podcast, today is January 4, 2024.
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:12.240]   On January 22, my forthcoming Panama Investment Tour begins.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.020]   Now last week I was talking with Mikkel Thorup, who is the primary host of this
[00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.880]   event. I am co-hosting it along with Gabriel Custodiat and Mikkel, and we were
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.600]   going over the numbers and everything like that.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.040]   And I said, Mikkel, I think we're done.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.760]   And Mikkel said, no, Joshua, most people sign up for this event, usually a couple
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.240]   of weeks before. It used to be that people sign up six months in advance, etc., like
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.480]   you expected. But in reality, in today's world, people sign up for stuff just a
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.760]   couple of weeks before the event.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.640]   No one wants to commit very much in addition.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.000]   So I was ready to stop doing ads and close things down.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.640]   And he said, no, you need to do ads.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.280]   So here I am doing an ad.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.320]   If you have ever thought about internationalization broadly, meaning you're
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.480]   interested in getting a second passport, having a residency elsewhere, banking in
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.440]   another country, anything like that, if you're interested in international
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.480]   investment, in investing in real estate in other countries for higher gains, greater
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.320]   opportunities, privacy, etc., or if you're interested in Panama specifically and
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.320]   you've wondered, hey, what is it about that little country?
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.080]   Why do so many people go there?
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.520]   Why do so many business oriented people go there?
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.200]   Then I would love for you to come to this event.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.160]   It's going to be a week long event together with me, Mikkel and Gabriel.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.920]   We have a bunch of events planned.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.200]   We have a bunch of tours planned.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.000]   I'll be speaking.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.760]   We'll all be speaking.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.720]   It's going to be a great time.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.880]   We're going to be hanging out.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.000]   Very intimate group of people able to hang out continually.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.480]   So if you just want to see me and spend basically a week with me and with my
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.920]   friends, I'll be making myself completely available.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.280]   It's a great time for us to get together.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.960]   You can come.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.920]   We can talk about anything that you want to talk about.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.440]   And again, I'm going to make myself completely available to you.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.800]   So if that's you and you are available during January 22 to January 28,
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.360]   please today go and sign up.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.320]   Sign up today.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.480]   Go to expatmoney.com/radical link in the show notes.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.440]   expatmoney.com/radical sign up today for the event.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.440]   Just a couple of weeks left.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.160]   expatmoney.com/radical.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:19.040]   Let's suppose you are a very wealthy man, no longer content with merely business
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.600]   success, you have aspirations of being something of a statesman.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.600]   You want to have a large impact on society.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.400]   And as you are a long-term thinker, you want your particular values to
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.440]   outlive you far into the future.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.960]   Let us furthermore assume that your opinions are heterodox compared
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.400]   to prevailing sentiments.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.920]   You are, after all, a contrarian.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.040]   You made your fortune by making large bets on ideas that were discounted
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.000]   or even unimaginable by the rest of the market.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.640]   You know that if you want to propagate your different ideas, you are going to
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.400]   have to find a completely unprecedented vehicle to express them.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.000]   In this essay, we'll examine a new kind of institution that
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.080]   can help you achieve your goals.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.960]   We present this in the form of a thought experiment.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.440]   You begin by thinking about the existing things or institutions that
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.760]   could a) embody your values and b) survive for a very long time.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.760]   You consider the following and discard each.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.160]   A business.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.120]   You have already founded and sold or IPO'd several of these.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.480]   Businesses are good for making money, but not so good for transmitting
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.560]   worldviews because they are subject to so much government oversight.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.080]   You must hire from the general public according to the law and must therefore
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.880]   admit general public type ideas.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.680]   You have indirect or no influence in choosing leadership for your public
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.400]   companies after you are gone, especially not after you are dead.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.440]   A school.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.720]   You could found a university, but in order for it to be accredited, you will
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.360]   also be subject to government oversight.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.680]   You also have very little way of ensuring the school remains true
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.480]   to your vision after you are dead.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.160]   A charitable foundation.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.800]   You could leave all your money to a foundation dedicated to a cause you like.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.480]   But once again, you have very little way of ensuring the fund administrators
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.480]   don't subvert your wishes after your death.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.760]   You also don't like the idea of putting your descendants in charge of just doling
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.000]   out money for the next few generations.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.200]   You have an aversion to professional philanthropists.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.880]   A book.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.320]   You could write a book about your ideas, but you have no way of guaranteeing
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.040]   that it will ever be or continue to remain popular after your death.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.800]   The odds of having a book in circulation for more than
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.120]   100 years is vanishingly small.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.160]   A monument.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.320]   Massive stone structures have longevity on the order of tens of thousands of years.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.840]   Now we're getting somewhere.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.160]   You could build a great stone pyramid inscribed with your ideas in several
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.600]   different languages, or even a clock, depending on how large and grand your
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.280]   monument was, people would come from all over the world to see it long into the future.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.240]   However, you discard this idea.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.400]   You realize that while this is actually a pretty good way to get your ideas read,
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.240]   there is no way to guarantee they would be interpreted the way you want them to.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.320]   Politics.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.160]   You could pour your money into a political campaign, either for
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.480]   yourself or a favored candidate.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.240]   If you win, you get to use the power of state to express your
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.480]   values in the world at broad scale.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.680]   And you might even cultivate a following who would revere you after your death.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.640]   But you discard this plan as well.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.080]   While it has some very attractive benefits, you tend to avoid competition.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.200]   And you know that politics is the most competitive domain on
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.480]   earth, besides naked warfare.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.080]   You decide you need something else entirely.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.680]   You need an institution that A, will faithfully embody your ideals, freedom
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.040]   to set initial conditions and create new systems as you see fit with no compromise.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.160]   B, will grow over time.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.680]   Institution augments and becomes stronger with age, preferably at a compounding rate.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.320]   C, indivestible, cannot be taken away from you, is hard for other actors,
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.560]   including governments, to interfere with.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.840]   You decide on the following, which you call the great house plan.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:43.760]   One, you will choose 150 men with families who are aligned with your ideals and of
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.000]   the best quality you can possibly find.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.960]   Two, you will give them monthly cash payments for the rest of their lives in
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:57.800]   the form of a gift, conditional on their loyalty, agreement to embody and propagate
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.120]   your ideals and commitment to having six children.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.720]   Three, you will support these families and see to their growth and the education
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.560]   and development of their children.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.400]   Four, these men will generally be working, studying, and pursuing their
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.840]   interests and the interests of the network out in the world, but will come
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.440]   work for you when called into service.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.520]   They should expect to work for you about 33% of the time over
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.800]   the course of their careers.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.080]   While they work for you, they will receive salary in addition to their gift payments.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:40.280]   Five, these men will also be loyal to the other men in your network and will
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.440]   work to advance each other's interests.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:49.120]   Six, this offer will extend to each man's male offspring upon reaching majority.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.640]   Seven, this arrangement can be terminated at any time by either party.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.200]   In short, you are going to play the part of the godfather.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:06.160]   You are going to translate your money directly into social capital by
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.360]   jump-starting a high-growth-rate network of families who regard you and
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.000]   your descendants as their benefactor.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.240]   You will not need to invent a new technology to do this.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.600]   You will only need to broaden your time horizon.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.840]   While there is nothing like this in the modern world, there is a historical
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.040]   precedent for this institution.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.880]   Roman patronage.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:34.680]   You are going to be a patron, and your beneficiaries are going to be your clients.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:39.960]   You are going to start small so you can set initial conditions exactly how you like,
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.760]   but the network will grow at a compounding rate.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.240]   You will provide the capital to bring the network together, and once it
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.040]   reaches self-sufficiency, it will continue on without you.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:57.680]   Beginning with just 150 couples after a surprisingly short amount of time, 30
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:04.520]   years, you will have a community of over 1,000 people who are elite, aligned to
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.000]   your ideals, and personally loyal to you.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.800]   Your money has provided the catalyst necessary for family growth,
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.400]   which is compounding network growth.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.280]   It's also a selection gate.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:24.440]   Only you get to choose who you give your money to, so you get
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.080]   to be as selective as you want.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.880]   Lack of demand for your money will not be an issue.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.840]   You can select from among your closest associates, choose exclusively from your
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:40.000]   church or favorite geography, use an IQ test, or make any kind of criteria you want.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.880]   No one can tell you how to give your money away for free, not even the government.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.920]   Lastly, your money is the primary, not ultimate, glue that
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.160]   holds everything together.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:57.280]   Your offer is for life and is even open to descendants, but can also be terminated
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:03.040]   at any time, ensuring maximum possible long-term alignment and long-term leverage.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.520]   Let's have a look at how this network grows over time, assuming lifetime
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:13.600]   fertility of six children per woman and cash payments of $5,000 a month to each
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.800]   head of household, I'm now going to summarize a chart.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.600]   If you'd like to see the whole chart, check the link for this essay in the show notes.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.000]   But the summary of the chart shows that in year zero, there is a total population
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.680]   of 300 persons out of 150 families.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.800]   The voting age population is 300.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:39.000]   There are 150 able-bodied men and the cost per year is 9 million US dollars per year
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.280]   with a cumulative cost of $9 million.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:47.240]   After 10 years, the total population has grown to 900 out of 150 families.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:52.960]   The voting age population continues to be 300 able-bodied men, 150, costing
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:58.120]   $9 million per year for a cumulative cost of $99 million over 10 years.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:06.320]   After 30 years, the total population has increased to 1,365 persons, 289 total
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:14.960]   families, 1,005 voting age persons, 360 able-bodied men, an annual cost of $17.3
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.280]   million and a total cumulative cost of $302 million.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:27.320]   After 50 years, the total population has increased to 3,812, 547 total families
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:33.840]   are represented with a voting age population of 1,448 and 618 able-bodied
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:40.560]   men with an annual cost of $32.8 million and total cumulative cost of $905 million.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:48.240]   Dropping down after 100 years, the total population is 20,918 persons, which
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:54.720]   are representing 4,235 families, voting age population of 11,150 persons
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.880]   and 4,203 able-bodied men.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:03.120]   The chart continues and shows that at the very end, after 300 years with this
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:09.560]   kind of growth, the total population would be 27.9 million persons, representing
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:17.400]   4.9 million families, a total voting age population of 13.4 million persons of
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:22.280]   voting age and able-bodied men of 5,208,000.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:27.800]   As we can see, after 30 years, your population has more than quadrupled.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.800]   Your first generation of children has matured to adulthood and you have a
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.800]   working and voting population of about 1,000 highly elite people who
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.800]   regard you as their benefactor.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.600]   You can now begin placing them in your companies, your political campaigns,
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.840]   or your cultural projects, and they will see to your interests.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.720]   Your children, meanwhile, are well into their careers as full-time
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.640]   developers of human capital, because you have plans to make this whole
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.320]   operation self-sufficient by year 60.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.000]   Therefore, your descendants will not be trust fund kids.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.800]   You are going to give away 100% of your money.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.720]   If this project is to outlive you, they are going to be the guardians,
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.360]   spiritual and material leaders, and benefactors of a new people.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.840]   By year 60, the first children from generation three have started to be born.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.840]   Your great house can sway elections in small towns.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.680]   Your network is also now self-sufficient.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:27.200]   By this point, assuming your people are at least as entrepreneurial as
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.760]   Stanford B school grads, about a 30% founder rate, your network has
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.800]   founded more than 260 ventures, 10% of which will have been successful if
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.080]   you apply common startup rules of thumb.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.440]   It will be up to you to work out exactly how individuals who have graduated out
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.560]   of your network continue to contribute, but with ties of gratitude and loyalty,
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.160]   you should be able to work something out that includes a combination of options
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:56.720]   on in-network businesses, as well as donations, and your people will donate back.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.080]   People have extraordinary loyalty to schools they paid
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.320]   for the privilege to attend.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.400]   Imagine how loyal they would be to a school that paid them.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.760]   Incidentally, this will be a full-time job for many of your children.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.520]   They will work to ensure your people are healthy, happy, educated, and fulfilled.
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.720]   They will settle disputes, represent their interests, provide services,
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.320]   be a social nexus, and lead large-scale projects.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:26.120]   By year 120, the whole thing is being administered by your great grandchildren.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.400]   Your people number 50,000, and they could field about two U.S.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.120]   Army Combat Brigades of manpower if they needed to.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.040]   If they keep founding ventures at their historic rate, they will have
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.520]   founded more than 200 successful companies.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:46.160]   They now comprise an elite minority of the kind that tends to rule majorities.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.560]   By year 200, your voting-age population can easily sway elections in any city,
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.080]   the current size of Chicago and below.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:00.480]   By year 300, your people are a national constituency, numbering at 27 million.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.400]   They are a large elite who would have a major say in setting the
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.120]   agenda in any country in the world.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.760]   If you started in the United States, their interests
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.640]   have international implications.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.240]   It is unlikely that they remain as tightly coordinated as they were
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.760]   when you first gathered them together, but they are bound by affection
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.520]   for each other as a distinct people, and regard you as the historic
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.880]   figure who brought them together.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.240]   They revere your founding ideals like we revere America's founding
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:32.320]   ideals today, and maybe even more so, because you've explicitly designed
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.480]   your system to use the power of descendants, which is very effective
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.400]   for transmitting beliefs across long time periods.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.640]   Early Americans were suspicious of hereditary institutions, but your
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.520]   descendants will have a role designated for them – they are to be your
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:53.360]   people's shepherds, they are to provide spiritual leadership, they will
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.440]   live from securing voluntary donations that are invested back into
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.040]   furthering your people's interests.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:03.840]   If they become avaricious, ineffective, or inattentive, the people
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.600]   fire them by ceasing to donate.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.080]   In this way, your descendants will always have a role in propagating
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:13.960]   your ideals, with a favorable population to receive them so long as they are good.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.200]   Among your people will be many successes.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:21.280]   Depending on what you prioritize in early years, their paths even far
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:26.760]   into the future will reflect your tastes, whether for arts or science or letters.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.920]   Some will have gone into politics, their careers launched
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.120]   by their base of support.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.360]   Hundreds of others are business owners.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.640]   They will cooperate to offer each other favorable access to labor, expertise,
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:41.480]   and goods, and they will have created trillions of dollars worth of value.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.720]   Yes, trillions.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.720]   To put things in perspective, the population of New York City is about
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.560]   8 million, with a GDP of $2 trillion.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:56.560]   Imagine a city like New York City that is three times the size, much
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:01.680]   younger, and entirely descended from hand-picked, elite founding stock.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:06.400]   If you can keep your community on track, you will have achieved your goals.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.400]   You started small and made a clean break with current paradigms
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.000]   using a novel institution.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.640]   You got to select for alignment with your beliefs.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.080]   You used human nature to your advantage, to help you pass on your
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.880]   beliefs to subsequent generations.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:25.120]   Every year, your community grows, modeled as a network.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.280]   Their capability increases geometrically for each new member.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.600]   Compared to others, it is an extraordinarily connected and valuable network.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:37.440]   They are uncommonly generous with each other, a reflection of your example.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.600]   They are of above-average intelligence, and they will have even gotten the
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.240]   benefit of a 60-year period of subsidy to get them jump-started.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.440]   Once they number above a few hundred thousand, as long as they hold
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:53.400]   a cooperation and high fertility, it is unlikely that they could ever be eradicated.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.280]   Your monument to the future will never die.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.760]   In exchange, you've spent a little more than $1 billion in today's
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.680]   dollars over the course of 60 years.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.920]   You have a resource in the form of a human network and their goodwill
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.440]   that can't be taxed and can't be taken away from you.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.800]   If your children are involved and maintain your level of care and
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.840]   investment in your people's well-being, you will be able to name them as
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.400]   your successors and pass this enormous good to them, also tax-free.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.920]   You and your descendants could have all your wealth confiscated,
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.800]   your companies nationalized, you could even be thrown in prison, and you
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.320]   would still have your people's loyalty.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:38.080]   In short, you would have made yourself and your descendants into beloved
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:44.200]   princes with the power to lead, using nothing but the last act of sovereignty,
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:48.240]   which can never be taken away, which is to give.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:53.160]   This great act of generosity will be responded to with great loyalty.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.920]   Standing at the head of your people, coordinating their efforts and
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.440]   representing their interests, your successors will compete on the
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.000]   national and international stage.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.360]   You and they will be remembered forever.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.400]   Further discussion of specific considerations.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.880]   Loyalty.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:16.480]   It seems simplistic to suggest that direct cash payments can inspire loyalty.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.880]   After all, salaries are cash payments, and with very large salaries, most
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:25.480]   people would leave for even larger salaries if given the chance.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.880]   The difference here lies in the nature of the transaction.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:33.960]   The cash payment comes in the form of a gift, and so it has
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.800]   an entirely different character.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:41.200]   Yes, there is the condition that your clients be pro-natal and the option on
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.440]   their labor, but you are a successful man.
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.400]   You are selecting for people who presumably want to work for you anyways.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.400]   The situation is akin to a parent paying their children to do something that's
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:56.560]   good for them, and that they do regularly anyways, like brushing their teeth, in
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.320]   which case the gift is really an unnecessary act of generosity that
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.800]   functions as a reinforcement.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.240]   Furthermore, this arrangement is freely chosen.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.120]   By taking the deal, your clients agree to its specific terms.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.800]   Loyalty in exchange for long-term support, and people do tend to feel
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.000]   gratitude towards benefactors.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.600]   Clan relationships are built precisely on this dynamic.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.160]   You will be able to select for agreement to these terms.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:29.040]   Lastly, the arrangement lasts for life, even to subsequent generations,
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.480]   and loyalty compounds over time.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.720]   The longer the history of the relationship, the deeper the trust.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:39.160]   Imagine multi-generational relationships between families, how
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.960]   deep the trust and loyalty could be.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:45.800]   Indeed, these kinds of bonds were once the basis for all political order.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.040]   As your network matures, you will also put it to use to
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.560]   affect change in the world.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.800]   As your people do hard things together and achieve victories, they will also
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.720]   tend to grow in loyalty to you and to each other.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.480]   They will also intermarry.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.760]   In this way, the artificial bonds which you induce in the early stages
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:09.080]   of the project will gradually be replaced by deeper and more organic ties.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.320]   Cost.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.840]   We have assumed cash payments of $5,000 per month.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:20.520]   I have done some Twitter polling that suggested that people would accept $7,170
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:25.040]   per month on average in exchange for their lifetime loyalty, but I tend to
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:29.400]   think this estimate was influenced too much by the poll choices, so I adjusted
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:34.760]   downwards. People also do not tend to know that taxes are not required on cash gifts.
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:39.000]   I think that if you are able to present an inspiring vision, you could adjust
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.680]   this figure downward even further, but it should not be zero.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:47.240]   The point of the exercise is to give your followers resources they can directly
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.040]   invest into having more children.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:54.240]   An interesting exercise would be to execute the plan at smaller scale, starting
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:22:00.080]   with 15 families and a modest $12,000 per year subsidy, a miniature great house
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:07.120]   would number about 450 people after 60 years, at a total cost, $27 million, an
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.560]   outlay achievable for even moderately wealthy families.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.360]   Legibility.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:18.480]   This institution has historical precedent, but is unknown in our day and age, which
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.160]   gives an enormous advantage.
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:24.320]   The great house plan is illegible to the government in many ways.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.200]   While the systems of oversight developed by governments for large companies,
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.040]   schools, and even political campaigns are highly developed, there is no
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.960]   corresponding infrastructure that mandates to whom you are allowed to give
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:36.440]   your money.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:41.040]   As long as you are careful to make your filings and avoid any illegal activity
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:45.120]   within your network, in this you must be scrupulous, you will be free to build
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.640]   your following as you see fit.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.320]   Because you are growing your own population, you don't have to go out and
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.240]   get converts from the public square.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.960]   You will not be out antagonizing anyone.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.880]   Also, the novelty of the program presents an advantage to the first mover.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.920]   Men and women and babies.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:07.120]   The strength of the plan relies on the continued growth of the group.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.960]   Because human growth is exponential, even small differences in the birth rate
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.360]   account for large differences in population over long periods of time.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:20.880]   For example, a fertility rate of 5 children per woman rather than 6 would
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:26.840]   result in a population of 12,000 at 100 years rather than 21,000, a
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.760]   difference of almost 100%.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:32.960]   For this reason, the plan assumes a culture that is optimized for
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.200]   having large families.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:39.160]   In this case, we would emphasize stable and early marriages, high degrees of
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:43.120]   cooperation between families, and division of labor between men and
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.040]   women according to historic roles.
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:49.120]   Most important of all would be to cultivate a sense of optimism about the
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:53.320]   future within the group, where couples feel themselves embedded in a larger
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:57.120]   community that has a sense of purpose and optimism about the future.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:01.600]   The long-term plan presented here, as well as the material help offered by the
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:05.760]   patron, gives powerful tools for the cultivation of this optimism.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:10.520]   It should be noted that because child rearing is so expensive, the patron's
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.920]   subsidy will be unlikely to compensate completely for the costs of having a
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.760]   large family.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:21.600]   Rather, the subsidy is an expensive signal that the patron is concerned for
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.960]   the family's well-being and will contribute to the family's growth in
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.120]   other ways, jobs, introductions for marriages, admittance to the network,
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.000]   spiritual leadership, and personal care, etc.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.840]   The patron's long-term care is a strong inspiration for each family.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.400]   It feels good to be personally cared for.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.560]   A patron should make every effort to select the founding group for their
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.400]   pre-existing intrinsic natal motivation.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:51.120]   This motivation should only have to be encouraged, not induced.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.000]   Polygamy.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.320]   System maximizers will immediately ask why we do not assume polygamy.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.360]   The reason for this is that polygamy does not scale after the first few
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.160]   generations.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:07.080]   In a system where a minority of men pair with the majority of women, too many
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:11.320]   young men remain unpaired, which is a problem associated with instability
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.600]   unless they can be induced to leave.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.720]   It is a poor use of human capital to raise young men only to push
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.720]   them out of the community.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:22.040]   Besides, polygamy is just weird, and if you practice it, your
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.680]   community will be labeled a cult.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.920]   Conclusion.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.880]   Because this form of institution is unprecedented, there are many
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.240]   outstanding questions about how exactly it would function and how
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.400]   feasible it could be.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.280]   In subsequent articles, I will explore some of these questions, including
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.680]   underlying theoretical frameworks, historical comparisons, and how a
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:46.440]   great house would fit into a larger network of institutions and society at large.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.760]   I invite readers to ask questions and make suggestions.
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.120]   This is a thought experiment designed to get people thinking about highly
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:57.160]   independent institutions that could be directly focused on cultivating
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.120]   humans in a way that works with human nature.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:04.320]   It is vital that we find these forms because so many of our institutions
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.280]   are dedicated to human elimination.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.200]   Elements of the plan could always be reconfigured.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:14.320]   Ultimately, I am inspired by the image of the great house, an edifice
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:18.200]   of noble men and women decorated with their arts who are deeply
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.440]   capable of affecting their aims.
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.560]   This is a romantic and stirring vision worth working for.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.440]   It will not be machines or corporations or democratic governments that
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:33.400]   cultivate the family and our associated human potential, but great families
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:37.680]   themselves, families like enormous oak trees who make shelter for
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.600]   a thousand seedlings in their shade.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.920]   This is how a mighty forest grows.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:48.360]   It is more possible today than ever in history to plant a seed and make a fresh start.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:57.600]   California's top casino and entertainment destination is now
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.640]   your California to Vegas connection.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:04.800]   Play a Yamaha resort and casino at San Manuel to earn points, rewards,
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:09.520]   and complimentary experiences for the iconic Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:14.600]   Two destinations, one loyalty card.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.320]   Visit yamaha.com/palms to discover more.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:23.560]   The essay you have just heard is titled how to found a great house and become
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:29.720]   a prince by an internet avatar named Paulus, and I will link to it.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.360]   The it's posted on a sub stack, which is now defunct.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.960]   I will link to it in the show notes.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:40.120]   You can follow the links forward and you can read some of the responses to this.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:44.000]   And you can read part two of his essay, which is for the great house plan, part
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.560]   two, further discussions on personal institutions, but I think you get the
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.320]   point, uh, in listening to part one.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.600]   And that is sufficient for today's discussion.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:28:00.480]   The reason I want to raise it for you is because one of my great burdens at this
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:07.320]   point in time is the astounding lack of vision that is presented by financial
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:12.040]   consultants and pundits and authors about how to actually improve the
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.480]   world and to use money to do so.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:20.280]   You may notice a hint of bitterness in my mind or in my voice, a note of bitterness
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.600]   in my voice, and that's because I am quite bitter because what has happened
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:28.560]   is the professional financial planning industry has somehow effectively
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:34.440]   persuaded most of us that our primary aim and ambition in life should be to
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:39.480]   accumulate money, invest that money into publicly traded funds of various kinds,
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:43.400]   and then sit back and live fat and happy on the, on the beach, instead of actually
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.040]   doing something with the money, doing something that matters.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:51.120]   And yet throughout history, prior to the formation of the modern financial
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.680]   instruments that we all are quite accustomed to, wealthy men and women
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:00.520]   have known that they had to invest their money into people and because of the
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.840]   requirement to invest their money into people, they had to actually develop a
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.360]   worldview and a system for so doing.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.840]   Were we better off before or better off now?
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:15.280]   I think probably now, but we are right now in one of the greatest
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.320]   wealth transfers of human history.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.720]   The baby boomers have millions and millions and millions and millions of
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.320]   dollars accumulated and they have nothing to do with it that actually is going to
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.680]   matter, nothing to do with it.
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:30.360]   That's actually going to change their town, their city, their family, their
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.080]   country in any meaningful way.
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:35.880]   And they go for meeting after meeting with financial advisor after financial
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.120]   advisor, and all the financial advisor can do is push, look at them across the
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.720]   table and say, Hey, guess what?
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.320]   Joe, you're rich and you're going to keep on being rich.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.160]   And Joe says, what do I do with the money?
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.280]   Well, just, you know, maybe give it to your kids.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.400]   Well, I got two of them.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:49.920]   Great.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.120]   Now your kids are going to be rich.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:51.800]   And what are they going to do?
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.280]   Cause there's no vision and friends without a vision, the people perish.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.320]   And so I believe that we must be the generation, those of us who actually
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:03.720]   care about the future to start to create and formulate a vision, a vision for our
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:07.840]   own lives, a vision for our communities, for our families, for our country, whatever
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.960]   level you feel capable of creating a vision, we have to do it.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:15.320]   And one important component of that vision is always going to involve money.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.640]   Money is not sufficient, but it is necessary.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:23.600]   And a man with vision as to how he can use his money is going to be much more
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:27.560]   capable of accumulating the money and then wisely using it than one for whom
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:31.000]   the money happens accidentally, or who spends his life thinking that the
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.240]   accumulation of the money is primarily about his own interests and his own
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.720]   enjoyment, we need friends.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.640]   If you're, if you're a baby boomer generation, if you're a retiree and
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.240]   you're listening to my voice, I beg of you.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:51.760]   Do not waste your life exclusively sauntering down beaches, rather accept
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:58.800]   that your role in society should be that of a wise elder, that of a wise patron.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:04.920]   You have a duty to me, to my generation, to your children, to your
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.600]   grandchildren, to your neighbors.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:14.080]   You have a duty to be the kind of man who founds a great house, to be the
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:18.680]   kind of man who goes through the difficult, diligent effort of creating
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:23.480]   a vision for the world, of articulating your ideals, articulating your
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:29.680]   philosophy, and then seeing to it that that your ideals and your philosophy
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.800]   is expanded throughout society.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:37.440]   That is your responsibility at this stage of life, not to ride away into
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:42.320]   the sunset and purely amuse yourself with endless steak and lobster, but to
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:47.600]   get down to the serious work of being a leader, being a statesman, being a
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.760]   patron in the community.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.280]   That is your responsibility.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:58.080]   You have reached a stage in life at which we expect you to serve as a wise elder.
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:04.880]   And I'm ashamed of many of your generation, because instead of accepting
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:09.160]   your role in life of that of a wise elder and mentoring your children and your
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.160]   grandchildren and your neighbors and investing your money in their community
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:15.400]   and transforming your neighborhood and transforming your industry and
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.880]   transforming your country, many of you are content to sit around and fripper
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.880]   away your days.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.240]   I don't get it.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:29.880]   You have an opportunity to do something that's truly remarkable and money can
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.280]   and should be, and will be part of it.
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:37.880]   Now, for those of us who are younger, I believe that this is not something that
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.440]   can be easily just shown up to.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:46.480]   If somebody has arrived at the age of 65 and all a man can dream about is sit
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.560]   back and let me just go ahead and retire so I can go fishing every day.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.560]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.560]   Ride my motorcycle.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.040]   If that's the height of his dreams and ambitions for his life, he's unlikely to
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:55.680]   change.
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:01.320]   However, you and I can arrive at 65 in a very different place.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:09.360]   You and I can arrive at 65 with an ambition as to what our elder statesman
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:14.640]   years might look like, with an ambition of some of the work that we may be able
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:21.120]   to do, and if we're going to do that effectively, we're going to need to give
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:27.720]   careful time and preparation to being prepared for that moment in history.
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:31.040]   What are some of the things that we could possibly do?
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:36.480]   Well, number one, as I think this essay would assume, is that we have to have
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.440]   some sense of our ideas.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:43.280]   We have to have some sense of a vision of the world, something that is coherent,
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:47.880]   something that is compelling, some sense of what we want the future of this world
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.640]   to look like.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:54.680]   And we have to develop a clarity of vision that is sufficient to allow us to
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:58.840]   articulate that vision to other people in a way that would also allow them to
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:04.680]   clearly see the vision that we see and want to align with us in that work.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:11.920]   There's an enormously wide degree of latitude available to you here, but what
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:17.280]   is not optional is the development of a vision, the development of something that
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:20.440]   you want to change, something that you want to impact.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.240]   You choose.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:29.840]   You choose anything, but if you are arriving at your elder statesman years of
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:37.640]   life and you have not done the hard work of clearly formulating a vision of
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:41.400]   something that you would like to see different in the world and some kind of
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:48.800]   practical, practicable plan that could result in the successful achievement of
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:54.520]   that vision, you're not taking life seriously, and you want to.
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:01.600]   You ought to do the hard work to develop a vision of some improvement in the
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:07.520]   world, some way that you think things should be bettered and improved, and
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:11.920]   then clarify that vision so that you can communicate it to others.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:15.880]   That's the first thing that's necessary.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:22.480]   And for those of us who are younger, at least I have found as I have attempted
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:27.160]   and keep on attempting to do this, this is not a decade project.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.280]   This is a multi-decade project.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.480]   This is not a one-year project.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.920]   This is a 20-year project.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:39.360]   I'm working hard to develop mine.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:44.400]   I think over the last probably 10 to 15 years, it's gotten clearer, but I don't
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.560]   think I could articulate it as robustly as I would like today.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:55.520]   My hope, my ambition, is that by the time I arrive at, say, 50, that not only will
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:01.360]   I be able to articulate it clearly, but that I will have begun the process of
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:07.920]   articulating it clearly, and that I will have spoken that vision so consistently
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.520]   that it will be something that I've successfully passed along to my children,
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:17.080]   that I have successfully influenced my community with, etc., that it is something
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:20.720]   that I have done the hard work to do.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:24.960]   And that vision, by the way, needs to not just be castles in the sky.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:31.280]   There needs to be a robust background that ties the vision to something that is
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:35.200]   practical, something that has proven results in the past.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:41.760]   If your vision is to green the deserts and to turn the Sahara back into a tropical
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:46.840]   paradise, then you will want to be able to tie that to some of the specific
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:51.600]   techniques that have been used to green a small portion of a desert in another area.
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:56.640]   If your vision is to create a society that is filled with liberty and freedom
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:01.400]   and justice for all, then you will need to be able to tie those ideas and your
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:05.200]   plans for how that is going to be accomplished to something that has been
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.120]   successful in at least some period of history and at least some corner of the
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.880]   world. And that means you're going to have to do some work.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:17.520]   If your vision is to cure diabetes on the face of the planet, then you need to
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:23.960]   begin by curing diabetes in somebody and then work on to somebodies and then go
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:29.240]   out from there. And so there needs to be some serious work into actually
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.440]   implementing a vision.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:34.800]   And that's also something that cannot be done overnight, but it's something that
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:41.360]   should be done consistently while you're young enough to actually form the vision
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:45.920]   and form a plan that might work so that when you arrive at your elder statesman
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:51.240]   role, when, God willing, you have more time, more freedom, more resources, etc.,
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.960]   that you're not arriving woefully unprepared.
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:58.800]   On the contrary, you're arriving with 20 years of experiments under your belt, 20
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.000]   years of arguments, of debates, of careful research, etc.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:09.080]   And so when you arrive at 65, you're arriving at 65 with an idea of some things
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:13.480]   that might work. And you've got 30 or 40 years ahead of you and a fortune behind
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:19.080]   you that you can use to see those ideas tested on a bigger scale with the plan of
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.840]   passing them on generationally.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.720]   So in order for you to – I hope that this inspires somebody.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.720]   Maybe it doesn't inspire anybody but me.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:30.920]   But one of the components that is necessary if you're going to found a great
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:36.720]   house is that you have to have a vision of the world, a vision of the future, and
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:40.360]   be able to articulate that vision in a way that is compelling to other people.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:46.520]   The second thing that is necessary is you must accumulate resources.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.760]   You have to accumulate resources.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:56.560]   And the steady, consistent accumulation of resources should be an ongoing ambition
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.680]   for men of virtue.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.880]   There is no virtue.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:08.640]   In being a pauper, there is no virtue in being someone who just systematically
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.960]   avoids the acceptance of responsibility.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:18.200]   But there is virtue in being someone who systematically accumulates resources.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.360]   Think about how you feel.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:24.760]   Let's use a physical example, because none of us had anything to do with the
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:29.560]   basic physical substance that we were given in terms of our body, our
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.080]   physical body that we control.
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:34.120]   All of us were gifted it, and all of us acknowledge it.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.880]   Some of us were given large bodies, some of us small bodies, some of us strong
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.600]   bodies, some of us weak bodies, some of us properly functioning bodies, some of
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.680]   us not properly functioning bodies.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.240]   We were all given these things.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:55.800]   Now, do you respect a man who was given a strong, properly functioning, healthy
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:02.400]   body, and then who proceeds to ignore it, to abuse it, to not use it, to not
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.680]   develop it to its proper level?
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.240]   Do you respect that man?
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.440]   I don't.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.400]   I don't.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.400]   And sometimes I look in the mirror at him and I say, "I don't respect you if you
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.680]   don't use this strength that you've been given."
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:22.600]   Now, do you respect a man who was given a weak, stunted body?
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:27.280]   Perhaps his legs are non-existent or doesn't work, and he uses every feature
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.880]   that he has in his body to make it stronger, to make it better, to make it
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:34.800]   more powerful, to make it more useful, regardless of the actual long-term
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.240]   outcome.
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.440]   Do you respect that man?
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:41.560]   We all naturally respect him.
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:47.120]   My favorite bodybuilding videos to watch is the dude in the wheelchair doing
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.520]   flips on a pull-up bar.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:51.880]   My favorite, every day there's a guy, I can't remember his name, but there's a
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.280]   guy who has no legs.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:58.600]   He's a really fast runner, and he holds the record for the fastest running on
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.440]   his hands thing.
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:04.320]   Every day when I go through my daily goals and visioning exercise, I watch the
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:11.320]   video of this guy running across the track on his hands with no legs, and it's
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.360]   just a reminder to me.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.760]   And the dude's jacked, his shoulders and arms are amazing.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.120]   He's a really smart guy.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:17.760]   I need to look up his name.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:20.400]   Forgive me for not knowing his name.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.400]   He's a hero of mine, and I should know his name.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.640]   It's just a short video that I watch, that's all.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:31.240]   So anyway, he's a really, really amazingly talented guy who has just sculpted and
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:35.360]   used his body to become incredibly fast, though he runs on his hands every day.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:42.480]   And I respect that guy so much, not for his ultimate outcome, but for the process
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.880]   of his using what he has been given.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:53.200]   Now, let's pivot from a physical body, and let's go to other resources that you
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:42:00.440]   and I have, resources such as our intellect, resources such as our
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:06.240]   character, resources such as the 24 hours of time that we have today, resources
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.520]   such as the finances that we have, the money that we control, the tools that we
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:11.680]   operate, et cetera.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:15.440]   Friend, to whom much is given, much is required, and you and I have been given
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.400]   much, and therefore much is required of us.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:22.800]   And what is required of us is that we maximize these things, that we use them,
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.320]   that we develop them, et cetera.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:30.360]   And so the acquisition and accumulation of wealth and capital is our responsibility.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:34.600]   It's a responsibility to our forebears who have come before us and have created
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:36.040]   the incredible world in which we live.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:40.680]   And it's a responsibility to our progeny, to those who will come after us, to give
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:45.120]   them a better world than the one that we inherited, to give them a world of
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:49.480]   greater resources, of greater tools, so that we can improve the human condition
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.320]   in the coming generations.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:54.200]   That is our responsibility.
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:43:03.880]   And we need to grasp that responsibility as full-hearted and as heartily as we
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.960]   have capability.
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:10.400]   Now, this doesn't have to be grandiose pie-in-the-sky stuff.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:15.720]   I'm intentionally not making these things precise because they'll be so
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.200]   different for you and for me.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:22.160]   But you have a responsibility to build a secure home around yourself.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.440]   You have a responsibility to provide for your children's education.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.920]   You have a responsibility to provide for your family's eating needs.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.560]   But you also have a responsibility to accumulate capital for the future.
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:39.040]   And as I tried to illustrate in a recent podcast, the accumulation of capital is
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:44.200]   primarily an emotional thing followed by decision rather than any external
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.080]   circumstance.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:50.800]   The man who must accumulate capital will accumulate capital.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.840]   He will find a way to do it.
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:57.600]   Financial capital is one form of capital.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:02.040]   We should not disregard or ignore other forms of capital.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:08.000]   We are the inheritors of the capital that has been passed down to us.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:15.840]   As I grow older, I'm distinctly conscious of how much capital I inherited from
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.440]   directly my own parents.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:20.160]   A few examples to try to make it precise.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:32.480]   First of all, I was never given a significant financial inheritance by my
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.080]   parents.
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:37.440]   I was given enormous love, support, a roof over my head.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:38.840]   Etc.
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.560]   And I'm grateful for those things.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:44.520]   My parents were not wealthy and did not give me a significant amount of money to
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:45.480]   get started in life.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.720]   They have supported me in all kinds of ways.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:54.840]   I think that parents who have capital should give their children capital.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.840]   But that is not my point here today.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:00.200]   My point is to say that even if you have not yet accumulated financial capital,
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:03.520]   you can give your children capital.
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:07.560]   My wife and I have a very smooth and comfortable relationship.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:13.960]   I think a significant portion of it, at least on my part, can just be due to the
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:17.760]   fact that I watched my parents have a healthy and smooth marriage relationship.
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:22.400]   And in so many ways, regardless of what I was explicitly instructed or taught with
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:28.320]   regard to marriage, you can't live with parents who have a healthy relationship
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:33.040]   and not automatically adopt those components that led them to a healthy
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:33.760]   relationship.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:38.400]   Now, obviously, we have to adapt to our wives because our wives are not our
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:38.800]   mothers.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:42.520]   They are different, unique persons, and we have to adapt to them.
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:49.480]   But for me, being a husband feels very natural and comfortable and normal because
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:54.160]   I observed my father be a father and, excuse me, be a husband.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:58.880]   Being a father feels fairly natural and normal to me because I observed my father
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.120]   being a father.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:05.480]   Having a simple cultural capital of the way that a home should feel is something
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:10.040]   that is an important component of the world that your children will grow up in.
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.440]   This is forms of capital.
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:16.360]   Intellectual capital, being taught to study, being taught how to study, being
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:17.760]   expected to study.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.720]   These are things that accumulate over generations.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:28.280]   A family that passes on a high regard for excellent academic work through one
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.840]   generation is likely to pass it on to the third.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:35.440]   By the third, that inheritance will be enormous.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.880]   You see this all the time.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:44.040]   When you see a child who, my mom was a doctor and my dad is a lawyer and guess
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:49.320]   what, you know, granddad was an army general and grandma was a doctor and here
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:52.720]   I am and I'm a doctor, a lawyer, an engineer, and it just passes on.
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:55.840]   And the gap is widening on all these things.
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:47:00.480]   These multigenerational trends are causing our society to be more and more
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:04.800]   fractured where the haves get more and the have-nots are getting worse.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:06.880]   It's happening all across our society.
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:10.680]   But regardless of where you are today, the change can begin with you.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:15.720]   And then finally, the third thing that is obvious from this particular essay is you
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.800]   got to have children.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.880]   You got to have children.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:25.240]   If you want to found a great house and you want your children to continue the
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:30.560]   tradition that you are establishing, you have to actually have children first and
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:31.320]   foremost.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.800]   The future belongs to those who show up for it.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:39.240]   And statistically speaking, if you don't have more than a couple of children,
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:43.280]   there's a very low chance that your personal genes will ever continue into the
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:43.800]   future.
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:48.120]   I forget the exact number, but I've watched some demographers and demography
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:51.680]   interested people kind of try to figure this out from historical data.
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:56.480]   And the only number I remember was, I think it was a study of perhaps Dutch
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.320]   family records.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.880]   The Dutch have great family records.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:05.520]   And basically, if you want to be sure that your family line will continue, that
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:10.200]   sureness on a statistical basis arrives at about five children.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:15.920]   Prior to five children, there is a relatively low confidence that you can have
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:20.400]   that your own children and your own lineage will continue.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:25.000]   But once you reach five children, then you can have a very high confidence that
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.640]   your genetic offspring will continue.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:31.000]   So I felt successful because I now have five children.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.640]   So if I can get them all to adulthood and keep them as good, healthy persons, then
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:39.720]   then we'll be in pretty good shape to continue my genetic impact on the world.
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:41.480]   And most of us don't.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:46.080]   Nobody ever sat me down as a young man and taught me about that.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:51.920]   No one told me, like I think they should have, about how hard I should be working
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:56.000]   when I'm 20 and 22 in order to support a family with five children.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.720]   Now, I had it modeled by my parents.
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.440]   I had it modeled by people around me.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:02.040]   I wish they'd been more explicit about it.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:05.960]   I don't know whether I would have listened or not, but I try to be explicit about it
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:09.520]   now because, friends, we've got to give young men a vision of the work that they
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:14.120]   need to do, of who they need to become in order to be prepared for the future.
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.840]   So you've got to have children.
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:20.880]   And having children is going to require you to have a vision that, again, you can
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:21.720]   pass along to them.
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:25.400]   And this is where we come full circle, where the whole thing continues, where it
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:26.520]   all comes together.
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.440]   You have to have a vision for the future.
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:33.280]   You have to have resources that you accumulate, and you're going to have to go
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:33.840]   big.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:36.720]   If you want to have significant resources, you're going to have to swing for the
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:41.280]   fences on something in order to found a great house, to have money to give away.
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:45.480]   You're going to have to invest faithfully over a very long period of time to grow
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:48.600]   your resources to be sufficient to actually do something in the world.
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:50.560]   And you're going to have to have children.
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:54.240]   And then having children requires you to have a vision that you can pass along to
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:54.520]   them.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:57.840]   Having children requires you to have resources to support your children and
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:59.000]   encourage them, et cetera.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.920]   And then it goes on and on and on.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:04.560]   But we should be those who change.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:06.680]   We should be those who embrace the vision.
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.400]   And this should be a consistent component of our life.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:13.480]   When I think about people that I admire in the world, I find that they have most of
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:14.080]   these things.
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:18.800]   I find that generally the men that I admire in the world are men who have a
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:21.520]   vision of something that they're working to change.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.320]   It can be an issue.
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.200]   It can be an ideology.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.560]   It can be an institution.
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:29.640]   It can be just something that they want to do.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.680]   There's a motivation to what they're doing.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:36.200]   They're trying to bring goodness and beauty and truth into the world in some
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:39.120]   corner of the world over which they have influence.
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:44.880]   They're generally men who are faithful to that vision over a significant period of
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:45.240]   time.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:47.880]   They don't bounce from here to there to the other thing.
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:53.960]   They labor at it for years, for years, for years, and they continue to labor at it.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:59.360]   And it's often, just like any exponential curve, it's often only in the latter part
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:03.440]   of their work that they start to see really, really fruitful results from it.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:07.720]   And you look back and you say, "What kept you laboring for 10 years, for 20 years,
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:10.880]   for 50 years, what kept you doing that work?"
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.360]   Well, it was the vision.
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:15.520]   They had a vision of something they would change, and they said, "Here's a place
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:19.680]   that I can do some good in the world, and so let me just focus on this and work at
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:19.840]   it."
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:22.880]   And they're generally men who accumulate capital.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:26.960]   They accumulate financial capital, but also importantly, they communicate
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:28.040]   cultural capital.
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:29.600]   They acquire power.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.240]   They acquire influence.
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:33.080]   They acquire prestige.
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.520]   Their reputation grows.
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:36.320]   Their influence grows over time.
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:42.560]   And those are forms of capital that have to be very, very carefully managed, very,
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:46.560]   very carefully protected in order for them to endure.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:48.680]   And then they're men who have children.
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:51.800]   They're men who pass along their values generation to generation.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:56.680]   You can know a lot about a man by looking at his children to see how well do his
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:01.000]   children model and carry out his vision for the world.
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:08.200]   Finally, I want to pivot and just say, I hope that while you are listening to that
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:12.360]   essay, which I found thought-provoking, thank you to the listener who sent it to
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:12.520]   me.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:13.240]   I wish I could remember.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.600]   I think I know who it was.
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:17.240]   I think it was a friend of mine who was also a listener of the show.
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:23.600]   But I hope what you found was thought-provoking, but I hope you
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:30.960]   realized that you probably are also aware of some institutions that are already
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:34.040]   something like what was described.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:41.240]   I think to me, the obvious ones that I have found, or the obvious ones to me, is
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:46.720]   simply the enduring nature of some churches and other religious bodies.
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:52.760]   Because at their core, that is what distinguishes a religious organization is
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:55.240]   its values, vision, etc.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:59.760]   And so if there is an ability from leaders in that organization to articulate a
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:06.360]   vision, that vision often winds up being a religious expression of some kind.
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:14.680]   And then if you combine other things about that organization, you combine
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:22.400]   financial growth, you combine pro-natalism, etc., then you can clearly see how
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:27.720]   religious organizations become incredibly powerful and strong, and they become in
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.800]   essence a form of fraternal organization.
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:34.360]   I'm a great admirer of the LDS Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:35.640]   Latter-day Saints, the Mormons.
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:42.000]   And some of the things that I admire very distinctly about their organization is how
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:48.720]   they model so many of the values of what even this author discussed.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:53.360]   Of course, the Mormon Church is a fairly recent church, but if you look at the
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:58.200]   growth of the church organization since Joseph Smith's being here, over the last
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:02.200]   century and three quarters now, it's remarkable to look at.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:07.080]   And what you see that's so interesting is you see these values and these things
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:12.320]   expressed consistently across the organization, across the entire church.
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:19.760]   And you watch Mormons are massively over-represented in organizations,
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:26.480]   massively over-represented in business, massively over-represented in various
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:33.560]   successful capacities, etc., and part of that has to do with their religious work
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:33.920]   ethic.
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:40.280]   Mormons are very, very effective at building a fraternal community, of looking
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:44.000]   out for one another, of supporting one another, etc., and they're very, very
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.320]   effective at having children and promoting a pro-natal organization.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:51.560]   If you look at the growth of the Mormon Church over the last century and a half,
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:59.320]   it's astounding to see its growth compared with even just the ideas outlined
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:02.480]   in this particular essay.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:06.160]   To me, that's one of the most obvious examples that we should look at and study.
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:12.080]   Now, I myself am not a Mormon nor an adherent to their ideology, but I am
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:16.760]   inspired by them, and what I have tried to do is take any aspect that I think is
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:20.760]   helpful and try to see it expanded within my own circles, and I think that's one of
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:26.680]   the things that we should do, is find an organization that is working where this
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:32.840]   has been effective and then try to model it and try to look for organizations that
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:35.440]   have these basic features that are described.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:38.760]   This essay, I don't know anything about the guy who is writing it.
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:43.120]   He's a fairly anonymous writer that seems to have some interest in classicism, etc.
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:44.920]   I didn't dig deeply into his blog.
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:47.640]   I just thought it was interesting.
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:50.040]   It was an effective articulation of it.
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:56.560]   And what is remarkable to me is that here I sit after decades of work in the modern
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:56:04.480]   world, and I find a random internet essay that inspires me and gives me kind of a
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:13.960]   vision for the future that is so, in a sense, so elementary, so simple, so
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:14.600]   elementary.
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:16.120]   I'm not critical.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:18.960]   I think the greatest ideas are often simply expressed.
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:23.640]   But what I'm saying is that this is something that should be common.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:29.040]   This is something, or whatever elements of this you agree with or disagree with, this
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:34.800]   is something that every grandparent should pass along to a grandchild, that every
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:37.000]   parent should pass along to our children.
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:45.120]   And this is where I want to end, is that we have a duty to pass along a vision to
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:49.400]   those we impact, to those we interact with, to our children, to our
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:50.560]   grandchildren, etc.
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:55.440]   And what's interesting is that in general, while I can't prove this statement to
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:57:01.320]   you, in general, I think our children will largely wind up fulfilling the vision that
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:01.880]   we give them.
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:06.440]   I've seen this enough with my own children and some of the experiments that I've run
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:09.840]   of where I tried to give them a vision, and then I watched them in the fullness of
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:12.880]   time step into it, and they do it.
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:17.440]   And obviously, children can be manipulated and controlled, and so we have a great
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:21.760]   responsibility to make sure the vision that we give to them is a positive vision, is
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.280]   something that leads them places.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:29.240]   But we should be giving multi-hundred-year visions to our children of what their
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:31.480]   dynasty is likely to look like.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:37.120]   We should be imparting a vision that came from our great-grandfather down to our
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.160]   children's great-great-grandchildren.
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:41.320]   That should be the level in which we are thinking.
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:47.400]   And that long-term vision has a great way of aligning so many things in life in a
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:50.120]   proper and productive and contented and happy way.
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:53.560]   So, if your vision for your children that you pass along to them is, "You've
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:57.560]   definitely got to go to college," your children will probably go to college.
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:00.280]   But what about after that?
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:02.000]   Why not more?
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.080]   Why not give them more and more of a vision?
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.640]   You and I are adults.
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:08.440]   You and I have experience in the world.
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:11.200]   You and I have experience in our own lives.
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:15.440]   We understand what leads to human happiness, what leads to human flourishing.
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:20.920]   I'm astounded right now that so many people who haven't seemed to figure it
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:24.320]   out, what are the solutions to human happiness and flourishing?
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:25.640]   We know a lot about this.
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:26.960]   It's pretty simple.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:31.400]   And while I prefer not to call them "sciences," the social sciences
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:32.760]   can inform this pretty well.
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:33.960]   We can look at the data.
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:36.840]   Now, you may not want to accept it, but we can look at the data and we can find
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:39.320]   the things that lead to human happiness and human flourishing.
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:43.880]   We should not be trying to make our children figure it out.
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:50.520]   This is one of the enormous sociological problems that we have, is that in current
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:56.080]   generations, we're not teaching children what will lead to their happiness and to
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:59:00.640]   their flourishing, we are telling them that they are responsible to figure it out.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:06.720]   In some cases, they do figure it out, but there's a lot, oftentimes a lot of
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:12.960]   decades of wasted effort trying to figure it out for themselves.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:17.240]   And our responsibility as an older generation is to pass along the wisdom
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:19.640]   that works for the younger generation.
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:21.400]   And we want to do that continually.
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:24.760]   In conclusion, I hope that you enjoyed that little essay.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.240]   I find it inspiring.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:31.160]   I don't know whether I will ever actually be able to put it
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:33.080]   into fruition with my own wealth.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:39.240]   I don't know whether it's even the smartest thing to do with wealth, but one
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:43.560]   of my great passions that I'm going to be leaning deeply into in the next year,
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:48.200]   the next years, so this is a multi-year project for me, is to try to figure out
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:51.800]   what are some ways of investing wealth effectively.
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:57.320]   And by investment, I mean investing it into people, because I am shocked and
[00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:06.680]   appalled at the dismal state of coherent advice, coherent frameworks that exist
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:12.360]   for wealthy people who have reached the stage of financial abundance and have
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:15.480]   more money than they'll ever personally be able to consume, than their children
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.160]   will ever personally be able to consume.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:23.080]   And there's no compelling frameworks to teach someone how to systematically
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:24.120]   make an impact with it.
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:31.240]   And so basically, as best I can tell, way more wealthy people than should wind
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:37.720]   up writing relatively random checks to not-for-profit organizations, which in
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.280]   some cases do a significant amount of good in the world.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:41.960]   After all, the donors are looking for that.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:47.480]   But in many cases, the wealthy people wind up never investing their money
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:51.640]   at an appropriate level of scale to see the impact of it.
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:57.560]   And so they go to their graves with their ambitions for impact unrequited.
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.120]   And I consider that a great tragedy.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:07.000]   Although we can't ever control that, we should try to see the fruitfulness,
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.920]   we should try to see the fruit of our own faithfulness come to fruition in our
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.440]   lifetime where we can still control it.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:20.280]   And I'm going to intentionally avoid the rant about how institutions change over
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.160]   time, etc.
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:26.680]   So this is a great passion of mine, and I'm looking for resources and things on
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.200]   that, which is a good place for me to close.
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:32.360]   If you yourself have ever come across great frameworks, great books,
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:35.480]   interesting essays, interesting people, interesting teachers, the wisdom of the
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:39.160]   sages, in the same way that a listener is the one who originally sent me this
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:41.800]   email, please pass those along to me.
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:45.240]   Best way is always email me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:49.800]   joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com is a great way to reach out to me.
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:53.480]   I'm also pretty active on Twitter, @joshuasheets is a great way to bring things
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.640]   to my attention as well.
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.680]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:02.040]   I hope that you enjoy this, and I hope that it's been impactful for you.
