[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.580]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.480]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Long Angle and it's
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.760]   totally free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.040]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.680]   Again, that's longangle, A N G L E.com.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.920]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.840]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.400]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited you're here today to talk about
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.840]   investing and we're joined by none other than Brian Faraldi.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.320]   He's a financial educator and author of a new book called Why Does the
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.400]   Stock Market Go Up?
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.040]   Everything You Should Have Been Taught About Investing in School, But Weren't.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.040]   It comes out April 5th, but I got an advanced copy and I really enjoyed it.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.360]   Brian has also written more than 3,000 articles on stocks, investing, and
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.280]   personal finance for The Motley Fool.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.400]   But I got to know his content through the detailed investing checklists he
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.560]   publishes and follows for all his new investments.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.640]   In our conversation, we'll talk about current market volatility, Brian's
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.080]   counterintuitive investing philosophy, making an investor checklist,
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.560]   evaluating risk, figuring out when to sell, taking asymmetric bets, and a lot more.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.640]   That is so much to cover.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.920]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.680]   Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.520]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.280]   do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.760]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.120]   upon for investment decisions.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.720]   Brian, thanks for being here.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.320]   Chris, awesome to be here.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.640]   I'm pretty sure I'm a day one listener to this podcast, so it's cool to be on it.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.600]   That is awesome.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.240]   Thank you for your support and for everyone else here listening.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.400]   So you've got a book coming out in a few weeks.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.920]   Why does the stock market go up?
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.320]   And I was thinking about that this morning.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.240]   And for anyone listening, we're recording on Wednesday, March 9th.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.400]   I was like, gosh, in the last month, the market's down about 7%, but somehow
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.640]   today we're up two and a half percent, which seems like some wild volatility.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.080]   You wrote the book.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.400]   How do you make sense of all this?
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.000]   Yeah, the last two years have been fascinating to watch as as an investor.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.360]   It was February and March of 2020 when COVID was taking over.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.720]   We saw the fastest bear market in stock market history, where over the course
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.720]   of a month, didn't matter what you did, whatever stock or fund that you held,
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.000]   it was going down and it was going down hard.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.960]   And then immediately after that, with everything changing in the world, I would
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.480]   have predicted that it was going to be a terrible year for the market, a terrible
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.360]   year for investors. In fact, we saw the exact opposite, where stocks just shot up
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.880]   to the moon and it was almost like the higher risk the stock, the better the stock did.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.840]   I mean, the numbers were off the charts.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.120]   Good. And then over the last year, we've seen kind of reversal of that with a lot
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.880]   of the stocks that were left behind in 2020 have since caught up, things like energy
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.600]   stocks and real estate stocks and stocks that were the go-go stocks of 2020.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.520]   Things like Zoom and Roku and Peloton have just been train wrecks from our investing
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.440]   perspective. But that's just how investing works over the short term.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.400]   What determines the value of any given stock or any given indice is just the collective
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.880]   emotions of all market participants, how investors feel about the markets.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.960]   And that is always so hard to predict and so hard to read.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.320]   So I view the stock market, what it's done over the last couple of years as fascinating,
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.360]   but entirely normal.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.280]   OK, and how do you think about calm times, volatile times?
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.440]   Are we in one of them?
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.440]   Are they all one in the same and you should just prepare for them at any moment?
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.920]   Yeah, when you're investing in the stock market, you never know what you're going to
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.360]   get over any short period of time.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.680]   That's why the stock market is a great place to put capital that you don't need for at
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.160]   least three to five years.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.880]   But it's a really poor place to put money that you're going to need in any shorter
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.720]   period of time. So if you need money in the next three years for college or for a house
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.440]   or for a car or anything like that, there's a reason why people say don't put it in the
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.320]   market, because no matter how good times see right now, that doesn't mean that the market's
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.520]   going to perform well.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.880]   The inverse is also true.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.960]   It looks pretty dark out there right now.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.200]   We have a war going on.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.640]   We have inflation going on.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.560]   We have interest rates that are rising.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.760]   Lots of high-growth stocks have been pulverized and are down huge.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.000]   But there's still no telling what the near-term returns of the stock market are going to be.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   So it's really important that if you're going to invest in the market, which I think everybody
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.120]   should be doing with their long-term capital, you have to do so in a way that allows you
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.280]   to endure short periods of extreme volatility, because that is the norm for the market.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.360]   What advice do you have for people who are just today thinking about, "Wow, we are in
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.000]   this very volatile time.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.440]   Should they be investing right now?
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.560]   Is now a good time to get in the market?"
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.080]   Or how do you feel about trying to time things like this?
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.480]   I never try and time things myself.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.920]   Because again, if you were to ask me what's going to happen in 2020, I would have said
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:03.920]   the market's going down.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.880]   If you ask me what's going to happen in 2021, I would have said the market's going up.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.720]   And I would have been wrong, essentially, on both accounts.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.880]   So, my own history with trying to time the market shows how poor I am at it.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.640]   For that reason, I just say ignore the timing and when to get in.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.320]   Instead, just focus on being in the market and being a continual buyer of the market.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.320]   It's just called dollar-cost averaging.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.920]   If you can dollar-cost average for a long period of time, the timing of your buys becomes irrelevant.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:36.440]   Do you think there's at least some argument to if the market is down and you're able to
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:42.560]   see that that's the case to get in now, like people who invested after the crash in 2020?
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.560]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.600]   The best time to buy the market is when it's on sale.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.520]   However, predicting when those sales are going to be is always an endeavor that isn't really
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.720]   worth the time or even that hard to do.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.040]   However, if you are the type of person that has cash on the sidelines, saving it for a
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.600]   time when the market does fall, I think right now is a great time to put extra capital in
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.200]   if you have that ability.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.120]   With the foresight being that you don't know what's going to happen next, I think we're
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.500]   down 20% from the highs last year, which is officially in bear market territory.
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.920]   But that doesn't mean that stocks can't continue to fall further.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.720]   If you're in that fortunate position of having cash that you've been waiting to invest and
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.040]   you're looking to do so, one trick that I like to tell people to do is come up with
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.840]   a schedule for investing that capital.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.200]   Let's say you have, to make things easy, $5,000 and you want to invest $1,000 a month over
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.200]   the next five months.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.480]   You don't know what's going to happen to the market over that time, but you just create
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.680]   a schedule for yourself.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.800]   Well, if by chance you invest $1,000 on the first day, and then the next week the stock
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:49.080]   market falls 5% or 10%, then accelerate your next purchase early.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:54.140]   That way, you can take advantage of that temporary dip and then just stick to the schedule thereafter.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:59.760]   But if the stock market stays flat or goes up, you just stick to your regular investing schedule.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.840]   So that's one way that you can deploy capital more efficiently if you want to take advantage
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.840]   of dips.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.840]   That makes sense.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.040]   And we haven't really talked about what to invest in.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:13.520]   So before we get there, how do you think about building your own investment portfolio?
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.240]   I know there's a massive world of investments out there, and we've had on some folks like
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.480]   Andy Ratcliffe and Ben Carlson, and we've talked about passive investing and index funds
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.480]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.200]   But for you personally, how do you think about your portfolio?
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.520]   I'm a massive fan of index funds.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.760]   Always have been, always will be.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.840]   I think that index funds plus dollar cost averaging, as those gentlemen pointed out,
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.960]   is just a wonderful formula for building wealth over long periods of time.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.960]   And that's what I personally do with all of my retirement funds.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.400]   I set it up once to drip into index funds, and that's what I do.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:49.560]   But with my capital in my regular brokerage account, I love analyzing businesses, studying
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.160]   businesses, and buying individual stocks.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.720]   I've been doing that personally for about 15-plus years now.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:00.000]   So, any capital that I have beyond my retirement funds, that's where I deploy it.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.240]   So, at any given time over the course of a month, I typically buy a handful of stocks myself.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:10.540]   And to do so, I just created a list of companies that I'm interested in, according to a checklist
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.640]   that I created.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.880]   And prices are changing dynamically all the time.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.520]   And what's so fascinating about, if you invest in the individual company level, what's happening
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.320]   at an individual company can be wildly different than what's happening with the market in general.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.640]   When the market is down, there can be companies that are up.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.220]   And when the market's up, there can be companies that are down.
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:33.540]   But when I'm deploying capital in my investment portfolio and trying to invest in individual
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:38.640]   businesses, what I'm trying to do is optimize, at any given time, for the best combination
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:45.540]   of high-quality businesses, according to criteria that I selected, times the highest long-term
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:51.520]   potential, times the companies that are trading at the most attractive valuation at any given time.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:57.040]   So, it's really the combination of those things that I look to deploy my capital into at any given month.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.840]   So, I want to get into those three things.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.120]   But before that, how do you think about risk-taking?
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:07.440]   Do you think of your single-stock investing, a more portfolio approach where you can diversify
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.760]   amongst stocks and it's actually not quite as risky?
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:16.260]   Or I think if you talk to most passive investors, they would say, "Gosh, if you go buy a stock,
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.260]   that's really risky.
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.260]   You don't want to do that.
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.260]   You want to bet on the market."
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.480]   How do you think your type of stock investing fits into general investing risk?
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.120]   Yeah, I think that they're actually two of the same, and it really depends on how you
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.120]   are investing.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.100]   When most people think about investing in individual stocks or businesses, what they're
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:34.660]   really trying to think about is timing the market and trading stocks, trying to buy them
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.680]   when they're low and sell them when they're high.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.340]   And I have no interest in trading stocks myself.
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:43.800]   I view the portfolio, the investments that I'm making outside of my retirement funds,
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.180]   as essentially building my own index fund.
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:52.640]   So, my style of investing is, I look for high-quality businesses that I think can grow for many,
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.820]   many, many years.
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:59.760]   I buy those companies and I try and hold them as long as they remain great businesses.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.480]   I'm not trying to trade in and trade out of companies.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.080]   I move my portfolio very, very slowly.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:10.720]   So, what I'm trying to do is handpick, essentially, my own index fund and let those businesses
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.280]   grow for long periods of time.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.420]   I know you're a fan of the investment policy statement.
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:20.280]   How have you used that concept, and for anyone who isn't familiar, maybe walk through what
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.880]   it is to guide your investing decisions?
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.440]   I think this is something that so many people overlook when they start investing.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.220]   They don't really sit and write down why they're investing in the first place.
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.840]   They just think, "I have some money.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.520]   This stock thing sounds interesting.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.600]   I'm just going to do that."
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.560]   But I think it's really important to take a step back and ask yourself, "What is the
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.380]   purpose of this capital?
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.220]   Why am I choosing it to invest it in any given way?"
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.140]   One tool that you can use to do that is just called an investor policy statement.
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:55.420]   It's just a very simple set of rules that you set up for yourself before you start investing,
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.240]   and you can use it to guide your decision-making over time.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:04.240]   For example, my long-term investing goal is to grow my capital for as long as possible
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:11.880]   at as high of a rate as possible, while simultaneously assuming as little business risk as possible.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.960]   Now, "business risk" means that the companies that I'm investing in, I actually think, are
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.840]   low-risk businesses.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.300]   That doesn't mean that their stocks aren't high-risk and very volatile, but the underlying
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:26.460]   businesses that I invest in are actually fairly low-risk businesses.
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:32.080]   All capital that I put into the market, I don't plan on touching for at least five years,
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:37.820]   and all of my short-term capital needs are funded by cash that I have on hand and income
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.820]   from mine and my wife's jobs.
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:44.580]   Because of that, we actually take a very conservative approach to our personal finances.
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:48.940]   We have a large emergency fund, we have a high savings rate, we have multiple sources
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.620]   of income, we have no debt of any kind.
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.020]   So, our personal finances are very conservative.
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:13:02.160]   That allows us to, essentially, with our investment portfolio, be 100% stocks and 0% bonds.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.480]   That, in and of itself, means that my portfolio is going to be far more volatile than the
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.380]   average portfolio that has a mix of cash or a mix of bonds in there.
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:15.420]   However, I'm perfectly fine with that volatility because I know that any money that I put into
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.140]   there, I don't need to touch for a period of years.
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:22.380]   But I think that people could do so much better for themselves if they just sat down and asked
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.740]   themselves, "Money that I'm going to put into the markets, what's its purpose, what are
[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.340]   my investing goals, and how long can I keep it in there?"
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.340]   I like that.
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.960]   Is there a place to get some examples, maybe your book or your website, of those policy
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.220]   statements and how to start thinking about writing one?
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.220]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.400]   Now that you're saying that, I missed a big opportunity by not putting it into my book.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.820]   But if you just Google the terms "investor policy statement", there's lots of examples
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.460]   online that you can use as a guide.
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.460]   Cool.
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.460]   Okay.
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.460]   And so, you've got your policy statement.
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.480]   And now, let's move on to this process of finding something to invest in, to start building
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.480]   out that portfolio.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.420]   You're pretty well-known for creating an investing checklist.
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.920]   So, where did that come from and how has it evolved?
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.300]   And talk a little bit more about it.
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.300]   Sure.
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.040]   If you're new to investing, as I am, it's not hard to find companies to invest in once
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.340]   you know what to look for.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:12.760]   There's so many places that you can get investing ideas, whether it's following some big, famous
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:18.320]   investors like Warren Buffett or Cathie Wood, reading free articles that are online, cracking
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.440]   open exchange-traded funds, looking at your own life and seeing what products or services
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.720]   do I use or does my company use?
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.360]   It's like the list of potential investments that you can make is huge.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.860]   There's thousands of publicly-traded companies for anybody to invest in.
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:35.540]   When I first started out, I quickly became overwhelmed with choice, and I was essentially
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:41.020]   trying to think in my own head, "Well, this business I really like because it's run by
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.020]   its founder and it has a great balance sheet.
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:47.500]   But this other business has great margins, high long-term potential, and there are all
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.840]   these factors that I was trying to keep in my head to weigh investments against each other."
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:56.100]   Turns out, that's a really poor way to do it because our brains are not built that way.
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:01.680]   Finally, I got smart enough to say, "Maybe I should write this down and create some rules
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.740]   for myself that I can use to guide my decision-making."
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.900]   I would suggest that everybody that invests in anything beyond index funds goes through
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:10.740]   this very process themselves.
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:16.820]   First, write down all of the attributes that would make any investment, a stock investment,
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.320]   for example, attractive to you.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.880]   I did that, and I came up with things like, "I want the management team to have a high
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.040]   ownership percentage.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.780]   I wanted the revenue to be growing at a very high rate.
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.100]   I wanted revenue to be recurring in nature.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.620]   I wanted it to be profitable.
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:35.780]   I wanted the company's balance sheet, how much cash it has, to far outweigh how much
[00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.460]   debt that it has," etc., etc., etc.
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:42.680]   I made a list of 30 things that I really wanted in any investment that I made.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.620]   Simultaneously, I made another list, which is, "What are all the things that I don't
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.620]   want to see in an investment that I make?"
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.540]   For me, that's things like, "I don't like it when a company gets the majority of its
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.020]   revenue from just a handful of customers."
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.800]   That's called customer concentration.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:01.580]   "I don't like it when a company is operating in an industry that I think is actively being
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.420]   disrupted, like the oil and gas industry right now.
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.460]   I think it's primed for disruption over the next 10 or 20 years.
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.300]   I don't want to make any investments in that."
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:13.240]   "I don't like it when a company's stock-based compensation, the amount of options that they
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:19.040]   hand out to employees, is such a high rate that the dilution rate is high," etc., etc.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.420]   So, I have my list of things that I'm looking for.
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:26.340]   I have my list of things that I don't want to see, and then I rank them in order of most
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.020]   important to least important.
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:33.260]   That's a tricky exercise to do when you really have to force yourself to rank things against
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.820]   each other, but it's so useful to do so.
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:41.740]   Finally, I have both of those things in place, and I just applied a very simple scoring system
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:47.100]   to weigh my criteria based on the factors that are most important to me, and the same
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.760]   goes for the factors that I'm not looking for.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.860]   I just came up with a simple 100-point scoring system, where I doled out 100 points in total
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.060]   based on the factors that I just listed.
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:03.500]   From there, I now have my criteria built out, so I can take any company that I come across,
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:08.440]   I can research it, and as I'm researching it, I'm filling out this checklist.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:13.200]   At the end, when this process is all done, I get to know whether a company is a match
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.000]   for what I'm looking for in investment or not.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.880]   I've done this now hundreds of times.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:23.320]   I have a list of companies that are very attractive to me as an investor, and simultaneously,
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:28.000]   I have another group of companies that there's just no way I'm going to invest in.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.160]   The process of creating a checklist for myself, ranking it, and scoring it has helped to clarify
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.720]   my decision-making so much.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.440]   I have so many follow-up questions right now.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.960]   I'm trying to take notes to organize them.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.960]   A few things.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.160]   One, you make this checklist of your own available on your website, correct?
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.160]   Yep.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.160]   I made it freely downloadable.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.160]   Yep.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.200]   So we'll make sure we link to that in the show notes.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:56.400]   But as you were walking through your criteria, it made me think, I'm not sure even I have
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.040]   an opinion on these things.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:03.000]   So is this something that takes years of playing in the stock market to build?
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.040]   Do I care about whether there are a lot of options granted to employees?
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.520]   These seem like things that the average person might not have an opinion on.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:16.040]   Where do you suggest people get started, or is it best to use someone else's list, or
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.760]   is there a way to educate yourself on why you may or may not care about some of these
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.760]   things?
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.680]   The checklist as it exists today is a constantly evolving process.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:30.400]   And what it is today is through trial, error, and most importantly, feedback that I've gotten
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.000]   from other smart investors that I respect.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.520]   By studying the styles of great investors that I deeply respect, I find out what really
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.520]   matters to them.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.560]   And then I took that and evolved it into what matters to me.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.600]   But I don't claim that the version that I have right now is "perfect."
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.880]   It's just the best version that I've come up with so far.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.560]   But to your point, all of these things do take time to research.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.960]   If you want to go through the process of researching a stock, there's a lot that you have to learn.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:57.960]   You have to learn accounting.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.080]   You have to learn how to read SEC filings.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:03.320]   You have to learn how to think about competitive advantages, studying the competition, thinking
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.080]   through the business model, studying potential risks.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.040]   There's a lot to evaluating individual stocks.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.920]   This is a big reason why so many people say, "Forget all that.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.280]   Just stick with index funds."
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.980]   It's so much easier to do that.
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:20.880]   So this process, I think, is a good process if you're in that 1% or 2% of the population
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.240]   that is really fascinated by business the way that I am and is really interested in
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.780]   studying the subject.
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:27.880]   That's why I created this.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:32.560]   I absolutely love everything about investing in research companies, but I'm right there
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.560]   with you.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:36.280]   This is a time-consuming process and it turns off a lot of people.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.000]   If there are specific companies that people listening to this are thinking about, I've
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   actually gone and...
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.480]   Brian has a YouTube page where you actually break down going through your checklist for
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.480]   different companies.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.920]   So I'll just give that a shout out because I thought that was really fun to go and look
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.920]   at a couple of companies.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.480]   I think Peloton is a great example.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.340]   You did one and then you came back and did a recheck in because it had been an interesting
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.600]   adventure for that company.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.200]   We got that one wrong.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.480]   That's why you're making more than one bet.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.680]   But what you said about it taking a lot of time, if someone listening to this is like,
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:09.180]   "Gosh, index fund investing is fine, but there's some companies that I like.
[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:14.120]   Is there a place for trying to invest in those stocks that whether you like them or you think
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:18.680]   they're exciting or the company has potential that doesn't need to take this much time?"
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.600]   Or is your general advice, "If you're not going to take the time, you probably shouldn't
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.600]   do it?"
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.620]   The best advice that I can give there would be always think about your overall asset allocation.
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.800]   Some people say that stock picking is a complete waste of time.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.960]   They're not interested in it.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.960]   Fine.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.720]   Just stick with 100% index funds and call it a day.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.680]   But I think there's room for a happy medium in the middle.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:42.000]   There are some people that I think should put say 90% or 95% of their assets into index
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.680]   funds, but if they have a hunkering or there's some businesses that they're really interested
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:50.160]   in or they want to research, I see nothing wrong with taking a few percent of your overall
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.520]   portfolio and putting it into investments that you pick out.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.460]   So, if you can pick, say, five companies or something like that that you're really passionate
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:02.520]   about and put 1% or 2% of your portfolio in it, even if you're wrong, even if the process
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.000]   that you go through, or if you don't want to do the research, you just want to make
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.280]   an investment in those companies, even if you're wrong about them, well, 90% of your
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.720]   net worth is perfectly fine in the market.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.440]   If you don't want to go through the research process and you just want to put a little
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.960]   bit of capital in, I think that's fine so long as you size it appropriately.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:23.360]   As I walk through what you're saying, I'm realizing that you're presenting us all with
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:30.400]   an option for building a part of your long-term diversified portfolio on your own with stocks.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.800]   So, I think some people listening might think, "It's okay to take some bets with 5% of your
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.440]   portfolio, but be safe with 95%."
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.280]   And you echoed that sentiment, but you've said, "Look, if you take the 95%, there's
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:47.220]   a different way than index funds that you could invest that 95%."
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.880]   And for you, it sounds like some of it is index funds, but some of it is building a
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.980]   portfolio of a lot of stocks that you spend time and research on.
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:59.300]   And if you're interested in that time and energy to do that research, you could treat
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:04.040]   your index fund portfolio and you could split it apart and do two different things without
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:09.520]   having to feel like you're taking a significant amount of risk on your stock investing.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:14.180]   Do you think that the type of investing you're doing is passive investing, or is it more
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.240]   like wild bets people often say they're taking with stocks?
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.960]   And I ask that because it feels like it actually is more like passive investing.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:26.220]   Yeah, if you crack open the S&P 500, you might naturally think that you're diversified equally
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.820]   across 500 companies.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.320]   That's actually not the case.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:35.160]   The S&P 500 is weighed by market capitalization, meaning, the larger the company, the bigger
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.520]   a portion of the S&P 500 that is.
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.360]   Now, there's still 500 companies in there, but if you look at the giant companies that
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:46.840]   are in there -- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. -- they take up a pretty sizable portion
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.840]   of the portfolio.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.620]   The last time I looked, they were at least 3% or 4%.
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:55.000]   If you're investing in the S&P 500, you have a higher concentration of your funds in those
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.640]   businesses just by the nature of investing in an index fund.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.600]   To your point, with the vast majority of my capital, especially the capital that's outside
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.760]   of retirement funds, I don't think that I'm taking on a huge amount of risk because I
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:12.600]   own a collection of a few dozen stocks, but the top 20 stocks that I have have earned
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:17.800]   their spot in my portfolio, meaning, I bought these companies a long time ago, and I just
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.120]   got them right, that they just happen to be great companies that grew and grew.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:25.840]   For that reason, when a company does very, very well on the markets, it's typically because
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.800]   the business underneath it is succeeding.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.800]   One of my top holdings is Google, which I bought 13 years ago.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.440]   It's grown into a top holding for me, not because I set out to make it a top holding,
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.860]   but I just bought it many years ago and just held on to it.
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.440]   If you look at Google's business alphabet, as it's called Google's business today, it's
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.000]   an extremely reliable blue-chip company.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.480]   The company has hundreds of billions of dollars that come in.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.840]   It generates huge profitability.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:55.600]   It has a war chest balance sheet, and it's still growing to this day.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:00.320]   If you're invested in the S&P 500 Index Fund or Total Stock Market Index Fund, it's a top
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.120]   holding for you, too.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:06.080]   I don't think what I'm doing with my portfolio, since I'm diversified, since I'm buying good
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.320]   businesses and since I'm holding them for long periods of time, is all that drastically
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:13.160]   different than people that just invest in index funds.
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.120]   It's just more time-intensive, and that's OK with me.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.320]   We talked a lot about different types of stock buying, but one thing I noticed you never
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:24.160]   mentioned you cared about, or at least I didn't hear, was what's the price of the stock right now?
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.520]   Is that even a factor when you make a decision?
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:30.200]   That is such a confusing thing about investing.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.720]   In fact, when I first started investing, I had no clue about the relationship between
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.480]   price and market cap.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:41.800]   Like so many people, I thought that the success in individual investing was looking for companies
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.160]   that trade at a very low share price.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:48.120]   A lot of my first investments, my investments in air quotes, because I had no idea what
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.200]   I was doing, was in penny stocks.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:54.120]   And it turns out that penny stocks have the reputation they have because they're typically
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.900]   places that you can go to destroy capital.
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:01.760]   So many of my first forays into the market were buying awful businesses solely because
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.920]   their share price was really low.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:09.040]   The way that prices work in the stock market is so different than the way prices work in
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.820]   every other consumer good that we buy that it's naturally very confusing.
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:17.620]   If you were to go in the market and find a company that was trading at $500 per share,
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:23.000]   and you found another one that was trading $5 per share, and say, "Which one is more expensive?"
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.720]   Only in investing can you say, "Not enough information."
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:32.800]   The stock that's trading at $500 per share might be less expensive, a better bargain
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.520]   price than the stock that's trading at $5 per share.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.880]   The reason for that is, the equity of a company is two things.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:45.320]   One, the dollar price of a share, which is the number that's quoted everywhere that you look.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.660]   You go on Google, you open the stocks app on your phone, what do you see?
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.160]   You see the price of one share.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.520]   However, what you don't often see is the market capitalization of the company.
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.380]   That's like the dollar value of the company's total equity.
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:05.260]   To find that number, you have to look at how many shares exist at a company.
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.420]   Here's something that not many people know.
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:13.900]   The number of shares that exist at a company is a totally arbitrary number that the company chose.
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:18.560]   A company can go out there and say, "I want to have a million shares of stock," or that
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.360]   same company could say, "I want to have a billion shares."
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.840]   What we look at when we're looking at the price isn't enough information to tell us
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:30.720]   if that company is trading at an attractive number, or if it's cheap, or if it's expensive.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:35.520]   However, that's such a counterintuitive thing that so many people assume the dollar price
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.080]   of a stock will tell you what you need to know about the company.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.080]   Two follow-ups.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:43.520]   One is, so the valuation of the company or the market cap is something that you do pay
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.640]   attention to when deciding to invest?
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.640]   Is that what I'm hearing?
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.640]   Yes.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:53.040]   I care much more about the market capitalization of a company than they do about the dollar
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.760]   price of one share.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:58.920]   If I'm analyzing a company, one of the first things I look at is the market cap, and that
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.460]   will give you a rough size about the total value of the business.
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:06.880]   The reason I focus on that is, when I'm looking to make an investment in a company, I typically
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:11.340]   want to buy companies or add companies to my portfolio that I think I can at least earn
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:15.300]   a 5X return on, or better yet, a 10X return on.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:20.240]   The size of a business is going to show me how hard that is for that company to do that.
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:25.800]   For example, if I come across a company and it's trading at a $1 billion valuation, that's
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:30.460]   the size of the market cap, for me to earn a 10X return on that company, that company
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.760]   would have to grow into a $10 billion valuation.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:38.040]   There's lots of companies out there that are currently worth $10 billion, $50 billion,
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.100]   $100 billion, or more.
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:44.420]   So, it doesn't take a huge amount of imagination to believe that a company can grow from $1
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.620]   billion to $10 billion.
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:52.520]   Conversely, if you come across a company like Apple, for example, Apple's market capitalization
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.440]   is currently enormous.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:59.100]   The company is currently trading at $2.7 trillion.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:06.100]   For Apple to grow five times in value from here, it would have to be essentially an $11
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:09.280]   or $12 trillion company.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:15.060]   That is such a gargantuanly huge number that I personally have a really hard time seeing
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.240]   Apple ever do that.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:21.340]   I'm not going to say it's never going to happen, but holy cow, is that a lot of market capitalization
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:25.520]   that has to be added onto Apple for its stock to 5X from here.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.680]   So that's why I'm really focused on the market capitalization of a company, not the dollar
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.000]   price of one share.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.400]   How does that change over time?
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.900]   You mentioned one of your investments early on was Google.
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:41.000]   And now, even though it's clear that in the last 13 years, Google probably did 5X the
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.440]   business, but now let's say you're looking at it and you think, "Gosh, now it's a lot
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.440]   harder."
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.440]   Like it might be for Apple.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.520]   Does that mean you have to get out?
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.840]   Or how do you think about exiting positions that you've made?
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:56.800]   So when I first made an investment in Google, it was far, far, far smaller than it was today.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:01.920]   The market capitalization was well under $100 billion when I started buying it.
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:07.340]   Today, I'm quite happy to continue holding Google, and I do not expect Google to 5X really
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:08.340]   in any period of time.
[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:13.360]   Google is a $1.7 trillion company, so for it to 5X, it would have to be a $9 trillion company.
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:17.200]   I'd be very happy with that outcome, but I don't think that it's going to happen.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:22.960]   Instead, I view Google as a part of my portfolio that is more of a bedrock anchor, something
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:28.420]   that I think can grow at a low double-digit rate, but I don't expect the company to deliver
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.420]   a 5X return from here.
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:35.140]   So, in general, while I'm very happy as a Google shareholder, I wouldn't approach it
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:39.240]   from a, "I'm interested in buying this company today," I would be more interested and likely
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:44.140]   to sell it to fund purchases of other companies that I think have higher growth potential.
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:48.060]   But I'm not going to sell a company solely because it's huge if I've owned that company
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:52.300]   for a long period of time and I'm still happy to own it.
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.980]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:55.980]   I get it.
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:30:00.800]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.800]   hang.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.640]   So, kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:10.440]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor, Drizly, the go-to app for
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:13.180]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.980]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.820]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:21.980]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just want
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.820]   to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:29.420]   With Drizly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:34.300]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:38.380]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:41.540]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:45.460]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last week, not
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:50.780]   only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found it for $15
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.580]   less than my local liquor store.
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:57.620]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizly app or go to drizly.com.
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:01.620]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:05.500]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.060]   So when do you decide to sell?
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:11.880]   Whether it was a pick that didn't work out or a company that's worked out and now doesn't
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:16.540]   have that potential, I can tell people listening that I have some random stocks I've invested
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:20.340]   over the years, and I personally am struggling, like, when do you exit?
[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:23.600]   How do you help people think about when's it time to either cut your losses if it's
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.100]   down or take your gains off the table?
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.100]   Yes.
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.100]   First off, let's acknowledge something.
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:33.020]   Knowing when to buy a stock is much easier than knowing when to sell.
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:36.260]   It's much more fun for me to research and think about companies that can grow in value
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.340]   than it is to be on the other side of the transaction.
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:42.380]   However, there are some reasons that I think a stock should be sold.
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:45.740]   First and foremost, the No. 1 reason that I sell a stock, and it's the most common,
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.420]   is I was wrong.
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:49.700]   So I came up with a thesis for a company.
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:54.300]   I thought that the company was going to grow, to take advantage of a blank market opportunity,
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.580]   and I thought the company had an advantage over its rivals.
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:02.940]   If that proves to be incorrect, if the company is clearly struggling to execute that and
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:07.940]   I am proven wrong, I have no problem saying, "I got that one wrong," and selling to be
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:09.060]   to play in my capital.
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:14.380]   Two, if I'm right about a company and it grows to be too large a position in my portfolio
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:19.020]   and I'm too concentrated in that company, that is a situation where I'm also happy to
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.020]   trim that company.
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:24.580]   More recently, I personally trimmed a little bit off of my position in Tesla, not because
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:28.360]   I don't think Tesla's a great company with a bright future ahead, but Tesla has grown
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:33.100]   to be my No. 1 position by far, simply because of how well that company has done.
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:36.800]   And I've been trimming my position surely for risk management purposes.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.380]   So that's a happy reason to sell it.
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:44.420]   No. 3, if you have a better use for that capital, if you're no longer interested in following
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:48.400]   a company or own a company, and it might be a lukewarm investment, but you find another
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:52.100]   investment that you're more interested in, I see nothing wrong with selling the one that
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:55.700]   you're not interested in to buy more of the one that you are interested in.
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:33:00.540]   And the best reason of all to sell is that you need the money for your personal life.
[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:04.940]   The whole reason we invest in the first place is to grow our capital so that we can live
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:05.940]   a better life.
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:10.000]   So I see nothing wrong with selling a stock if you need to use that money for a purchase.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.460]   So I think one takeaway for me out of this is, the best I can remember, I'm going to
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:17.100]   go through the handful of stocks I own and try to write down why I invested them in the
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:22.220]   first place, and that'll give me a place to look to decide when it's appropriate to sell
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.540]   because maybe I don't believe in that thing anymore.
[00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:28.380]   One thing that I personally do and I'm a big advocate for, in addition to writing an investor
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:32.060]   policy statement for yourself, is to keep an investing journal.
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:37.140]   So every time that I go and I buy a stock, I just write down what stock I'm buying, a
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:42.660]   few words on why I'm buying it, and also the valuation that I'm paying at the time of my
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:43.660]   purchase.
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:48.300]   It can be time-intensive to do that, but so often, if we buy a stock, it's not all that
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:53.420]   uncommon for us to change our thesis over time as the business results come in.
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:57.540]   It's really helpful to have an anchor point to look back and say, "What was I thinking
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:02.180]   at the time of this purchase?" and to match up the reality that the business is doing
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:04.900]   against your initial predictions for those businesses.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:08.620]   If those two things are a mismatch for the worst, that can be a sign that company is
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:10.940]   no longer for you and it's time to sell that company.
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:15.660]   But again, broadly speaking, buying is much more fun than selling and knowing when to
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:17.140]   sell a stock is very, very hard.
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:19.960]   So we talked about buying, we talked about selling.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.360]   What about adding to a position?
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:25.180]   Is that something you find yourself doing over time and how do you decide that you want
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:26.180]   to double down?
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:29.500]   I don't invest all the capital that I'm going to invest in a company up front.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:33.780]   I tend to buy in small chunks over periods of time that are spaced out.
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:38.220]   I do so because I know from my own track record that I'm often wrong, right?
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:42.720]   A company can check a lot of the boxes that I look for in a business, but that business
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:47.420]   still has to go on and execute against the opportunity that it presents for itself, and
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:51.240]   sometimes new competition can come along, or the market can change.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.420]   It's common for me to be completely wrong about a stock.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:35:00.200]   So, when I'm looking to add to a position over time, what I'm attempting to do is two things.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:04.300]   First, I'm looking to invest in companies that are winning.
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.180]   That's a very counterintuitive thing.
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:10.960]   Most people think, "Oh, I bought a stock for $10, it went to $20, I can't buy any more
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.380]   of that stock. It was at $10 before, now it's at $20."
[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:17.700]   Conversely, they buy a stock at $10, it falls to $5, and that's the one that they're interested
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.480]   in adding to because it's at a lower price.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.420]   What I've discovered the hard way is that more often than not, it's better to take additional
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:28.580]   capital and put it into the company that's already doubled for you, as opposed to the
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:30.400]   one that's already halved.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:34.100]   The reason that companies go up and their stocks tend to do well is because something
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:39.200]   about the underlying business is succeeding, and Wall Street is recognizing that business
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.140]   is succeeding.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.980]   Conversely, if a stock is underperforming, that's a sign that the company is having a
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:48.000]   hard time succeeding, and it's not meeting investors' expectations.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:55.320]   Broadly speaking, winners tend to keep on winning, and losers tend to keep on losing.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:59.340]   So, when I'm looking to add to companies, I'm typically looking at the companies that
[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:04.100]   are winning in my portfolio first, and those are the ones I'm actually adding to.
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:07.700]   Lewis: I think some people might hear that and think, "Wow, that sounds a lot like the
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:11.320]   opposite of the tried-and-true buy low, sell high.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:15.580]   That sounds like buy high, sell low," which I think everyone says, "That's what you shouldn't do."
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:21.500]   How do you juxtapose what you just said with what I would say is pretty commonly-believed
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:24.260]   advice -- maybe you disagree with it -- of buy low, sell high?
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:28.180]   Feroldi: I think it's helpful to actually look at some studies of investing and how
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:33.780]   the market actually works, which are hidden from us if you're investing in just index funds.
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:37.580]   J.P. Morgan did this wonderful study where they looked at thousands of publicly traded
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:42.300]   companies over a period of 30 years, and they looked at the returns of those companies.
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:46.820]   What they found was that if you put your capital into 10 random companies, what you can expect
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:52.540]   is that four of those companies will suffer a catastrophic loss and stay down permanently.
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:59.260]   Three of those companies will go up in value, but they will underperform the market in general.
[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:00.680]   That leaves three other companies.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:06.500]   Two of those companies will be modest market beaters, and one of those companies will deliver
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.140]   multi-bagger returns.
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:13.660]   What actually drives the market forward over time is a very small minority of companies.
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:19.960]   It's really about the top 10% of companies that are literally responsible for 90% of
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.820]   the market's returns over long periods of time.
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:26.340]   When I've looked at that, and I've studied some investors that have taught me this really
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:29.860]   counterintuitive lesson, what you actually want to do is, it really matters that you
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:35.440]   get some of your portfolio to include some of those 10% of companies that are the mega-winners.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.780]   And what do mega-winners have in common?
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:41.820]   Their stocks have already gone up a lot.
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:48.260]   If you think back to some of the mega-winners that are today -- Tesla, Google, Apple, Netflix, Chipotle --
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:53.920]   if you bought those companies after their stock doubled, tripled, or quadrupled,
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:59.860]   you then went on to earn a massive return, even after their stocks were up huge.
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:04.380]   That's why it can actually be a good sign if a company's stock is going up.
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:09.420]   That's an indication that the business model is working and that Wall Street is recognizing
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.860]   that the business model is working.
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:15.940]   Conversely, if you want to buy a stock that has lost badly to the market, underperformed
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:21.400]   the market, history shows that the chances are pretty good it's in that 7 out of 10 stocks
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.340]   that is going to permanently underperform the market.
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:29.480]   So, I think the phrase "buy low, sell high" sounds really good in theory, but when you
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:34.000]   actually get into the practicality of investments, some of the best investments that I've ever
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   made was buying stocks that were already up big and were at all-time highs.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.900]   Lewis: My conversation with Andy Ratcliffe was that some of the best investors are quite
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.940]   contrarian, so I like that you're taking a different approach, and I'm glad we got to
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:50.400]   dig into some of the data about it.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.660]   We talked a lot about ways to invest, but I want to ask what platform you're doing this
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.960]   on and if it makes any of the things you're doing easier.
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:04.360]   You mentioned buying a stock, maybe you want to deploy over time, but gosh, let's say you
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.940]   wanted to put $500 into Google today.
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:12.740]   There's not an easy way to say, "I want to put $500 over the next five months and then
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:13.740]   stop."
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:14.740]   I'm not familiar with one.
[00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:18.920]   Is there an investing site that you like or recommend that makes some of those kinds of
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:19.920]   things easy?
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:24.760]   Feroldi: I'm pretty sure that M1 Finance has done many of those things with, you can create
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:29.960]   a pie for your portfolio, and as you put capital into it, it automatically allocates, and you
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.640]   don't have to worry about things like buying exactly one share.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.200]   You can buy fractional shares.
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.860]   We as investors are extremely lucky because there's lots of platforms out there that allow
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.940]   you to buy fractional shares of stocks.
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:44.080]   To answer your question, though, the broker that I use is called Interactive Brokers.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:49.520]   I signed up with them nine years ago, and what I liked about them is it's a hassle to
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.520]   use their system.
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:55.860]   It is a pain in the butt to log in, and once you're in, buying and selling is easy just
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.400]   like it is on any other platform.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.080]   But I actually like that there's friction to the platform.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:05.080]   I don't use any app on my phone because the easier it is to buy a sell, the more tempted
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:08.040]   I would be to do it when I'm feeling emotional.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:12.600]   If I owned a stock and that stock was down big or up big in response to whatever the
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:16.460]   news of the day, my decision-making skills would be compromised because of what I was
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:17.540]   seeing on the screen.
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:20.260]   I also use Interactive Brokers, and it's funny.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:25.420]   It's one of the few products that I've probably never even mentioned I use on this show because
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.180]   I think most people would hate it.
[00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:30.300]   Yes, I agree.
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:31.660]   The interface is difficult.
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:35.900]   I'm often unsure of how to find things and have to read long manuals.
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:41.900]   But for me, the other big perk of Interactive Brokers is that if you need to borrow against
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:47.500]   your portfolio, the amount of interest many institutions charge is very high.
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.940]   So Interactive Brokers is quite low.
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:53.780]   At Wealthfront, we have a portfolio line of credit that's also low for index funds.
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:56.740]   And everywhere else I've seen is like 5%, 6%, 7%.
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.340]   So that's another plus on Interactive Brokers.
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:02.860]   But in general, I will say it is a confusing interface.
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:07.420]   I'm happy to put my referral link in the show notes, but I don't expect a lot of usage of
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:09.060]   it because of that.
[00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.060]   But it's funny.
[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.100]   I also use that for my single stock investing.
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:17.620]   And I'm also not familiar with an easy way to say, "Oh, I want to invest $1,000 in this
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:18.620]   company.
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:19.620]   Can I do it over 5 months?"
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:24.240]   Because doing it each month manually just invites emotion to change the decision you
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.420]   made in advance.
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:30.740]   One other platform technology question I have, so often I see people say, "Gosh, I picked
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:34.340]   this stock and over the last month, it's down 7%.
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:35.340]   How should I feel about that?"
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:38.100]   I'm like, "The entire market is down 7%."
[00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:43.540]   So relative to the benchmark of the market, your stock hasn't gone up, hasn't gone down
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:45.020]   relative to the benchmark.
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.540]   Is that a way you look at things?
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:50.480]   Do you look at how a stock's done absolute on its own?
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:54.820]   Or do you try to compare how it's done to the general market to get a sense of relative
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:55.820]   performance?
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:57.440]   I always like to compare things to the market.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.940]   You have to have something to compare it to.
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:02.880]   I'm happy just to compare it to the standard benchmark, which is the S&P 500.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.180]   But, yeah, you can't look at stocks in a vacuum.
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:10.680]   What's even more confusing about investing is that there is a one-to-one relationship
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:16.180]   between the performance of a business and the performance of a stock over long periods of time.
[00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:21.160]   The reason that companies go up substantially over long periods of time is the underlying
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:24.320]   business underneath them has improved dramatically.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:28.680]   Maybe revenue is up a whole lot, margins are better, profits are improving.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.900]   They've made an acquisition, or whatever the reason is.
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:35.000]   There's a direct tie between what happens to a business and what happens to the stock
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.800]   over long periods of time.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:41.520]   Over short periods of time, there's almost no connection at all to what a business and
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.520]   a stock are doing.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:47.720]   And what's happening in the macro environment can often so overwhelm the actual business
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:48.960]   performance of a company.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:53.800]   And this can be so confusing to you as an investor, because you can buy a company, and
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.240]   you can say, "I think this company is going to become more profitable, its revenue is
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.560]   going to grow, and the stock's going to do well."
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:02.280]   And you could be right about the business.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:06.220]   When they come out with a quarterly report, they could say, "Revenue is up, profits are up,
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:10.580]   we're hiring more people, we're expanding, hey, we've got this new product that's coming out."
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:11.960]   And that stock can fall.
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.320]   And that stock can fall really hard.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:18.180]   So, in the short term, there isn't always a direct relationship between the performance
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:20.960]   of the company and the performance of the business.
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:24.160]   And that's why investing can be so trying on your emotions.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:29.820]   However, over long periods of time, the performance of the business always is eventually reflected
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:30.820]   in the stock price.
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:36.080]   So, when I'm judging how my companies are doing, I'm almost never looking at just the
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.080]   stock price.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:40.200]   I'm always asking myself, "How did the company do?
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.040]   What's the general direction of the business?"
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.860]   And I'm focused very heavily on the business itself.
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:51.200]   In those short-term scenarios where comparing how it's done to the benchmark is really helpful,
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.320]   right, because you might feel like you got a dud, but really, just the market, as you
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.980]   said earlier, it's down almost 20% from highs.
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:01.000]   Is there an easy way to do that online for someone who maybe wants to look at their portfolio
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.560]   and say, "Gosh, I invested in Square 12 months ago.
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.420]   How has Square done relative to the market?"
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:09.260]   Is that an easy calculation anywhere you know?
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:13.320]   Interactive Brokers gives me an overall portfolio versus the market over various periods of
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.320]   time.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.320]   So, that's what I do.
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.640]   But you can use some very simple charting tools, especially ones that are on Yahoo Finance
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:23.240]   or Google if you want to look up an individual holding over shorter periods of time.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.240]   Cool.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:27.420]   I just want to thank you, Quick, for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:30.180]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:35.240]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals, and discounts from our partners, you can go to
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:38.240]   allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.480]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:42.480]   Okay.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:47.400]   We went a lot of places and we talked briefly at least a couple times on asymmetric bets.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:51.440]   And I think most people listening might have thought, "Gosh, Brian's this guy that invests
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.580]   in a lot of stocks.
[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:58.340]   All he's doing is making a bunch of high-risk asymmetric bets across his whole portfolio."
[00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:01.640]   And hopefully, if they're still here, they've come to the conclusion that's not the case,
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:06.360]   that you're actually trying to do a different type of investing with the bulk of your portfolio.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.480]   But I'm curious where those asymmetric bets do fit in.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:14.320]   And do you take those much higher-risk bets in your portfolio and how do they fit into
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.320]   everything?
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:20.620]   The bulk of my individual holdings are in companies that are low-risk businesses with
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:24.720]   strong competitive advantages, they're growing at an above-average rate, they tend to be
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:28.900]   profitable, free cash flow positive, they tend to be very high-quality businesses.
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:33.020]   I don't think I'm taking on a whole lot of risk by investing in those companies.
[00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:40.620]   However, with a portion of my portfolio, I also am happy to invest in higher-risk situations,
[00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:46.140]   knowing full well going in that I'm assuming a whole lot more risk, so I better be compensated
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.780]   for that risk with the potential for higher return.
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:54.180]   I know you've talked in the past about making investments in crypto, like Ethereum and Bitcoin.
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.760]   I view those the same way.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.700]   They're asymmetric opportunities.
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:02.820]   If you invest, say, $1,000 into a high-risk stock, the wonderful thing about investing
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:07.380]   is, the worst you can do, assuming you use no leverage, is lose $1,000.
[00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:10.260]   You are completely wrong about the company, it goes belly-up.
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.060]   You lose your $1,000.
[00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:17.980]   However, if you're right about that company, that $1,000 can grow into $2,000, $5,000,
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:23.040]   $10,000, even $100,000 if you are right about the business.
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:26.680]   Yes, those companies are extremely rare, but they are out there.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:32.640]   So, with a portion of my individual stock portfolio, I'm happy to buy higher-risk companies
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:35.820]   if I believe that I can earn 10x plus returns on them.
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:39.120]   When you're thinking about these asymmetric bets, do you try to limit them?
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.340]   Do you try to make them regularly?
[00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:43.220]   Do you have a way to come up with ideas for them?
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:44.180]   How do you find them?
[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:49.020]   Well, I'm a stock market junkie, so one of my favorite things to do is to research companies.
[00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:53.100]   But to answer your question, I'm a contractor for The Motley Fool, so I get access to all
[00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:55.940]   of their recommendations, and that's one place that I go to.
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:47:01.160]   There's also tons of ways to find investments by looking at high-growth portfolios, high-growth
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:05.560]   ETFs, and the ARK funds, for example, have become very popular with investors, although
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:08.580]   those things are losing very badly to the market over the last year.
[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:11.780]   There's lots of asymmetric risk-reward companies that are in there.
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:15.180]   So, finding potential ideas isn't the hard part.
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:21.260]   The hard part is vetting the ideas and asking yourself, "What kind of risk level am I taking,
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:24.740]   and what are the odds that this company is going to go on to beat the market?"
[00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:27.600]   But finding ideas is really easy nowadays.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:32.380]   Is the vetting process for these higher-risk, higher-return investments, is that a different
[00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:37.200]   investing checklist, or how do you think about making those picks differently than you would others?
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:41.400]   No, I still take it through my exact same checklist, it's just that the companies typically
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:47.720]   score very poorly on my checklist for doing so because I value things like free cash flow,
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:52.140]   I value things like net income, I value competitive advantage, etc.
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:57.060]   So, I still go through the exact same process that I go to, but even after that process
[00:47:57.060 --> 00:48:02.320]   is done, if the company scores poorly, but I still believe that the potential is huge,
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:05.260]   I will go in and make an investment in that case.
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:10.640]   I just do so going eyes wide open that this is a high-risk, high-reward bet that I'm making,
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:13.160]   and I just size it appropriately in my portfolio.
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:13.660]   Cool.
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:17.340]   This is a question that I'm not sure I was going to ask, and I feel like I'll probably
[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:21.820]   get some emails from listeners if I don't ask it, but I'll probably also get some if I do.
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:26.400]   But are there any companies right now that you're particularly excited about?
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:31.240]   And to be clear, this is not an investment recommendation from Brian or an endorsement by me.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:36.380]   But if someone's sourcing ideas, are there any you want to seed out there right now?
[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:36.880]   Sure.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:40.120]   As part of the show notes, you asked me to come up with the five stocks that I like.
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:44.340]   So, I like stepping up to the plate and swinging, but to your point, I own four of these stocks.
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:46.340]   I don't own one of them, and I'll tell you which one I don't own.
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:49.800]   But I have confidence that all these stocks will beat the market from here.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:54.280]   But going back to the percentages we talked about earlier, history shows that when I make
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:59.420]   10 investments, I'm wrong about half the time, but that's okay because it's the half of the
[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:00.420]   time that I'm right.
[00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:05.180]   I do so well on just a few of them that the losses that I have and the ones that I'm wrong
[00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:09.100]   on are dwarfed by the gains that you get than the ones that you're right on.
[00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:14.900]   But to play the game, five stocks that I think are good buys right now are Roku, Pinterest,
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:20.100]   Zoom -- how's that for contrarian -- Fiverr, and Upstart is the fifth one.
[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:25.060]   That's one that I don't own, but that is a high-growth, profitable company that I'm very
[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:26.060]   interested in.
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:29.940]   For the second or maybe the third time with the disclosure at the beginning, say, "This
[00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:31.140]   is not a recommendation.
[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:34.520]   Brian is not telling anyone here to go buy these stocks, but I love playing the game.
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:36.460]   I love hearing what's on top of your mind.
[00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:37.460]   Thank you."
[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:39.720]   And what's fun about that is it's not hard to track ourselves.
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:43.180]   So I'll create a little spreadsheet for us right now on today's recording date.
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:46.340]   I'll put these companies in there so I actually can see how these companies do over time.
[00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:47.340]   Oh, that's great.
[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:48.340]   Let's make it a Google sheet.
[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:49.340]   Let's make it public.
[00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:50.340]   I'll put it in the show notes.
[00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:54.180]   And even a few weeks from now, when this comes out, you'll be able to see how it's been done.
[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.180]   Years.
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:56.180]   These aren't multi-week investments.
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:57.180]   These aren't multi-week investments.
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:58.180]   Oh, sorry.
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:49:59.180]   Sorry.
[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:00.180]   I meant when this episode's out in a few weeks.
[00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:01.180]   Oh, yes.
[00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:02.180]   Yes.
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:03.180]   People will see how it's done.
[00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:04.180]   But yes.
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:05.180]   Don't judge them on their short nature returns.
[00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:06.180]   Okay.
[00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:07.180]   Cool.
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:08.180]   Last thing on investing.
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:10.520]   And then I have a couple totally different questions for you.
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:11.880]   One is on just books.
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:15.580]   People listening to this that think, "Gosh, I want to get more educated."
[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:18.620]   I'd love it if you could throw out a few of your favorite resources.
[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:19.620]   They don't have to be books.
[00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:21.100]   They could be online.
[00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:23.260]   Both for people who are like, "I need to brush up."
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:26.100]   And people who are like, "What are the next level books that I should be reading if I've
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:27.100]   read the basics?"
[00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:30.660]   Anybody that's interested in individual stock investing, there are a couple of books I'll
[00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:33.280]   throw out there that I think are wonderful resources.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:37.800]   The first is called Warren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:42.020]   This is a book that was written by Warren Buffett's daughter-in-law, Mary Buffett.
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:45.940]   And it basically takes the three major financial statements -- the income statement, the balance
[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:50.000]   sheet, and the cash flow statement -- and it goes through them line by line, and it
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.380]   shows you how Warren Buffett thinks about those numbers.
[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:58.460]   So it's a wonderful book for learning accounting and thinking through how financial statements
[00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:00.740]   can be turned into investment decisions.
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:02.540]   So that one is a hidden gem.
[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:05.780]   Another one is called The Little Book That Builds Wealth.
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:07.940]   That one is by Pat Dorsey.
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:11.660]   Pat Dorsey is the former head of research at Morningstar.
[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:16.620]   And that book really goes into how to think about competitive advantage in businesses
[00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:20.280]   and how to spot investments that have a competitive advantage.
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:23.420]   That's a very important topic that everybody needs to learn about.
[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:28.340]   And the third one I'll throw out there is a fun book called 100 Baggers by Christopher Meyer.
[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:35.020]   That's a study of public companies that returned over their lifetime, earned investors a 100X
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:36.340]   return on their investment.
[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:40.560]   It talks through some of the principles that they had in common and what investors can look for.
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:43.640]   Those are three under-the-radar books that I think are wonderful.
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:45.360]   That's great! Thank you for sharing those.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:51.060]   The interesting thing I want to jump to, which has nothing to do with stock investing at all,
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:55.260]   but what reminded me of it was, I both heard you talk about it on another podcast, and
[00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:59.460]   I recently got an email from a listener asking about picking their mortgage.
[00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:03.740]   It'll draw back to investing a little, but they said, "Gosh, if you start from a 30-year fix..."
[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:07.760]   They were like, "I could make a strong argument to try to get a 15-year mortgage to pay it
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:13.100]   down faster, but I could make an equally strong argument to go for an interest-only mortgage
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:17.500]   and take all the money that I would have put in the house and invest it, which I believe
[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:21.180]   will outperform the low interest rates I'm facing now."
[00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:27.460]   I kind of always fall on the, let's call it, financially rational decision of, "Well, you're
[00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:29.820]   going to earn a higher return here, so maybe that's the path."
[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:31.620]   But I know you disagree.
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:36.500]   And so I want to make sure a contrarian opinion makes it out here because I love giving people
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:38.400]   both sides to every story.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:41.340]   So what would your response be to a question like that?
[00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:47.220]   "I love investing. I love stocks. I've earned a decent return since I started investing
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:52.660]   in the stock market. But I actually made the decision to pay off my mortgage fully aware
[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:57.540]   of the math that goes into it. There is a very strong mathematical argument that you
[00:52:57.540 --> 00:53:01.800]   should never pay off your mortgage. You should leverage it as much as possible, and you should
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:06.080]   take the difference, and you should invest it into the stock market. You'll earn a spread
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:11.680]   on the return. So, why on earth would I pay off my mortgage if I do believe that?"
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:16.540]   And it just, to me, gets back to, "What's the whole point of money? Why do we invest
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:20.460]   in the first place, with the highest use of money? The highest use of money is for us
[00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:26.580]   to live the life we want without my money being a financial factor. So, when I made
[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:30.620]   the decision to do so, me and my wife made the decision to do so, what we asked ourselves
[00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:38.060]   was, "Does permanently eliminating our largest fixed monthly cost make our lives better?"
[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:44.340]   Yes, it does! By paying off my mortgage, my future expense rate is permanently lower,
[00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:48.860]   literally, for the rest of my life. So, I don't really care that the money would be
[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:54.100]   better spent by putting it into the market. What I cared about was lowering my fixed monthly
[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:59.300]   costs forever, so that way, the future amount of money that I have to make in any given month,
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:02.100]   the amount that I need to live on, is permanently lower.
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:06.900]   It gets back to what Morgan Housel, I think, said so brilliantly. "My financial goal is
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:13.600]   to make my finances unbreakable. I want to make myself immune to the economic cycle.
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:17.560]   I don't want to have to worry about losing my job or my family's life being disrupted
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:23.680]   at all for financial reasons. That's why I keep a pretty sizable amount of cash out there,
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:29.400]   and that's why I also have zero debt to myself. Doing so gives me a level of freedom and allows
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:34.960]   me to think and act long-term and really helps me to sleep at night." Knowing full well that
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:41.440]   the mathematics of that decision is unfavorable. I would be richer today if I didn't decide
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:45.560]   to pay off my mortgage, but I would go back and do the exact same thing in a heartbeat.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:51.200]   And just for all the credit card nerds listening, a no-debt lifestyle does not mean you don't
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:55.720]   use credit cards to earn points and cash back and then pay them off each month, correct?
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:59.920]   Oh, yeah. I love credit card hacking. I'm a big fan of credit cards. I'm just a bigger
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:04.320]   fan of living debt-free. So like people say that are in the travel hacking world, table
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:09.000]   stakes is no credit card debt. Table stakes is paying them off every month. I think there's
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.280]   a way to use credit cards responsibly to earn higher rewards, like promote. So yes, I also
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.280]   do that.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:17.480]   I just have to throw it out there because I know there's the Dave Ramsey contingency.
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:18.480]   Yes.
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:22.840]   No-debt means not even using credit cards. I don't want people to think, "Oh, Brian,
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:25.960]   this guy doesn't even believe in credit card points." Because I know you play that game
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:31.080]   as well. So to wrap us up, I want to hear some of your local recommendations for anyone
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:35.800]   who's taking a trip to Rhode Island. Would love to hear favorite meal or someplace people
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:40.480]   should go check out to eat, a place to meet up, grab a drink with a friend, and an activity
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:44.600]   that's not the most obvious thing for anyone to do. And take your time if you want to.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:48.960]   Yeah. We're blessed in Rhode Island to have Providence, which has tons of great restaurants
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:54.200]   in it, no matter if you're into steak or seafood or sushi or Indian food or that kind of thing.
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:59.160]   But there's a wonderful restaurant downtown called Hemingway's, which is a perennial popular
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:03.000]   pick for seafood. So I would say that's a great place to get a meal.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.700]   Great activity to do. Also in Providence, at night over the summer, there's something
[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:12.560]   called water fire, which is when they take gondolas and on the little river that's downtown,
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:17.360]   they do bonfires in the middle of the river up and down them. And it's right by Rhode
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:21.640]   Island School of Design, so RISD. So there's all kinds of like paintings and sculptures
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:25.680]   that are on display at the time. It's just a really nice way to spend the night, especially
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:29.200]   if it's a nice night out walking along the river, watching these fires and seeing some
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:33.120]   kind of artsy things on the side of the road. Not something that many people know about
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:35.480]   Rhode Island. And the last one was a...
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:36.700]   Grab a drink after.
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:41.360]   Like many parts of the world, we have also seen an explosion of breweries in Rhode Island.
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:45.880]   So Rhode Island is a pretty small state and I think there's like 17 breweries in our state.
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:50.360]   One of them that I'll give a shout out to is Tilted Barn Brewery in Exeter, Rhode Island.
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:54.040]   It's just got a wonderful atmosphere and some very tasty beers, if that's your thing.
[00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:58.800]   Awesome. Thank you so much for joining us on the show. I think in the last few years,
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:03.440]   there's been so much conversation about the craziness of meme stock investing and people
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:07.600]   taking wild, risky bets with stock. So I feel like it was really a breath of fresh air to
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:13.560]   talk about stock investing and what I'll call a more civilized and rational approach than
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:18.480]   just taking crazy bets. So thank you so much for being here. Where can people find everything
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:20.680]   you're writing and the content you're creating online?

[00:57:54.780 --> 00:58:00.540]   week. I'll see you next week.
[00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:02.540]   Bye.
