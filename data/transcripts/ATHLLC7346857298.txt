[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.000]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law, manufacturing,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.620]   and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.300]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.980]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.960]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.880]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.800]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.960]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited you're here today to talk about investing.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.800]   And we're joined by none other than Brian Faraldi.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.600]   He's a financial educator and author of a new book called Why Does the Stock
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.400]   Market Go Up? Everything You Should Have Been Taught About Investing in School,
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.000]   but Weren't.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   It comes out April 5th, but I got an advanced copy and I really enjoyed it.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.320]   Brian has also written more than 3,000 articles on stocks, investing, and
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.240]   personal finance for The Motley Fool.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.400]   But I got to know his content through the detailed investing checklists he
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.520]   publishes and follows for all his new investments.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.600]   In our conversation, we'll talk about current market volatility, Brian's
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.040]   counterintuitive investing philosophy, making an investor checklist,
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.040]   evaluating risk, figuring out when to sell, taking asymmetric
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.520]   bets, and a lot more.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.600]   That is so much to cover.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.880]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.680]   Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.480]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.240]   do not reflect the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.160]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.080]   investment decisions.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.680]   Brian, thanks for being here.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.320]   Chris, awesome to be here.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.640]   I'm pretty sure I'm a day one listener to this podcast, so it's cool to be on it.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.600]   That is awesome.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.240]   Thank you for your support and for everyone else here listening.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.400]   So you've got a book coming out in a few weeks.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.960]   Why does the stock market go up?
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.320]   And I was thinking about that this morning.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.240]   And for anyone listening, we're recording on Wednesday, March 9th.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.720]   I was like, gosh, in the last month, the market's down about 7%, but somehow today
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.640]   we're up two and a half percent, which seems like some wild volatility.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.080]   You wrote the book.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.400]   How do you make sense of all this?
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.000]   Yeah, the last two years have been fascinating to watch as an investor.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.360]   It was February and March of 2020 when COVID was taking over.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.880]   We saw the fastest bear market in stock market history, where over the course of a
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.400]   month, didn't matter what you did, whatever stock or fund that you held, it was going
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.000]   down and it was going down hard.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.960]   And then immediately after that, with everything changing in the world, I would
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.480]   have predicted that it was going to be a terrible year for the market, a terrible
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.440]   year for investors.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.000]   In fact, we saw the exact opposite, where stocks just shot up to the moon.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.880]   And it was almost like the higher risk the stock, the better the stock did.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.840]   I mean, the numbers were off the charts.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.760]   Good. And then over the last year, we've seen kind of reversal of that.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.560]   What a lot of the stocks that were left behind in 2020 have since caught up, things like
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.600]   energy stocks and real estate stocks and stocks that were the go-go stocks of 2020.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.520]   Things like Zoom and Roku and Peloton have just been train wrecks from an investing
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.440]   perspective. But that's just how investing works over the short term.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.360]   What determines the value of any given stock or any given indice is just the collective
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.840]   emotions of all market participants, how investors feel about the markets.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.960]   And that is always so hard to predict and so hard to read.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.320]   So I view the stock market, what it's done over the last couple of years as fascinating,
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.360]   but entirely normal.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.240]   OK, and how do you think about calm times, volatile times?
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.440]   Are we in one of them?
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.480]   Are they all one in the same and you should just prepare for them at any moment?
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.120]   Yeah. When you're investing in the stock market, you never know what you're going to get
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.360]   over any short period of time.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.680]   That's why the stock market is a great place to put capital that you don't need for at
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.160]   least three to five years.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.200]   But it's a really poor place to put money that you're going to need in any shorter period
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.960]   of time. So if you need money in the next three years for college or for a house or for
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.840]   a car or anything like that, there's a reason why people say don't put it in the market,
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.480]   because no matter how good times see right now, that doesn't mean that the market's going
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.520]   to perform well.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.880]   The inverse is also true.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.960]   It looks pretty dark out there right now.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.200]   We have a war going on.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.640]   We have inflation going on.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.600]   We have interest rates that are rising.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.760]   Lots of high-growth stocks have been pulverized and are down huge.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.000]   But there's still no telling what the near-term returns of the stock market are going to be.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.960]   So it's really important that if you're going to invest in the market, which I think everybody
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.200]   should be doing with their long-term capital, you have to do so in a way that allows you
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.280]   to endure short periods of extreme volatility, because that is the norm for the market.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.320]   What advice do you have for people who are just today thinking about, "Wow, we are in
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.040]   this very volatile time.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.480]   Should they be investing right now?
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.320]   Is now a good time to get in the market?" or how do you feel about trying to time things
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.320]   like this?
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.560]   I never try and time things myself, because again, if you were to ask me what's going
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.920]   to happen in 2020, I would have said the market's going down.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.600]   If you asked me what's going to happen in 2021, I would have said the market's going
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.600]   up.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.840]   And I would have been wrong, essentially, on both accounts.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.120]   So my own history with trying to time the market shows how poor I am at it.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.400]   For that reason, I just say, ignore the timing and when to get in.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.280]   Instead, just focus on being in the market and being a continual buyer of the market.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.520]   It's just called dollar-cost averaging.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.880]   If you can dollar-cost average for a long period of time, the timing of your buys becomes irrelevant.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.680]   Do you think there's at least some argument to, if the market is down and you're able
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.760]   to see that that's the case, to get in now, like people who invested after the crash in
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.760]   2020?
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.760]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.640]   The best time to buy the market is when it's on sale.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.520]   However, predicting when those sales are going to be is always an endeavor that isn't really
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.720]   worth the time or even that hard to do.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.040]   However, if you are the type of person that has cash on the sidelines, saving it for a
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.600]   time when the market does fall, I think right now is a great time to put extra capital in
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.200]   if you have that ability.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.760]   With the foresight being that you don't know what's going to happen next.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.640]   I think we're down 20% from the highs last year, which is officially in bear market territory.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.160]   But that doesn't mean that stocks can't continue to fall further.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.720]   If you're in that fortunate position of having cash that you've been waiting to invest and
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.040]   you're looking to do so, one trick that I like to tell people to do is come up with
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.080]   a schedule for investing that capital.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.200]   Let's say you have, to make things easy, $5,000 and you want to invest $1,000 a month over
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.200]   the next five months.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.480]   You don't know what's going to happen to the market over that time, but you just create
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.680]   a schedule for yourself.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.800]   Well, if by chance you invest $1,000 on the first day, and then the next week the stock
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:49.060]   market falls 5% or 10%, then accelerate your next purchase early.
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:54.140]   That way, you can take advantage of that temporary dip and then just stick to the schedule thereafter.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:59.720]   But if the stock market stays flat or goes up, you just stick to your regular investing schedule.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.820]   So that's one way that you can deploy capital more efficiently if you want to take advantage
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:05.820]   of dips.
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.820]   That makes sense.
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.040]   And we haven't really talked about what to invest in.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:13.520]   So before we get there, how do you think about building your own investment portfolio?
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.240]   I know there's a massive world of investments out there, and we've had on some folks like
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.480]   Andy Ratcliffe and Ben Carlson, and we've talked about passive investing and index funds
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.480]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.200]   But for you personally, how do you think about your portfolio?
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.520]   I'm a massive fan of index funds.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.760]   Always have been, always will be.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.840]   I think that index funds plus dollar cost averaging, as those gentlemen pointed out,
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.960]   is just a wonderful formula for building wealth over long periods of time.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.960]   And that's what I personally do with all of my retirement funds.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.400]   I set it up once to drip into index funds, and that's what I do.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:49.580]   But with my capital in my regular brokerage account, I love analyzing businesses, studying
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.160]   businesses, and buying individual stocks.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.680]   I've been doing that personally for about 15-plus years now.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.960]   So, any capital that I have beyond my retirement funds, that's where I deploy it.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:05.220]   So, at any given time over the course of a month, I typically buy a handful of stocks myself.
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.560]   And to do so, I just created a list of companies that I'm interested in, according to a checklist
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.880]   that I created, and prices are changing dynamically all the time.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.520]   And what's so fascinating about, if you invest in the individual company level, what's happening
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.360]   at an individual company can be wildly different than what's happening with the market in general.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.600]   When the market is down, there can be companies that are up.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.180]   And when the market's up, there can be companies that are down.
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:33.560]   But when I'm deploying capital in my investment portfolio and trying to invest in individual
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:38.640]   businesses, what I'm trying to do is optimize, at any given time, for the best combination
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:45.520]   of high-quality businesses, according to criteria that I selected, times the highest long-term
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:51.520]   potential, times the companies that are trading at the most attractive valuation at any given time.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:57.040]   So, it's really the combination of those things that I look to deploy my capital into at any given month.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.880]   So, I want to get into those three things.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.120]   But before that, how do you think about risk-taking?
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:07.440]   Do you think of your single stock investing more a portfolio approach, where you can diversify
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.800]   amongst stocks and it's actually not quite as risky?
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:16.240]   Or I think if you talk to most passive investors, they would say, "Gosh, if you go buy a stock,
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.240]   that's really risky.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.240]   You don't want to do that.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.240]   You want to bet on the market."
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.440]   So, your type of stock investing fits into general investing risk?
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.440]   I think that they're actually two of the same.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.840]   And it really depends on how you are investing.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.080]   When most people think about investing in individual stocks or businesses, what they're
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.640]   really trying to think about is timing the market and trading stocks, trying to buy them
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.680]   when they're low and sell them when they're high.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.320]   And I have no interest in trading stocks myself.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.800]   I view the portfolio, the investments that I'm making outside of my retirement funds,
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.080]   as essentially building my own index fund.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:52.640]   So, my style of investing is, I look for high-quality businesses that I think can grow for many,
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.840]   many, many years.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:59.400]   I buy those companies and I try and hold them as long as they remain great businesses.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.480]   So, I'm not trying to trade in and trade out of companies.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.960]   I move my portfolio very, very slowly.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:10.720]   So, what I'm trying to do is handpick, essentially, my own index fund and let those businesses
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.360]   grow for long periods of time.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.440]   I know you're a fan of the investment policy statement.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.280]   How have you used that concept, and for anyone who isn't familiar, maybe walk through what
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.880]   it is to guide your investing decisions?
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.440]   I think this is something that so many people overlook when they start investing.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.240]   They don't really sit and write down why they're investing in the first place.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.840]   They just think, "I have some money.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.520]   This stock thing sounds interesting.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.640]   I'm just going to do that."
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.560]   But I think it's really important to take a step back and ask yourself, "What is the
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.380]   purpose of this capital?
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.200]   Why am I choosing to invest it in any given way?"
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.160]   One tool that you can use to do that is just called an investor policy statement.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:55.400]   It's just a very simple set of rules that you set up for yourself before you start investing,
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.280]   and you can use it to guide your decision-making over time.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:04.240]   For example, my long-term investing goal is to grow my capital for as long as possible
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:11.960]   at as high of a rate as possible, while simultaneously assuming as little business risk as possible.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.960]   Now, "business risk" means that the companies that I'm investing in, I actually think, are
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.880]   low-risk businesses.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.300]   That doesn't mean that their stocks aren't high-risk and very volatile, but the underlying
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:26.480]   businesses that I invest in are actually fairly low-risk businesses.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:32.080]   All capital that I put into the market, I don't plan on touching for at least five years,
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:37.400]   and all of my short-term capital needs are funded by cash that I have on hand and then
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.800]   income from mine and my wife's jobs.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.540]   Because of that, we actually take a very conservative approach to our personal finances.
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.160]   We have a large emergency fund.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.820]   We have a high savings rate.
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.600]   We have multiple sources of income.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.580]   We have no debt of any kind.
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.020]   So, our personal finances are very conservative.
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:13:02.180]   That allows us to, essentially, with our investment portfolio, be 100% stocks and 0% bonds.
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:06.480]   That, in and of itself, means that my portfolio is going to be far more volatile than the
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.400]   average portfolio that has a mix of cash or a mix of bonds in there.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.280]   However, I'm perfectly fine with that volatility because I know that any money that I put into
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.160]   there, I don't need to touch for a period of years.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.400]   But I think that people could do so much better for themselves if they just sat down and asked
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.680]   themselves, "Money that I'm going to put into the markets, what's its purpose?
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.840]   What are my investing goals?
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.200]   And how long can I keep it in there?"
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.200]   I like that.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.960]   Is there a place to get some examples, maybe your book or your website, of those policy
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.200]   statements and how to start thinking about writing one?
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.400]   Now that you're saying that, I missed a big opportunity by not putting it into my book.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.840]   But if you just Google the terms "investor policy statement", there's lots of examples
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.520]   online that you can use as a guide.
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.520]   Cool.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.520]   Okay.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.520]   And so, you've got your policy statement.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.480]   And now, let's move on to this process of finding something to invest in, to start building
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.480]   out that portfolio.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.400]   You're pretty well-known for creating an investing checklist.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.920]   So, where did that come from and how has it evolved?
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.280]   And talk a little bit more about it.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.280]   Sure.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.040]   If you're new to investing, as I am, it's not hard to find companies to invest in once
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.280]   you know what to look for.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.760]   There's so many places that you can get investing ideas, whether it's following some big famous
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:18.320]   investors like Warren Buffett or Cathie Wood, reading free articles that are online, cracking
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.440]   open exchange-traded funds, looking at your own life and seeing what products or services
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.720]   do I use or does my company use?
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.380]   It's like the list of potential investments that you can make is huge.
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.860]   There's thousands of publicly traded companies for anybody to invest in.
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:35.520]   When I first started out, I quickly became overwhelmed with choice, and I was essentially
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:41.000]   trying to think in my own head, "Well, this business, I really like because it's run by
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   its founder and it has a great balance sheet.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.480]   But this other business has great margins, high long-term potential, and there are all
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.840]   these factors that I was trying to keep in my head to weigh investments against each other."
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:56.120]   Turns out, that's a really poor way to do it because our brains are not built that way.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:01.680]   Finally, I got smart enough to say, "Maybe I should write this down and create some rules
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.920]   for myself that I can use to guide my decision making."
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:08.880]   I would suggest that everybody that invests in anything beyond index funds goes through
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.840]   this very process themselves.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:16.720]   First, write down all of the attributes that would make any investment, a stock investment
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.320]   for example, attractive to you.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.880]   I did that, and I came up with things like, "I want the management team to have a high
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.040]   ownership percentage.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.800]   I wanted the revenue to be growing at a very high rate.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.080]   I wanted revenue to be recurring in nature.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.640]   I wanted it to be profitable.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.920]   I wanted the company's balance sheet, how much cash it has, to far outweigh how much
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.480]   debt that it has," etc., etc., etc.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:42.720]   I made a list of 30 things that I really wanted in any investment that I made.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.620]   Simultaneously, I made another list, which is, "What are all the things that I don't
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.640]   want to see in an investment that I make?"
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:52.560]   For me, that's things like, "I don't like it when a company gets the majority of its
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.980]   revenue from just a handful of customers."
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.820]   That's called customer concentration.
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:01.560]   "I don't like it when a company is operating in an industry that I think is actively being
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.420]   disrupted, like the oil and gas industry right now.
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.440]   I think it's primed for disruption over the next 10 or 20 years.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.320]   I don't want to make any investments in that."
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.240]   "I don't like it when a company's stock-based compensation, the amount of options that they
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:19.140]   hand out to employees, is such a high rate that the dilution rate is high," etc., etc.
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.440]   So, I have my list of things that I'm looking for.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.080]   I have my list of things that I don't want to see.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:29.020]   And then I rank them in order of most important to least important.
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:33.280]   That's a tricky exercise to do when you really have to force yourself to rank things against
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.840]   each other, but it's so useful to do so.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.900]   Finally, I have both of those things in place.
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:44.760]   And I just applied a very simple scoring system to weigh my criteria based on the factors
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.680]   that are most important to me.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.760]   And the same goes for the factors that I'm not looking for.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.840]   I just came up with a simple 100-point scoring system where I doled out 100 points in total
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.080]   based on the factors that I just listed.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:03.500]   From there, I now have my criteria built out, so I can take any company that I come across,
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.800]   I can research it, and as I'm researching it, I'm filling out this checklist.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:13.200]   And at the end, when this process is all done, I get to know whether a company is a match
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.000]   for what I'm looking for in investment or not.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.880]   I've done this now hundreds of times.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:22.480]   I have a list of companies that are very attractive to me as an investor.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:26.240]   And simultaneously, I have another group of companies that there's just no way I'm going
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.240]   to invest in.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:32.600]   So, the process of creating a checklist for myself, ranking it, and scoring it has helped
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.120]   to clarify my decision-making so much.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.480]   I have so many follow-up questions right now.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.240]   I'm like trying to take notes to organize them.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.840]   So, a few things.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.360]   One, you make this checklist of your own available on your website, correct?
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.360]   Yep.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.360]   You can make it freely downloadable.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.360]   Yep.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.200]   So, we'll make sure we link to that in the show notes.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:56.400]   But as you were walking through your criteria, it made me think, I'm not sure even I have
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.920]   an opinion on these things.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:03.000]   So, is this something that takes years of playing in the stock market to build?
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.040]   Do I care about whether there are a lot of options granted to employees?
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.520]   These seem like things that the average person might not have an opinion on.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.640]   Where do you suggest people get started?
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.800]   Or is it best to use someone else's list?
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.760]   Or is there a way to educate yourself on why you may or may not care about some of these
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.760]   things?
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.680]   The checklist as it exists today is a constantly evolving process.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:30.400]   And what it is today is through trial, error, and most importantly, feedback that I've gotten
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.000]   from other smart investors that I respect.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.540]   By studying the styles of great investors that I deeply respect, I find out what really
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.540]   matters to them.
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.560]   And then I took that and evolved it into what matters to me.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.600]   But I don't claim that the version that I have right now is "perfect".
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.860]   It's just the best version that I've come up with so far.
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.560]   But to your point, all of these things do take time to research.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.940]   If you want to go through the process of researching a stock, there's a lot that you have to learn.
[00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.560]   You have to learn accounting, you have to learn how to read SEC filings, you have to
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.840]   learn how to think about competitive advantages, studying the competition, thinking through
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.360]   the business model, studying potential risks.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.020]   There's a lot to evaluating individual stocks.
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:12.600]   This is a big reason why so many people say, "Forget all that and just stick with index
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.600]   funds."
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.600]   Right?
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.600]   It's so much easier to do that.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:20.880]   So this process, I think, is a good process if you're in that 1% or 2% of the population
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.240]   that is really fascinated by business the way that I am and is really interested in
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.780]   studying the subject.
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:27.880]   That's why I created this.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:32.400]   I absolutely love everything about investing in research companies, but I'm right there
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.400]   with you.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.280]   This is a time-consuming process and it turns off a lot of people.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.000]   If there are specific companies that people listening to this are thinking about, I've
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   actually gone and...
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.480]   Brian has a YouTube page where you actually break down going through your checklist for
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.480]   different companies.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.920]   So I'll just give that a shout out because I thought that was really fun to go and look
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.920]   at a couple companies.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.480]   I think Peloton is a great example.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.360]   You did one and then you came back and did a recheck in because it had been an interesting
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.600]   adventure for that company.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.240]   We got that one wrong.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.480]   That's why you're making more than one bet.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.680]   But what you said about it taking a lot of time, if someone listening to this is like,
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:09.160]   "Index fund investing is fine, but there's some companies that I like.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:14.120]   Is there a place for trying to invest in those stocks that whether you like them or you think
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:18.640]   they're exciting or the company has potential that doesn't need to take this much time?
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.800]   Or is your general advice, if you're not going to take the time, you probably shouldn't do
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.800]   it?"
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.600]   The best advice that I can give there would be always think about your overall asset allocation.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.880]   Some people say that stock picking is a complete waste of time.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:30.880]   They're not interested in it.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.880]   Fine.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.720]   Just stick with 100% index funds and call it a day.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.680]   But I think there's room for a happy medium in the middle.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:41.380]   There are some people that I think should put, say, 90% or 95% of their assets into
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.120]   index funds, but if they have a hunkering, or there's some businesses that they're really
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:49.420]   interested in or they want to research, I see nothing wrong with taking a few percent
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:53.560]   of your overall portfolio and putting it into investments that you pick out.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.480]   So, if you can pick, say, five companies or something like that that you're really passionate
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:02.540]   about and put 1% or 2% of your portfolio in it, even if you're wrong, even if the process
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.000]   that you go through, or if you don't want to do the research, you just want to make
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.260]   an investment in those companies, even if you're wrong about them, well, 90% of your
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.720]   net worth is perfectly fine in the market.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.460]   If you don't want to go through the research process and you just want to put a little
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:18.180]   bit of capital in, I think that's fine so long as you size it appropriately.
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:23.360]   As I walk through what you're saying, I'm realizing that you're presenting us all with
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:30.600]   an option for building a part of your long-term diversified portfolio on your own with stocks.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.800]   So, I think some people listening might think it's okay to take some bets with 5% of your
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.420]   portfolio, but be safe with 95%.
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:42.280]   And you echoed that sentiment, but you've said, "Look, if you take the 95%, there's
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:47.220]   a different way than index funds that you could invest that 95%."
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.860]   And for you, it sounds like some of it is index funds, but some of it is building a
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:54.980]   portfolio of a lot of stocks that you spend time and research on.
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:59.300]   And if you're interested in that time and energy to do that research, you could treat
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:04.020]   your index fund portfolio, and you could split it apart and do two different things without
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:09.660]   having to feel like you're taking a significant amount of risk on your stock investing.
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:14.180]   Do you think that the type of investing you're doing is passive investing, or is it more
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.440]   like wild bets people often say they're taking with stocks?
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.660]   And I ask that because it feels like it actually is more like passive investing.
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:26.220]   Yeah, if you crack open the S&P 500, you might naturally think that you're diversified equally
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.100]   across 500 companies.
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.420]   That's actually not the case.
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:35.140]   The S&P 500 is weighed by market capitalization, meaning, the larger the company, the bigger
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.540]   a portion of the S&P 500 that is.
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:41.340]   Now, there's still 500 companies in there, but if you look at the giant companies that
[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:46.820]   are in there -- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. -- they take up a pretty sizable portion
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:47.820]   of the portfolio.
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.740]   The last time I looked, they were at least 3% or 4%.
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:55.020]   If you're investing in the S&P 500, you have a higher concentration of your funds in those
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.620]   businesses just by the nature of investing in an index fund.
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:02.620]   To your point, with the vast majority of my capital, especially capital that's outside
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:06.740]   of retirement funds, I don't think that I'm taking on a huge amount of risk because I
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:12.580]   own a collection of a few dozen stocks, but the top 20 stocks that I have have earned
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:13.980]   their spot in my portfolio.
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:18.680]   Meaning, I bought these companies a long time ago, and I just got them right, that they
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.140]   just happen to be great companies that grew and grew.
[00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:25.820]   For that reason, when a company does very, very well on the markets, it's typically because
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.660]   the business underneath it is succeeding.
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:32.740]   One of my top holdings is Google, which I bought, oh, jeez, 13 years ago.
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:37.300]   It's grown into a top holding for me, not because I set out to make it a top holding,
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:40.700]   but I just bought it many years ago and have just held onto it.
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:44.420]   If you look at Google's business alphabet, as it's called Google's business today, it's
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.980]   an extremely reliable blue-chip company.
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.460]   The company has hundreds of billions of dollars that come in.
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.780]   It generates huge profitability.
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:55.380]   It has a war chest balance sheet, and it's still growing to this day.
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:24:00.340]   If you're invested in the S&P 500 index fund or total stock market index fund, it's a top
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.100]   holding for you, too.
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:06.080]   I don't think what I'm doing with my portfolio, since I'm diversified, since I'm buying good
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.340]   businesses and since I'm holding them for long periods of time, is all that drastically
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.180]   different than people that just invest in index funds.
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.140]   It's just more time-intensive, and that's OK with me.
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:19.300]   We talked a lot about different types of stock buying, but one thing I noticed you never
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:24.160]   mentioned you cared about, or at least I didn't hear, was what's the price of the stock right now?
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.580]   Is that even a factor when you make a decision?
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:30.180]   That is such a confusing thing about investing.
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:34.700]   In fact, when I first started investing, I had no clue about the relationship between
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.620]   price and market cap.
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:41.780]   Like so many people, I thought that the success in individual investing was looking for companies
[00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:44.260]   that trade at a very low share price.
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:48.100]   A lot of my first investments -- my investments in air quotes, because I had no idea what
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.500]   I was doing -- was in penny stocks.
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.560]   It turns out that penny stocks have the reputation they have because they're typically places
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.080]   that you can go to destroy capital.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:01.780]   So many of my first forays into the market were buying awful businesses solely because
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.940]   their share price was really low.
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:09.060]   The way that prices work in the stock market is so different than the way prices work in
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:12.820]   every other consumer good that we buy that it's naturally very confusing.
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:17.580]   If you were to go in the market and find a company that was trading at $500 per share,
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:22.980]   and you found another one that was trading at $5 per share, and say, "Which one is more expensive?"
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.740]   Only in investing can you say, "Not enough information."
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:32.780]   The stock that's trading at $500 per share might be less expensive, a better bargain
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:36.500]   price than the stock that's trading at $5 per share.
[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.920]   The reason for that is, the equity of a company is two things.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:45.300]   One, the dollar price of a share, which is the number that's quoted everywhere that you look.
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:48.660]   You go on Google, you open the stocks app on your phone, what do you see?
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.160]   You see the price of one share.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.540]   However, what you don't often see is the market capitalization of the company.
[00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:59.420]   That's the dollar value of the company's total equity.
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:05.260]   To find that number, you have to look at how many shares exist at a company.
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.380]   Here's something that not many people know.
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:13.660]   The number of shares that exist at a company is a totally arbitrary number that the company chose.
[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:18.060]   A company can go out there and say, "I want to have a million shares of stock,"
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:21.300]   or that same company could say, "I want to have a billion shares."
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:25.820]   What we look at when we're looking at the price isn't enough information to tell us
[00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:30.700]   if that company is trading at an attractive number, or if it's cheap, or if it's expensive.
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:35.520]   However, that's such a counterintuitive thing that so many people assume the dollar price
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.140]   of a stock will tell you what you need to know about the company.
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:39.140]   Two follow-ups.
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:43.980]   One is, the valuation of the company or the market cap is something that you do pay attention
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.620]   to when deciding to invest.
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:46.620]   Is that what I'm hearing?
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:47.620]   Yes.
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:53.020]   I care much more about the market capitalization of a company than they do about the dollar
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.740]   price of one share.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.900]   If I'm analyzing a company, one of the first things I look at is the market cap.
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:02.460]   That will give you a rough size about the total value of the business.
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:06.900]   The reason I focus on that is, when I'm looking to make an investment in a company, I typically
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:11.340]   want to buy companies or add companies to my portfolio that I think I can at least earn
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:15.300]   a 5X return on, or better yet, a 10X return on.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:20.220]   The size of a business is going to show me how hard that is for that company to do that.
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:25.800]   For example, if I come across a company and it's trading at a $1 billion valuation, that's
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:30.460]   the size of the market cap, for me to earn a 10X return on that company, that company
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.720]   would have to grow into a $10 billion valuation.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:38.020]   There's lots of companies out there that are currently worth $10 billion, $50 billion,
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.560]   $100 billion, or more.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.480]   It doesn't take a huge amount of imagination to believe that a company can grow from $1
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.600]   billion to $10 billion.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:52.540]   Conversely, if you come across a company like Apple, for example, Apple's market capitalization
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.540]   is currently enormous.
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:59.220]   The company is currently trading at $2.7 trillion.
[00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:06.120]   For Apple to grow five times in value from here, it would have to be essentially an $11
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.260]   or $12 trillion company.
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:15.060]   That is such a gargantuanly huge number that I personally have a really hard time seeing
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.240]   Apple ever do that.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:21.340]   I'm not going to say it's never going to happen, but holy cow, is that a lot of market capitalization
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:25.760]   that has to be added onto Apple for its stock to 5X from here.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.680]   That's why I'm really focused on the market capitalization of a company, not the dollar
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.140]   price of one share.
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.400]   How does that change over time?
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.980]   You mentioned one of your investments early on was Google.
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:42.080]   Now, even though it's clear that in the last 13 years, Google probably did 5X the business,
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:46.040]   but now let's say you're looking at it and you think, "Gosh, now it's a lot harder.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.040]   It might be for Apple."
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.640]   Does that mean you have to get out?
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.800]   How do you think about exiting positions that you've made?
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:56.800]   When I first made an investment in Google, it was far, far, far smaller than it was today.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:01.920]   The market capitalization was well under $100 billion when I started buying it.
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:07.340]   Today, I'm quite happy to continue holding Google, and I do not expect Google to 5X really
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:08.340]   in any period of time.
[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:13.120]   Google is a $1.7 trillion company, so for it to 5X, it would have to be a $9 trillion
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.120]   company.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.320]   I'd be very happy with that outcome, but I don't think that it's going to happen.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:22.960]   Instead, I view Google as a part of my portfolio that is more of a bedrock anchor, something
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:28.420]   that I think can grow at a low double-digit rate, but I don't expect the company to deliver
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.460]   a 5X return from here.
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:35.140]   So, in general, while I'm very happy as a Google shareholder, I wouldn't approach it
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:39.240]   from a "I'm interested in buying this company today," I would be more interested and likely
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:43.920]   to sell it to fund purchases of other companies that I think have higher growth potential.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:48.040]   But, I'm not going to sell a company solely because it's huge if I've owned that company
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:52.120]   for a long period of time, and I'm still happy to own it.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:56.520]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and the cracks start to
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.520]   emerge.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:02.480]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week, and you have too many manual processes,
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.680]   and there's no one source of truth.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:12.160]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers - $37,000, $25,000, and $1,000 - $37,000.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.080]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle, and I'm excited
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.120]   to partner with them for this episode.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:22.200]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining accounting, financial
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.320]   management, inventory, HR, and more.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:26.320]   25.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.160]   NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:33.520]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books in days, not
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.120]   weeks, and drive down costs.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.320]   And 1.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.640]   Because your business is one-of-a-kind, so you get a customized solution for all your
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:46.100]   KPIs in one efficient system with one source of truth.

[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:54.240]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you from all the companies
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.080]   I've run, makes everything so much better.

[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:25.000]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so good
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.600]   for you, and nothing showcases that better than Pu-erh tea.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:32.620]   It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.560]   it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:41.680]   Peak's Pu-erh teas are all cold-extracted using only wild-harvested leaves from 250-year-old
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:46.140]   tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:51.180]   Then everything is triple-toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals, and toxic mold
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.260]   commonly found in plants.
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:58.680]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero-prep, because they're all in pre-measured quantities
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:03.760]   that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds, and are so travel-friendly.
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:08.200]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green Pu-erh
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:13.040]   for mental clarity and energy, and the black Pu-erh, which helps kick-start digestion and
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:18.120]   metabolism with a rich, earthy flavor that is so good, and probably one of my favorite
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.480]   things to drink.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:23.060]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research-backed benefits of
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:27.960]   polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more, and then be happy that
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:32.560]   Pu-erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the world.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:36.520]   But you don't even have to take my word, or do any research, because Peak offers free
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.140]   US shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:45.760]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea samples

[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.320]   So when do you decide to sell?
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:04.160]   Whether it was a pick that didn't work out or a company that's worked out and now doesn't
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.800]   have that potential, I can tell people listening that I have some random stocks I've invested
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:12.620]   over the years, and I personally am struggling, like, when do you exit?
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:15.880]   How do you help people think about when's the time to either cut your losses if it's
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.520]   down or take your gains off the table?
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.520]   Yes.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.520]   First off, let's acknowledge something.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:25.080]   Knowing when to buy a stock is much easier than knowing when to sell.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.520]   It's much more fun for me to research and think about companies that can grow in value
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.580]   than it is to be on the other side of the transaction.
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:34.220]   However, there are some reasons that I think a stock should be sold.
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:37.840]   First and foremost, the No. 1 reason that I sell a stock, and it's the most common,
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.500]   is I was wrong.
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.980]   So, I came up with a thesis for a company.
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:46.640]   I thought that the company was going to grow to take advantage of a blank market opportunity,
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.940]   and I thought the company had an advantage over its rivals.
[00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:55.200]   If that proves to be incorrect, if the company is clearly struggling to execute that and
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:00.220]   I am proven wrong, I have no problem saying, "I got that one wrong," and selling to be
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:01.380]   to play in my capital.
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:06.620]   Two, if I'm right about a company and it grows to be too large a position in my portfolio
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:11.280]   and I'm too concentrated in that company, that is a situation where I'm also happy to
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.280]   trim that company.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:16.840]   More recently, I personally trimmed a little bit off of my position in Tesla, not because
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.640]   I don't think Tesla is a great company with a bright future ahead, but Tesla has grown
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:25.800]   to be my No. 1 position by far, simply because of how well that company has done, and I've
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.080]   been trimming my position surely for risk management purposes.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.640]   That's a happy reason to sell it.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:36.680]   No. 3, if you have a better use for that capital, if you're no longer interested in following
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:40.680]   a company or own a company, and it might be a lukewarm investment, but you find another
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:44.480]   investment that you're more interested in, I see nothing wrong with selling the one that
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:48.000]   you're not interested in to buy more of the one that you are interested in.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.840]   And the best reason of all to sell is that you need the money for your personal life.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:57.200]   The whole reason we invest in the first place is to grow our capital so that we can live
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.200]   a better life.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:02.280]   So, I see nothing wrong with selling a stock if you need to use that money for a purchase.
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.760]   So I think one takeaway for me out of this is, the best I can remember, I'm going to
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.400]   go through the handful of stocks I own and try to write down why I invested them in the
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.400]   first place.
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:15.360]   And that'll give me a place to look to decide when it's appropriate to sell because maybe
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.800]   I don't believe in that thing anymore.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.660]   One thing that I personally do and I'm a big advocate for, in addition to writing an investor
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:24.360]   policy statement for yourself, is to keep an investing journal.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:29.400]   So every time that I go and I buy a stock, I just write down what stock I'm buying, a
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:35.000]   few words on why I'm buying it, and also the valuation that I'm paying at the time of my
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   purchase.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.580]   It can be time-intensive to do that, but so often, if we buy a stock, it's not all that
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:45.680]   uncommon for us to change our thesis over time as the business results come in.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:49.820]   It's really helpful to have an anchor point to look back and say, "What was I thinking
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:54.440]   at the time of this purchase?" and to match up the reality that the business is doing
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.160]   against your initial predictions for those businesses.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:00.880]   If those two things are mismatched for the worst, that can be a sign that company is
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.240]   no longer for you and it's time to sell that company.
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:07.940]   But again, broadly speaking, buying is much more fun than selling and knowing when to
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:09.800]   sell a stock is very, very hard.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.800]   So we talked about buying.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.240]   We talked about selling.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.640]   What about adding to a position?
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:17.440]   Is that something you find yourself doing over time and how do you decide that you want
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.440]   to double down?
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.760]   I don't invest all the capital that I'm going to invest in a company up front.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:26.080]   I tend to buy in small chunks over periods of time that are spaced out.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:30.520]   I do so because I know from my own track record that I'm often wrong, right?
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:35.000]   A company can check a lot of the boxes that I look for in a business, but that business
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.720]   still has to go on and execute against the opportunity that it presents for itself, and
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:43.520]   sometimes new competition can come along, or the market can change.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:46.740]   It's common for me to be completely wrong about a stock.
[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:52.280]   So when I'm looking to add to a position over time, what I'm attempting to do is two things.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:56.040]   First, I'm looking to invest in companies that are winning.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.440]   That's a very counterintuitive thing.
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:03.240]   Most people think, "Oh, I bought a stock for $10, it went to $20, I can't buy any more
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.700]   of that stock. It was at $10 before, now it's at $20."
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:09.960]   Conversely, they buy a stock at $10, it falls to $5, and that's the one that they're interested
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.760]   in adding to because it's at a lower price.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.680]   What I've discovered the hard way is that more often than not, it's better to take additional
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:20.880]   capital and put it into the company that's already doubled for you, as opposed to the
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.680]   one that's already halved.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:26.360]   The reason that companies go up and their stocks tend to do well is because something
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:31.480]   about the underlying business is succeeding, and Wall Street is recognizing that business
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.480]   is succeeding.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.240]   Conversely, if a stock is underperforming, that's a sign that the company is having a
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:40.280]   hard time succeeding, and it's not meeting investors' expectations.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:47.600]   Broadly speaking, winners tend to keep on winning, and losers tend to keep on losing.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:51.680]   So when I'm looking to add to companies, I'm typically looking at the companies that are
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:56.400]   winning in my portfolio first, and those are the ones I'm actually adding to.
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.640]   I think some people might hear that and think, "Wow, that sounds a lot like the opposite
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:03.620]   of the tried-and-true buy low, sell high.
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:07.840]   That sounds like buy high, sell low," which I think everyone says, "That's what you shouldn't do."
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:13.740]   How do you juxtapose what you just said with what I would say is pretty commonly-believed
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:16.600]   advice -- maybe you disagree with it -- of buy low, sell high?
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:21.500]   I think it's helpful to actually look at some studies of investing and how the market actually
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:25.880]   works, which are hidden from us if you're investing in just index funds.
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.840]   J.P. Morgan did this wonderful study where they looked at thousands of publicly traded
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:34.320]   companies over a period of 30 years, and they looked at the returns of those companies.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:39.040]   What they found was that if you put your capital into 10 random companies, what you can expect
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:44.800]   is that four of those companies will suffer a catastrophic loss and stay down permanently.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:51.480]   Three of those companies will go up in value, but they will underperform the market in general.
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.960]   That leaves three other companies.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:58.780]   Two of those companies will be modest market beaters, and one of those companies will deliver
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.380]   multi-bagger returns.
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:06.000]   What actually drives the market forward over time is a very small minority of companies.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:12.240]   It's really about the top 10% of companies that are literally responsible for 90% of
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.040]   the market's returns over long periods of time.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.600]   When I've looked at that and I've studied some investors that have taught me this really
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:22.320]   counterintuitive lesson, what you actually want to do, it really matters that you get
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:27.840]   some of your portfolio to include some of those 10% of companies that are the mega-winners.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.040]   What do mega-winners have in common?
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:33.780]   Their stocks have already gone up a lot.
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:39.520]   If you think back to some of the mega-winners that are today -- Tesla, Google, Apple, Netflix,
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:46.200]   Chipotle -- if you bought those companies after their stock doubled, tripled, or quadrupled,
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:52.180]   you then went on to earn a massive return, even after their stocks were up huge.
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:56.660]   That's why it can actually be a good sign if a company's stock is going up.
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:40:01.680]   That's an indication that the business model is working and that Wall Street is recognizing
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.120]   that the business model is working.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:08.200]   Conversely, if you want to buy a stock that has lost badly to the market, underperformed
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.760]   the market, history shows that the chances are pretty good it's in that seven out of
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:16.560]   10 stocks that is going to permanently underperform the market.
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:21.760]   So, I think the phrase "buy low, sell high" sounds really good in theory, but when you
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:26.280]   actually get into the practicality of investments, some of the best investments that I've ever
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:32.220]   made was buying stocks that were already up big and were at all-time highs.
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:37.360]   My conversation with Andy Ratcliffe was that some of the best investors are quite contrarian.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.960]   I like that you're taking a different approach, and I'm glad we got to dig into some of the
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.520]   data about it.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:46.920]   We talked a lot about ways to invest, but I want to ask what platform you're doing this
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:51.240]   on and if it makes any of the things you're doing easier.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.400]   You mentioned buying a stock, maybe you want to deploy over time.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:41:00.200]   But gosh, let's say you wanted to put $500 into Google today.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:05.320]   There's not an easy way to say, "I want to put $500 over the next 5 months and then stop."
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.920]   At least I'm not familiar with one.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:11.160]   Is there an investing site that you like or recommend that makes some of those kinds of
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.280]   things easy?
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:17.920]   I'm pretty sure that M1 Finance has done many of those things with, you can create a pie
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:22.200]   for your portfolio, and as you put capital into it, it automatically allocates, and you
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.900]   don't have to worry about things like buying exactly one share.
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.480]   You can buy fractional shares.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:30.120]   We as investors are extremely lucky because there's lots of platforms out there that allow
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.200]   you to buy fractional shares of stocks.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:36.360]   To answer your question, though, the broker that I use is called Interactive Brokers.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:42.200]   I signed up with them 9 years ago, and what I liked about them is it's a hassle to use
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.200]   their system.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:48.160]   It is a pain in the butt to log in, and once you're in, buying and selling is easy, just
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.720]   like it is on any other platform.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.360]   But I actually like that there's friction to the platform.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:57.360]   I don't use any app on my phone because the easier it is to buy or sell, the more tempted
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.360]   I would be to do it when I'm feeling emotional.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:04.880]   If I owned a stock and that stock was down big or up big in response to whatever the
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:08.720]   news of the day, my decision-making skills would be compromised because of what I was
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:09.800]   seeing on the screen.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:14.640]   I also use Interactive Brokers, and it's funny, it's one of the few products that I've probably
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:19.880]   never even mentioned I use on this show because I think most people would hate it.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.560]   I agree.
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:23.920]   The interface is difficult.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:28.160]   I'm often unsure of how to find things and have to read long manuals.
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:34.200]   But for me, the other big perk of Interactive Brokers is that if you need to borrow against
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:39.760]   your portfolio, the amount of interest many institutions charge is very high.
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.220]   So Interactive Brokers is quite low.
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:46.060]   At Wealthfront, we have a portfolio line of credit that's also low for index funds.
[00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:49.000]   And everywhere else I've seen is like 5%, 6%, 7%.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.600]   So that's another plus on Interactive Brokers.
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:55.120]   But in general, I will say it is a confusing interface.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:59.500]   I'm happy to put my referral link in the show notes, but I don't expect a lot of usage
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.320]   of it because of that.
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:04.400]   But it's funny, I also use that for my single stock investing.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:09.680]   And I'm also not familiar with an easy way to say, "Oh, I want to invest $1,000 in this
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:10.680]   company.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:11.680]   Can I do it over five months?"
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:16.520]   Because doing it each month manually just invites emotion to change the decision you
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:17.700]   made in advance.
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:23.000]   One other platform technology question I have, so often I see people say, "Gosh, I picked
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.640]   this stock and over the last month, it's down 7%.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.640]   How should I feel about that?"
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.360]   I'm like, "The entire market is down 7%."
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:35.800]   So relative to the benchmark of the market, your stock hasn't gone up, hasn't gone down
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.280]   relative to the benchmark.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.800]   Is that a way you look at things?
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:44.080]   Do you look at how a stock's done absolute on its own, or do you try to compare how it's
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:47.760]   done to the general market to get a sense of relative performance?
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.720]   I always like to compare things to the market.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.200]   You have to have something to compare it to.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:55.440]   I'm happy just to compare it to the standard benchmark, which is the S&P 500.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.640]   But yeah, you can't look at stocks in a vacuum.
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:02.940]   What's even more confusing about investing is that there is a one-to-one relationship
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:08.420]   between the performance of a business and the performance of a stock over long periods of time.
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:13.440]   The reason that companies go up substantially over long periods of time is the underlying
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.620]   business that's underneath them has improved dramatically.
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:21.320]   Maybe revenue is up a whole lot, margins are better, profits are improving, they've made
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:23.140]   an acquisition, or whatever the reason is.
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:27.320]   There's a direct tie between what happens to a business and what happens to the stock
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.080]   over long periods of time.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:33.800]   Over short periods of time, there's almost no connection at all to what a business and
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:34.840]   a stock are doing.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:40.000]   What's happening in the macro environment can often so overwhelm the actual business
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.500]   performance of a company.
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:46.260]   This can be so confusing to you as an investor, because you can buy a company and you can
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:50.200]   say, "I think this company is going to become more profitable, its revenue is going to grow,
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.320]   and the stock's going to do well."
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.560]   You could be right about the business.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:58.500]   When they come out with a quarterly report, they could say, "Revenue is up, profits are up,
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:02.820]   we're hiring more people, we're expanding, hey, we've got this new product that's coming out."
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:06.620]   And that stock can fall, and that stock can fall really hard.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:10.460]   So, in the short term, there isn't always a direct relationship between the performance
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:13.280]   of the company and the performance of the business.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.440]   That's why investing can be so trying on your emotions.
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:22.100]   However, over long periods of time, the performance of the business always is eventually reflected
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:23.240]   in the stock price.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:29.080]   When I'm judging how my companies are doing, I'm almost never looking at just the stock price.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:32.480]   I'm always asking myself, "How did the company do?
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.340]   What's the general direction of the business?"
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:37.120]   And I'm focused very heavily on the business itself.
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:43.460]   In those short-term scenarios where comparing how it's done to the benchmark is really helpful,
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:44.460]   right?
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:47.200]   Because you might feel like you got a dud, but really just the market, as you said earlier,
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.260]   it's down almost 20% from highs.
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:53.200]   Is there an easy way to do that online for someone who maybe wants to look at their portfolio
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.820]   and say, "Gosh, I invested in Square 12 months ago.
[00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:58.700]   How has Square done relative to the market?"
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:01.520]   Is that an easy calculation anywhere you know?
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:05.600]   Interactive Brokers gives me an overall portfolio versus the market over various periods of
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:06.600]   time.
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:07.600]   So, that's what I do.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.920]   But you can use some very simple charting tools, especially ones that are on Yahoo Finance
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:16.560]   or Google if you want to look up an individual holding over shorter periods of time.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:21.920]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact, and trade coffee is a great addition
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:23.680]   to your New Year routine.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.280]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:30.440]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources the best
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:34.840]   coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:39.320]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters so you can enjoy their craft from
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:44.320]   the comfort of your own home at a fraction of the cost of going out for coffee.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:47.340]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with trade.
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:51.240]   Sign up for a subscription or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:55.680]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need it.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:59.600]   And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from trade.
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:04.880]   But this last bag of beans from Drink Coffee Do Stuff in Tahoe, it's called Bark the Moon
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.920]   and it's so delicious.
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:10.120]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a trade subscription.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:17.920]   Right now, trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans when you visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:23.320]   That's allthehacks.com/trade for a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:24.320]   allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:32.640]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to chef David Chang about leveling up your
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.040]   cooking at home?
[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:36.360]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:39.640]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:44.880]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave cookware from
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:49.440]   Any Day, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:54.240]   Any Day is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from scratch in the
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:59.600]   microwave and honestly using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:02.220]   and simplifies the process so much.
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:07.840]   The cookware is 100% plastic free and you can cook, serve, store and reheat all in the
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:12.480]   same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer and oven safe too.
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:17.000]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your Any Day adventure, I highly recommend
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.600]   David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:20.840]   It is so good.
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:25.360]   And if you haven't checked out the Matte Black Ayo Collection they launched last year, you
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:27.080]   have to check it out.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:31.520]   So to get 15% off our new favorite cookware, go to allthehacks.com/anyday.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:40.520]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:44.360]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:47.120]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:55.200]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals and discounts from our partners, you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:58.400]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.400]   Okay.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:04.360]   We went a lot of places and we talked briefly at least a couple of times on asymmetric bets.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:08.400]   And I think most people listening might've thought, "Gosh, Brian's this guy that invests
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.520]   in a lot of stocks.
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:15.280]   All he's doing is making a bunch of high risk asymmetric bets across his whole portfolio."
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.600]   And hopefully if they're still here, they've come to the conclusion that's not the case.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:23.320]   That you're actually trying to do a different type of investing with the bulk of your portfolio.
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:26.440]   But I'm curious where those asymmetric bets do fit in.
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:31.160]   And do you take those much higher risk bets in your portfolio and how do they fit into
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.160]   everything?
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:37.560]   The bulk of my individual holdings are in companies that are low risk businesses with
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:40.960]   strong competitive advantages. They're growing at an above-average rate.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.560]   They tend to be profitable, free cash flow positive.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:45.860]   They tend to be very high-quality businesses.
[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:49.980]   I don't think I'm taking on a whole lot of risk by investing in those companies.
[00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:57.560]   However, with a portion of my portfolio, I also am happy to invest in higher risk situations,
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:03.080]   knowing full well going in that I'm assuming a whole lot more risk, so I better be compensated
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.700]   for that risk with the potential for higher return.
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:11.120]   I know you've talked in the past about making investments in crypto, like Ethereum and Bitcoin.
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:14.620]   I view those the same way. They're asymmetric opportunities.
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:19.720]   If you invest, say, $1,000 into a high-risk stock, the wonderful thing about investing
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:24.320]   is the worst you can do, assuming you use no leverage, is lose $1,000.
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:29.000]   You are completely wrong about the company. It goes belly up. You lose your $1,000.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:34.920]   However, if you're right about that company, that $1,000 can grow into $2,000, $5,000,
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:40.000]   $10,000, even $100,000 if you are right about the business.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.620]   Yes, those companies are extremely rare, but they are out there.
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:49.580]   So, with a portion of my individual stock portfolio, I'm happy to buy higher risk companies
[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:52.780]   if I believe that I can earn 10x plus returns on them.
[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:56.020]   When you're thinking about these asymmetric bets, do you try to limit them?
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:51:00.160]   Do you try to make them regularly? Do you have a way to come up with ideas for them?
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.120]   How do you find them?
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:05.940]   Well, I'm a stock market junkie, so one of my favorite things to do is to research companies.
[00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:10.020]   But to answer your question, I'm a contractor for The Motley Fool, so I get access to all
[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.880]   of their recommendations, and that's one place that I go to.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:18.760]   There's also tons of ways to find investments by looking at high-growth portfolios, high-growth ETFs.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:22.920]   The ARK funds, for example, have become very popular with investors, although those things
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:25.500]   are losing very badly to the market over the last year.
[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:29.060]   There's lots of asymmetric risk-reward companies that are in there.
[00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:32.160]   Finding potential ideas isn't the hard part.
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:38.120]   The hard part is vetting the ideas and asking yourself, "What kind of risk level am I taking
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:41.800]   and what are the odds that this company is going to go on to beat the market?"
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:44.560]   But finding ideas is really easy nowadays.
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:49.340]   Is the vetting process for these higher risk, higher return investments, is that a different
[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:54.160]   investing checklist? Or how do you think about making those picks differently than you would others?
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:58.340]   No, I still take it through my exact same checklist, it's just that the companies typically
[00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:04.680]   score very poorly on my checklist for doing so because I value things like free cash flow,
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:09.520]   I value things like net income, I value competitive advantage, etc.
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:14.620]   I still go through the exact same process that I go to, but even after that process is done,
[00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:19.880]   if the company scores poorly, but I still believe that the potential is huge, I will
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:22.160]   go in and make an investment in that case.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:27.520]   I just do so going eyes wide open that this is a high-risk, high-reward bet that I'm making,
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:30.040]   and I just size it appropriately in my portfolio.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:34.280]   Cool. This is a question that I'm not sure I was going to ask. And I feel like I'll probably
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:37.880]   get some emails from listeners if I don't ask it, but I'll probably also get some if
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:43.600]   I do. But are there any companies right now that you're particularly excited about? And
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:48.800]   to be clear, this is not an investment recommendation from Brian or an endorsement by me. But if
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:53.240]   someone's sourcing ideas, are there any you want to seed out there right now?
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:57.240]   Sure. As part of the show notes, you asked me to come up with the 5 stocks that I like.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:01.240]   I like stepping up to the plate and swinging, but to your point, I own four of these stocks.
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:04.520]   I don't own one of them, and I'll tell you which one I don't own. But I have confidence
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:08.040]   that all these stocks will beat the market from here. But going back to the percentages
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:13.220]   we talked about earlier, history shows that when I make 10 investments, I'm wrong about
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:18.280]   half the time. But that's OK, because the half of the time that I'm right, I do so well
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:22.560]   on just a few of them that the losses that I have and the ones that I'm wrong on are
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:26.040]   dwarfed by the gains that you get than the ones that you're right on.
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:31.640]   But to play the game, five stocks that I think are good buys right now are Roku, Pinterest,
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:37.640]   Zoom. How's that for contrarian? Fiverr and Upstart is the fifth one. That's one that
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:43.200]   I don't own, but that is a high growth, profitable company that I'm very interested in.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:46.800]   For the second or maybe the third time with the disclosure at the beginning to say, "This
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:50.520]   is not a recommendation." Brian is not telling anyone here to go buy these stocks, but I
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:53.880]   love playing the game. I love hearing what's on top of your mind. Thank you.
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:57.360]   And what's fun about that is it's not hard to track ourselves. So I'll create a little
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:01.280]   spreadsheet for us right now on today's recording date. I'll put these companies in there so
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.280]   I actually can see how these companies do over time.
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:06.480]   Oh, that's great. Let's make it a Google sheet. Let's make it public. I'll put it in the show
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:10.680]   notes. And even a few weeks from now when this comes out, you will be able to see how
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:11.680]   it's been done.
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.840]   These are multi-year investments. These aren't multi-week investments.
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:18.760]   Oh, sorry. Sorry. I meant when this episode's out in a few weeks, people will see how it's
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:23.400]   done. But yes, don't judge them on their short nature returns. Okay, cool. Last thing on
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:28.360]   investing and then I have a couple totally different questions for you. One is on just
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:32.800]   books. People listening to this that think, "Gosh, I want to get more educated." I'd love
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:36.520]   it if you could throw out a few of your favorite resources. They don't have to be books, they
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:40.960]   could be online. Both for people who are like, "I need to brush up." And people who are like,
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:44.080]   "What are the next level books that I should be reading if I've read the basics?"
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:47.840]   Anyway, that's interested in individual stock investing, there are a couple books I'll throw
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:52.600]   out there that I think are wonderful resources. The first is called Warren Buffett and the
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:56.720]   Interpretation of Financial Statements. This is a book that was written by Warren Buffett's
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:55:01.780]   daughter-in-law, Mary Buffett. And it basically takes the three major financial statements,
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:04.920]   the income statement, the balance sheet, and the cash flow statement, and it goes through
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:10.500]   them line by line and it shows you how Warren Buffett thinks about those numbers. So, it's
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:15.400]   a wonderful book for learning accounting and thinking through how financial statements
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:19.480]   can be turned into investment decisions. So, that one is a hidden gem.
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:24.840]   Another one is called The Little Book That Builds Wealth. That one is by Pat Dorsey.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:29.680]   Pat Dorsey is the former head of research at Morningstar. And that book really goes
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:35.520]   into how to think about competitive advantage in businesses and how to spot investments
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:39.540]   that have a competitive advantage. That's a very important topic that everybody needs
[00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:44.020]   to learn about. And the third one I'll throw out there is a fun book called 100 Baggers
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:48.960]   by Christopher Meyer. So, that's a study of public companies that returned over their
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:54.060]   lifetime, earned investors a 100X return on their investment. It talks through some of
[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:57.920]   the principles that they had in common and what investors can look for. So, those are
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:00.880]   three under-the-radar books that I think are wonderful.
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:04.880]   That's great. Thank you for sharing those. The interesting thing I want to jump to, which
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:10.040]   has nothing to do with stock investing at all, but what reminded me of it was, I both
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:14.920]   heard you talk about it on another podcast, and I recently got an email from a listener
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:18.240]   asking about picking their mortgage. It'll draw back to investing a little, but they
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:22.760]   said, "Gosh, if you start from a 30-year fix..." They were like, "I could make a strong argument
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:27.360]   to try to get a 15-year mortgage to pay it down faster, but I could make an equally strong
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:31.600]   argument to go for an interest-only mortgage and take all the money that I would have put
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:37.000]   in the house and invest it, which I believe will outperform the low interest rates I'm
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:44.380]   facing now." I always fall on the, let's call it, financially rational decision of, "Well,
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:48.560]   you're going to earn a higher return here, so maybe that's the path. But I know you disagree.
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:53.440]   And so, I want to make sure a contrarian opinion makes it out here because I love giving people
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:58.600]   both sides to every story." So, what would your response be to a question like that?
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:04.180]   I love investing. I love stocks. I've earned a decent return since I started investing
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:09.600]   in the stock market, but I actually made the decision to pay off my mortgage fully aware
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:14.480]   of the math that goes into it. So, there is a very strong mathematical argument that you
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:18.740]   should never pay off your mortgage. You should leverage it as much as possible, and you should
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:23.020]   take the difference, and you should invest it into the stock market. You'll earn a spread
[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:28.860]   on the return. So, why on earth would I pay off my mortgage if I do believe that? And
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:33.980]   it just, to me, gets back to, what's the whole point of money? Why do we invest in the first
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:38.060]   place? What's the highest use of money? The highest use of money is for us to live the
[00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:44.360]   life we want without my money being a financial factor. So, when I made the decision to do
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:49.620]   so, me and my wife made the decision to do so, what we asked ourselves was, "Does permanently
[00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:56.540]   eliminating our largest fixed monthly cost make our lives better?" Yes, it does! By paying
[00:57:56.540 --> 00:58:02.400]   off my mortgage, my future expense rate is permanently lower, literally, for the rest
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:07.100]   of my life. So, I don't really care that the money would be better spent by putting it
[00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:13.100]   into the market. What I cared about was lowering my fixed monthly costs forever. So, that way,
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:16.820]   the future amount of money that I have to make in any given month, the amount that I
[00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:21.140]   need to live on, is permanently lower. It gets back to what Morgan Housel, I think,
[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:27.180]   said so brilliantly. "My financial goal is to make my finances unbreakable." I want to
[00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:32.320]   make myself immune to the economic cycle. I don't want to have to worry about losing
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:37.340]   my job or my family's life being disrupted at all for financial reasons. That's why I
[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:43.400]   keep a pretty sizable amount of cash out there, and that's why I also have zero debt to myself.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:48.240]   Doing so gives me a level of freedom and allows me to think and act long-term, and really
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:55.320]   helps me to sleep at night. Knowing full well that the mathematics of that decision is unfavorable.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:59:00.240]   I would be richer today if I didn't decide to pay off my mortgage, but I would go back
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.480]   and do the exact same thing in a heartbeat.
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:08.140]   And just for all the credit card nerds listening, a no-debt lifestyle does not mean you don't
[00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:12.560]   use credit cards to earn points and cash back and then pay them off each month, correct?
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:16.860]   Oh, yeah. I love credit card hacking. I'm a big fan of credit cards. I'm just a bigger
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:21.260]   fan of living debt-free. So, like people say that are in the travel hacking world, table
[00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:25.940]   stakes is no credit card debt. Table stakes is paying them off every month. I think there's
[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:30.220]   a way to use credit cards responsibly to earn higher rewards, like promote. So, yes, I also
[00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:31.220]   do that.
[00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:35.340]   I just have to throw it out there because I know there's the Dave Ramsey contingency.
[00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:39.780]   No debt means not even using credit cards. I don't want people to think, "Oh, Brian,
[00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:42.900]   this guy doesn't even believe in credit card points," because I know you play that game
[00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:43.900]   as well.
[00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:48.120]   So, to wrap us up, I want to hear some of your local recommendations for anyone who's
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:52.740]   taking a trip to Rhode Island. Would love to hear favorite meal or someplace people
[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:57.420]   should go check out to eat, a place to meet up, grab a drink with a friend, and an activity
[00:59:57.420 --> 01:00:01.540]   that's not the most obvious thing for anyone to do. And take your time if you want to...
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:05.920]   Yeah. We're blessed in Rhode Island to have Providence, which has tons of great restaurants
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:11.140]   in it, no matter if you're into steak or seafood or sushi or Indian food or that kind of thing.
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:15.960]   But there's a wonderful restaurant downtown called Hemingway's, which is a perennial popular
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:19.940]   pick for seafood. So, I would say that's a great place to get a meal.
[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:24.640]   Great activity to do. Also in Providence, at night over the summer, there's something
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:29.500]   called Water Fire, which is when they take gondolas and on the little river that's downtown,
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:33.980]   they do bonfires in the middle of the river up and down them. And it's right by Rhode
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:38.780]   Island School of Design, so RISD. So, there's all kinds of paintings and sculptures that
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:42.740]   are on display at the time. It's just a really nice way to spend the night, especially if
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:46.300]   it's a nice night out, walking along the river, watching these fires and seeing some kind
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:50.500]   of artsy things on the side of the road. Not something that many people know about Rhode
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.420]   Island. And the last one was a...
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:53.620]   Grab a drink after.
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:57.940]   Like many parts of the world, we have also seen an explosion of breweries in Rhode Island.
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:02.820]   So, Rhode Island is a pretty small state and I think there's like 17 breweries in our state.
[01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:07.260]   One of them that I'll give a shout out to is Tilted Barn Brewery in Exeter, Rhode Island.
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:11.060]   It's just got a wonderful atmosphere and some very tasty beers, if that's your thing.
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:15.740]   Awesome. Thank you so much for joining us on the show. I think in the last few years,
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:20.380]   there's been so much conversation about the craziness of meme stock investing and people
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:24.540]   taking wild risky bets with stock. So, I feel like it was really a breath of fresh air to
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:30.500]   talk about stock investing and what I'll call a more civilized and rational approach than
[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:35.420]   just taking crazy bets. So, thank you so much for being here. Where can people find everything
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:37.660]   you're writing and the content you're creating online?
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:41.700]   Sure. The best place to connect with me is on Twitter. That's where I'm the most active.
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:45.380]   If you're interested in learning how to invest in individual stocks or my checklist, check
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:48.700]   out my YouTube channel, which is just my name, Brian Feraldi on YouTube.
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:50.700]   Awesome. Thank you so much for being here.
[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:52.580]   Chris, thanks so much for having me.
[01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:56.900]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode. Thank you so much for listening. If you haven't
[01:01:56.900 --> 01:02:01.540]   already left a rating and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify, I would
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:05.620]   really appreciate it. And if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me, or
[01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:11.700]   just want to say hi, I'm Chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter. That's it for this
[01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:25.980]   week. I'll see you next week.
[01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:30.540]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money. That
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:34.560]   means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement. It's called
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.420]   The Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building generational wealth and
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:43.460]   spending your money on the things you value than it is about clipping coupons to save
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:44.580]   a dollar.
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:48.540]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this world
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:53.900]   can build wealth and his passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining. I
[01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:58.900]   know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022. But recently I listened to
[01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:04.260]   an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind. And it was so crazy
[01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:09.220]   to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating in their employer's retirement
[01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:14.740]   plan. And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared. The Personal Finance Podcast
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:19.140]   has something for everyone. It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:23.240]   you get better with your money and grow your wealth. So I highly recommend you check it
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:28.340]   out. Just search for The Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever
[01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:30.420]   you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
