[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   You look through history, you either have land reform or you have revolution.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.720]   And it's either either you have a never ending cycle of of transfers of income from the unlanded
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.360]   to the landed.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.940]   And eventually the unlanded will not put up with that.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.680]   There was a real chance in the 19th century, at the end of the 19th century of America
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.040]   going full on socialist or communist.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.760]   And the only thing that saved us was of course, the automobile and the automobile kicked the
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.760]   can down another generation, another couple generations, right.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.800]   And it came at the cost of sprawl.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.900]   And that made everyone feel like we had solved the issue.
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.480]   But the costs of sprawl are enormous in terms of pollution, and poor land use.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.680]   Just look at Houston right now, right?
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.400]   But now we've come at the end of that frontier.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.400]   And now we're at the same question.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.560]   It's you see this resurgent interest in leftism in America.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.240]   And that's not a coincidence, right?
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.920]   Because the rent is too damn high and poor people and young people feel really shoved
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.680]   out of the promise and social contract that was given to their parents.
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.680]   they're jealous of it and they're wondering where it went.
