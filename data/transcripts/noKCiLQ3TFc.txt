[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   Psalm 26 from the Legacy Standard Bible.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:17.640]   Give justice to me, O Yahweh, for I have walked in my integrity, and I have trusted in Yahweh.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.820]   I will not waver.
[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.840]   Test me, O Yahweh, and try me.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.440]   Refine my mind and my heart, for your loving kindness is before my eyes, and I have walked
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.040]   in your truth.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.080]   I do not sit with worthless men, and I will not go with pretenders.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.760]   I hate the assembly of evildoers, and I will not sit with the wicked.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.560]   I shall wash my hands in innocence, so I will go around your altar, O Yahweh, in order to
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.000]   proclaim with the voice of thanksgiving and to recount all your wondrous deeds.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.100]   O Yahweh, I love the habitation of your house and the place where your glory dwells.
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.360]   Do not take my soul away, along with sinners, nor my life with men of bloodshed, in whose
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.840]   hands is a wicked scheme, and whose right hand is full of bribes.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.560]   But as for me, I shall walk in my integrity.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.340]   Redeem me and be gracious to me.
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.560]   My foot stands on level ground in the congregations.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.160]   I shall bless Yahweh.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.880]   Amen.
