[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   So, as we bring these questions to Dr. Street, I think one thing that's important to keep
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:11.140]   in mind is, don't kind of equate what's about to happen with seeing Dr. Phil questioned
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.140]   on television.
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.140]   Please don't.
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.720]   So, we're not going to Dr. Street as some sort of a really narrow specialist, the keeper
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.600]   of all the secrets and try to tap into him before he leaves.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.200]   Yes, he holds incredible biblical wisdom, but the key is it's biblical wisdom.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.680]   So, he's going to bring the truth of the scriptures to bear on these questions.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.080]   And the good news for us is that this is instructive.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.680]   We're benefiting from him as a wise brother, but we don't need an expert in order to grow
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.680]   in Christ's likeness.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.320]   We have the same Bible and the same Holy Spirit.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.240]   So, that's an important principle to keep in mind.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.760]   The other one I want to say is this.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.160]   If we don't get to your question, you wrote a question, I want to say in the best way
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.080]   that I can, some of the questions were very, very good, they were very detailed, but they
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.440]   were also very serious and they really would require, to handle them in an honest and a
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.420]   biblically responsible way, they would require time to sit down and get more information.
[00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.720]   And so, we didn't feel it was wise to try to offer an answer without getting more information.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.800]   So, if you still want to get, if your question, and you'll probably know which ones don't
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.760]   get answered, if your question's in that category, you want to send me an email, we'll work on
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.900]   maybe scheduling a time to sit down and hopefully help you to think biblically through those
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.900]   things.
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.900]   So, let's get kicked off.
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.600]   Dr. Street's going to go through these kind of rapid fire.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.200]   I know he would love, and I would love to spend the rest of the day and night talking
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.680]   about these, but we're only going to get through kind of short answers in order to get through
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.680]   the bullet point.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.280]   Here's the first one.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.600]   In the category of just general biblical counseling, how can I get training, either further training
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.360]   or, as it were, retraining in true biblical counseling?
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.640]   That's a really good question.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.680]   Some of you already saw that we passed around material about that with our graduate program,
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.220]   but not everyone can go and actually get a graduate degree, we understand that.
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.040]   Those that really want to go into it in depth, then would think about getting a good accredited,
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.160]   make sure it's fully accredited graduate degree, in biblical counseling.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.160]   You would need to do that.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.840]   But there are other means as well.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.120]   For example, you heard at the beginning of our conference, I'm a part of ACBC, which
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:35.600]   is the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors, and they offer, ACBC offers, all kinds of
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.680]   training all around the country, several different places around the country, all year long.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.720]   And you can probably go to the ACBC website, which is biblicalcounseling.com, and you just
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.680]   go to that website, and it'll pop up, just put in your region what's the closest training
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.040]   that's going to be near to you.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.640]   This is something that someday in the future, maybe your pastor would like to bring into
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.120]   the church here at some particular point, some training like that, so you can get further
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.240]   training in that to be of help to your church.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.240]   That's really key.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.200]   Again, we want to take good theology and make it practical.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.160]   Not everything that's out there is true biblical counseling.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.560]   You've got to understand that.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.840]   There used to be years ago, people hated the term biblical counseling.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.840]   I talked with a couple of Christian psychologists who laughed at the idea of biblical counseling.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.080]   This was back in the late 1970s, early 1980s.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.240]   They laughed at the concept of biblical counseling.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.360]   Now biblical counseling has won so many people's hearts, now there are a lot of psychology
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.440]   programs that are adopting the terminology.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.640]   Well, it's not true biblical counseling.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.800]   They have to have a very high view of God, high view of the Word of God, high view of
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.560]   its sufficiency, that the Bible is not just sufficient for every spiritual problem that
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.600]   man has, but it's also superior to everything that man offers.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.440]   So you've got to make sure you get into a program like that.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.560]   If you're looking for an undergraduate degree in that, there are several schools that are
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.760]   out there.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.280]   I know like Boyce College has an undergraduate degree.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.080]   It's a very good one in biblical counseling.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.240]   The Masters University has an undergraduate degree in biblical counseling.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.960]   Masters even has an online undergraduate degree because the undergraduate degrees are more
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.720]   dealing with theory than professional practice.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.000]   The graduate degrees are more practice, so there has to be more of a discipleship thing
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.160]   going on there.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.360]   So there are programs out there that are like that scattered around the country if you want
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.160]   to pursue that on a more formal educational basis.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.920]   But there are also wonderful seminars.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.160]   And what usually happens is, usually what happens is people will go into the seminars,
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.720]   take the training, they'll get so excited about it and how it's changed their life and
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.600]   they've been able to help other people, that then they want to go in and get more formal
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.800]   training in it.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.000]   That's usually what happens.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.080]   But start that way.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.520]   It doesn't matter.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:16.240]   Just make sure that they are committed to good biblical counseling standards.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.100]   Go on the website of ACBC.
[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.680]   Go to biblicalcounseling.com, look at the standards of faith and practice.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.680]   Read that through.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.280]   It is the most detailed statement of any organization, any counseling, secular or Christian, in how
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.520]   to deal with counseling issues that's out there, and it's all built upon the Bible.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.920]   When you see people offering programs that are inconsistent with that statement, you
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.440]   know something's wrong with it, all right?
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.800]   So that'll be a standard by which you could use in order to do that.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.800]   Right.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.000]   Now, there's a thousand more things I'm sure he'd like to say about that and I would like
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.480]   to say about biblical counseling in general and the way it sets apart from secular psychology
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.920]   or even what's normally known as Christian counseling, but we won't have time to cover
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.920]   that.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.480]   Hopefully, that's probably the best destination.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.480]   Go to that website.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.480]   You'll get a lot of information.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.360]   In the general counseling category, our second one, a little bit of a change of gear here
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.480]   is how do we deal with past hurts, pains, difficulties, abuse, et cetera, kind of in
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.280]   one big hopper here, one big major question.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.280]   And that is a big one.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.240]   And I could literally spend the next three days just talking about that straight out,
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.240]   all right?
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.080]   So let me see if I can summarize things very, very quickly here and not be too simplistic
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.920]   about it.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.960]   This is a common issue that comes up.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.880]   You've got people that maybe grew up in homes where they were physically or sexually abused.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.200]   People have had bad circumstances that have occurred in life.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:51.520]   If you're here tomorrow, I'm going to describe for you in the message one of the most horrifying,
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:58.400]   difficult people I've ever dealt with when it comes to bad background and bad past.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.560]   I'll talk about that a little bit.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.200]   And finally, her question to me, "Is God punishing me?"
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.940]   And that's the whole point of the message that we have.
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.840]   So I'm going to be addressing that a little bit more tomorrow, but let's say it like this.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:18.040]   If I were to sum up theologically what the Bible says about this, we live in a sinful
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.040]   world.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.120]   We live in an ungodly world.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.960]   I've worked with numerous children who have had terrible things happen to them.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:31.880]   I know that some of the men and women who have mistreated these children are in jail
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.720]   and probably going to be in jail for the rest of their life.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.720]   And rightly so.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:42.440]   Right now, you should rejoice because most of the laws in our country right now are going
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.720]   to prosecute people who do horrible things, especially to children.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.360]   That's not always going to be true.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:55.560]   There are strong forces in our country today who want to make pedophilia a common practice
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:01.760]   and that it's just as legitimate in our culture and society as homosexuality, lesbianism.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.760]   People can't help themselves.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.540]   It's just the way it is, that kind of thing.
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:10.720]   By the way, these robot companies are developing robot children for sex.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.640]   This is a big issue.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.600]   So that's one of those things that's coming down the pike.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:21.320]   We live in a very corrupt society, a very corrupt culture.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.680]   Almost every way we turn.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:29.080]   And in working with the children, it's funny how children can grasp onto this better sometimes
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.640]   than adults can.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:37.240]   When I begin to talk to them about the fact that we live in a sin-cursed culture, that
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:43.960]   you can expect in this culture people to do evil, sinful, ungodly things, and sometimes
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:50.680]   those will happen to you, kids will sit there and say, "Yep, yep, I understand that.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.680]   I got it.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.000]   I understand it."
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.120]   But we, as adults, have a tendency to act like, "Oh my goodness, this is so incredibly
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.120]   unusual.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.120]   You don't understand what's..."
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.120]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.120]   It's not.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.000]   If you really took seriously what the Bible says about man's sinfulness, you wouldn't
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.240]   be asking, "Why does this happen?"
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.240]   That's what the world asks.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.320]   You'd be asking, "Why doesn't this happen more often?"
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.260]   That's what you'd be asking.
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.320]   Now here's the key.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.800]   When you've had something terrible, traumatic that's happened, a part of your past, I can
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.920]   relate to this in several different ways, but I'm not going to get into that right now.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.380]   But if you've had terrible things or traumatic things that have happened that are a part
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:34.600]   of your past, you have a choice moving into the future on whether or not you're going
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:43.040]   to allow the thoughts of that trauma to define you, or whether or not you're going to allow
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.440]   Christ to define you.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.200]   I hope you're listening to me on this.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.080]   I'm saying a lot of stuff in very simple form.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:58.440]   There's a lot more I could be saying with this, but if you're allowing Christ to define
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:05.480]   who you are, then these traumas will not have the grip or the hold on you.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:10.160]   Let me use one illustration if I can, and he's given me permission to do this.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.360]   Back just a few years ago, some of you remember, there were a terrible accident out there in
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:26.680]   California where a passenger train and a cargo train hit head-on, and several people died.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:34.840]   Well, the first police officer on the scene of that accident was a guy in our church,
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:42.960]   and he had horrible nightmares about that for months after that happened.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.520]   He's the first guy on the scene.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.760]   People are screaming, yelling at him.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.200]   People with severed arms, people with severed heads.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:55.000]   It was a horrible thing all over the place, just spread everywhere, and he's running from
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.080]   person to person trying to make a judgment, "Can I save them?
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.960]   If I can't save them," then his training taught him to move to somebody who could save.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.440]   At the same time, the person who he just passed over is yelling and screaming at him that
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:14.600]   he needs help, and those memories haunt him, the yelling and screaming.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:20.280]   We went through a biblical process of dealing with that past trauma and those memories and
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.480]   not allowing that to define his life.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.900]   He's back on the force now.
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:25.900]   He's functioning normally.
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:30.360]   He's had to deal with some pretty bad things since then, but it has not traumatized him,
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.600]   hasn't defined him any longer.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.920]   But if he were sitting here today, he would tell you, you ask him, "What defines your
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:37.920]   life?"
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.880]   He says, "I want to tell you, Jesus Christ defines my life.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.120]   That's what defines me.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.120]   I live for Christ."
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.120]   All right.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.120]   That's about it.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.640]   - Yeah, and that's a huge one.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.640]   - That's huge.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.640]   - We could talk about that in more depth.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:54.040]   If you've got more pointed questions about that, I'd love to talk with you personally.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.160]   That same principle applies across even a broader scope because part of what we're seeing
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:04.040]   in the world today is people finding their identity in the effects of the fall, not God's
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.040]   design.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.240]   So they look at what is really only present in their life.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.240]   It's legitimate.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.240]   - Can I say amen?
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.240]   Let me say amen.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.760]   - Desires that are present, but they're there because of the fall.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.400]   And they're blaming that on God.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.800]   God did this, but no, sin did this.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.860]   And the same thing can be true about sin done to us.
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:25.100]   So whether the sin nature, we try to find identity in that, or sin's done to us.
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.320]   That's a very important topic for us to explore.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.120]   Next category, children.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.120]   Here's an interesting one.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.940]   At what age do you encourage children to move out of the home?
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:41.340]   - Somehow I knew that one was going to come up.
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.600]   All right.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.200]   And let me say this this way.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.940]   Again, we're dealing this in broad generalities at this point.
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:54.500]   There is no particular age that I set on this, because there are people even in our own congregation
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:13:06.540]   that have 30, 32-year-old kids who are quadriplegic and have bad, they were born horribly deformed.
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.060]   So we're not going to encourage them to move out of the home, obviously.
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:16.860]   So we don't put an age on that, but physical and mental capacity has a big role to play
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:23.540]   in this as to do they have the capacity physically and mentally to support themselves.
[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:28.260]   All four of my kids were relatively normal sinners.
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:39.300]   And so as we taught them coming up that they're being raised to leave the home, not stay in
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:45.660]   the home, and to be united with their future spouse, and that their primary commitment
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:51.100]   is not going to be to us but to their spouse, and that doesn't mean that I love my kids
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.820]   any less than you love your kids.
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.380]   I love them just as much as you do.
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:14:00.820]   But I want them to be reasonable, functioning, Christian adults who know how to function
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.540]   in society well on their own.
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.820]   So I'm going to move them out.
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.180]   Our boys, after they graduated from, we have twin boys, they're identical twins.
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:17.540]   They graduated from Master's University, went and got their MDivs at Master's Seminary
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.820]   and their THMs.
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:25.020]   When they were all done with their education, we started charging them rent.
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.020]   All right?
[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.340]   And it was great.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.340]   That's the money I used.
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.700]   My wife and I go out to eat for dinner.
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:33.700]   It was phenomenal.
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.700]   All right?
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:39.500]   So we start charging rent, and the longer they were in the house, the higher the rent
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.500]   went.
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.500]   All right?
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.500]   Type of thing.
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.500]   Now both of them end up moving out.
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.580]   One ended up getting married.
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.260]   The other one took an associate pastor of a church.
[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:55.860]   Now he had to back out of his associate pastor because he took a youth group up in the mountains
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:01.780]   and he got a horrible tick bite that got, he got Rocky Mountain spotted fever and two
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:02.780]   other things.
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:08.060]   He had to have a shunt put in and they had to destroy his immune system, re-release his
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.540]   immune system out again.
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:14.020]   So we moved him back in to help him during that time, but he knows he's on his way back
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.020]   out again.
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:16.020]   All right?
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:22.060]   But there are exceptions to that particular rule like I just gave you.
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:30.980]   Mom and dad is there as a safety net, but they're not there to stay with.
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.060]   Their purpose as mom and dad is to send them out.
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:41.380]   So if they're mentally and physically capable of supporting themselves, guys or girls, all
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.460]   right, then they need to go.
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:51.220]   Now there is a tendency to, for the Christian, to be more protective of the ladies, which
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.220]   is good.
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:57.620]   There's nothing wrong with that, but you have to even be careful about that, you know, because
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:02.980]   at some particular point they need to get out and function on their own, support themselves
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:08.380]   or get married and have a spouse support them, whatever the case may be.
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:12.420]   All right, next category, we'll go through these kind of rapid, these three, they're
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.420]   somewhat close.
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.220]   On the young couples, not married yet category.
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.500]   So number one, what do you say to couples who are living together prior to marriage?
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:25.380]   And that's kind of the conglomeration of a couple of really nuanced questions.
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.660]   Stop it.
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:29.660]   That's what needs to happen.
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.620]   I mean, they're living openly in sin.
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:37.380]   They're just living in open sin, and I know that's the common practice out in the world.
[00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:42.020]   I know that that's common practice out in the world, but we're supposed to be different.
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:49.060]   We're categorically different as Christians, and we don't adopt ourselves to the world's
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.060]   practices.
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.740]   We don't do that.
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:56.540]   This is not one of those things where we're going to try one another on, see if the size
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.540]   fits, and then if it doesn't fit, then we're going to move on to somebody else.
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.820]   This is not one of those things.
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:09.420]   This is one of those things where, like Adam, who swore his allegiance to Eve, bone of bones,
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:15.060]   flesh of flesh, where they swear themselves to one another, otherwise they don't enjoy
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:19.300]   the benefits of marriage, which includes the sexual relationship or anything else that
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.300]   goes on in there.
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:28.180]   They need to stop doing that, repent of that, ask each other for forgiveness.
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:33.260]   That's really, in counseling, we have them do that.
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.580]   The guy's got to go and ask the gal for forgiveness.
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.580]   Why?
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:43.180]   Because he's used her body for his own self-gratification, and her body doesn't belong to him.
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:46.180]   She's used his body for self-gratification.
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.460]   His body does not belong to her.
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:54.700]   It's not until you're married in a monogamous heterosexual relationship does each other's
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.920]   body belong to each other.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:05.940]   So they're defrauding each other by doing this, by living in a sexual relationship prior
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.460]   to marriage.
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.920]   This is really key for their welfare.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:16.220]   I mean, when you start doing that kind of thing, then how do you know, even after you're
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:21.660]   married, that your spouse is going to maintain discipline of that marriage?
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:22.660]   You don't know.
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.900]   They may go off and sleep with somebody else, because they're willing to do that prior to
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:27.900]   your marriage.
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.540]   They're willing to use you in the same way, and you are too.
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.740]   There's no integrity anymore to marriage.
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.660]   No, no, no.
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:40.620]   Boy, if anything, we may be old codgers, but we're trying to get people back to genuine
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.340]   integrity in relationships.
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:48.340]   And that's what the Bible teaches, and we're not going to stop proclaiming that.
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:53.540]   [Nic] I would say amen to that, by the way, and that definitely sounds very counter to
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:58.900]   the culture around us, and it should, because that reflects a biblical view of marriage.
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.820]   It's benefits minus commitment.
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:06.300]   And biblically speaking, marriage is built upon covenant and commitment, and this is
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.460]   critical in our age.
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:12.180]   And I hear, to be totally honest, I hear a lot of Christians work really hard to justify
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.540]   that practice, but they're unable to do that biblically.
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.060]   And we want to think biblically.
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.180]   If you're sitting and go, "Wow, we're really taking the Bible seriously here."
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.740]   Let me just add to that a giant head nod.
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.460]   Absolutely, in every realm, we're trying to.
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:31.620]   Now close to that, talking about the parents of maybe a young couple, unmarried, living
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:37.460]   together, coming to visit mom and dad on either side, what's mom and dad do as Christians
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.380]   when they want to come and stay in the same room?
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.660]   You guys on the same page with that question?
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.660]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.660]   Yeah.
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.660]   No, can't let that happen.
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:47.620]   I know you want to express love to them, but you're going to need to set up some kind of
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:53.140]   arrangement even if mom's got to sleep with the gal and dad's got to sleep with the guy.
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:58.500]   I don't care how that, you got to set up separate arrangements for that to happen, because you
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:03.300]   can't allow, let's assume at this particular point that you've got a young couple who's
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.940]   not committed to Christ, they're not interested in following Christ, but they want to come
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.640]   and stay at your house.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.300]   You're not going to cave your principles for their ungodliness.
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.900]   You're not going to do that.
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.720]   You can express love to them in many other ways, but you're not going to do that.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.660]   If they're going to do that outside of your home, you can have no control over that, then
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:24.660]   they're going to do that.
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:28.940]   And by the way, they will suffer the way the transgressor is hard.
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.860]   They will suffer for that down the line.
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.340]   Adversity will pursue sinners.
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:37.620]   Spurgeon used to say, "God releases the hounds of heaven and they start nipping at those
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.520]   people's hills."
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.060]   That's what happens.
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:48.500]   Difficulty awaits them in the future, but you're not going to let them defile your home.
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.980]   When I have people in counseling, and they come in, and they're really upset at each
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:57.260]   other, husband and wife relationship, and they start saying all kinds of wicked things,
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.860]   I say, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop."
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:03.060]   And by the way, that's the greatest word in counseling, "Whoa," all right?
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.740]   It's the greatest word in counseling, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop,
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:07.740]   stop, stop, stop."
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:13.100]   I'm not going to let you sit here and sin all over my office, all right?
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.100]   This is my office.
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.540]   You're not going to sin all over my office.
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:20.580]   Well, you're not going to let this young couple come in and sin all over your home.
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.140]   Or let's say it's not even a young couple.
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:30.700]   Let's say it's your son, who's not following Christ, has a boyfriend that he claims is
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:31.700]   his boyfriend.
[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:36.620]   You're not going to let them come in either and do that either.
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.260]   And have sex with each other in your home.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.780]   You're not going to let them sin all over your home.
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:42.780]   That's not right.
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:46.220]   You can still find other ways to express love to them and care for them.
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:51.780]   All of that is really critical, but you're not going to cave to their ungodliness.
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:56.540]   We have too many Christians willing to do this, and the world doesn't take us serious
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:57.540]   anymore.
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:01.100]   They say, "You act no different than we do.
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.460]   You're no different.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:07.940]   There's nothing qualitative or quantitatively different in your life than my life."
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:12.540]   And boy, that is not biblical Christianity at all.
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:22.460]   We've got to be radically different than the world, different in a Christ-like way.
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:25.940]   That's what we're talking about, different in a Christ-like way.
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:32.940]   All right, now someone really in the category of young couples not yet married, how do we
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:38.460]   help young men and women who are unmarried but who want to become married?
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.980]   Oh, boy.
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:41.980]   That's a great question.
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:48.500]   I have a son that's that way right now, so I'm trying to give him as much help as possible.
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:23:08.780]   All right, let's go to 1 Corinthians, or no, excuse me, 1 Thessalonians, chapter 4, and
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:15.820]   this is really critical, I think, in helping young men and young women.
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:21.500]   Verse 3 says, "For this is the will of God, your sanctification, that is, you abstain
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:30.740]   from sexual immorality," that's pretty straightforward, "that each one of you know how to control
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:36.680]   his own body," it says, "in holiness and honor."
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:43.140]   Now you see, if you have the English Standard Version, that is footnoted, and if you have
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:48.860]   the New American Standard Version, translation of the Bible, that's footnoted as well, and
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:58.060]   if you go to the footnote, it says down there how to take a wife for himself, or some say
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:01.100]   how to possess his own vessel.
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.860]   That's literally what the Greek says.
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:08.020]   The Greek says how to acquire your own vessel.
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:14.940]   The word "acquire" is a very deliberate business word, and it's never used in the sense of
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:20.060]   acquiring your own body.
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:24.380]   That would be the only time in the entire Greek language or the Bible where that particular
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:29.680]   word is used in controlling your body, and yet some translators do that.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:35.420]   I just read that in the English translation, but it's a very deliberate business word to
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:40.760]   go out and acquire something, to get something, is the idea.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:46.340]   Literally to acquire your own vessel, and the word "vessel" can refer to your body,
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:57.600]   but as in 1 Peter 3 and verse 7, the same word "vessel" refers to a wife.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:03.620]   Now the most literal sense of this is this, now follow me here, "that each one of you
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:12.820]   know how to acquire his own wife in holiness and honor, not in the passion of lust like
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.420]   the Gentiles who do not know God."
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:21.020]   Now that makes a lot of sense to me, because you're picking a wife not on the basis of
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:27.860]   sex appeal, that's not the primary criteria by which Christians pick a wife.
[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:37.700]   Christians pick a wife, or in this case, a wife picks a husband on the basis of holiness
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.320]   and honor.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.320]   What is that?
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:46.180]   Well, it means simply this, that in your relationship together, after you have been together, are
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:50.820]   the two of you more holy?
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:55.740]   Or is your relationship together an honorable relationship?
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:00.900]   When people look at that relationship and say, "I want to emulate that," that is an
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:09.280]   honorable relationship, that's the criteria by which you pick a spouse, is in holiness
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:14.020]   and honor, not on the basis of sex appeal.
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:17.980]   Now, I'm not saying that you marry somebody you're not attracted to, and that's not what
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.460]   the Bible is saying.
[00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:24.380]   It's saying that sex appeal is not the primary criteria.
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:28.340]   The criteria is holiness and honor.
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.340]   This is sanctification.
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:34.700]   Then you go on and it says that no one transgress and wrong his brother.
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:42.460]   The brother in this case is the woman's father in this manner, because the Lord is an avenger
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:48.100]   in all these things, as we are told beforehand and solemnly warn you, for God has not called
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.660]   us for impurity, but to holiness.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:56.620]   In other words, if you marry a woman, according to what Paul says, on the basis of sex appeal,
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:03.420]   you've defrauded her father, because you've pretended to marry her, to provide for her,
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:12.300]   to protect her, but you're really marrying her to use her, and that's defrauding him.
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.340]   That's defrauding him.
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.860]   You don't want to defraud her father.
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:17.860]   You don't want to do that.
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:26.280]   You want to marry those in holiness and in honor.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:31.900]   What does your relationship mean, greater holiness for both of you?
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:38.880]   Does your relationship mean greater honor for both of you and honor especially for Christ?
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:44.060]   If that's true, that's the person to marry.
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:49.340]   Let me add a wrinkle to this that's not on the forum, that I think will be on maybe some
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.900]   people's minds.
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:57.660]   What role, and I know there's a lot of variance depending on the age of the grown children,
[00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:02.860]   what role do the godly parents play in encouraging the child through that process?
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:07.580]   Well, I think teaching them what Scripture says.
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:08.580]   That's important.
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:09.580]   That's the beginning.
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:15.820]   Teaching them how to make that decision in an honorable way, in a godly way.
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:25.140]   Let me say this, that parents have a wisdom, even if they're unbelievers, that sometimes
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:29.600]   younger people do not have, and I'm going to use my mother as an example of this.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.560]   She just passed away a couple months ago.
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:40.240]   She lived with us, but many, many, many years ago when she was going to Baptist Bible Institute
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.680]   in Cleveland, Ohio, she ran into a young man there.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:50.120]   They started dating regularly, and he became very interested in her, and so she took him
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:54.180]   home one weekend to meet my grandfather and my grandmother.
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.720]   My grandmother was a Christian.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:56.720]   My grandfather was not.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:01.280]   In fact, he was a professional photographer, and he was a horrible drunk.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:05.400]   Later on, God saved him and took away all that alcohol, praise God.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:10.700]   But at that particular time, my grandfather was not a godly man at all.
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:16.520]   After the weekend was over, the guy went back to the Bible Institute, and this guy was preparing
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:26.040]   to go into mission work, and my grandfather said to my mother, "I don't think you should
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.880]   be dating that guy."
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:34.800]   And she kind of wondered about that, asked her father a lot of questions, and was tempted
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.600]   to think, "Well, my father is not a Christian.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.840]   He doesn't like Christians, so he doesn't like this guy.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.160]   That's the idea."
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.520]   And that wasn't the issue at all.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.280]   It's just he said, "There's something different about that guy."
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.280]   Nothing.
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.700]   Well, that was really hard for her.
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.440]   She struggled with that a little bit, but she said, "Okay.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.440]   You know what?
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.440]   I'll honor my father."
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.480]   She went back, broke up with the guy.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.840]   Six months later, that guy was dating another gal, was engaged to her, and they got married.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.560]   A year later, they went off to the mission field.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:07.520]   They were on the mission field for about two years, and the mission society had to bring
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:11.720]   them both home because he was beating his wife senseless.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:20.000]   Now, my grandfather, as an ungodly man, picked up on that in that guy, all right?
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.880]   So there's a wisdom there that even ungodly people have.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:28.840]   It's the wisdom of the world, but not all of it's always bad that's there.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:34.640]   So paying close attention to what parents have to say is really a key thing.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.520]   And by the way, not long after that, my mother met my father.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:41.560]   That's why I'm here, okay?
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:47.160]   And my father ended up being a pastor and was a very faithful man for many, many years.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:56.080]   He died in 1985, got really bad leukemia, but I think that parents need to give as much
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:07.120]   input as possible to their son or their daughter about who they're marrying and realize, and
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:11.520]   help them to realize that when they get married, they're not marrying somebody who's perfect.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:17.480]   They're marrying somebody with lots of flaws, and usually in dating, you don't see them.
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:23.000]   They don't let you see them, all right?
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   - There's a lot we could add to that.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.800]   You know, a very common statement is, you know, someone would say, "This isn't the person
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.800]   that I dated."
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:36.680]   And the common response been said many times is, "No, the person you dated doesn't exist.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.560]   The person you married is all there is.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.000]   There's nothing else.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   There is no other thing."
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   - That's right.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   That's right.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   - And so it's an important...
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.080]   There's a lot more I'd love to say about that, and maybe in another forum we can, but that's
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.080]   very helpful.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.280]   Okay, next section.
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:54.800]   This one was also very popular, in-laws.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.560]   - Otherwise known as outlaws.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:01.200]   - Should couples, and I'm assuming married couples, should married couples live with
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.200]   their in-laws?
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:14.280]   - All right, first of all, there's no easy yes or no to that question because, for example,
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:19.480]   I just told you that my mother lived with us in her remaining years.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:23.120]   She ended up remarrying after my father passed away, the wonderful godly man.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.960]   He later on died of colon cancer.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.600]   And then she lived with us for about five years.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.720]   We had a separate mother-in-law's apartment that was a part of our house.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.200]   Now we rented out the seminary guys.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:38.640]   I've got a guy in there right now, he's going to get married in December, so he's in grandma's
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.320]   apartment there.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.520]   So because I felt, as the oldest in the family, it was my responsibility to take care of my
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.840]   mom, and my wife was full agreement.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:53.800]   In fact, my wife got along with my mom better than she got along with her mother, all right,
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:54.920]   which is really something.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:58.760]   And they just got along famously together and worked together on so many things.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:06.400]   My mother had polycystic kidneys and so taking her back and forth to kidney dialysis was
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.640]   a regular routine that my wife was used to.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:14.560]   So there are times where living with your in-laws is a necessity to be of help to them,
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.760]   to minister to them, those kind of things.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:23.840]   Generally, when that's not involved, it's not the best thing.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:29.680]   Now, it's not wrong, it's not sinful, if your in-laws live with you, maybe it's financial
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.120]   necessity, those kind of things.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.880]   Sometimes it makes it difficult.
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:39.280]   But oftentimes in counseling situations like that, it's not so much the living in that's
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:44.720]   the real problem, it's the way people treat one another.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.720]   That's the issue.
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:53.200]   And if you have a mother-in-law or a father-in-law that doesn't treat you well, or kind of favors
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:34:01.320]   their son or daughter in situations like that, that's going to make life very hard.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:05.700]   And a husband has got to see that.
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:10.640]   He's got to be able to step in there and side always with his wife, and the wife must always
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:21.280]   side with her husband because the Bible is very clear, we're supposed to leave and cleave.
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:25.640]   The husband's not going to side with his parents, the wife's not going to side with her parents,
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:28.780]   no, no, they're going to side with each other.
[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:33.800]   And there's going to be an absolute unified front presented before mom and dad.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.400]   That's what has to happen.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:41.280]   Otherwise, I know that there are some, and I know different cultures have this problem,
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:47.560]   there's a lot of matriarchal type of relationships that go where grandma intends to be the queen
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:51.400]   of the castle type of thing, and that becomes a serious problem.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.400]   She's not.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.280]   The wife is.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.280]   Grandma's not.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.800]   She may be living there, but she's not the queen of the castle.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.640]   That violates biblical standards.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:04.360]   That may be cultural, but it's not biblical.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:08.320]   And my mother was not the queen of the castle in our home.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:13.760]   My wife was, and my mother knew it, and my mother was happy with that.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:19.240]   My wife came before my mother, okay?
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.440]   That's really important, and everybody in the home knew that.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:27.040]   If you were to ask any of them and interview them, they'd tell you that in a heartbeat.
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:32.760]   But if you have a situation where that's not true, and you've got a husband that's siding
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:39.400]   with his mother, or a wife siding with her mother or her father, now you've got problems.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:43.280]   Because they're not following exactly what we saw in Genesis 2:24, they're not leaving
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.280]   and cleaving.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:49.800]   Instead, they're still holding on, and that's got to change.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:50.800]   Amen.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.160]   That's a big category.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:58.160]   I think you actually hit the second question with that first answer, so that works out
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.160]   pretty well.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:02.960]   Next category, women and careers.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:09.080]   First one here, how do I make my husband a priority when I have a career in the sense
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.000]   of juggling that with children and everything?
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.320]   It's not wrong for a woman to have a career.
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:20.800]   Obviously, the Proverbs 31 woman was busy outside of her home and had her own businesses.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.680]   That's pretty obvious, not wrong.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:31.680]   However, it is wrong for a woman to make her career over dictate what goes on in terms
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:35.560]   of the home, what goes on in terms of her husband or her children.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:41.120]   If her career is more important than her husband, and this shows up in the fine details of life,
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:45.800]   more important than her children, then she's got a major problem going on.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:51.920]   Or if her career is somehow dictating what goes on, where they live, what's really happening,
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:52.920]   no.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:59.640]   In fact, and I know some husbands want their wives to work because usually in counseling,
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:03.840]   I'm able to lay out their finances and show the only reason he wants her to work is because
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.240]   she buys all of his toys, all right?
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:16.160]   She's the one with her salary that buys his boat and his vacation condo and his stereo
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:27.420]   equipment and his sports car, and no, instead of him providing for her, she's the one that's
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:28.720]   really providing for him.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.960]   So the shoe's on the other foot.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.320]   That's not the way it should be.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.480]   1 Timothy chapter 5 is very clear.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:42.400]   When a man does not provide for his own household, he is worse than an unbeliever.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:50.520]   Now I can't imagine what is worse than an unbeliever, but it's that guy.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.800]   God created a man to provide for his own house.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.720]   You say, "Well, we'll have a lot less money if my wife doesn't work."
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.480]   Well, so what?
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:03.680]   Maybe you'll have a happier home.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:13.040]   So this is really such a key thing that she was created, as we saw a little bit earlier,
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.720]   to be his helpmate.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.360]   He was not created to be her helpmate.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.320]   That was not the way creation was designed.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:28.200]   He has got to take leadership in this, and he's got to stop being lazy and pick up the
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:32.960]   mantle and make enough money for both of them to subsist on, along with the kids.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.560]   That's what he's got to do.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.400]   So this is very important.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.960]   I know, again, this is counter-cultural.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:42.960]   I know that.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:43.960]   I know.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:44.960]   I know.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:48.000]   You can pull out your guns and shoot me now.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.600]   But the Bible's very clear on this.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:39:12.880]   This is not…Titus 3 talks about women should be busy at home, busy at home.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.280]   This is such a key thing.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.280]   And that's it.
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:20.400]   Now, the Bible's not saying if you work outside their home, it's wrong.
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.640]   It's not saying that.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:29.160]   But that her primary responsibility is her husband, is those children, is that home,
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.260]   that is her primary.
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:34.920]   Her career is not her primary responsibility.
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.920]   That's such a key thing.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:42.420]   Now, as that works out, I want you to hear something, too, husbands, as you're listening
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:43.680]   to that.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:47.520]   So the husband that comes home, and the Lord's been teaching me this, and I've been learning
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:48.800]   and trying to grow in this over the years.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.040]   If you come home, and your wife's been at work all day long, and there's kids in the
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.920]   home, or maybe if there's not kids, there's just priorities and things that have to be
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.000]   done in the home.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.520]   If you come home, even after the longest day you've ever had, sit down, get in your chair
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:04.400]   and say, "Man, I have had the worst day.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.440]   I'm just going to do nothing.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.520]   I need you to do everything."
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:09.520]   That's not going to…
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:15.240]   Not only it's not going to go over well, you're also putting her in a position of temptation.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:22.040]   You're tempting her to choke you when you sleep first, but you're tempting her to sin,
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.920]   because you're failing to meet your responsibilities.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.240]   [Steve Myers] Of being a doulos and a diakonos, that's right.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.120]   [Darris McNeely] To be a servant in the home.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:32.800]   So someone has said, many times have been said, that your job does not end when you
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.560]   leave work and come home.
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.560]   You still have work to do.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:41.240]   If there's kids in the home, then your work ends when the kids go to bed, and when you
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:45.160]   have taken care of anything that needs to be taken care of in support of your wife.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:49.520]   So I don't want you to hear this on a one-sided way and walk away, "Oh, man, so I'm a woman,
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:53.320]   I have a job, and now I've got to do everything in the house too, and take care of the kids
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.320]   too."
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:59.960]   No, no, there still is a level of a partnership here, and the husband has to respect that,
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:04.520]   and that has to be central in his mind and his thinking.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:14.020]   So closely related to this, very closely, can I have a calling at work as a woman?
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:18.760]   And we think that this question has the idea of, in the sense that God's maybe called me,
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:22.840]   and in my case, I'm a little different, God's called me to a special thing that would maybe
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.800]   supersede these other responsibilities.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:30.040]   [Steve Myers] Yeah, if that's what is meant, just the way that Pastor Mark here has just
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.940]   described it, then the answer is no.
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:38.400]   There is no special calling that's talked about in Scripture in regards to that.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:45.780]   There is a calling in relationship to full-time Christian ministry or work in that sense,
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:51.300]   but she may have a career and be well-accomplished in a career.
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:42:02.740]   We just had a gal go through our MABC program who has, she had two master's degrees and
[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:12.420]   a PhD in psychology and actually taught psychology to med students at UCLA, and she and her husband
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.260]   got into serious marital problems.
[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:18.820]   She got counseling from one of the guys that, she and her husband got counseling from one
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:21.740]   of the guys that graduated from our program.
[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:30.300]   Here's a gal with a master's in marriage and family and another master's degree and a PhD
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:37.100]   and having massive problems at home, and she had this all messed up, and the counselor
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:42.940]   was able to help him iron these things out, get these things, and she finally said, "Where
[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:43.940]   did you get this stuff?"
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:46.460]   He says, "Well, I got it from the Bible."
[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:47.460]   "No, no, no.
[00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:48.460]   Where were you trained to do this?"
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:50.020]   She said, "Well, master's university."
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:53.740]   "Do you suppose they let me go through that program?"
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:57.260]   Well, she has now gone through the program.
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:59.860]   She's going to be graduating this next year.
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.500]   This is her third master's degree.
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:08.460]   She's got more degrees than a thermometer, all right, her third master's degree.
[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:14.140]   But she is, she's a very sweet gal, but she realized that all of her priorities were all
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:15.140]   messed up.
[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:16.780]   That's the reason why she was struggling so much with depression.
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:19.260]   That's the reason why things were falling apart at home.
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.900]   That's the reason why things were messed up in her marriage.
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:24.600]   All of those things were, all of our priorities were really askew.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:32.060]   When she finally got her priorities straight biblically, joy came back to her life.
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:36.180]   And if you meet her husband, he's one of the happiest guys on the planet.
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:40.980]   Wow, he's got a completely different wife now.
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:44.500]   And here she's got all these degrees and stuff.
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:49.660]   But she had to get those things straightened out in her life, come into line biblically.
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:53.640]   That's what had to happen.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.500]   That's such a key thing.
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.600]   Can they have a calling in the way that a pastor has a calling?
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.020]   I don't think so.
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:02.220]   I don't think that that's a biblical concept.
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:06.300]   It's kind of a mystical thing.
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:10.080]   But can they have a career that they're well-trained in?
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.520]   Sure, absolutely.
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.520]   That's really true.
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:15.840]   And sometimes they can use their career in a good and godly way.
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.920]   Sometimes they use their career in Christian service.
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:23.200]   Sometimes they use their career to benefit their home and their family, but their home
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.240]   and their husband always comes first.
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.480]   That's always the priority.
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:29.480]   That's what has to be there.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:35.160]   All right, just two more questions, two more categories, and we'll wrap up.
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.240]   Christians and non-Christians in marriage together.
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:40.880]   So one Christian married to a non-Christian.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.360]   This question is kind of simple.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.960]   Actually, it's bringing together a few questions.
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:49.800]   What are some basic principles that apply in this case?
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:53.600]   If you have that type of situation going on in your life, one of the things that you need
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:57.840]   to do, you've got to be intimately familiar with 1 Peter.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:00.840]   I talked about that and hinted at this earlier.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:05.200]   If you're a woman married to an unbelieving husband, then 1 Peter 3, 1 through 6 becomes
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.200]   your marching orders.
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:10.200]   But you're not going to fully understand what's going on there until you understand the surrounding
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.860]   context of what's being said there.
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:13.880]   So you've got to understand that.
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:17.360]   If you're a Christian husband married to an unbelieving wife, then you've got to understand
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:24.040]   1 Peter 3, 7, and you've got to live that out on a daily basis, every single day in
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.040]   your life.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:28.600]   You've got to understand, flush that all out every day.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.200]   Now there are some general principles.
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:35.720]   If you want to grab your Bible just for a moment, right after Peter talks about that
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:47.640]   1 Peter 3, he talks about, he kind of sums up things there in verse 8.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:55.040]   He says finally, all of you, that is, he's talking to all the Christians, have unity
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:46:04.360]   of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, tenderhearted, humble mind, do not repay evil for evil.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.920]   This is verse 8 and 9 here.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:13.760]   Or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you are called that you
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.280]   may obtain a blessing.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:21.080]   Now if you use this to sum up everything he said to unbelievers, this goes back into chapter
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:33.160]   10 where he's talking about Christian slaves who are at the mercy of masters who are unbelievers
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:42.280]   and they're harsh and ungodly, and then Christian wives married to harsh ungodly husbands, Christian
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:49.240]   husbands married to harsh ungodly wives, then the things they need to focus on is this unity
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:54.240]   of mind with other Christians, sympathy, brotherly love, tenderhearted, humble mind, not repaying
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:47:01.120]   evil for evil, reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you are
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:03.920]   called that you may obtain a blessing.
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:11.200]   Now he says this, and then he says in verse 10, "For whoever desires to love life and
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:14.920]   see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil."
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:21.200]   It's easy when you're living close to an unbelieving spouse to give in to the evil and to say wicked
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:24.120]   things and his lips from speaking deceit.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.880]   Verse 11, "Let him turn away from evil and do good.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:30.480]   Let him seek peace and pursue it, for the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:36.280]   his ears are open to their prayer, for the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.120]   So we have to concentrate on doing good.
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:43.740]   Then he says in verse 13, here's a general principle, "Now, who is there to harm you
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:46.000]   if you are as zealous for what is good?"
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.720]   And that's a great principle.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:52.800]   And that's a general principle that works predominantly throughout most of life.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:56.640]   If you do good to people, generally they're going to do good back to you.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:00.520]   If you have an unbelieving spouse and you do good to them, generally they're going to
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.880]   do good back to you.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.400]   Generally that's going to happen, all right?
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:08.100]   But then there's exceptions to the rule.
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:15.040]   But verse 14, here's the exception, "But if you should suffer for righteousness," in other
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:19.400]   words, you're doing good and you're still suffering, "for righteousness' sake, you will
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:20.400]   be blessed.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.320]   Have no fear of them, nor be troubled."
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:28.880]   In other words, God ingratiates himself to a person who's suffering for righteousness'
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:29.880]   sakes.
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:35.680]   Verse 15, "But in your hearts, honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:39.920]   make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you, yet
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:43.280]   to do it with gentleness and respect."
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:48.480]   In other words, if you continue to live out righteousness in front of an ungodly spouse,
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:57.120]   eventually they're going to say to you, "How are you able to do that?
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.120]   How come you keep doing it?
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:04.080]   I keep doing all these things to you and you just respond so godly.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:06.040]   How do you do that?"
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:09.520]   Then you need to be ready, he says, to give an answer.
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.700]   And you need to say, "You know what?
[00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:13.760]   It is not me.
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:16.280]   It is Christ working through me.
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.080]   It is Jesus Christ.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:21.480]   He paid my entire debt of sin.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:24.580]   I owe him my life.
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:29.760]   What I go through and what you do to me, it counts as nothing compared to the suffering
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:36.280]   that Christ went through when he died for my sin, and that's why I do what I do."
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:43.240]   Always be ready to give an account to him who asks you about the faith within you.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.560]   Always be ready to do that.
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:52.360]   You become God's missionary to that ungodly husband, that ungodly wife.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:56.180]   You are God's appointed missionary to them.
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:50:04.000]   No one else can be a better missionary than you can because you know them inside and out.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:10.160]   You have to live out righteousness, godliness, not give in to your temper or your anger or
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:17.360]   your hate, remembering that Jesus Christ died for those sins, and you are going to live
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:20.680]   out Christ all you can in front of them.
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:27.840]   Well, I hope that was a really detailed and hopefully helpful answer to those of you that
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:29.960]   are in that situation.
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:34.360]   Of course, as Christians, we wouldn't knowingly enter into a marriage relationship that way,
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:35.360]   right?
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:39.520]   As a pastor, I've seen many times, I'm sure Dr. Street has seen this as well, I've seen
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:45.240]   it in circumstances where a person really wanted to marry someone else, all of a sudden
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:50.120]   their understanding, biblical standard for what a Christian is, begins to change and
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:56.320]   it becomes exactly what this potential spouse is.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:01.000]   And then something happens after they finally get their catch and they get married.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.800]   That person is revealed for who they are.
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:03.840]   They never were a Christian.
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:04.840]   They have no interest in Christ.
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:07.920]   They had an interest in a person who had interest in Christ.
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:12.520]   And so they were as interested in Christ as they needed to be to mirror the interest of
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.200]   that person.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:17.640]   And I'll tell you, I have seen more and more marriages, I'm sure you could speak to this
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:26.920]   as well, that have suffered because they took the wrong first step, didn't apply these principles,
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:28.160]   and now we're in this spot.
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:32.280]   So if you're there, there's hope for you and there's some clear guidance here.
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:35.120]   But we would love to encourage you, if you're a young adult here, not yet married, or if
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:39.520]   you're someone who's now pursuing marriage, I would really, really, really challenge you
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:46.240]   and encourage you to get good biblical counseling, premarital counseling, which we offer here,
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:53.320]   but to really, really carefully consider this particular aspect of what would be your marriage
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.800]   as long as you're alive on this earth.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.240]   I'm going to speak one last thing to that before we close or not.
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:58.400]   Would you like to?
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.400]   Sure.
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:00.400]   Fire away.
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.400]   Oh, I thought you were going to ask the last question, that's what you meant by that.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:04.400]   Well, no.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.400]   I just want to speak to that.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.400]   We answered that question.
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:07.400]   Yeah, we did.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:08.400]   You nailed that in the last one.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.400]   Okay, good.
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:10.400]   Good.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:17.480]   So any concluding parting words then before we go?
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:23.080]   I hope as a result of this particular weekend, you have a higher view of marriage than you
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:26.960]   did when you came in.
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:31.360]   I know, and I have counseled so many people, even people who have been divorced going into
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:35.880]   their second marriage, they always think that they have a high view of marriage, but when
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:40.000]   we get done with taking a look what the Bible has to say about it, all of a sudden they're
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:46.200]   overwhelmed by, "Oh my goodness, this is a much higher view than I ever thought marriage
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.200]   to be.
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:54.400]   It is an incredibly honorable institution, but we treat it so dishonorably."
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:59.080]   And like I said at the very beginning, marriage is not in trouble.
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:01.800]   Marriage is just fine, the way God designed it.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:04.800]   It's just exactly the way God intended it to be.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:09.280]   It's the people who are in marriage that's in trouble.
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.280]   That's the problem.
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:12.480]   The institution's fine.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:17.320]   The culture wants to destroy it, they'll never destroy it, because God created it.
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:19.280]   You can't destroy something God created.
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.280]   They can't.
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:23.840]   They'll try to redefine it, they can't.
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:27.800]   It's going to go on until the end of time.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:36.280]   But it is a very honorable institution, and I hope that this encourages you to treat it
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:37.280]   that way.
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:41.080]   So gentlemen, you're going to impress your wives with three things you've got to remember
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:43.560]   in order to be a godly husband.
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:48.000]   So in order to be a godly husband, number one, gentlemen?
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   Yes.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   Uh-huh.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   Amen.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.640]   I'm going to have a charismatic revival right here.
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:59.640]   That sounds so good, all right.
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:06.320]   All right, ladies, you're going to put a smile on your husband's face by the three things
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:08.800]   you've got to remember in order to be a godly wife.
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:09.800]   Are you ready?
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:10.800]   They all start with S, remember.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:16.840]   Uh-huh.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.840]   There we go.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:22.400]   Submission, suitable helper, and selflessly reverent, very good.
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:26.240]   First of all, every one of you, looking this way, four things you've got to remember in
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:33.160]   terms of godly communication in the home, Ephesians chapter 4, verses 25 through 32.
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:34.600]   Number one, be?
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:35.600]   Keep.
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:36.600]   Attack.
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:37.600]   Act.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:46.040]   Oh my goodness, God's going to do some great things here, pastor.
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:48.960]   Why don't you show your appreciation one last time for Dr. Street?
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:52.120]   (audience applauding)
