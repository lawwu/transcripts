[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.840]   Completing our consideration of the section of Paul's epistle to the Romans, which runs
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.280]   from the middle of the seventh verse of the first chapter to the end of the fifteenth
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.600]   verse, I want in particular tonight to call your attention to the fourteenth verse. The
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.000]   fourteenth verse in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans. "I am debtor both
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.560]   to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise." We've seen
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.360]   that the apostle in this section does two main things. One is he says certain things
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.400]   about the Christians in Rome, and secondly he says certain things about himself. And
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.000]   we've considered the various things which he has been saying about himself, and we have
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.120]   come to the main thing, in a sense, the thing which he emphasizes most of all, which was
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.800]   his service, his life of service, and especially his view of it. And we've seen that he says
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.920]   a number of things about it. He describes it in general as the service of God. He tells
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:25.160]   us the spirit in which he does it. He tells us also that its content is the gospel of
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:33.840]   God's Son. He has told us also about his consciousness of power as he engages in this service. And
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.840]   then last week we were looking at his humility. That is the amazing thing about this man,
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.160]   just as he was of power. Knowing as he did that he was full of the blessing of the gospel
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.280]   of God, he nevertheless says that he's longing to see them, not only that he may impart unto
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.880]   them some spiritual gift, but that also he may be comforted together with them by the
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.800]   mutual faith both of you and me.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:13.160]   Now then, we come to the last thing which he tells us about his service, and that is
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:22.120]   his sense of constraint with respect to it. That's the service he's been describing.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:30.880]   Now here he emphasizes in verse 14 the sense of constraint of which he was conscious in
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:39.400]   his life, in his work, in his ministry. And that is put here very clearly before us. Now
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:48.040]   primarily of course the apostle here is speaking about himself. But I think that all his teaching
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.800]   everywhere will urge us really to draw the deduction that what the apostle says here
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:02.560]   about himself should be true of all us also. And I read those portions just now from the
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.280]   two epistles to the Corinthians because they're in both cases. He does show very clearly that
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.360]   what he says about himself in his service for God should also be true of all Christian
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:21.880]   people. And indeed if we do realize the truth as he realized it, it can but lead to the
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.880]   same result. Not of course that we can be apostles. We've seen already that we cannot.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.640]   Not that we are all called to preach in the way that Paul was called to preach, or in
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.860]   the way that some people are still called to preach and to give their entire life and
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.320]   energy to the preaching and the teaching of the gospel. But we are all in another sense
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.200]   called to preach, for we are all of us in contact with men and women. And as I hope
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:58.640]   to try to show you, if we realize truly what it is to be a Christian and why we ourselves
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.120]   are Christian, well then the motive which the apostle felt and the sense of constraint
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:13.240]   of which he was conscious must also surely be felt by us to some extent or to some measure.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:20.520]   Now then, he puts it, you notice, in a very striking way. He says, "I am a debtor, both
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:27.440]   to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise. So, as much
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:35.400]   as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also. For I am not
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.640]   ashamed of the gospel of Christ." You see the argument, you see the logic, you see how
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:46.040]   it all goes on from one step to another. Well now then, let's look at this striking statement.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.800]   Take this word "debtor" that he uses, which is our key word here, obviously. What's
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:05:00.800]   it mean? Well, while in its very origin it does carry the meaning of a debt in the sense
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.880]   that we normally use the term, that a man owes somebody else some money. He's in debt
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.760]   to him, he's a debtor, he owes money. That is the original in the primary meaning, but
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:21.120]   always it has been used in an extended manner. And it has come to mean to be under obligation.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:27.400]   When I say, when I put it like that, I mean that the very word that Paul used already
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.860]   in Paul's day and before Paul's day had been given this further and extended meaning.
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:42.000]   It meant to be under obligation, to be bound by duty or necessity to do something. Now
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.280]   that's an important meaning, to be under obligation, bound by duty or necessity to
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:58.000]   do something. But also we can put it like this. It's a word which describes a necessity
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:10.960]   imposed either by law and beauty or by reason or by the times or by the nature of the matter
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:21.800]   under consideration. A necessity imposed upon us by the nature of the matter under consideration.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.640]   That's what he means more or less by this great word, debtor. "I am a debtor,"
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:33.680]   says Paul. "I am under a necessity, I am under an obligation." And what we have
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:42.720]   to do this evening is to consider the character of this necessity, this obligation, which
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.640]   the great apostle felt. It was so strong that he chose this word deliberately. He's in
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:54.120]   a sense like a man under the constraint of the law. He's in a debtor's court and
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:59.680]   he's standing in a box and the processes of the law are pressing upon him. It's
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.000]   as powerful as that, he says. "That's what I am," he says, "that's my work,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.280]   that's my life. I go about the world preaching this gospel and I do so for this reason."
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.280]   Now then, what does he tell us here exactly? Because as I say, he's not only speaking
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:24.920]   about himself. He is describing what we all should be conscious of to some extent and
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:31.480]   to some measure. I keep on putting it like that for this reason, that I do believe, as
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:37.280]   we all must believe, that this man of God was in a very special way a herald of the
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:45.600]   gospel. But we see in him in the most intense form imaginable to us what we all should be
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:51.280]   aware of in principle. Let's not excuse ourselves. I'm not saying it that we may
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:57.440]   do so, but I'm saying so lest anyone may go from this service feeling that because
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.640]   he or she is not in the identical position of the Apostle Paul in these matters, well
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.320]   that therefore he or she is not a Christian at all.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:13.600]   Very well then, what is it that he is saying? Well, the first thing obviously is this. He
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:22.440]   is asserting that he is the possessor of something which he can give. Now, we've already seen
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:28.480]   that in verse 11, haven't we? "I long to see you, that I may impart unto you, hand
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:34.200]   over to you, pass on to you, some spiritual gift to the end that he may be established."
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:40.680]   Very well then, the first thing I say is this, that he's a man who's got something in
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:48.920]   his possession which he can hand on to another. That's a very good definition of a Christian.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:56.680]   What's it mean? Well, it first of all of necessity implies knowledge. It means that
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:02.560]   you know something and you can tell somebody else about this something. You can pass on,
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:12.480]   you can impart the knowledge, the information. I think we all see at a glance how this must
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:19.800]   of necessity be true, and how it is basic to the Christian's whole position. The Apostle
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.480]   Peter, you remember, in his first epistle and in the third chapter, he puts it like
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:33.720]   this, "Be ready," he says, "at all times to give a reason for the hope that is in you."
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:42.520]   In other words, you can't be a Christian without knowing why you're a Christian. The
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.120]   Christian knows what it is that makes him a Christian. I can't see that a man can be
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:52.800]   a Christian apart from that. A Christian is one who, putting it at its very minimum and
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:58.080]   at its very lowest, believes in the Lord Jesus Christ. He must know that, and he must know
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:06.320]   something of what that means. If we don't know what we are as Christians, how can we
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:13.560]   tell somebody else? How can we impart to another? How can we pass on? Therefore, if I may, in
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:19.880]   a hurried illustration, put it to you, I'd put it like this. Here's a very good test
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:27.320]   that we can apply to ourselves. Let's imagine that somebody whom we know is taken desperately
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:34.200]   ill, even while we are here now in this service, if you like. So when you go home tonight,
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:39.480]   you've scarcely arrived in the house before somebody arrives, a messenger arrives, telling
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:46.440]   you that this friend has been taken desperately ill. This friend is not a Christian. You've
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.440]   known him, and you may have had dealings with this person in various ways, but he's just
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.920]   not a Christian. He's living the typical non-Christian life. Well, the message is that that friend
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:02.000]   has been taken desperately ill tonight, and they've sent for the doctor, and the doctor
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.480]   has taken a very grave view and has called in a second opinion, and the second opinion
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.400]   is equally grave. In fact, they have both agreed that unless something happens, and
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:16.400]   that very dramatically, almost miraculously, that it's very doubtful whether this man will
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:24.120]   live to see midnight tonight. There is a man suddenly stricken, and who realizes that he's
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:31.480]   desperately ill, and has a sense within him that he's dying. And suddenly, he awakens
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:36.040]   to this whole question of his soul and of eternity. He doesn't know anything about
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.920]   it. He's not a Christian. He's not really ever gone to a place of worship. He doesn't
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:45.440]   know. The people around and about him don't know. He suddenly thinks of you, and he thinks
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.360]   of you because he knows you as a Christian, as one who's always been a Christian as long
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:56.300]   as he can remember, or who suddenly, recently, become a Christian. And in his agony and desperation,
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:00.680]   he sends for you. Well, of course, you've no choice. You've got to go. Now, here's
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:05.280]   the test. There you are. You're standing in the bedroom, looking at this man who's desperately
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.560]   ill. He wants something. He wants help. He doesn't know how to die. He doesn't know
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.320]   where he is. He's nothing in his past to lean on, nothing that he has in the present.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:21.200]   He's afraid of that eternity to which he's going. Here's the simple question. Have
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:28.800]   you got something that you can pass on to that man? Now, obviously, it isn't enough
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:34.680]   for you just to be a good and a nice and a moral person. You may be a paragon of all
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:40.040]   the virtues, but you can't pass that on to him. That doesn't help him at all. And
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.640]   it's no use your saying to him, "Therefore, oh, well, of course, now you're beginning
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.840]   to ask questions. If you'd only always lived a good life as I have, well, then you wouldn't
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:52.160]   be feeling like this." Does that help him? Well, patently, it doesn't. You're not
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:59.680]   giving him anything at all. You're increasing his anxiety and his stress. No, no. The Christian
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:04.320]   is not merely a good and a moral man, for however good and moral we are, we can't
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.600]   give that to anybody else. Neither, obviously, is the Christian just one who's seeking
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:15.600]   salvation or trying to discover it, because if that's his position, he's got nothing
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.640]   to say to this man. But there are many people who believe that that is Christianity. They
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.920]   think it's a great quest for truth. They're reading books, and they say, "I hear there's
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.360]   an excellent book coming out next week, and I'm looking forward. I think it's going
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.200]   to help me." What's the value of that to the men who'll be dead before midnight
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:39.720]   tonight? No, no. Can the blind lead the blind? Of course they can't. But the Christian,
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:46.960]   says Paul, is a man who's got something, and he can give it to another. He knows, he
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:52.520]   understands, he has a knowledge. He can speak to that soul in such a way as to give him
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:14:01.600]   rest and peace. Debtor, something to pass on, something to give. Well, my friends, we
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:07.920]   must have this knowledge. As I say, I can't see that one can be a Christian without it.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.760]   And I can't see that you need some special training in order to do this. If you are a
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:17.920]   Christian yourself, well, you must know it. You couldn't be a Christian without it.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:24.600]   And therefore you have it in your possession, and you can pass it on. It implies, it postulates
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:31.600]   this knowledge. And secondly, it also postulates experience. In other words, that your knowledge
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:38.120]   is not merely theoretical, but that you know something of its power, that you know what
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:43.840]   it is to rely upon it yourself, so that as you visualize yourself in that person's
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:50.080]   vision, you know and you'd have that certainty. You wouldn't be unhappy about it. Clearly,
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:58.920]   this ability to impart and to pass on presupposes at any rate those two things.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:07.120]   Paul was very obviously and definitely in that position. Are we all in that position?
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:12.880]   Do you know whom you have believed? Do you know what you've believed? Are you able
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:19.720]   to give a reason for the hope that is in you? Have you lost the fear of death and the grave?
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:26.680]   Are you ready to meet God? That's the knowledge. And it is the thing we've already been looking
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:34.960]   at, so I don't stay with it. It is the gospel of his Son, justification by faith, that this
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:40.160]   man can be right with God here and now. He doesn't have to wait and start living a better
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:46.280]   life. He won't be alive. He'll be dead tonight. Very well, then. There is the first
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.280]   thing. Let me go on to the second thing. The apostle
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:56.280]   is very anxious to stress the fact that he is able to give this to everybody. "I am
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:01.800]   a debtor," he says, "both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:09.600]   to the unwise." It's not mere repetition, that. It isn't tautology. Greeks and barbarians.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:16.280]   What does that mean? Well, that's the whole world. The world was divided up by the Greeks
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:20.400]   into Greeks and barbarians. You were either a Greek or you were a barbarian. That's
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:28.440]   the whole of mankind. And you notice that here, for the purposes of this classification,
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:35.600]   the Romans were regarded as Greeks, because by this time when Paul lived, Greek philosophy
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:41.320]   and Greek culture had come to Rome as it had come throughout all the civilized parts of
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:46.560]   the world, and therefore there was a sense in which it was right to regard them as belonging
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:55.040]   to Greek culture, though actually Rome had conquered Greece in a political sense. Culturally,
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:00.760]   it was Greece that had conquered Rome. Very well, in the same way, the Jews are included
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:08.840]   amongst the barbarians. So Paul is saying here that he is able to impart this precious,
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:18.320]   priceless knowledge to any kind of nationality, it doesn't matter where, Greeks and barbarians.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:27.220]   But then he adds another classification, both to the wise and to the unwise. You can classify
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:34.200]   mankind not only nationally, but in general in a cultural manner. You can classify them
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:39.680]   according to ability and understanding, or the absence or the lack of that ability and
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:49.320]   understanding. In other words, he is saying, I am ready and able to hand over this knowledge,
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:55.800]   to impart this knowledge well, both to the professors and to the students, both to the
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.840]   rarely great and able giants of intellect, and to the people who have never had any educational
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:09.200]   advantages at all. Oh, and this is an absolutely vital point for us. You will find, and we
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.880]   shall find together, God willing, as we go on through this epistle, that Paul goes on
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:22.200]   saying that many, many times. Indeed, that is the theme of this epistle from the eighteenth
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:27.400]   verse of this first chapter to the end of the third chapter, which he sums up in these
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:37.240]   words, "All have sinned and come short of the glory of God. There is none righteous,
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:45.960]   no not one. Every mouth has been stopped." He sums it up like that in chapter three.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:52.680]   But here he introduces it, and this was the thing which made him so proud of the gospel.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:19:04.840]   "Give me," says Paul, "any sort of men. Confront me with a soul, and I am that soul's
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:12.240]   debtor." You see how vital this is and how we must remember it at this present time.
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:19.080]   The gospel of Jesus Christ is needed by everybody. It doesn't matter whether you have been
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:24.440]   born in Great Britain or in Japan or in one of the countries of South America, the gospel
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:31.680]   is needed by all. There is no such thing as a Christian nation, and you are not a Christian
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:38.480]   because you are born in a given country. It is needed by everybody. And it doesn't matter
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:45.200]   whether people are good or bad, morally speaking, they all need the gospel. So you need to preach
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:51.600]   it and to talk about it to the most respectable as well as to the most profligate and disciplined.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:59.040]   The same gospel. And the learned people and the philosophers stand in exactly the same
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:08.240]   need of this, as the most ignorant person conceivable. That is something that is asserted
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:14.600]   everywhere in the scriptures. And if we fail to do so, to that extent we are not being
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:23.080]   Christian. Everybody needs this gospel. Here is the common denominator for the whole of
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:33.400]   mankind, and it is the only one. Face to face with God, all men are miserable, wretched,
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:41.800]   hopeless sinners. And you and I as Christians must make that clear to them. We are debtors
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:49.440]   to all men of all types and kinds and every conceivable combination and permutation of
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:56.160]   character and psychology and everything else. There is no such thing as the religious complex.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:02.880]   It isn't only for certain people. Everybody needs it because everybody is under God and
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:12.000]   face to face with God. Very well then, that's the second thing he tells us. But the third
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:23.280]   thing he says is this. He's got this something to give, everybody needs it. Ah yes, but the
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:30.600]   apostle is asserting that he can also give it to everybody. Now that's a slightly different
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:35.600]   point, isn't it? And to me a very important one, and especially again in these days in
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:46.240]   which we live. Take a man like this apostle Paul, with his gigantic intellect, his profound
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:55.440]   ability, with his capacity for reason and logic and understanding. Well, as we think
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:02.200]   of such a man, and as we think of him in terms of modern education and its methods and its
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:09.880]   ideas, we would undoubtedly come to the conclusion, well yes, of course he probably would make
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:16.760]   a very good preacher to philosophers and to people like that. But of course you don't
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:23.160]   send a man like that to preach to barbarians. You send him to preach to the wise, but you
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:30.080]   don't send a man like that to preach to the unwise. How could they possibly follow him?
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:35.000]   They have minds which are big enough and capacious enough to listen to such a man. They wouldn't
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:42.720]   understand his terminology. No, no, your great professors, they can only address people who
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:49.440]   are of like quality. And when you come to the common people, the ignorant and the unlettered,
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:54.840]   well then of course you have some popular kind of preacher. And he will understand them
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:00.520]   and they'll understand him. "Oh," says the apostle Paul, "that's not true for a moment.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:06.880]   I am a debtor both to the Greeks and the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise." And he
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:12.600]   not merely says this, he proves it. Here's a man who could stand without any fear and
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:20.760]   without any apology in Athens on Mars Hill. And there he is confronted by a congregation
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:26.840]   of Stoics and Epicureans, and he can speak to them and speak to them with authority.
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:34.880]   Ah, but the same men, when he visits Galatia, where they belong to rather a primitive type
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:40.600]   of culture and lacked this knowledge of philosophy and various other things, he's equally ready
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:47.080]   to preach. He's equally effective as a preacher, and his ministry is equally used. The apostle
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:52.520]   Paul would do as well in the slums of the great cities as he'd do in the very centers
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:24:03.440]   of learning. Wise and unwise. It doesn't matter where you put him. As long as he's preaching
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:08.600]   to men and women, he not only has a message, he is able to impart it. Do you notice how
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:12.440]   he puts it? "To them that are under the laws, under the law. To them that are without the
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:17.240]   laws, without the law. To the weak became I as weak. To the strong, as strong I am made
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:24.960]   all things. To all men that I might by all means save some." What a wonderful thing
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:35.480]   this is. But you know, there are times when I begin to wonder whether we are equally clear
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:45.360]   about this at the present time. We tend to divide, even in this matter of the preaching
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:50.240]   of the gospel, don't we, as I indicated just now, that the world tends to do in a secular
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:25:01.160]   manner, and it's quite wrong. If a preacher can't preach his gospel to everybody, I take
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:06.560]   leave to doubt whether he can preach it to anybody. If a preacher must have a certain
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:16.360]   type of congregation, to that extent he's unlike the Apostle Paul. He's probably a philosopher.
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:24.040]   He's probably a purveyor of natural human learning, which is using Christian terminology.
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:29.600]   A preacher doesn't need to presuppose anything in his congregation except their need of God
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.880]   and of Christ.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:39.680]   Now I'm raising this point and emphasizing it for this reason, that you'll hear a good
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:46.600]   deal today along this line that we are told that students and others who are going to
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:55.600]   be trained for the ministry should be compelled to spend a part of their time working in factories,
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:01.120]   perhaps. You see, this is the argument. It is said, "How can a preacher preach to factory
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:06.800]   workers unless he knows their conditions and circumstances?" He must go and spend three
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.920]   months or perhaps more working in a factory. He'll get to understand them and their outlook
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:15.720]   and their mentality. Then he'll be able to preach to them. Now that is not only being
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:21.680]   seriously advocated, it is even being put into practice. The argument is, you see, that
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:27.200]   unless we know the exact position and circumstances and make up of people and their way of thinking,
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:34.820]   we can't preach to them. Not only is that unscriptural, it is, I think, the moment you
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:39.880]   seriously begin to consider it, quite foolish. Let me put it to you like this, to ridicule
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:46.600]   it. If I am told that I can't preach effectively to factory workers unless I've been a factory
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:55.520]   worker, surely I am equally entitled to argue that I can't preach to drunkards unless I
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:03.560]   go and spend three months in public houses. I can't preach to farmers unless I become
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:10.640]   a farmer. I can't preach to people in the theatrical profession unless I become an actor
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:18.960]   for three months. How utterly monstrous the suggestion is. But that's being said today,
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:23.800]   and being said sometimes even by evangelical people. What's it mean? Well, it just means
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:29.840]   this, my friends, that we've misunderstood this, that the preacher needs to know nothing
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:34.920]   about his congregation because he knows already the one thing that needs to be known, which
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:43.240]   is that they, like himself, are sinners, and that apart from the grace of God, they are
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:55.040]   lost and damned. Oh, no, he doesn't need all that. Of course, it needs this, that the
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:28:02.040]   actual form of the presentation will vary very slightly, but that's more or less immaterial,
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:06.960]   because this one man, without having these varying experiences under the power and the
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.680]   influence and the guidance of the Holy Spirit, is able to preach to all.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:18.320]   Or let me put it to you in another way. I was present at a very interesting discussion
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:24.400]   not so long ago in which this question was raised, and it's a very important question.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:31.640]   A minister asked, "Why is it," he said, "that as Christian people, and especially
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:40.880]   as evangelical people, we only seem to be able to appeal to a certain type?" He said,
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:45.440]   "Why is it that in our churches it's true to say that the vast majority of the members
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:51.320]   present are women, and there's such a scarcity of men? And why is it," he said, "that
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:57.360]   the church today seems to be failing to touch the working classes, so-called, almost entirely?
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:02.840]   Why is it," he said, "that we only seem to be appealing"—this was his term—"to
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:07.600]   the people who live in the suburbs? Why is it that Christians today seem to be only nice
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:12.840]   and kind and respectable people?" Now, he was granting, of course, that they experience
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:19.080]   true conversion. His question was, "Why are we not touching the others? Why are men
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:25.200]   not being attracted?" A very good question. It's a question that we all as Christians
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:32.680]   ought to face very seriously and very urgently. And to me, the answer to that question is
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:40.080]   provided by this verse that we're looking at tonight. The apostle's boast was that
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:49.400]   his appeal went to all, men and women, all ranks and classes, all kinds of abilities,
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:55.560]   any kind of soul. Here was a man who could preach as well to the slaves in Caesar's
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:30:01.080]   household as he could to the Stoics and the Epicureans. You see the range of his ministry.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:07.840]   Well, what's the explanation? It's this. And I commend it to you for careful, prayerful
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:19.600]   consideration. I suggest to you that if we preach the gospel in all its fullness, and
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:28.320]   if we apply it to the whole men, the mind as well as the heart and the will, if we preach
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:37.200]   the whole counsel of God to the whole individual personality, relying upon the Holy Spirit,
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:44.920]   we shall find that the gospel today will produce its results in all types and kinds and classes,
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:50.000]   even as it did at the beginning, even as it has always done in every period of revival
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:57.200]   and of reawakening. Surely it's a condemnation of our own methods. There's something wrong
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:03.240]   in our presentation. If our preaching and our gospel is only appealing to a certain
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:09.080]   type, well, I suggest then that we are preaching in a way that only appeals to such a type.
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:14.040]   We are leaving out something. We are either leaving out something in the message, or else
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:19.040]   we are not appealing to the whole men. Are we perhaps only appealing to a certain sentimental
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:27.720]   type? Isn't there enough intellect in our message? Aren't we making the people think?
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:36.280]   Is there nothing offensive about our message? Because it's an interesting thing. There
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:43.400]   are men especially who prefer a thing when it does hit them and hurt them, and the one
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:50.200]   thing they cannot abide is a sentimentality. Give them something strong, though it be severe
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:56.040]   and though it hurts. They know it's right and they listen to it. But if you once give
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.880]   them the idea that you're getting at them and are trying to influence them by certain
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:04.480]   methods, certain psychological approaches, they won't even come and put themselves
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:10.680]   under the possibility of being affected. And surely it is a problem for all of us in the
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:18.440]   whole Christian church. Why is it that the masses of the people are untouched right outside?
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:23.280]   Have we given them the impression, I wonder, that the gospel of Jesus Christ is only for
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:28.960]   a certain type and for a certain class? Have we somehow given them the impression that
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:37.160]   this gospel of ours is against them? If we have, God have mercy upon us. Let us therefore,
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:43.800]   I say, be clear in our minds and be careful that we present the whole counsel of God as
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:50.240]   this man did, without fear and without favor, without any respect for persons. Let's give
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:56.600]   it in its grand content, with all the intellect that's in these epistles. For he was writing
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:01.600]   this, remember, to people who were slaves, most of them, and serfs in Caesar's household.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.920]   Not like the modern people who say, "Oh, we can't take more than twenty minutes, and
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:08.600]   it mustn't be too intellectual. Don't give us too much doctrine." That's what's being
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:15.480]   said by many evangelical people today. Is it surprising that we are guilty of a kind
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:23.920]   of inbreeding and only producing the same type always? Let us, I say, go back to the
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:33.720]   scriptures and let's preach a whole gospel for men's minds and hearts and wills. Not
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:42.880]   one at the expense of the others, but always the whole, a whole gospel for a whole man.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:49.160]   And then the Holy Spirit will apply it. And we will have again what used to take place
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:54.760]   here in London two hundred years ago, when a man like George Whitefield was preaching.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:34:00.320]   He could preach to miners and they were converted. Yes, but the Countess of Huntingdon used to
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:06.600]   pack her drawing room in the west end of London, and Lord Chesterfield and all sorts of other
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:12.200]   members of the aristocracy used to come together and listen, and several of them were converted.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:20.400]   The same preacher. And he preached the same gospel to them all. And the Holy Spirit honored
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.060]   it and made it efficacious.
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:28.800]   But that brings me to my last point, which is this. The apostle Esadatta tells us that
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:37.520]   he's got something to give, that all need it, he can give it to all. In other words,
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:43.560]   you and I must be able to give it to an intellectual kind of person as well as to the person who's
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:52.280]   not intellectual. And vice versa. There are no specialists in this matter. If I can't
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:58.480]   preach, I say again to anybody and to everybody, well then I say about myself I can't preach
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:06.800]   to anybody. I could illustrate that, but my time is going, I must leave it. Let me just
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:12.040]   put it like this. I remember a challenge that came to me once, and I think it puts my point
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:20.000]   very neatly. I'd preached here on a Sunday. I then went off on my holidays to the country.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.400]   I hadn't intended preaching that first Sunday, but there was an oldish minister in the place
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:29.120]   where I was staying, and he was due to preach three times. It was a very hot day. I felt
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:34.600]   I couldn't allow it. I volunteered to take his afternoon service for him. And that meant
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:42.920]   going up to a little place halfway up a mountain. And my wife and I went there, and I went into
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:47.560]   the pulpit and I looked at my congregation, including my wife. The congregation consisted
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:55.160]   of five people. Let me admit it quite frankly and honestly, the devil came to me and tempted
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:36:01.120]   me. And he tempted me in this way, well of course, just five people, just give them a
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:09.000]   little talk. Quite apart from the fact that I'm not very good at that kind of thing,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:18.920]   I recovered myself. I recovered myself, and this is what I said to myself. "If you can't
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:24.960]   preach to these five people in exactly the same way as you preached last Sunday in Westminster
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:33.600]   Chapel, the sooner the better you get out of the pulpit." By the grace of God I was
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:41.160]   enabled to do so, and I never enjoyed a service better in the whole of my life. A preacher
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:47.120]   who is dependent upon his congregation is unfit to enter a pulpit.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:51.480]   Let me come to my last point. I'll say just a word. The last thing the apostle tells us
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:58.720]   here is not only that he can give this message, but that he feels he must give it. "I am
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:06.160]   a debtor." Why did he feel this constraint? What is this? Well, there are many answers.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:14.960]   One is his call, his commission. "We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:21.520]   and give an account of the deeds done in the body. Therefore, knowing the terror of the
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:28.160]   Lord, I persuade men." That's the first reason. The Lord had commissioned him on the
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:34.200]   road to Damascus. He had sent him out. He'll have to render up an account of his ministry
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:41.200]   and of his stewardship. Do you notice his term? "Knowing the terror of the Lord, I
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:48.560]   persuade men." And do you notice how he put it in 1 Corinthians 9? "Don't praise
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:54.160]   me for this," says Paul, "I can't help myself. Necessity is laid upon me. Yea, woe
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:38:01.560]   is unto me if I preach not the gospel. I dare not. I must. I'm a man under a commission.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:10.560]   There's an obligation." Oh, and the other thing that comes in here is surely this.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:19.800]   This consciousness of the need of others, the appalling need of men and women. That's
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:27.800]   the thing that brings in the urge. You know, if you and I only realized fully the state
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:33.600]   and the condition of men and women by the thousand round and about us, do you know,
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:41.520]   I think we'd be unable to sleep sometimes? Do you really believe and know that the unbeliever,
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:49.560]   the person who dies unbelieving and in his sin, goes to hell? Well, if we really believe
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:54.240]   that, there'll be a sense of constraint in our lives. You won't care what they'll
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:58.440]   think of you. You won't be super subconcilious about these matters. You'll say whoever
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:03.960]   they are and whatever they are, they're dying in sin. They're wretched as they are.
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:13.440]   There's worse to come. I must. I must speak. The need of others as he knew it and as he
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:22.440]   realized it. And then the next thing surely was this. His consciousness of what this glorious
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:29.320]   gospel had done for him, the joy and the peace and the happiness it had brought him. And
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:35.640]   he was anxious that all others should have the same. "I am a debtor," says Paul.
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:48.080]   And finally it was this, the thing itself. You know what I mean by that? Whenever you
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:55.200]   come across anything in any realm of life which pleases you and gives you great satisfaction,
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:01.500]   you feel you're bound to tell people about it. And you do. If you read a book that gives
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:06.200]   you something unusual, you say, "I must tell so and so. I must tell everybody."
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:11.400]   The thing itself is so wonderful. If you see a wonderful bit of scenery, you say, "I
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:17.960]   must tell others about this. They must go and have a look at that." Whatever it is.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:24.120]   We always feel we can't keep it to ourselves. We always want to share our blessings. Our
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:28.600]   Lord has put it once and forever. The woman who lost the coin, when she found it, she
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:32.720]   goes and tells her neighbors, "Come and rejoice with me. I found it." The shepherd
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:37.600]   who has lost the sheep does the same. And the father who has lost his son and who finds
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.200]   him, he does the same.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:47.520]   Well now, here it is, this glorious gospel. Oh, you noticed how Paul put it into Corinthians
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:57.600]   5? He says, "The love of Christ constraineth me." That's the thing. He says he's like
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:03.720]   a man in a vice. And the vice has been screwed up and tightened up, and it's being pressed
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:09.920]   out of him. What's pressing him? The love of Christ. This amazing thing, this gospel
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:16.880]   of reconciliation, this love of God that sends his only Son and even makes him to be sinned,
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:22.560]   he's seen it. He wants everybody to see it and to rejoice in it and to glory in it
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:32.800]   and to participate in it. The wonderful, glorious character of the gospel itself has made him
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:45.040]   a debtor, both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and the unwise.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:53.160]   Are we like that, my friends, Christian people? Do you know anything about the constraint?
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:42:04.200]   Do you know something about this must, this debtor element? Well, to the extent that we
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:13.560]   do know this gospel and the one about whom the gospel speaks, to the extent that we know
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:25.480]   Christ and his love, he and the love will constrain us likewise and will make us feel
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:35.280]   that we are debtors to the whole world, debtors to tell them and to make known unto them their
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:46.120]   terrible, precarious position and God's amazing provision in Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:52.440]   So we must know it. We must get to understand it. We must get a hold of the doctrine of
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:57.680]   these epistles, this epistle to the Romans and the others. We must study, for we are
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:02.480]   not only going to be speaking to people who don't understand, but also to people who
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:07.680]   do. We must be able to talk to the professor, the learned men, as well as to the other,
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:14.040]   and we must not be satisfied until we can speak to all types and all kinds. And the
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:20.920]   Church of God will not only consist of a certain type of person, but we shall see in the Church
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:29.680]   men and women of all types and kinds, of every stratum of society, male and female, all coming
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:40.520]   together to worship the same Lord and to praise the same Savior. May God make of all of us
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:48.000]   debtors to all. Amen.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   O God, we pray thee to have mercy upon us for our coldness, for our lack of zeal, for
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:10.400]   our lack of the sense of constraint. O God, reveal unto us the glory of the gospel. Forgive
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:19.640]   us for our laziness and our indolence, for our failure to go into the depths of thy truth
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:30.240]   as we should, and to try to excuse ourselves and to rest at ease in Zion, and our failure
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:39.920]   to realize the urgency of the times. O God, awaken us and display unto us the glory of
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:48.240]   thy grace, that we may be enabled to tell others of it by thy Spirit, and so bring them
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:55.800]   as willing captives to it. Lord, bless us, we pray thee to that end, and for thy great
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:03.880]   name's sake. And now, may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and the love
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:09.960]   of God, and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:18.000]   us now, throughout the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage,
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:28.640]   and until we shall stand at the judgment seat of Christ. Amen.
