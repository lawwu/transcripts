[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:38.040]   Today's Q&A episode of Radical Personal Finance is sponsored by SoFi, the social finance corporation.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.320]   Hey, wouldn't it be cool if the business of lending were actually brought into the 21st
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.320]   century?
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.680]   A couple of years ago, I applied for a mortgage and if you've ever done that, it's just a
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.720]   nightmare when it comes to the paperwork.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.240]   You got to send in emails and send in PDFs and take scans and send faxes and you're doing
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.120]   screenshots of this and it's just a nightmare.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.320]   I remember just thinking at the time, man, it would be nice if somebody would make this
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.320]   a little bit better.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.320]   Well, guess what?
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.680]   You don't have to wait.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.120]   SoFi has brought the business of lending into the 21st century, made it easy for you with
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.440]   a super great technology solution.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.300]   They've also made it cheap and cheap is good when you are borrowing money.
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.800]   The cheaper they can get the money, the better for you, the borrower.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.800]   Here's the deal.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.920]   If you've got student loans, SoFi built their business on student loans, refinancing and

[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.160]   Super easy technology solution.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.920]   Today we do a Q&A episode and this one's unique.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.600]   We have one question, one caller.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.920]   We spent 45 minutes or an hour just talking about the one question.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.760]   It was a rich conversation on a difficult topic, which is how can husbands and wives
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:43.840]   handle their money together better?
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.720]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.960]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host, your guide, your Sherpa, hopefully your friend.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.880]   Living a rich life now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.240]   Today is pretty much all about the rich life because I'll tell you what, there's riches
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.440]   and there's quality of life and hopefully today we're going to dig into quality of life
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:15.700]   and talk about things that matter.
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.480]   On Fridays I do these Q&A shows and I really love doing these.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.000]   I'll tell you in a moment kind of, I'll do it now.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.400]   I'll tell you why I started doing these shows.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.160]   This Q&A show was an idea for me.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160]   One of the things I wanted to do was to streamline.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.040]   I wanted to do more Q&A because I love doing Q&A, but I also wanted to streamline the production
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.040]   of it.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.280]   So the first thing I wanted to do is I said, how can I do it and do it in an interactive
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.480]   way?
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.760]   Being a podcaster is a great thing, but it's also can be a lonely thing because it's just
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.840]   you talking into a mic.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.200]   You don't get the feedback that you get speaking to a crowd.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.740]   If you've never recorded a show, I encourage you to do it, but it's a strange situation
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.120]   because you got to speak, but you don't get the feedback from a crowd.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.340]   Usually when you're giving a speech, you get eyes and you can see is the crowd receiving
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.340]   this?
[00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.340]   Is it not?
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.620]   After you've spoken for a while, you get to be pretty receptive as to the mood of the
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.620]   crowd.
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.980]   Well, podcasting is not like that.
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.820]   So I always like to get that interaction, but usually it comes not posthumously, it
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.780]   comes post, I don't know, after the show.
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.220]   That's when I get the reaction in the comments.
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.220]   By then it's too late.
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.860]   I can't do anything about it.
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.180]   So I thought it'd be fun to do a little live Q&A and have some interaction.
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.900]   The other reason I started to do this was as part of my own plan of preparation for
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.860]   possibly going to broadcast radio in the future.
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.460]   The end of 2015, I spent a lot of time wrestling with whether I wanted to take the show to
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.180]   the radio waves and ultimately decided the timing wasn't right if I ever do choose to
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.220]   do it.
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.740]   But the other thing I wasn't so confident is my skills.
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.060]   I wanted to improve my skills.
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.980]   I said, "How can I bring some of that live dynamic?"
[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:46.700]   Well, I'll do a live Q&A call, which is what these Friday shows are now scheduled to be.
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.020]   And it's been fun.
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.500]   It's also been challenging because it requires me just to show up and speak on my feet.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.340]   And I'll tell you, I might, especially today, you'll hear me hem and haw a little bit.
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.740]   I might seem like Mr. Confident or Mr. Brash or Provocative, but I'm really not.
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.700]   I'm kind of an introvert, but I'm willing to do it.
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.220]   I've made the commitment when I started the show.
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.140]   I'll just try to be clear and give the best answer as I can.
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.140]   So today was fun.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.500]   I showed up to the call and there was one person on the call, one person listening in
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.820]   and one person there listening, there with a question.
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.120]   And so this entire Q&A call is just one conversation with a listener named Erica.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.120]   And I think it was really good.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.120]   It was really rich.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.120]   It was unusual.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.380]   And I wasn't expecting to talk about the things that we talked about, but I hope you enjoy
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.660]   and appreciate it.
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.060]   I'll play that interview for you.
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.220]   I'll play that call for you in just a moment.
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.460]   And just a tiny bit of preamble to the call.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.540]   I hope you enjoy it.
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.620]   Some of you who, if you don't like it when I talk about my own perspectives, convictions
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.980]   with regard to religious conviction, this will be a show you'll want to skip because
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.860]   that's, especially at the front end, it's heavy on that.
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.340]   That was the question that I was asked.
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.660]   And so that was the question that I answered.
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:06.260]   So if you're not into that, please don't just comment about why you hate that.
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.900]   Just skip the show.
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.220]   Come back another day.
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.900]   But if you're willing to listen to that and listen to my own convictions, my own perspective,
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.200]   I do my best to share with you why I believe what I believe and why I do what I do.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.500]   And I think there's some rich content here for many of you.
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.500]   And I hope you enjoy it.
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.740]   Erica was a wonderful lady to talk to.
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.140]   And she asked a great question.
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.140]   I try to record these shows usually with a start to finish.
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.260]   I hit record and then bring the callers on the line.
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.260]   I like that.
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.560]   It makes it smoother for me in the production.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.780]   But today I didn't know if more people would call in.
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.980]   And so I just, I'm recording the intro now after I just hung up the phone with Erica.
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.500]   So that's going to be the call.
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.940]   Before I play the call for you, I won't come back at the end and do announcements.
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.940]   I'll just go ahead and do it here.
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:51.940]   This is a benefit.
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.140]   These calls are a benefit for patrons.
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:59.100]   And I would encourage you, if you would like to talk with me and discuss your question,
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.300]   your comment, get my answer.
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.860]   It can be technical, it can be my opinion.
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.860]   That's up to you.
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.860]   But I'll answer anything you want.
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.600]   I'll show up and I'll just talk with you on these calls.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.860]   That's exactly what they are.
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.260]   And I'll give, I try to give everyone a chance to do it.
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260]   I try to sense the flow of the time to commit to it.
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.540]   I'm learning with those things.
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.820]   But I'd love for you to be involved in that.
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.380]   Frankly, if you want to get my opinion on something, this is going to be your best way
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.380]   to do it.
[00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.380]   I get tons of emails.
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.300]   And thank you to those of you who've been resending your emails.
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.300]   I love getting emails.
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.500]   And as I said in a recent standalone episode, I respond to every email.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.180]   But a lot of times my response is simply, "Hey, thank you for the question.
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.180]   I've added it to my Q&A queue.
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.100]   I keep a list of all of your questions and that way I have ideas to go to and answer
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.500]   questions sometimes."
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.500]   That's often a response.
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.020]   More often a response is, "Hey, I just can't address this in email.
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.020]   I'm sorry.
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.740]   But here are a couple things to consider and I just give a quick answer."
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:55.460]   But I get too many in-depth questions for me to be able to guarantee you your spot.
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.540]   But the way I'm doing these Q&A calls, you got a really good chance.
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:04.180]   So if you sign up to become a patron at the appropriate level, details on that at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron,
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.780]   you will get access to the time and the phone number for the call.
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.580]   You'll be able to call in and ask me your question.
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.380]   And I would love it if more of you were to do that.
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.540]   So check it out, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.540]   Now let's get to it.
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:24.620]   So we're here on the Q&A call and at the moment, we have exactly one participant.
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:32.240]   So for other listeners who want to join us in these Q&A, we've got a massive room open
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.240]   for you.
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.820]   So if you'd like to have a discussion, we've got one person hanging on the line to ask
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:37.820]   a question.
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.260]   And Erica, that means that we get as much time as you want to talk about anything that
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.260]   you want.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:46.860]   You got—this is a high—hopefully a high—if I can say something intelligent, this is hopefully
[00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.420]   a high beneficial consulting call for you.
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.500]   You don't have to pay anything more than what you're already paying as a patron.
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.100]   And I'll give you as much time as we can.
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.660]   So welcome to the Friday Q&A call.
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.260]   How can I serve you today?
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.260]   Thank you so much, Joshua.
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.260]   Thank you for having this Q&A call for us.
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:06.820]   And I feel very lucky to be the one to get all of your time today.
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:11.780]   I listened to the Q&A call last week and I was really interested by the Q&A—the question
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:16.540]   about the roles of finances in a family between a husband and a wife.
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:22.460]   I have an economics degree, architecture minor, and I've been working in finance for about
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.300]   10 years as an analyst and as a trader and that sort of thing.
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.700]   So I'm very up to date in investments and that sort of thing.
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:35.900]   And I'm working on my—on the actual money management, thanks to YNAB, because you turned
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.060]   me on to that late last year.
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:42.740]   My husband works in a corporate job and brings in pretty good income, enough where it should
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:48.700]   be more of an issue of allocation and use for us than trying to bring in more.
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:53.780]   But given my background, I have a hard time not wanting to earn money for the family,
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.860]   even though we have two young kids that we intend to homeschool.
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:03.980]   And basically, the question last week opened up a big, big question in my mind as to whether
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:08.780]   that set of roles and my feeling of a need to provide as well since I'm allocating
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:15.780]   the money we have, if that might be why I'm so hung up and why I'm still freelancing.
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.620]   Yeah, so that question caught me out of the blue last week, and I'm trying to keep these
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:26.540]   Q&A calls—I mean, it's just me, so this is just a conversation between a couple of
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.540]   people.
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:33.380]   But it's—I mean, frankly, I don't love to talk about—I don't love to be in the
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:39.340]   public eye, and I don't love to have my opinions criticized and dealt with.
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.740]   And that's what's challenging for me and why I kind of approached the topic gingerly.
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.100]   And I went ahead and shared what our perspective was.
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.340]   And I'm going to give you a straight answer, but I got to give a little bit of preamble
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.480]   in order to make myself feel better about it.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:56.260]   But the answer that I gave was talking about the role of—what is my role in our family
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.980]   versus my wife's role in our family finances.
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.260]   And it's something that we've changed on over the years, and it's something that
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.340]   directly confronts biblical Christianity.
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:12.260]   And it's probably—it's uncomfortable for me to talk about in a public forum because
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.820]   it confronts so many of the arguments that go on in our culture.
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:20.740]   It's the popular culture, and you've got to trace it through gender relations throughout
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.660]   the last—I don't know, I guess since time immemorial.
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.900]   I mean, there's always had to deal with it.
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:32.340]   And in our country and in our culture, this is like the massive press of culture around
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:38.980]   with—it started back in the '60s and '70s with the major revolution, the feminist revolution
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.340]   that dramatically changed gender roles.
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:49.420]   And fast forward, even to today, we see with the role of marriage, the role of now gender
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.980]   identity is the major theme that's in the news.
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.920]   I mean, you can't pick up a newspaper without seeing an article at it.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:12:00.700]   And so, I also feel a lack of personal—a lack of real confidence because I'm a young
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:01.700]   husband.
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:08.500]   I've been married for four years, four or five years, something like that now.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.820]   January 1, 2012, do the math, that's how long we've been married.
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:16.420]   And so, you've had to learn as a new spouse, as a new couple, we've had to learn over
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.740]   the years and try different things.
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:25.640]   So, I'll just tell you kind of my perspective on it and where I've grown to, but with those
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.680]   caveats of recognizing I'm a young husband and I don't love to talk publicly, so it's
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.980]   just a conversation between friends, obviously, with other people listening.
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:39.360]   Just for me to understand, though, are you guys Christians?
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.360]   We are.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.360]   He was raised Catholic.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.720]   I was raised—Mom sent me to Sunday school so I'd be exposed.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.800]   I wasn't exposed enough, so I actually just ordered a copy of the Geneva Bible, and so
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.720]   I'm reading that one now, just to build a stronger foundation as opposed to sort of
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.120]   the hodgepodge that I have.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.120]   Right.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:00.440]   But it's more an issue that I'd like to sort of talk through some of the issues, because
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:08.280]   you exposed the question as to whether it's that feeling that feminism has given me that
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:14.380]   I need to contribute financially more than anything that's driving this feeling that
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:20.120]   maybe I'm not enough if I'm simply managing my family and perhaps also helping on the
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.120]   financial side.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.120]   Right.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:27.320]   I know it seems that in your family, especially being a financial planner, and with all the
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:32.120]   background that you have, it also seems to suit your strengths to have you do all of
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.040]   that management as well.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:40.600]   And I wonder if you have a perspective—I know this is just your thought and just what
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:46.560]   you have, but I know a lot of us are sort of floundering in this idea of how do we recreate
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:51.800]   what we do, whether it's within the scheme of what has historically been done with what's
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.600]   been presented to us or figuring out what works for us.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.600]   So I welcome a conversation.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.600]   Right, absolutely.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.100]   So I'll begin with my presupposition.
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:09.800]   So my presupposition is that, based upon external evidence and also based upon my own personal
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.240]   conviction—so the external evidence is a discussion where you have to prove the authenticity
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.040]   and authority of the Bible.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:22.580]   That's a long-winded conversation as far as different perspectives.
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:27.280]   Much of history, the general challenge and struggle between worldviews has been, do we
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:34.740]   base our systems and our actions and our behaviors on a biblical framework or do we base them
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.880]   on something else, some other creation?
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:44.260]   And Western society was founded upon a direct approach of saying, "We're going to implement
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.640]   and live under the authority of biblical scripture and biblical precept and concept."
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.280]   That's been the foundation of Western society.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.000]   That's changing now.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.280]   We're moving into a much more secular society and that has different skirmishes on the edges
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.640]   where things are changing.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:08.040]   I choose to believe the Bible and I choose to place the Bible as the highest authority
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.260]   for the way that I act.
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:14.360]   So I look then to say, "Does the Bible have a clear teaching or does it have principles
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:20.680]   that I can draw from that will be applicable to my modern life?"
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.440]   There are various reasons why I choose that.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:29.560]   I won't go into it here, but I'll say the best, most concise summary of it that I've
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.920]   ever heard verbalized and that you may find particularly valuable.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:38.520]   There's a preacher that I like, his name is Vodie Bauckham and he has a, I'll look it
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:45.640]   up and include it in the show notes, but he has an interesting speech that he made, I
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.480]   believe it was on a college campus, but it was just entitled, "Why I Choose to Believe
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.760]   the Bible."
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.440]   And from scripture, he draws this statement.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:57.120]   He says, "I choose to believe the Bible because it's a reliable collection of historical documents
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:02.000]   written by eyewitnesses during the lifetime of other eyewitnesses.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.920]   They report supernatural events which happened in fulfillment of specific prophecy and they
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.960]   claim to be divine rather than human in origin."
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.040]   So, that's the verbatim quote of what he teaches and he unpacks that in a sermon.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:21.000]   I don't think it's directly related to finance, but for anyone who's interested in that topic,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.440]   I would encourage it as a good, useful place to start.
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.240]   And for you, as you're considering, what do I believe and why do I believe it, that's
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.240]   where I go to.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:36.800]   So, in the Bible, the Bible teaches, clearly talks about gender roles and on biblical authority,
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:43.000]   you see that husbands and wives are brought together as one and they have different functions
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.680]   in the family.
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:51.600]   And when looked at specifically, there is not the major question in our modern age is,
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.600]   does that mean that one is more valuable or less valuable?
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:01.120]   In the Bible, women and men are equally valuable and so, that's the first major hurdle that
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:06.160]   people have to face is, does the Bible teach that men and women are differently of value?
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:12.260]   Historically, it's interesting, if you look at Jewish culture, you find actually an esteem
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.280]   of women that was far above many of the historical cultures.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:21.400]   So, you have to balance, are men and women equally valuable?
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.800]   Yes.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.520]   Are they different in function?
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.360]   And in that regard, the Bible teaches very clearly that men and women are different in
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.480]   function.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.780]   And so, I wasn't prepared to do a Bible study with chapter and verse today, but that's something
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.480]   for another day.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.840]   But specifically, what it teaches is that the man has the responsibility for providing
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:45.560]   for the family and the wife has the primary responsibility for providing within the home.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:49.480]   That's a scriptural teaching and there are various verses that could be referenced about
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.480]   that.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:55.520]   So, what you see clearly is you see an authority and a responsibility that's placed upon the
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.520]   husband.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:03.720]   So, when I said last week that I said that it's my responsibility, that ultimately, I'm
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.760]   the one who bears all of the responsibility.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:11.320]   And for me to place any of the responsibility onto my wife to provide for our income, to
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:16.680]   provide for the care and protection of our family, that would be an abdication of my
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.680]   responsibility.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:24.360]   So, I take full responsibility for all of those aspects.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:29.240]   My wife's major responsibility and her major calling is to function within our family.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:34.680]   And that is more valuable with the children and in our family to keep our home operating
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.680]   at peak perfection.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.900]   So, there's a division of responsibility there.
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:46.080]   What happens is that if I place a responsibility on her to where she's got to function effectively
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:52.240]   in the home and outside of the home, it causes a very difficult stretching.
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.800]   It causes something...something's got to be ignored in that situation.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:01.320]   Now, I don't think these lines are cut and dry in this sense.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.680]   As a father, I am responsible for what's happening in my home.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.400]   So, my heart has been over the years, I desire to be present in my home.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:14.000]   And I usually like to start, if I were going to preach on the subject in another forum
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.240]   other than Radical Personal Finance, I always start with the men.
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:22.040]   And I generally speak more strongly to men than I do to women because it's our responsibility
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.040]   to lead.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.800]   So, as an example, I don't maintain activities that are going to take me out of the home
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.000]   during my family time.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.120]   I don't maintain hobbies.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.600]   I don't maintain activities that are my thing.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.600]   I don't golf.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.600]   I don't go fishing.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.160]   It's not a rule that I can't do it.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.680]   But on an ongoing basis, my heart is for my home and for my children.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:45.640]   And that's my number one calling in life is first to labor in my house.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.840]   It's not to be rich.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:47.880]   It's not to become wealthy.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.960]   My number one calling in life is to labor within my family and to raise my children.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:56.440]   Now, I'm going to integrate them into other things and I want to live a life that's fully
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.440]   integrated.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:04.560]   But my calling is at home, is to be there and to serve my family.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.600]   I'm also responsible for going out from the house to the world and that's where I'm also
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.920]   responsible to go and earn an income.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.680]   I'm responsible to support the family.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:19.480]   But I try to do that always with the vision of being as involved in my family's lifestyle
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.480]   as possible.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:25.660]   So, that's why I've worked hard to build the work that I do now.
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:30.280]   As we record this call, I'm sitting in what technically is a third bedroom in my house
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.960]   and my kids are napping.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.120]   My wife is in the other room right before I came in and hit record and fired up the
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.120]   call.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.800]   I kissed them good to go and have a nap.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.320]   So, that's the type of lifestyle I'm trying to build that's integrative.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:47.080]   But if there's a direction, a change of direction, then my calling is to do the work that's required
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.000]   outside of the home and my wife's calling is to do the work that's inside the home.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.200]   Now, that's – we accept that based upon a submission to biblical authority and to
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.200]   God.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:06.680]   When I became a Christian, many people, I believe, misperceive becoming a Christian
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:12.720]   as something that's – it's just a decision that, "Okay, this is true."
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.880]   When I became a Christian, I became a slave of Christ.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.080]   And so, that's that fundamental basis of authority and it's always on that basis
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:25.200]   of my submission to God's authority in my life that I even have the right or responsibility
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.400]   to exercise authority in my family.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.900]   Moving on to practical expression of it.
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:35.880]   The biggest practical expression that I identified with – that I was speaking on last week
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:44.000]   was simply that what I – the challenge that my wife and I faced is that we have been raised
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.800]   in a gender-neutralized society and both of us have been raised in that context.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.120]   And because of that, I generally have always wanted to run away.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.640]   I never want to push anything on my wife.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.800]   I never want to indicate any gender differences.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:05.200]   Many ways we've been – I feel like I've been neutered by modern society and finding
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:10.060]   that proper expression of masculinity and femininity is a challenge.
[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:16.040]   She was raised as wanting to contribute and wanting to contribute financially.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:21.740]   And so, when she was – she actually came into our marriage – my wife is an amazing
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.340]   manager of money.
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:28.760]   I had made – prior to our marriage, I had made some boneheaded business decisions which
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.760]   haunted me for years.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.480]   I had to work very hard to overcome them.
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:39.080]   Specifically, I let my business get out of whack and let my expenses of my business vastly
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:44.580]   exceed what they should have been and it resulted in my burning a lot of money that I had saved.
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:49.100]   And so, when we actually came into our marriage relationship, she came in with more money
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:53.680]   in her pocket than I did which was really, really frustrating to me because I thought,
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.880]   "Well, I'm supposed to be this great top-notch financial guy.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.800]   I've been studying personal finance for a really long time and I'm supposed to be
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.800]   rich."
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.680]   And I had lost a bunch of money on some bad investments.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:13.440]   I wound up completely – anyway, I lost money and it was a painful experience to me.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:20.280]   And then in paying for the aspects of buying engagement rings and those normal marriage
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:25.120]   expenses and setting up honeymoons and all of that, I spent a majority of the liquid
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.280]   cash that I had.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:31.800]   And I – so it was really humbling that I thought I was Mr. Big Shot Financial Guy and
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.800]   I wound up being the broke one.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.160]   And she came in and she had been diligently saving.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.160]   She never made a lot of money but she'd always been very careful with her expenses
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.000]   and she'd been diligently saving.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.960]   And so we approached it in the beginning of trying to say, "Well, we should – both
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.880]   of us should – we should do everything equally."
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.280]   And that was what I was taught is that we should do everything equally.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:59.320]   We should sit down and one of us, whoever is more financially proficient, should run
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.320]   the budget.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:05.120]   One of us who's more technically capable should be the one to keep the checkbook and
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.120]   all of those things.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.480]   That was how we started.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:12.120]   But what I found was that if I needed to make – let's say I needed to make a business
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:16.860]   decision or if she needed to make a decision with something in the household that was under
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:20.760]   her jurisdiction, then we found that there was a tension there.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:25.900]   And if – and it did her – and it didn't do a lot of good especially once she came
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:31.400]   home when we had our first baby – right before we had our first baby.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.160]   It doesn't do her any good to say, "We got to make more money.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.160]   We're getting broke.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.760]   We got to make more money," when she's taking care of a baby.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.040]   How is it going to work where if she's going to have to take the responsibility of the
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:46.780]   stress of saying, "We don't have a lot of money," and then – but she is not free
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:52.200]   because of her duties with the little baby who needs her all day long if she's not
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.320]   free to go and do the work.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:58.880]   That was what the reality was in that book that I referenced, Man of Steel and Velvet,
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.760]   where the author of that book is really the only place I've ever read it, where he pointed
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:07.040]   out that when you take responsibility, you also have to take authority.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:13.120]   You can't delegate – you can't ask someone to bear a burden without also giving them
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.120]   the authority to do it.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:21.600]   And so once that came down and we realized the stress that it was causing for her to
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.120]   have this divided attention and she would be frustrated, which it's possible.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.160]   I mean I don't know anything about your financial situation.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:33.440]   But what I see so many of my friends doing is they put the stress on their wife and they
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.960]   don't take the responsibility.
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.440]   And one of the things that's always puzzled me as I've searched and looked at the scripture
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:43.020]   and tried to figure out like how do you apply this in a modern way, the thing that's often
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:48.680]   puzzled me is it seems to me, based upon personal experience, that women are naturally more
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.800]   capable than men.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.960]   My wife is, I believe, she just seems much more capable than men.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.200]   From the earliest age, girls seem to mature faster than boys.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:02.320]   And so she's more technically competent, she's in some ways more rational, she's
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:07.040]   more thoughtful, she has a better ability to control her urges and her impulses.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.160]   And so I think, "God, it doesn't make any sense.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:14.920]   Why on earth would you tell me to be responsible and her to work with me in that?
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.880]   Why don't I just put it onto her?"
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.680]   But what I also see is that I see that men, we don't want the responsibility.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.440]   And this is the best I've come up with at this point, is that the reason that God places
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:30.840]   the responsibility on men is because it touches that thing that we don't want to touch.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.960]   Men find it easy to run away from their families, to run away to their golf game, find it easy
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.000]   to say, "I'll just dump it on my wife.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   Here, honey, here's the paycheck.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.040]   Now I'm going to go do my thing."
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:45.240]   And so by me being responsible, it forces me to confront the reality of the situation
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.400]   that I'm in.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.720]   So I don't – so those are the principles.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.840]   When it comes to actual application, that's about where I would stop in terms of giving
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:27:04.080]   advice to people because I don't see – I don't draw from those principles a specific
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.080]   rule.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:10.920]   I would not go to somebody and say, "You can't do part-time work."
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.800]   I think if I were to say that, that would be anti-biblical.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.360]   So for example, the scripture, the reference there is that's often referenced, Proverbs
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:23.720]   31 is an amazing account of what the Bible holds out as the ideal woman.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.320]   And the ideal woman is a woman of business.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:29.520]   And so you ask yourself, how does this – how is this applied?
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:34.280]   It's not from the – I would – I personally would not at this point in my understanding,
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:40.760]   I would not apply it in terms of a rule of saying, "No, you shouldn't do a business
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.840]   or you shouldn't use this skill that you have or you shouldn't use this ability that
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:45.840]   you have."
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.360]   I don't have any rule associated with it.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:53.640]   What I would – how I would apply it is if I met your husband or any husband that was
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:59.520]   a Christian, if I found out that they were placing a responsibility on their spouse to
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:05.000]   support the family financially, and if that responsibility to support the family financially
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.400]   is interfering with the ability to love your children, to love the family, I would believe
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.880]   – I believe that would be a problem.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:20.560]   And that's where I would privately, if the person were open, I would privately encourage
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:21.920]   them, "Listen, you need to do this."
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.640]   I believe that for the sake of my children, and I've seen this worked out and my wife
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.700]   and I were talking, because after last week's show, I said, "Oh man, I just – I opened
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.640]   up a can of worms."
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.120]   I didn't necessarily intend to get into that.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.880]   It's hard for me to talk about some of those private things.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.120]   I'm not used to it.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.760]   And I went and we were talking about it all again and I said, "Are you happier?
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.040]   Do you feel happier?"
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.640]   And she said, "Absolutely.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.360]   It's better."
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:50.660]   And when I – I'm going to bring what I'm saying to a close here just with – for me
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:55.960]   and for us, I believe it would be a better result in our family.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:03.480]   If I didn't have earning capacity, I believe it would be a better result in our family
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:09.320]   for me to go and get two jobs if I had to, and for my wife to be caring and pouring into
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.800]   the lives of our kids.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:15.080]   I believe that would be what I would – what we would choose to do rather than to say,
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.640]   "Okay, we both got to go and work."
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.160]   Now, thankfully, I also believe there are options.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:25.560]   For example, if we would move into a smaller apartment, we would move into a cheaper lifestyle
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:30.920]   before we would force her to go and earn income.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:34.520]   And the challenge that I've had is trying to sort it through.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.520]   Just this morning, I was reading a book by Mary Eberstadt.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:43.240]   I think I may have mentioned it before, but the book was called Adam and Eve After the
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.720]   Pill, The Paradoxes of the Sexual Revolution.
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.900]   And what's interesting to me is to go through, because there's such a political orientation
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:54.640]   for people trying to promote an agenda, I've been interested to go through and try to read
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:59.000]   what is some of the research on children, the presence of a father, the presence of
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   a mother.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.280]   And it's always difficult to filter through the political agenda as compared to the actual
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:09.280]   facts, the sociological health of the family and of the children.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:14.240]   So I'll shut up now, Erica, and just let you respond and ask further questions.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.720]   Was that anything like what you were thinking about, asking about?
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.480]   Absolutely.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.600]   And I actually have a little bit more dialogue with that.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:26.520]   But what I find so helpful for this as a woman and as a wife is it's really hard to get into
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:31.920]   your own husband's head, because they feel certain obligations to not put a burden on
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:37.360]   you by saying that, "I'd rather have you home," and not working, because the man might
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:41.880]   feel that then they're telling the wife that they can't work outside of the house.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.600]   And it just gets, when you're so deep in a relationship, sometimes it's hard to know
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:51.640]   how much you're trying to satisfy and please the other person's needs versus what you actually
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.520]   want and what you need out of a relationship.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:59.480]   So I really appreciate seeing a strong husband's perspective on this as well and hearing from
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:02.160]   your wife.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.680]   Looking to all of that, too, it's actually funny, because Proverbs was the first one
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:13.440]   that I read when I got the New Geneva Bible, and I actually saw Proverbs 31 as the man
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:18.400]   has gathered and hunted, and then within the household, the woman has then made the most
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.400]   of it.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.000]   And I actually saw that as more the role of the woman helping within the household, as
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.560]   opposed to going out and doing business deals that are outside of the family's business.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:31.080]   So I find it interesting that you see that as more supportive of the working outside
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.080]   of the home.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.560]   But there's a million and one different interpretations.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:42.720]   Let me respond to that real quick, or to both of those things, because they're both valuable
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.720]   things.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:47.600]   And I want to just make a note of the question that you were going to go on with.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:55.880]   First, as far as the men, what you identified as far as husbands saying to their wives,
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:32:01.320]   I see this as it's a real challenge in our culture, and that's what I talked about in
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.480]   many ways being feeling neutered.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.000]   I personally have a real burden for men.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.280]   And burden, I use that term, that's a Christian-ese term, but meaning I feel a calling, a responsibility,
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:16.400]   a desire, a goal, a burden.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.320]   It's not a negative thing when I say a burden.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.200]   It means like it's something that's just on my heart.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:23.380]   It's one of those things that's important to me.
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:27.600]   And so that's why I started my other show, Encouraging Christian Fathers.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:33.840]   And frankly, in many ways, I don't particularly desire to speak to women in the sense that
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:38.440]   I believe that if men would stand up and if they would lead and if they would be worthy
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.000]   of respect, that's the primary responsibility.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.520]   I don't believe it's my responsibility to go and tell a lot of other people, especially
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:50.040]   – I don't believe it's my responsibility to go out and try to preach to women.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:56.440]   I find that the men are generally the problem, and so I want to speak to men.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.360]   And what you identified, though, is exactly kind of when I shared last week, I shared
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:05.600]   the story of my friend and I said, "This is the same thing that is happening."
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:12.080]   And I have seen this continually in close relationships, people who I care about.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:17.840]   And as a product of the feminist revolution, as a product of – let's just stick with
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:26.160]   that – we as men have been raised and trained to be respectful and careful and not to exclude
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.160]   women.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.960]   And so what happens now is instead of a man being willing to lovingly say to his wife,
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.160]   "Listen, honey, you don't have to work," we always have to say, "You don't have
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.040]   to work unless you want to, and I want to make sure that you have everything that's
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.040]   there."
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.040]   Now, I don't know how to solve that problem.
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:43.800]   All I know is that in the context of a loving relationship with personal communication between
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:49.920]   husbands and wives, as they continue to communicate, if I encourage men to serve and to love their
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:54.640]   wives, I believe that the women will respond and they'll be able to work it out as communication
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.960]   skills grow.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:01.920]   But you're exactly right with your analysis, is that even to this day, I personally am
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:07.920]   very, very careful of the demands that I place upon my wife, and I'm very, very cautious.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.420]   Now, I think that's a right thing to do.
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:12.700]   Love is always with caution.
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:17.980]   As I said, I hope clearly last week, I'm not making a major financial decision without
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.260]   my wife.
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:25.940]   I'm not going to do it because she's there as knowing me, and she's a wise source of
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.140]   counsel.
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:28.900]   So I'm not going to make a major decision.
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:32.020]   I'm not going to say, "I'm going to go and do this thing here," unless she's
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:35.940]   on board with that because that's part of my safety net.
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.180]   But if something goes wrong, I'm not blaming her.
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:39.740]   It's my fault.
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:42.620]   So you identified the issue.
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:50.020]   With regard to Proverbs 31, it is an interesting passage and I'm not prepared at the moment
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:55.500]   to do a full exegesis to use Christianese words of like, pull it all out.
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:35:02.780]   I think it's true and I guess the biggest thing that you see in Proverbs 31 is you see
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:08.340]   that it is one scripture passage from which you can draw the principle that the woman
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:14.300]   is a homemaker, she's focused on her home and her husband is known in the gates.
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:21.780]   And when both of those roles are fully committed to and fully appreciated, it leads to incredible
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:22.780]   results.
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:27.300]   It would not be possible for me to build radical personal finance.
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:30.500]   It would not be possible for me to fulfill my calling of the things that I'm called
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:35.820]   to do if my wife were not fully on board with it and if I didn't have the confidence that
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:37.940]   my home was well taken care of.
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.740]   And so it's a valid point.
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:44.900]   I'll have to go back and take a look again.
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:46.540]   I haven't read that scripture in a while.
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:49.980]   Go ahead with your next question and response, please.
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:54.140]   I guess that in response, when you were talking about your wife feeling better when she wasn't
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:59.220]   stretched so thin to so many areas, I personally stretch myself in so many areas that that's
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:04.860]   why I feel like it's hard to do anything to the standards that I require.
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:10.700]   My house isn't how it should be for either myself or for my husband or for our two kids.
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:15.100]   As a man building a business, you think it really helps to have the whole house under
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.100]   control?
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:19.540]   And that makes you feel less concerned?
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:20.940]   Without question.
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:26.180]   And one of the concepts that I think is so powerful is many times people feel in our
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:35.500]   modern culture, we've accepted the idea that being a father or being a mother is somehow
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:41.540]   less valuable than other functions and other work in society.
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:45.100]   And so as I always prefer to do, I'll speak to fathers.
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:52.100]   If my job or my business is conflicting with my family, I will not do it no matter what.
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:57.140]   There is not a job opportunity in the world that if it conflicts with my family and causes
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:00.500]   me to not have to do it, I won't take it.
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.300]   Best example, I always wanted to be a truck driver.
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.780]   I always thought it would be so fun to be a truck driver.
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:09.700]   There's not a chance in the world that I would be a truck driver with having a wife and kids.
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:14.840]   I'd be on the road 13 days out of 14, home for one night every two weeks or a couple
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:19.060]   nights every few weeks, calling home every night for an hour.
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:20.820]   That's simply not going to work.
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:25.380]   I would rather in my order of priorities, I believe and I would counsel men who are
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:26.380]   in the situation.
[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:29.700]   I'm not saying that – there's lots of men who are stuck in this situation, but I would
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:35.980]   rather that we live in a very humble house and we don't have a car and I take whatever
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:41.780]   job I'm suited for that has me home in the evening and during the night and during the
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:42.780]   day.
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:47.300]   I fear right now as we record this, we're in the middle of a political election season.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:52.540]   I would never even consider running for a political – I wouldn't really consider
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:55.940]   running for a political office, but I wouldn't even consider running for political office
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:38:01.060]   when I had young children because if you think about the plight of a politician when they
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:07.340]   have young children, you're going to miss five years, ten years of your child's life.
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:09.020]   For me, that's a categorical no.
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:13.260]   Being president of the United States is not nearly as important as loving and serving
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.260]   my children.
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:17.740]   I love and serve my children, but I would never consider running for the presidency
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:18.740]   of the United States.
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:19.740]   I would never consider running for the presidency of the United States.
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:20.740]   I would never consider running for the presidency of the United States.
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:21.740]   I would never consider running for the presidency of the United States.
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:22.740]   I would never consider running for the presidency of the United States.
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:23.740]   I would never consider running for the presidency of the United States.
[00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:24.740]   I would never consider running for the presidency of the United States.
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:25.740]   I would never consider running for the presidency of the United States.
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:26.740]   I would never consider running for the presidency of the United States.
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:27.740]   I would never consider running for the presidency of the United States.
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:28.740]   I would never consider running for the presidency of the United States.
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:29.740]   I would never consider running for the presidency of the United States.
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:30.740]   I would never consider running for the presidency of the United States.
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:31.740]   I would never consider running for the presidency of the United States.
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:35.560]   That is my first and foremost responsibility and calling.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.860]   And that's job number one.
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.220]   And you can't offer me a job that's gonna hinder that
[00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:41.700]   and expect me to take it.
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.740]   Money is not my determinant of success.
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:47.460]   And again, this is based very clearly on biblical teaching.
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.740]   First, just two biblical passages.
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:53.180]   One, Paul says, "What is a profit of man
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:56.300]   "if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul?"
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.900]   So I never place money and finance and business
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:01.140]   at the top of my scale.
[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:03.060]   Number two, even a subset of that,
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.820]   what is a profit of man if he gains the whole world
[00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:05.900]   and loses his family?
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:08.820]   And so here's where in ministry,
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:12.940]   every single one of my credentials for ministry,
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:16.860]   for being able to be involved and respected
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:19.620]   in the working of the church is based upon my family.
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:21.180]   And it's based upon my character.
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.140]   It's not based upon how much money I have.
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:25.060]   The only scriptural qualifications regarding money
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.260]   is that I'm a generous giver
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.900]   and that I'm able to support my family.
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.580]   Those are the only qualifications.
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.880]   But there's no dollar figure,
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.220]   there's no relative wealth scale attached to that.
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:36.620]   But if my household is not under authority,
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:37.940]   if my household is not functioning,
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:40.580]   if my wife is not loved, if my children are rebellious,
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:43.800]   then I'm completely disqualified from everything else.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:48.020]   So for fathers first, those are all of my responsibilities.
[00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:49.560]   And the same thing is true for mothers.
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.740]   And so what I have a heart for
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:56.300]   is that we've lost so much the ability
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.100]   to conceive of being a father or a mother
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.240]   in even a professional capacity.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.280]   So you used to take classes on home economics,
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.080]   you used to take classes on things of family.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:10.200]   Today, all of that has been traded for a career orientation.
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.220]   But like my wife, when I look at what she's able to do,
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:16.220]   I'm amazed at what she's able to do with our children.
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.720]   I mean, she does preschool with my son.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.080]   My son is two and a half years old
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.560]   and she's able to sit down with him.
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:23.760]   We spent hours reading with him, doing preschool with him.
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.400]   At two and a half years old,
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.920]   we were looking at a book that's called
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.840]   "What Your Child Should Know in Kindergartener."
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:31.040]   And my son, at this point, two and a half,
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.600]   can, I can't, let me be careful
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.880]   'cause I don't wanna oversell it.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:39.440]   But he's able to do many of the things
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.680]   that a kindergartner should be able to do.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.420]   He knows all his colors, he knows his shapes,
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:45.660]   he knows all of the sounds of his A through Z.
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:46.960]   We haven't really done the song,
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.080]   but we went with, to teach him to read,
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.000]   we went with the sounds first instead of the letters.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   He can count, I think he's up to 17 now.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.680]   We skipped one to 10 and we just said,
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:56.720]   we're gonna teach you one to 100.
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.400]   So he loves to count, he loves to sing.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.200]   Like, all of these things that she can do,
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.480]   but those are all so time consuming.
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.120]   And then the little character things.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:07.080]   So, sitting down and teaching, you know,
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.240]   for him, teaching my son, teaching Sterling,
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.720]   saying, okay, time to put away toys.
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.020]   Well, when he was one and a half
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:14.640]   and it was time to put away toys,
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.720]   it was about a 35 minute process.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:17.840]   And I don't, he doesn't wanna do it.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:18.800]   Well, he wants, okay.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.920]   So, for her, at that point,
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.280]   even before my daughter was able to be built,
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.960]   there was one time where she sat on the floor with him,
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.040]   patiently, working with him,
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.320]   until he was able to put away his toys.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.140]   That's not possible if you don't have the time.
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:35.760]   Now, I look at that and I look at the character
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:39.320]   that's being sown in his life, by her presence in his life.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:42.000]   And I look at the discipline of his self-discipline,
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.540]   his ability to control his emotions,
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:45.320]   ability to follow through on a task.
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.680]   And I fast forward that and I say,
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:50.000]   where is he gonna be at 30 years old?
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.320]   I would not be, and I always, I hate to sound arrogant,
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:56.560]   but I have to be accurate.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:00.480]   So, please recognize this with a spirit of humility.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.760]   But I would not be the man I am
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:08.080]   without the love and care of my parents.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.460]   Most importantly, in different ways,
[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:12.800]   but especially in those early years of my mom.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.400]   And there were those years of her pouring into me
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.000]   and her holding me accountable.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.400]   And those things, when you study childhood development,
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.120]   you see how in the first few years of a child's life,
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:26.920]   that completely transforms the course of a child's life.
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.760]   And so, when I look at investments,
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.920]   and we talk to my wife sometimes,
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.760]   I talk about all the things that are going on with the show.
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.760]   And we talk about it and I say, you know what?
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.120]   Comparatively speaking, let's say that you go get a job
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.000]   outside the house and you're earning income.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.080]   That would be what our society
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.840]   would respect on a broader basis.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:46.680]   What do you do?
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:48.600]   Oh, I'm an advertising executive or whatever.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.320]   That would be what our society would respect.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.600]   But what are we gonna do with the money?
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.120]   Okay, we're gonna pay a bunch of money in taxes,
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:55.940]   and we're gonna save some money
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:57.520]   and put it in a retirement account.
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:00.660]   How much, it's also, however, what about this?
[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:03.140]   Let's sow into our kids so that they don't need us,
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:04.880]   so they're not boomerang children,
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.400]   regressing into our home as a spoiled brat,
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:11.380]   25-year-old boy who has never learned how to be a man.
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:12.840]   Let's teach him how to be a man,
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.800]   and then we don't have to incur that financial expense
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.400]   of supporting our boomerang child for 11 years.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.000]   Or let's sow into our children a relationship.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.240]   Where, like, to this day,
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:23.840]   if my parents had any financial need whatsoever,
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.960]   I would, in a second, and someday I hope to do this,
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:27.800]   they're at a stage of life
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.240]   where they are enjoying their independence,
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.520]   but someday I hope they will come and live with my family
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:32.840]   and live with our other children.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:35.040]   And it's not from a begrudging,
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.840]   oh, I've gotta do it for my parents.
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.800]   It's because of the relationship that's sown
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.140]   and that's built that I have this relationship with them
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:43.480]   where I want them to be involved in my life.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:44.400]   That wouldn't have happened
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.960]   if my dad were off conquering political campaigns
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:51.400]   and my mom were off earning lots of money.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:57.120]   Last week, I took a road trip with my dad,
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.360]   and he goes to some of my conferences with me now.
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.120]   His work schedule now is very flexible.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.360]   And he goes to some of my conferences.
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.200]   The only reason he comes is so that we can ride in the car
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.040]   and talk together.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:07.900]   And so last year, we went to Texas together,
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:10.920]   and I think we played one hour of audio the whole trip,
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.560]   there and three hours or so back.
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:14.660]   The rest of the time, we were talking.
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:15.500]   We went up to Tennessee.
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:17.600]   We played about two hours of something to listen to,
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.440]   and the rest of the 24 hours together in the car,
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:21.280]   we were talking.
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:24.040]   And so that type of relationship doesn't come by accident.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.080]   That type of relationship with my children
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.720]   is not gonna come if I'm out earning lots of money
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:33.560]   and it only comes with intention.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:35.960]   And so I consider myself first and foremost
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:37.160]   a professional father,
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.360]   and my wife is first and foremost a professional mother.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:43.240]   And we make decisions within that context
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:46.240]   that are gonna allow us, I hope, and I pray, and I trust,
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.880]   and it's my confidence that are gonna allow us
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:50.960]   to build the type of family that we wanna have.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.800]   But it's not gonna happen if we're stuck
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.160]   in this US-American, Western mindset
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.720]   where everything's about the money that we earn
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.800]   and we're judged based upon the salary.
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:02.480]   I reject those things as valid standards of comparison.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:07.120]   - That is incredibly helpful.
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.280]   Thank you so much.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:12.320]   I find myself torn between what's demanded of me
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.100]   based on my education and what I feel
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.560]   that I should be doing.
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:18.120]   And I think that I'll be saving this episode
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:20.640]   or the replay on my phone to remind me
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.440]   just what the value of that professional mother is
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:26.000]   because it is so crucial.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.320]   Yet, whether out of fear, or guilt, or ignorance,
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:30.920]   so many people who have made the choice
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:34.180]   to also work outside of the home just cut that down.
[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:39.180]   And it's rare to hear such a strong encouragement
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:41.360]   of that importance, so thank you.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.200]   - Absolutely.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:47.200]   It's kind of you to give me the platform.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:50.440]   I feel so strongly about it.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.920]   And I don't think the answer is,
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.760]   it's not as cut and dried as to say,
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.800]   well, here's the rule.
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.360]   I can't stand the rule of, well,
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.640]   you can't work outside the home,
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:02.120]   or you can't run a home-based business,
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.160]   or you can't do this.
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:06.120]   My way of approaching it is to say,
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:09.120]   capture the vision, understand the principles,
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:13.120]   and then in your or my specific situation,
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.480]   what can we do within that?
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:20.280]   And so I think there's a way at which you,
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.000]   in your situation, with your skills,
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.600]   and your gifts, and your experience,
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.000]   and your perspective, there's a way,
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.120]   and there's wisdom.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.800]   And this is where one of the most important things
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:35.400]   for Christians is to recognize that the wisdom of God
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.160]   is not found in just simply saying,
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.000]   okay, you must, thou shalt do this,
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.320]   or thou shalt not do that.
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:44.920]   The entire Christian doctrine,
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.480]   the entire doctrine of Christianity,
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:51.480]   the whole reason Jesus Christ died and rose again was,
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.680]   and he says it, you read through the Gospels,
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.120]   Jesus says, I'm going away
[00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:58.560]   so that I can send the Holy Spirit.
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.280]   And it's the Holy Spirit who gives us wisdom
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.280]   in our specific situations.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.600]   And so I always wrestle with this challenge
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:07.720]   on radical personal finance of how do I,
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.200]   share some ideas that will be helpful
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.760]   from the perspective of vision and principles
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:19.160]   while making sure that individuals are free
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:21.960]   in their own situation to respond to that.
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:23.280]   So there's a practical way,
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:26.120]   with the perspective, again, that I have for me.
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:28.760]   Family is my major calling.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:31.600]   It doesn't, finances are not my major calling.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:32.760]   This is my job.
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:33.880]   Now, within that situation,
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.960]   how can I practically build my life
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:37.840]   and structure it in such a way
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.280]   that I'm going to be able to fulfill those things?
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.400]   It's not based upon,
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:43.160]   I have to work more than 40 hours a week
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.680]   or less than 40 hours a week.
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:45.520]   It's not based upon,
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.200]   I have to do this type of job or another.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:50.760]   It's based upon, in my situation, with my family,
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:55.080]   based upon our vision and our vision,
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.800]   what's the wisdom for us?
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:59.720]   And that's what has led systematically over the years
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:01.200]   to me making the steps.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.640]   That was one of the components of that
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.160]   was radical personal finance.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.840]   Radical personal finance allows me to be more free.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.600]   I believe it has higher income potential
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:13.080]   when compared to a per hour unit of work input.
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.760]   And I could see,
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.880]   at the stage I was at with my children's lives,
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:18.480]   and this was another thing
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.080]   about what is the age of my children.
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:22.160]   At the stage I was at with my children,
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:25.720]   in their ages when I made the transition,
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:28.520]   we felt that was the appropriate stage for me to do it.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:30.200]   And so in that first year,
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.440]   when I was putting in a lot of hours,
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:34.120]   one of the things that was valuable
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:35.640]   was I was putting in all those hours from home.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.200]   So I was working a lot,
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.680]   but I was still able to be involved
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:40.200]   in the functioning of my family.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.280]   We still ate two,
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:43.400]   I was home for all the meals,
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:46.040]   but we usually eat two meals together as a family,
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.320]   breakfast and dinner.
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.720]   I usually skip lunch and keep working, just have a snack.
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:52.320]   But we ate two or three meals together every day.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:55.200]   I'm still involved with that daily flow of my family.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:57.640]   I'm not cut off on the road for weeks at a time.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.480]   If radical personal finance had required me
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:02.000]   to be on the road for weeks at a time, I wouldn't do it.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:02.960]   And in fact, recently,
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:06.240]   I thought I wanted to start doing more public speaking.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.800]   And I've just come to the decision
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.760]   that I don't wanna be out of the house.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.960]   I don't wanna be out of the house for three days here
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.440]   and five days here to fly to Cincinnati and give a speech.
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:16.280]   I'm not gonna do it.
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:17.200]   I don't need to do it.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.320]   And it's not worth it because now, especially,
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:21.360]   my children are starting to get to that age
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:24.520]   where there's that major transition from mommy to daddy.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:28.080]   And that's where my influence is so important.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:30.280]   And there's that transition that happens
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.280]   with parents in the household.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:34.960]   So all that to say that it's been
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:37.560]   a systematic part of our plans.
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:42.560]   And if I can't, the rules that I have on the business,
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:44.400]   if I can't do it with the amount of time
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:47.240]   I'm willing to allocate to it, I'm not gonna do it.
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:49.960]   I'm not gonna play this game of I'm gonna work seven hours,
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:52.200]   seven days a week and work 100 hours a week
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.640]   just to somehow make more money,
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.400]   to look more impressive to people on the internet.
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:56.240]   Not a chance.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:01.360]   If I become the most impressive person on the internet
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:04.800]   and I become the wealthiest podcaster and financial advisor
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:07.720]   and impact millions, and if I don't know my children,
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:09.540]   I consider that failure.
[00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:12.460]   So I believe there's wisdom in our specific situations
[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:14.920]   that you and your husband can look and say,
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:16.880]   what's the wisdom at this time in life
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.920]   based upon our unique skills and abilities
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:20.200]   and our situation?
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.040]   What do we need?
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.100]   What do we have to have?
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:23.880]   There's a bare minimum.
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:26.040]   But I tell you, many of the friends and people
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:29.000]   that I've counseled, if people have this heart,
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.640]   and that's always the question,
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:32.040]   you gotta have a heart for your children,
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:33.140]   have a vision for your family.
[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:34.620]   But as many people I've counseled,
[00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:39.100]   and big old house, expensive lifestyle,
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:42.140]   lots of fancy looking things that look great
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:43.800]   in your selfie on Instagram,
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:47.020]   nights out with the cocktails at the bar
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:51.800]   and fancy brand new cars, there's another way.
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.240]   And it might involve some decreased consumption.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.160]   It might involve downsizing.
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.880]   It might involve an older car.
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:01.200]   It might involve fewer nights out.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:04.800]   But personally, I believe that's the superior path.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:09.820]   - Thank you, thank you.
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:13.880]   I think I'll probably, as soon as I'm able
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:16.400]   to disentangle myself from my current freelancing,
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:19.880]   I'll probably put on any of the ideas that I have
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.400]   for side hustles.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.180]   I'll wait until my boys are old enough
[00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:24.880]   to start helping me with those.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:26.160]   And considering the three year olds
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.720]   already measuring things with the ruler
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:29.680]   and telling me how long things are,
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:30.600]   shouldn't be that long.
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:31.440]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:34.600]   Erica, that's what I'm most excited about as a father.
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:37.000]   And I'm just starting to see the glimmers of it.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.680]   My kids are two and a half and seven months old.
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.840]   So my baby, she's crawling around,
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:47.360]   and my son, we're just starting to get the glimmers of it.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:50.240]   But what I have been dreaming of
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:53.820]   is how can I have my family and my lifestyle
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:54.780]   fully integrated?
[00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:57.100]   Historically, this was normal.
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:59.780]   In an agrarian society, historically,
[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:01.540]   the family is an integrated unit
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:05.060]   where children and parents are working together.
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:08.720]   And you need the old joke
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:10.740]   about having all the old farm families
[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:13.420]   that had 16 kids because, well, we need the free labor.
[00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:16.300]   That was historically the norm.
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:19.900]   And so even if you look at families
[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:21.800]   who weren't agrarian societies,
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:27.180]   you were much more likely to have a family workshop.
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:29.220]   Dad was a bootmaker,
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:31.460]   and so the kids were involved in that.
[00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:32.540]   When I look at the family,
[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:34.320]   the strength of that as a family perspective
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:35.980]   and the benefit for the children,
[00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:40.220]   I see that as vastly superior to the segregated society
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:41.500]   that we now live in,
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:45.500]   where it's all about measuring everything in economic terms.
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:48.820]   The family is disconnected, purposeful or not, whatever.
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:50.740]   We, practically speaking,
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:52.620]   we're fully disconnected from one another.
[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:53.880]   There's no integration.
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:57.060]   And so what I look at and what I've been choosing
[00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:01.580]   with my business pursuits is how can my kids be active
[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:02.900]   and involved in my business?
[00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:04.380]   And it's gonna mean one thing at five,
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:05.580]   it's gonna mean another thing at 10,
[00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:07.660]   it's gonna mean another thing at 15.
[00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:09.680]   And I don't want to,
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:11.940]   I think a danger that parents have to be very careful of
[00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:16.940]   is to try to make their kids fulfill the parents' dreams.
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:19.420]   It's very dangerous.
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:21.060]   I'm a doctor, or I've always wanted to be a doctor
[00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:22.680]   and attorney, so you've gotta go be a doctor or attorney,
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.660]   or I am a doctor, so you gotta be a doctor.
[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:27.220]   I think we should allow our children
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:29.900]   to express their own personality, their own skills,
[00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:31.100]   their own interests.
[00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:35.500]   But I'm gonna use the family businesses to,
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:38.380]   I'm gonna use those family businesses
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:40.260]   to help them to learn,
[00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:43.060]   not in this disconnected academic way
[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:44.100]   that is commonly taught,
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:45.820]   where everything is pieces of knowledge
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:47.620]   that are disparate and disconnected.
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:51.300]   Rather, life is the point of education.
[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:54.220]   And so, I was even considering some of the conferences
[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:56.780]   I was just talking about and thinking with my wife,
[00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:58.440]   like is my son starting to be old enough
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:53:59.840]   to go to a conference with me?
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:01.040]   If I have a seven-year-old boy
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:03.780]   and any listener sees me at a conference,
[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:05.100]   that's not always gonna be the case,
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:07.060]   but I want my seven-year-old boy,
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:08.480]   or I want my seven-year-old daughter
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:11.580]   to be with me there at a podcasting convention
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:13.460]   or a financial planning conference.
[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:15.260]   And I want them to be able to be there helping me
[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:17.600]   and working with me and seeing that.
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:19.100]   I want them to be learning on the job.
[00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:23.100]   That's one of the reasons why I've chosen to focus,
[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:28.100]   as I transition, chosen investment activities on real estate
[00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:31.580]   because on real estate, it's much more accessible
[00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:33.620]   where I can involve my family.
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:35.500]   And my wife's skills and abilities
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:37.740]   can be extremely well-profiled.
[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:41.820]   I mean, she's the world's greatest finder of deals.
[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:45.980]   And so, if we're trying to fix up a rental house or whatnot,
[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:47.260]   I'm the heavy construction guy.
[00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:48.440]   I can deal with that.
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:50.440]   I can put my kids to work helping me with that
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:53.240]   where they learn those physical skills that are so valuable.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.640]   And meanwhile, my wife is furnishing the house
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:57.360]   and decorating it, and those are her skills.
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.740]   And so now, instead of it being,
[00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:01.880]   well, one of us just goes away and we're totally disconnected
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:03.760]   now we're working and building the family wealth.
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:06.000]   We're building our family empire together.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.320]   And now that practical experience will translate
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:12.560]   to as the children age and transition
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:15.480]   from dependency to autonomy,
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:19.380]   now they'll be equipped with a lot of skills
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:22.700]   that are very applicable to real life.
[00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:24.800]   And they'll be able to take that,
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:26.740]   filter that broad experience
[00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:28.580]   through their own unique personality
[00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:30.220]   and find the right fit for them
[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:31.580]   and for their families going forward.
[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:33.940]   So that's my dream and vision.
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:35.460]   And that's what I'm excited about.
[00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:37.100]   I don't talk a lot about those things
[00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:38.820]   'cause I feel a distinct,
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:42.540]   I don't have a lot of evidence to point to.
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:43.820]   I can only point to other people.
[00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:46.400]   I can't speak authoritatively and say,
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:47.240]   look at my children
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:48.760]   'cause they've achieved these certain things.
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:50.720]   But those are just my dreams and my hopes
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:53.220]   and my vision for me and my family.
[00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:57.040]   - We actually share similar dreams and visions.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:00.480]   My husband actually brought myself and my oldest son
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:03.000]   to a conference when he was seven months old.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.720]   And he was actually able to see it.
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:06.240]   He didn't enjoy it as much as he would
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:07.600]   when he was older.
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:12.080]   But everybody there was very excited to see a child there.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:13.120]   And there were a few other children
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:14.360]   that were brought along as well.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:16.120]   So it's actually, the professional world
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:18.760]   is more open to them than you might realize.
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:20.380]   And we're looking to get into real estate
[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:21.600]   for similar reasons.
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:24.440]   His best friend, his family's in real estate.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:27.240]   And you do see that generational transfer
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.360]   of knowledge and capability and strength
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:32.480]   that you have from learning a business
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:34.080]   at the side of your parents.
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:37.840]   And one that can enable you to really support your family
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:40.840]   in all ways, both financially and with your time
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:42.400]   and with your energy.
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:45.680]   So I have seen some empirical evidence
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:47.160]   that that does work well.
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:50.800]   And that's why we are aiming the same direction as you are.
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:52.600]   - How old are your kids now, Erica?
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:55.320]   - The oldest is three and a half
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:56.880]   and the youngest is almost two.
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:57.720]   - Exciting.
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:00.360]   This is that exciting stage.
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:02.640]   When they're no longer just crawling around
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.860]   and you're able to actually interact with them
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:06.520]   and train them and teach them.
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:08.700]   This is the exciting stage.
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:16.600]   - My personal, I mean, I think that,
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.080]   I mean, the stage that you're in from that,
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:21.360]   four or five-ish, I don't know whether it's four,
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:22.200]   I don't know whether it's five,
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:23.240]   I don't know whether it's seven, who knows.
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:25.040]   Some people make big a deal about these ages.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:28.240]   I think the calendar years are much less important
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:32.560]   than the child's personal maturity level.
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:34.480]   Some children seem to mature so quickly
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:35.320]   and some children don't.
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:40.160]   And how much of that is environmental versus, I don't know.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:45.160]   But I think that age from say five-ish to 12 or 13-ish,
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:49.260]   I mean, those are the years where we transform them
[00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:51.400]   from children into adults.
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:54.680]   And I'm convinced it can happen far sooner than 18.
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:57.320]   I think there's a, I mean, I got a whole podcast.
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:00.040]   That's why I started another podcast
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:02.820]   'cause I didn't wanna mess up
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:04.340]   all of the personal finance stuff
[00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:06.520]   with me constantly sharing what I'm learning,
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:08.920]   what I'm excited about with parenting.
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:12.080]   But I get excited by, I'm excited for you
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:13.120]   and the stage that you're in.
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:16.360]   And it sounds, I mean, you guys are in a wonderful position
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:20.240]   as a family where with your skills and background,
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.120]   the things you can expose your children to
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.640]   and your husband's skills and backgrounds,
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:25.880]   I'm excited for you guys.
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:28.280]   - Thank you very much.
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:30.560]   And I think you've helped me figure out
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:31.880]   where to stop stretching myself
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:34.160]   and where better to apply myself within the family.
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.840]   So thank you so much, Joshua.
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:37.780]   - Ask yourself this question.
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:39.480]   If I earn a little bit more money
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:46.120]   and yet I wind up with a family life
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:49.940]   that doesn't look how I desire it to look,
[00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:52.560]   will that be better?
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:55.240]   Or would it be better to have a little bit less money
[00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:59.280]   and have a family life that looks better?
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:02.080]   Me, every single time,
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:05.000]   and I mean this with every fiber of my being,
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.860]   if I got to the point where I realized,
[00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:12.140]   and this type of thing occurs with an older child,
[00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:16.300]   but let's say that there's a family listening
[00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:18.260]   who their child is in crisis
[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:20.460]   and dads and moms are looking at their child
[00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:22.380]   and they're saying, 10 year old, a 12 year old,
[00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:24.740]   a 15 year old, whatever, these ages at which,
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:27.300]   I mean, look at the rates of suicide among children.
[00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:28.860]   So I'm talking that level of crisis,
[00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:30.600]   or just even you're recognizing
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:32.220]   that family relationships are suffering
[00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:35.980]   and there's not that same intimate interaction,
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:39.220]   that same heart to heart sharing that once was.
[00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:41.340]   I'd cash out every dollar in retirement
[00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:46.260]   and spend every bit of it restoring my child
[00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:49.620]   and doing everything I can for the relationship.
[00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:51.740]   And I believe every listener would too.
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:56.220]   It's just that we only see that when a child gets cancer.
[00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:58.220]   We totally know when the child gets cancer
[00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.640]   and all of a sudden now there's a beautiful young girl,
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:03.340]   a beautiful young boy that's now bald and sickly,
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:06.140]   and we understand, well, mom quit, dad quit,
[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:09.140]   and now they're spending every dime
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:10.620]   on the health of their child.
[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:14.020]   Well, those are tough situations.
[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:16.480]   The thing about cancer, it's easy to see physically,
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.520]   but I say, are we doing the same thing
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:21.220]   with the cancer that is not so physical?
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:22.860]   Are we doing the same thing with relationships?
[01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:25.180]   Are we doing the same thing with the disconnectedness?
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:28.860]   And if more parents would prioritize that family life,
[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:31.200]   which is something that is eternal,
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.520]   as compared to, not eternal in the sense
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:35.520]   of family relationships, but in the sense
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:38.240]   that family relationships are for this lifetime only,
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:43.240]   but from the perspective that the child's soul,
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.560]   that's an eternal good.
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.880]   And it's also a way that you can impact
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:50.860]   that goes far beyond anything that one person can do.
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:52.280]   It's a leveraging ability.
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:57.840]   If we saw the cancer that can happen that's not physical,
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:03.140]   why should we not apply the same focus to it?
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:07.180]   Because the cancer that's physical, it's one thing,
[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:10.100]   but there are relatively few children
[01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:13.820]   who are dying of cancer, and yet how many children
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:16.780]   are dying of lack of love, lack of involvement,
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:20.520]   lack of guidance, and they're being raised by,
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:23.280]   well, anyway, you get the point.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.740]   So I think that if ever there's a question
[01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:30.040]   between finance and family, I'm always gonna elevate family
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:33.660]   above finance, even if it's other people don't understand,
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:34.940]   because the finance is simple.
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:36.660]   It's solvable, and it's doable.
[01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:37.920]   So those would be my answers.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.760]   Erica, I thank you for calling in.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:40.940]   It's an honor to have your questions.
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:44.500]   I hope that I've carefully kept to,
[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:49.140]   this stuff exposes me personally, and I'll tell you,
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:51.200]   many listeners might think I like to talk
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.060]   about controversial stuff, but it's really not.
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:55.080]   It's tough to do it, so I just ask
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:58.100]   that hopefully listeners would hear my heart
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:00.500]   and be willing to consider things
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:02.580]   without attacking me personally.
[01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:04.140]   So Erica, thank you for calling in
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:06.420]   and asking your question, and I wish you guys
