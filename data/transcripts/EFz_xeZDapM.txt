[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.780]   Well, we get a steady stream of questions from mothers of young kids like this one from
[00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.180]   a listener named Beth.
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.380]   "Dear Pastor John, my husband and I are new parents to a two-month-old son.
[00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.020]   Caring for him has been joyful and exhausting.
[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.620]   I can barely concentrate on anything I used to, but I need the Lord more than ever to
[00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.120]   sustain me.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.700]   What counsel do you give new mothers on continuing their walk with God?"
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:36.900]   Well, I'm not a mother, never have been, but I lived with one for 47 years.
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.780]   I still live with one.
[00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:48.300]   And I watched her be a young mother with five children, four of them born into the family,
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.200]   one of them carried into the family at eight weeks.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.660]   And I do try to read my Bible with an eye to what is helpful for moms and dads and everybody
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.660]   else.
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.000]   So here are a few pieces of counsel from experience and from the Word, and they may not be the
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.580]   most important, but they're off my prayerful front burner.
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:19.620]   Number one, never lose sight, Beth, never lose sight of the fact that your walk with
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:32.460]   God is as essential for the good of your child as is your milk or the formula that you may
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.500]   be giving him.
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.220]   Children do not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes out of the mouth of
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.220]   God.
[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:48.460]   If you lose your communion with God, you will lose not only a source of strength for the
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:58.340]   sake of parenting, but you will lose the very thing you want most to impart to this child.
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:05.180]   And you want him to know God more than you want him to live, namely a relationship with
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.060]   God.
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.940]   You want him to taste and see that God will be sufficient to meet all his needs, including
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.460]   his needs for his own parenting.
[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:23.640]   And if you lose God while parenting, the very thing you want to give him most you have lost.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:32.820]   So that's how important it is for you to fight for whatever it takes to maintain a sweet,
[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.740]   growing, satisfying walk with your God.
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:45.220]   Number two, don't let this little boy become a little emperor.
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:52.060]   I see far too many parents who are dominated by their children, out of control on airplanes,
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.660]   out of control in restaurants, out of control in the mall.
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.620]   All the trouble that these parents have spared themselves at home by not disciplining comes
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.180]   back on their own heads in public, and it will come back with a vengeance on their children's
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.260]   heads later in life.
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:18.020]   Children are designed, intended by God to be submissive and to be obedient to their
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.300]   parents.
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.020]   They are not intended to dominate the house, dominate relationships, dominate when company
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.940]   comes over.
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.340]   And it's important for them to learn this early, because if they think they are the
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:42.540]   center of the world, it will be hard to break them of this destructive illusion later on.
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:51.540]   Practically, that means that the child doesn't so rule your schedule that you don't have
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.140]   time for what you need to do for your own soul.
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.660]   He does not need your ever-present attention.
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.740]   You can show him lavish attention and provide him with all the affection and touch he needs
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:15.860]   without training him that you have to respond to every time he has a peep in his crib.
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:23.620]   God loves us lavishly, and as part of that love, he makes sure we know we're not the
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.620]   center of the universe.
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.500]   That's what love does.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:37.820]   Let your child become secure not in your ever-present hovering, but in the certainty that you always
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.980]   return in love.
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.200]   Number three, turn all your practical mothering into worship.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.260]   Make the food, change the diapers, push the stroller, whatever you do, whether you eat
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.140]   or drink or play peekaboo with your baby, do all to the glory of God.
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:02.820]   And that means, I think, practically, as you're doing it, all these things, hundreds of them.
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.580]   Number one, depend upon the sustaining, empowering, guiding grace of God.
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.220]   Two, give thanks for all the blessings of this child and your strength to care for him.
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.140]   Three, be amazed at the miracle that he is and what he's becoming and turn your amazement
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.460]   into praise.
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:29.860]   Four, when you become irritable, confess it and honor God with your confession and
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:36.740]   your reception of promised forgiveness and constantly pray, pray, pray.
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.380]   That's how you make your days an act of worship.
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:49.580]   And then there may not be in your mind such a huge gulf between tending to your child
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.500]   and tending to your soul.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:59.740]   Number four, stay in church and be involved with other people.
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.780]   Beware of withdrawing into solitude with the child.
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.700]   You need other people.
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.700]   The Bible makes that plain, especially in 1 Corinthians 12.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.240]   And that need doesn't go away just because children come into the house.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:23.860]   So strap that baby on and be out and doing with other people, especially be in worship
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.180]   and be in fellowship around God's word.
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:36.460]   I can remember 44 years ago with our first child, Karsten, born in Germany.
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:47.360]   And as soon as we brought that chubby little beached whale home and tried to learn how
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.480]   to be parents, as soon as we got him home, we went straight to our Friday night small
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.640]   group meeting, which we did every Friday night while we were in Germany.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:01.840]   It was our lifeline because our church life wasn't as good as we'd want it to be, but
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.120]   we had a small group.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.520]   So we would get there early in the evening.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.040]   The baby would either have already eaten or we would feed him there while everybody else
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.040]   was eating.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:16.880]   Then when it was time to study and pray, we would lay him down, tummy down, put on a double
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.920]   bed, put a pillow on four sides of him, pat his bottom and walk out of the room and leave
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.400]   him there for the next three hours.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.720]   And then we would take the bus home.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.020]   We had no car in Germany and put him to bed at home at 11 o'clock.
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:37.480]   And he never woke up between seven in the morning usually, or if he was very young,
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.580]   yes, he would have to wake up and eat for a while.
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.200]   So don't let the baby slow you down.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.200]   Do what you need to do for your own souls.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:52.680]   Number five, negotiate with your husband to take turns in getting up in the middle of
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.680]   the night.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.080]   He should know you need sleep as much as he does.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.840]   God's ideal for child rearing is two parents.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.660]   There's a reason for that.
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.780]   So tell your husband that I said he should help you.
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.440]   Make room in your schedule not only for rest, but also for reading.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.280]   And that leads me to the last thing I want to say.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:23.840]   Read Bible-saturated books, and the most Bible-saturated book is the Bible, but read others as well,
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.040]   maybe audio books while you're working.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:34.040]   And the reason is this, the book of Proverbs begins, chapter one, verse eight, "Hear, my
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:44.120]   son, your father's instruction, and forsake not your mother's teaching."
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:53.040]   Your responsibility is to pour glorious, wonderful teaching about God and His ways and His world
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.240]   into the mind of this little child.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:03.800]   So don't fail the child by failing to read and grow in what you need to teach him about
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.500]   God and about life.
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:14.160]   So I pray that the Lord will give you the strength and the wisdom that you need to take
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:22.800]   up this perhaps greatest of all tasks, raising this child in the nurture and discipline of
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.800]   the Lord.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.800]   Amen.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.800]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.480]   And if you're a dad, be sure to check out one of my favorite APJ episodes of all time,
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:36.560]   titled "Dad's Role in Homemaking," which is episode number 255 on leading the family into
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.560]   joy.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.760]   It is so good, episode 255.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.360]   And as you can hear, we're still working through some audio issues on Pastor John's end, but
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.280]   I think we may have them fixed.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.480]   So thank you for your patience over the last couple of weeks.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.480]   We appreciate it.
