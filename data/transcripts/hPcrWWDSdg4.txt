[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560]   I abandoned social media,
[00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.000]   but now I feel left out and forgotten.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   Since I now barely have an online existence,
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.920]   people tend to make plans that don't include me.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.360]   And when I do send somebody a message
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.340]   to arrange a meetup,
[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.160]   my energy gets sapped waiting for the replies.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.480]   Most of my friends communicate through social media,
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.660]   so my old way of communicating gets lost.
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.520]   How can I still live a meaningful social life
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.640]   with this quandary?
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.080]   - So what do you think,
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.240]   I don't know if it's a he or she,
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.080]   let's say he.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.960]   What do you think he means by his friends
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.520]   make plans mainly using social media?
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.040]   What tool is he talking about?
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.380]   Because he separates out messaging, which he does do.
[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.860]   - Well, you can message on Instagram.
[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.480]   I think a lot of people do that, especially young people.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.160]   - So like using Instagram instead of like iMessage
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.980]   or WhatsApp.
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.360]   - Yeah.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.120]   Using the communication within those apps.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.640]   I know that, like with our guys,
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.960]   my coach, like in high school,
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.960]   they use Instagram messaging a lot.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.320]   - Okay.
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.080]   And this, is this different than, is DM Twitter?
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.920]   - That's DM.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.620]   - Or it's Instagram DM as well?
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.160]   - DMing is-
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.000]   - Direct messaging.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.960]   - That's Instagram.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.800]   - Right.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.680]   Okay.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.560]   So it's like a main way.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.840]   It's why like a lot of people-
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.240]   - And I could see like, you know,
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.680]   parties and stuff like that being announced there,
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.680]   especially on Facebook.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.360]   Like they, people would invite people more our age,
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.800]   but I bet you people use a lot Facebook to make plans
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.320]   and invitations, stuff like that.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.280]   - So Instagram does this.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.280]   TikTok is not a social network, right?
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.360]   So it's not TikTok.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.280]   There you're seeing stuff the algorithm shows,
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.020]   but Facebook, Instagram, maybe Twitter,
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.480]   are probably not as much anymore.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.880]   Like Instagram.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.720]   Okay.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.120]   So I think, my thought here is, okay,
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.260]   perfectly fine use for social media.
[00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.880]   I mean, if your friends are using a messaging feature
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.680]   of let's say Instagram to meet up,
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.640]   then use the messaging feature on Instagram to meet up.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.680]   Just don't use Instagram in other ways.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.000]   Just put up gates about how you want to use it.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.120]   Like this shouldn't be too hard.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.560]   - Yeah. Same with Facebook.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.920]   I mean, if he's a little bit older
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.080]   and a lot of invitations would be sent through Facebook,
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.400]   just go on there a couple of times a week
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.840]   and see if there's any invitations to go.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.680]   - Yeah.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.280]   So go on Facebook, look at invitations.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.860]   Instagram, go on there and look at your DMs.
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.880]   Don't post things.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.000]   Don't really follow anyone except for your friends,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.020]   I suppose, if they're posting something.
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.460]   Don't make Instagram on your phone
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.740]   a default place to go if you're bored.
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.500]   Seek out slow distractions instead of fast,
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.100]   like we talked about in the show.
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.060]   But to use Instagram as sort of a inefficient version
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.040]   of WhatsApp, fine.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.420]   So I'm glad you asked this question
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.900]   because we want to be,
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.720]   when we're thinking about our engagement with the digital,
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.000]   we want to be very intentional, right?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I really try to steer away from more generic prescriptions.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.460]   This is evil, this is good.
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.280]   Never do this, always do that.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.260]   If you read "Digital Minimalism", for example,
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.680]   my book, "Digital Minimalism",
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.520]   I don't go in and say,
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.260]   here's the bad services, here's the good.
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.100]   I don't go in and say,
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.920]   let me talk about how bad of a guy Mark Zuckerberg is.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.540]   You don't want to support his company.
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.960]   I said, figure out what you want to do.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.560]   Figure out the right tools to do that.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.880]   Use those tools to do that.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.920]   And anything else those tools try to get you to do,
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.320]   say, I'm not interested.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.180]   Just take control over how you use your digital life.
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.120]   So there's a chapter in "Digital Minimalism".
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.960]   If you get that book,
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.600]   there's a chapter called "Join the Attention Resistance"
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.960]   that gets to exactly what I think
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.760]   you need to think about here.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.760]   And it's about how do you use the advantageous parts
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.600]   of these giant attention economy platforms
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.160]   without being trapped by the other parts
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.880]   that you're not interested in
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.840]   and that are poised to perhaps capture your attention
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.920]   and make your life worse.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.840]   And to do that is almost like an act of resistance.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.240]   To come into your Instagram,
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.160]   and it's not on your phone, it's on your computer,
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.040]   to come into Instagram, but you haven't followed anybody.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.320]   So there's just like these weird discover stuff
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.480]   that the algorithm chose you could care less about.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.340]   And you jump in, look at the DMs and jump out.
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.000]   To do like I talk about in that book,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.400]   to use a plugin, so you can go into Facebook
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.520]   to see Facebook groups where people are posting
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.040]   about parties, but there's no newsfeed.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.160]   That's the attention resistance.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.240]   You see, I'm keeping control of my attention,
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.840]   and you're not going to take control of my attention
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.720]   by luring me in with these specific really useful features.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.240]   I can use those useful features
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.160]   without having to become a pawn
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.520]   in your attention economy scheme.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.040]   It's like we talked about with YouTube as well.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.080]   YouTube is a great library.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.720]   YouTube is a great cable channel.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.920]   It's a dangerous form of wandering distraction.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.040]   So people come in and use plugins, for example,
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.720]   that get rid of, and this is an example from that chapter,
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.280]   get rid of the recommendations.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.960]   It turns YouTube into like a search engine.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.400]   I know I like "Deep Questions,"
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.680]   and I know the new episodes come out Monday.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.600]   So on Monday, I go and I type into the top
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.080]   "Deep Questions" or "Cal Newport,"
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.600]   and I click on the latest episode and I watch it.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.120]   I use it, it's like turning on the TV
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.640]   and watching a certain show.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.840]   But there's nothing being recommended on the side.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.680]   That's it.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.880]   If I want to do something else, I'll look it up.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.240]   Oh, I want to know how to fix something.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.960]   I search for that thing and I get the video.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.800]   I watch it, I'm done.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.640]   It's a great library.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.520]   Another example of the attention resistance.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.600]   So if your friends are using the communication tools
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.480]   built into social media apps, use those tools,
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.800]   but only use those tools.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.640]   And by doing so,
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.800]   you're sort of giving a metaphorical middle finger
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.240]   to the owners of those companies anyways,
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.640]   which itself is kind of fun.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.360]   I learned something.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.560]   - Yeah. - Communication tools.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.680]   I know journalists talk about it a lot.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.520]   Journalists find this useful because people,
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.280]   a lot of very online people that you might need
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.560]   to like get a quote from for an article or whatever,
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.440]   that's how they contact them.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.040]   Twitter DM.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.040]   It's like, it's something I don't have.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.160]   I think it's been fine,
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.400]   but I think there's a lot of that going on in journalism.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.200]   DMing people's social media accounts
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.360]   to try to contact them.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.000]   Kind of makes me glad I don't have Twitter.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.520]   I think about all the DMs we would get.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.560]   I mean, we already get so many emails.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.840]   Could you imagine?
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.960]   If people had the illusion of like,
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.600]   I could just like directly yell at you about things.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.760]   All right, let's do a call.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.160]   Do we have a call load up?
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.000]   - Yes, we do.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.840]   Here we go.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.640]   - G'day, it's Logan here.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.840]   I'm a Kiwi currently living in the US
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.680]   working as a financial consultant.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.280]   I have a question around decentralized social media.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.600]   I've spent the last five years
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.520]   developing my artistic drawing skills
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.600]   to a proficient level
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.320]   until I could now generate some real revenue.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.080]   I'm not about to quit my day job.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.360]   My question is more about
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.840]   how do I share my content with an audience?
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.400]   How do I monetize it?
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.720]   How do I do this and still maintain control
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.800]   over what I create
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.760]   while not handing over the reins of these things
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.160]   and my audience to a large social media company?
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.120]   Ideally, I would only use social media
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.000]   as a tool to funnel viewership into some other thing.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.720]   Well, I'd love to hear your thoughts.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.960]   I've heard you talk theoretically about this idea,
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.560]   but don't really know how you imagine it
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.000]   to work in practice.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.920]   Cheers for all the hard work, out.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.400]   - All right, Kiwi, that's New Zealand?
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.240]   - I think so.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.080]   - All right, excellent.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.000]   International audience, I like it.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.480]   So what type of art was he saying?
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.360]   He said visual.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.200]   - Yeah.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.840]   - Visual, some sort of digital visual art.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.400]   Yeah, so once again,
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.440]   I don't know that particular world well,
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.440]   but like in my answer to Fab, I believe it was,
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.680]   the Peruvian musician,
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.040]   I'll give a similar answer here,
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.920]   which is, okay, 12 years ago,
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.520]   how did the artists in this general space,
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.320]   how did they get noticed and spread?
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.800]   Go see if you can do that.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.720]   Like that's step one, right?
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.560]   And so it's probably,
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.040]   you're doing something really original,
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.640]   and then maybe it starts in a local gallery.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.040]   Maybe it starts in someone else's sort of showcase
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.120]   that they do.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.000]   That's a starting place.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.520]   Building a digital home is another good idea.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.880]   Build a website.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.160]   You can have a digital home with a website
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.480]   where people can come and see your art, right?
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:33.000]   And then be okay with not trying to play
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.040]   the algorithmic amplification lottery.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.920]   Be okay with I'm working on this art,
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.080]   I'm finding like a slower way of developing this
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:39.960]   and spread it to an audience.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.240]   I have a digital home to point people towards.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.880]   Go to this well-designed website.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.520]   You can see or buy my art.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.200]   You can join my mailing list for updates
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.360]   if you wanna know when new pieces are coming out
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.360]   or for sale.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.000]   And build a following slowly.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.840]   That is a durable following you're going to build.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.240]   It's also, I think, a beneficial feedback loop.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.320]   You have to interact more with people,
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.480]   convince people to let you in their galleries,
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.400]   convince people to buy your work one by one.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.360]   That feedback loop improves your work.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.720]   Okay, maybe this is not really original enough,
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.280]   so I need to do something different here.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.320]   You don't get any of that feedback
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.080]   if you're just posting on Instagram
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.440]   and hoping that like a celebrity influencer
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.760]   repost one of your things
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.280]   and then all these people are interested in your work.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.400]   So like how did people do this 12 years ago?
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.920]   Like do that with a good website and mailing list
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.520]   and be ready for that to be a slow process.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.600]   Again, and I left this out in the fab answer,
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.120]   but the other piece here is the slowness of the process
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.160]   motivates you more
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.600]   because you have to work harder and harder
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.160]   to try to move this thing along.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.280]   When you're just posting stuff on Instagram,
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.600]   you get caught up in what I call checklist productivity,
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.440]   where you feel like the key to a big accomplishment
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.880]   is just following some script
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.640]   that other people don't have access to.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.000]   That in other words, the scarcity
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.200]   that means most people don't succeed is in the information,
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.200]   not in the actual execution.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.520]   And so you could end up in a checklist productivity mode
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.760]   where what you really care about is
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.680]   am I posting on a regular schedule?
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.640]   Do I have good tags and hashtags for the algorithm to hit?
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.280]   Am I spending enough time following other artists
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.680]   and replying so they'll follow me?
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.400]   You get caught up because that's so much easier.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.400]   Checklist productivity, anyone can do it.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.720]   That's so much easier than saying,
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.800]   how do I make this better?
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.040]   This local gallery in New Zealand,
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.280]   you know, they didn't wanna show this.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.320]   Why, how can I make it better so they would?
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.400]   Let me be around more artists.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.240]   Let me meet more artists.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.840]   Let me join or start an artist collective
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.200]   where we're helping and critiquing each other's work.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.280]   The slower approach forces you to focus on quality
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.760]   and lights that fire to keep pushing
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.640]   in a way that when you're just playing
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.160]   the algorithmic amplification lottery,
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.320]   you're like, I don't know, I'm just,
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.600]   what really matters is some clever trick I do
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.000]   in my headline construction.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.320]   That's gonna please the algorithm.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.960]   And all that's energy that could be going towards
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.200]   making your stuff better.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.840]   So for our third and final segment,
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.480]   like take something that's going around the internet
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.320]   and react to it.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.880]   Today I wanna react to a YouTube video
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.240]   that some of our listeners were sending in
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.880]   because it's going around the internet right now.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.720]   I'm looking at it now.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.120]   It has over 1.5 million views.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.640]   And so I thought we would take a look.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:27.640]   For those who are watching instead of just listening,
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.840]   I have it loaded up on the screen here in the corner
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.640]   with the closed captioning.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.640]   So the title of this YouTube video is
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.920]   I'm a 33 year old woman with no life.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.560]   My advice to young women.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.880]   So we have a young woman talking straight to camera.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.520]   Here, I'll read the closed caption at the beginning.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.400]   I wanna give you some advice on how to deal with this
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.600]   and cope with no sense of direction.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.960]   But for now, I kinda wanna just tell you my story
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.280]   of how I got here.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.520]   And it's not long and it's not that sad.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.680]   All right, so then we get a story from this person
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.000]   talking straight to camera
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.400]   about why she is now 33 years old
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.560]   and feels like she has no life.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.440]   So let me summarize.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.280]   I took some notes here.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.040]   Let me summarize the story that she tells.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.920]   Coming out of college,
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.760]   she was interested in digital media,
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.920]   got a good internship in digital media.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.760]   But then when she applied for what she described
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.480]   as fun media department jobs, she didn't get 'em.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.520]   They kept saying, "No, you don't have enough experience."
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.840]   And so not able to get those jobs she desired,
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.120]   she fell back and said, "I'll just do retail."
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.080]   So she kinda fell back for retail jobs.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.240]   Some time passed, an opportunity came up for her
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.040]   to get a quote, "good project manager job."
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.760]   So this is a job with benefits, normal salary.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.880]   I think this was out West.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:53.720]   But then after a little while,
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.160]   she got fired and has no jobs.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.000]   As she says, it was so devastating.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.400]   It's back like she was when she was looking
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.560]   for her original jobs after her internship.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.640]   She's having a hard time finding a solid job.
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.280]   She did some contract work for about eight months.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.600]   But now she says, "It feels like no one wants to hire me.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.920]   "No one wants anything to do with me."
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.640]   Because they feel like she doesn't have the right experience.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.680]   It seems like her new plan,
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.480]   based on what she says in this video,
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.320]   is to make content for YouTube
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.760]   and hope maybe that works out.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.120]   All right, so there's a couple things
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.840]   I wanna talk about here.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.920]   First of all, I wanna say,
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.560]   this is a useful type of video to exist.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.760]   I think having people actually talk about the realities
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:44.120]   of their engagement with the world of work is really useful
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:48.320]   because we don't really get a clear picture,
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.160]   especially young people.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.560]   They don't get a really clear picture about how this works.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.880]   You have sort of abstract books maybe,
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:59.520]   and then you have the typical YouTube TikTok
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.960]   presentation of work,
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.240]   where it's usually a lot of people
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.960]   who make a living on YouTube and TikTok
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.040]   kinda talk about how they make a living
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.920]   on YouTube and TikTok.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:07.760]   And then maybe you get exposed
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.320]   to some sort of celebrity workers,
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:16.120]   famous writers and artists and sports stars,
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:16.960]   this type of thing.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.480]   That's kind of it.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.520]   So we don't really get exposed to a lot of the reality
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.320]   of how the world of work works and what to expect
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.440]   and how hard it can be
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.280]   and how emotionally hard it can be.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.280]   And so to see that and have someone
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.960]   just say it straight to camera,
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.720]   no holds barred, I think is really important.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.240]   Oh, this is how the world of work can work for most people.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.120]   And it's really hard.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.720]   And if you're feeling emotionally drained
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.360]   by your difficulty in the world of work,
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.240]   instead of feeling like you're an outlier,
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.080]   you watch a video like this,
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.600]   you say, yeah, this is, I'm not alone.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.440]   Work is hard.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.480]   We just don't hear those stories.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.240]   Those stories don't get amplified.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.040]   Second, however, I think this video
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.360]   is a good reason to revisit some ideas
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:04.600]   from my 2012 book, "So Good They Can't Ignore You."
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.520]   'Cause I think in addition to being a useful window
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.320]   into the reality of the world of work,
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.480]   this video also gives a reality,
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.240]   a window into the reality of how a lot of people,
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.840]   she's a young millennial,
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.600]   but Gen Z probably feels the same way,
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.960]   but especially millennials, just when we were raised,
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.400]   it gives a window into some of the issues
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.320]   with how we think about work.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.320]   So the model that comes out of this video,
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.920]   at least this was my impression,
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.800]   was a model of work in which you figured out
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.960]   what you wanna do, digital media, whatever it is,
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.560]   and then you wait to get chosen to do it.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.120]   So then someone chooses you,
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.400]   you say, okay, I will let you come
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.680]   and do this for my company.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.920]   They choose you to do it.
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.520]   So it's like getting into college, right?
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.320]   Getting accepted into graduate school.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.600]   And then you're good.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.000]   I got chosen, I put out my applications,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.560]   and someone said, I choose you.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.200]   You get to come into this world now
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.720]   and be a digital media, whatever.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.720]   And if that doesn't happen, then you're kinda lost.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.400]   So you figure out what you wanna do.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.360]   You put yourself out there.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.920]   Hey, can I come do this for you?
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.120]   And either they say yes,
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.000]   and you're happy, or they say no,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.040]   and then you really could end up in a hard situation.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.520]   What's the alternative model to think about this?
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.640]   Well, it's the model from my book,
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.600]   "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.280]   which is based on career capital.
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.800]   It says the whole job industry, the whole job market,
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.680]   it's all about what do you have to offer
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.120]   specifically that's valuable.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.000]   And the collection of your rare and valuable skills,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.480]   your skills that are rare and valuable to the market
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.080]   in general is what we call career capital.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.240]   The more of it you have,
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.560]   the more opportunities and leverage you have.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.720]   And therefore, the whole game,
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.360]   especially right out of college,
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.600]   is building career capital as quickly as possible.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.120]   It changes the way you think about things,
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.440]   because especially when you're young,
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.040]   you're not focused on what do I want my job to do for me?
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.200]   All right, I found this would be,
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.600]   this job has all the things I want.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.160]   I hope they select me.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.240]   And instead turns it around and say,
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.720]   what can I offer to the jobs?
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.120]   Well, not much yet because I'm new.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.760]   So let me get my foot in the door somewhere
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.720]   and aggressively build up rare and valuable skills.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.400]   This is the only way I have to take control over my career
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.520]   is to be good at things that people need.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.040]   Now I can start to dictate.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.320]   I want this position instead of that.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.040]   I don't wanna do this work, I wanna do that work.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.120]   I wanna be remote.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.680]   I'm taking the summers off.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.600]   I wanna make a lot of money.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.160]   I wanna live in the city.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.960]   You get more and more autonomy and control of your career,
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.560]   the more valuable you're making yourself.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.640]   And when you have this mindset,
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.840]   it changes the way you approach your day-to-day jobs
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.120]   because you approach the jobs from the standpoint
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.240]   of a musician who's trying to get to the first chair
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.000]   in the symphony, practice.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.120]   How do I get better?
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:46.960]   What am I not good at?
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.040]   How do I get better at that thing?
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:49.880]   Now, especially when you're young,
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.960]   you don't have as much going on.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.040]   You have the time and energy
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.400]   to actually do this career capital development.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.160]   When you don't have this mindset,
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.280]   when you have the mindset of I wanna get chosen
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.600]   for the job that's meant for me,
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.480]   it can lead to a lot of these type of traps.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.360]   And there's a lot of, I think, bad luck
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.600]   and unfortunate circumstances
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.320]   that happened in the story as well.
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.280]   But there was also, I think,
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.400]   some mindset unforced errors, right?
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.520]   So for example, when she didn't get chosen
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.840]   for the kind of dream digital media job
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.880]   that her internship had prepared her for,
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.080]   what did she say her only other option was,
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.080]   was just to go back to retail.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.240]   As opposed to say, well, I have a college degree
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.120]   and these other types of things.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.640]   There's gotta be somewhere I can get in my foot in the door
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.360]   and start building up the skills really fast
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.560]   to then take more control.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.720]   Oh, it's gonna take five years of building up skills
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.560]   to take control.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.280]   So I don't need to be in the digital media department
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.120]   of this place.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:45.960]   I just need to get in somewhere
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.800]   and start building up skills.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.920]   I can move my way over there, right?
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.520]   So when you get rid of the,
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.040]   if it's not my dream job, then why bother?
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.680]   I should just sort of go back and work at retail.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.640]   That's maybe an unforced error you wouldn't make
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.520]   if there was career capital thinking.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.480]   It also just affects how you approach your work
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.160]   when you think about accumulating skills
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.560]   versus just, do I like this job?
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.160]   Yeah, I like this job, but maybe not.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.400]   When you're just thinking about the job
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.720]   and if it's what you want,
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.400]   you're not building up aggressively your value
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.800]   to the organization, you're vulnerable.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.960]   And then when the downsizing happens,
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.320]   you might be closer to the choppy block
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.360]   because they don't point you and say,
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.920]   well, she does this for us that no one else does.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.720]   She's invaluable over here or there.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.480]   Of course, she's not gonna be the one we let go.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.360]   So there's a mindset change that could help.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.360]   Now, of course, the whole problem with all of this
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.240]   is it's not the difficulty of doing this
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.560]   is not evenly distributed.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.560]   For some people, a career capital mindset
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.520]   is gonna come much easier.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.840]   They have many more opportunities to do it
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.200]   just because of who they are
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.840]   or the opportunities or connections they have.
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.760]   It's not a fairly distributed system,
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:55.760]   but it still seems to be the way the job market works,
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.080]   even if it works differently for different people.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.480]   So we shouldn't let our frustration
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.440]   with this system is not fair,
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.400]   hide the reality of how the system works,
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.600]   which is it's a market.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.680]   Skill is what matters.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.600]   Building skill is the way to think about it.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.720]   Hey, if you liked this video,
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.340]   I think you'll really like this one as well.
