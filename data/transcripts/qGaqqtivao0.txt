[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   You said that intellectual curiosity is above all the thing you value.
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.000]   Why have you leveled that up to be the most important thing?
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.720]   I am a big fan of learn it alls versus know it alls.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.440]   Learn it alls get better.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.080]   Know it alls don't.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.680]   And so when you hire someone or work with someone, you want someone who has a big
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.720]   ceiling or a very tall ceiling that they can grow into.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.400]   The only way for them to grow is for them to better themselves.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.480]   And the only way they can likely do that is if they have intellectual curiosity.
