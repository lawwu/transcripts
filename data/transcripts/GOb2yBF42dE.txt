[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   All right, Jesse, what do we got next?
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.720]   - Okay, next question's from Jacob,
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.480]   a 20 year old from Colorado.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.160]   "I seem to have contracted a case
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.520]   of what I call seasonal discipline,
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.460]   where I'll be very actively disciplined
[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.080]   on following my habits and systems
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.600]   for a few months at a time,
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.620]   and then fall off really hard for a few months
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.900]   in an endless agonizing loop.
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.160]   I'm wondering if you have any tips
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.360]   for cultivating a more consistent commitment to discipline?"
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.520]   - You got a lot of young people today, Jesse.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.880]   - I know, I was thinking the same thing.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.880]   - Makes us feel old.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.560]   - You know, when you were doing the Henson Reed,
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.360]   I was thinking, you know, you haven't shaved in two days,
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.640]   and I was like, "Mine, I go back and forth a lot,
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.200]   but mine's white now."
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.040]   - Oh, mine is too.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.400]   - Yeah, yeah. - I don't mind it.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.960]   - I don't mind it, but my beard is,
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.480]   well, it's salt and pepper, but it's definitely white.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.200]   And I can see it at my sideburns as well, yeah.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.600]   My hair is still mainly brown, but...
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.280]   Oh, that's coming, that's coming.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.040]   We need to balance these 20 year old questions,
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.860]   I'm telling you, Jesse.
[00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.560]   People get, I don't know, a 41 year old question
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.120]   is gonna be like a combination of wanting to know
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.580]   about tax filing.
[00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.460]   You know, I'm doing my Schedule C deductions
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.160]   and wondering if this is the right line item
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.000]   to put that deduction.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.760]   Some mixture of talking about, yeah, tax filings,
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.560]   and then also, I don't know, what else does?
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.680]   - Potential hair surgery.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.520]   - And like, yeah, hair surgery.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.720]   I am, I'm thinking like, this hair surgery
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.960]   for this hair surgery, and I have a kind of a tax question.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.380]   And also I'm tired all the time.
[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.060]   And I need to, should I get like testosterone treatment?
[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.100]   Yeah.
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.180]   Meanwhile, these young kids are, yeah.
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.220]   I was up 12 hours, 20 hours straight
[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.960]   working on my screenplay.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.860]   And we're like, I only get two hours of working
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.420]   in the morning before I fall asleep and take a nap.
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.820]   All right, Jacob, I'm sorry, let's get back
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.660]   to your question.
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.360]   So, I'm gonna have, again, two solutions here.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.160]   Where this is gonna overlap with what I talked about
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.160]   with Fahad is just the mindset training piece.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.120]   So the very same thing I recommended Fahad
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.760]   that I recommended at the beginning of the show,
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.360]   I'm gonna recommend as a starting point for you as well.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.240]   That discipline layer, that very first layer
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.200]   of the deep life stack.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.240]   Two to three, non-trivial and tractable,
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.640]   non-trivial but tractable daily discipline
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.640]   and then the last one, the mindset training piece.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.800]   So, I'm gonna have, again, two solutions here.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.180]   Non-trivial but tractable daily disciplines
[00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.580]   covering multiple areas of your life
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.820]   that you track every single day
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.480]   and put most of your productivity, intentionality, focus,
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.220]   all that willpower on just doing those every day,
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.160]   not breaking the chain.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.420]   You wanna mark it every day on a calendar.
[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.020]   It's a good tune up just to get your mind back in shape
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.280]   as I don't need external power to do things.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.940]   I don't need to be in a season where I'm excited
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.380]   or things are going well to make progress
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.220]   on important things.
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.820]   I can also make progress in the hard seasons,
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.500]   in the proverbial winters when other things are going on
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.320]   or the work itself is not going so well.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.740]   So, there's a mindset tune up
[00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.700]   and I think that returning to that discipline layer
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.960]   can help with that.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.900]   And then just like with Fahad,
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.940]   but with slight differences in specifics here,
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.120]   I would say let's also think about what this,
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.580]   what you're calling here habits and systems,
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.440]   what these habits and systems are.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.260]   So, even if you have the right internal conception
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.660]   of yourself, it is still the case
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.820]   that if the particular habits or systems you've put in place,
[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.820]   if those particular habits and systems aren't sustainable
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.840]   or if they have a lot of friction,
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.220]   they work but they have overhead that don't need to be there
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.780]   and your mind senses that,
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.220]   you are going to accumulate stress fractures, right?
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.940]   You're gonna accumulate over time
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.380]   this friction and grinding of the system's not quite right.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.840]   It's too big, it's too hard.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.080]   It has steps we don't need to do.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.760]   It's like the system's gonna start building up
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.440]   these stretch fractures until the whole thing
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.820]   eventually breaks apart.
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.740]   And that's maybe why you can only make a few months.
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.420]   This is very common in the world of productivity systems
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.300]   that if the system is not compatible with your life
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.500]   and streamlined and believable,
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.940]   you can last with it for a while.
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.160]   But after, it gets this clunky.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.660]   I'm typing these notes and it goes into this note system
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.060]   that then automatically populates these types of systems.
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.260]   And every day I have a generative AI bot
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.540]   take these and generate a schedule
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.800]   and then I use that schedule to sort of schedule my hours.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.360]   These type of high overhead, high friction systems,
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.920]   they begin to just accumulate too much wear and tear
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.560]   until all of the gears get jammed.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.000]   And then you just say enough with this
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.640]   and you fall back to doing nothing
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.840]   until doing nothing after a while
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.880]   gets you so stressed out or overwhelmed
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.240]   by being disorganized that you go and build a new system
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.000]   and that starts generating friction until it's gears mesh.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.280]   And then that could also be the source
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.500]   of what you're seeing here.
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.960]   One season up, one season down,
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.640]   one season up, one season down.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.280]   So you also wanna really check out your systems here.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.560]   Streamline them.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.120]   The simplest possible thing
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.920]   that actually helps you get your work done
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.080]   sometimes is the right thing to do.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.720]   Get rid of unnecessary things.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.240]   Have a core document where you keep track of,
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.080]   here's what I do and how I do it.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.740]   So you're not just trying to keep track of things
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.600]   in your mind and you can see where there's overlap
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.220]   or redundancies or your systems are sort of out of control.
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.480]   You want something that fits very naturally into your life.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.600]   So if you're starting from scratch here,
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.240]   I would say something like multi-scale planning.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.880]   You have a strategic plan, a weekly plan
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.440]   and do some sort of daily time block plan during work days
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.800]   but not the weekends.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.200]   Have some sort of good system for capture of your tasks
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.120]   so that you don't have to keep track of those things
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.480]   in your head.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.960]   Put those two things together,
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.040]   maybe mixed in with some sort of
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.220]   fixed schedule productivity mindset of this is my work hours
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.600]   and everything else has to fit into it.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.300]   That's a good start for organizing
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.200]   all the professional things in your life.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.800]   Use very simple tech tools for implementing this.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.480]   I'm talking, you have a paper time block planner
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.440]   and then a couple of Google Docs to keep track
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.440]   of strategic plans and weekly plans.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.280]   You could use Trello to keep track of tasks
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.900]   or even just a long text file where you're typing things.
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.920]   Simple technologies that are easy to get in
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.400]   and easy to get out that you can access
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.760]   from multiple platforms, that makes a big difference.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.960]   As you add in other structures or goals
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.080]   around your personal life, keep it simple.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.360]   So again, let's go for simplicity, accessibility.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.360]   Let's try to minimize friction.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.000]   Let's just make the general rhythm of your life
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   something that's very sustainable.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.840]   That'll help too.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.240]   So I don't know in your case, Jacob,
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.520]   which is the bigger problem.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.840]   So I don't know if it's a mindset issue,
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.880]   that your systems are fine,
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.160]   but your mindset just needs right now,
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.440]   external fuel for you to work on hard things,
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.360]   or if it's a systems problem, your mindset's fine,
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.640]   but your systems have too much friction.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.960]   So look at both.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.520]   But between those two things,
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.280]   I think you're gonna find the seasonality
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.180]   of following systems is going to go away.
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.520]   One epilogue I will add to this as well
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.480]   is don't reject seasonality outright as an issue.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.580]   I think it's an issue if your systems are seasonal.
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.180]   I stop being organized during some months versus others.
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.640]   I think it's completely fine if your workload is seasonal.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.480]   In fact, in my new book, "Slow Productivity,"
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.480]   which is coming out in March,
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.560]   there's a whole principle is about
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.760]   working at a natural pace,
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.560]   and it really gets into seasonality
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.960]   and how natural and well-suited humans are for that.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.960]   So I do wanna throw that in there.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.520]   You might just be getting exhausted, right?
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.120]   Like a professor, by the time a professor
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.020]   gets to the end of spring, traditionally,
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.240]   they're exhausted because they've gone
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.080]   through a full school year.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.240]   So to actually pull back some in the summer makes sense
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.360]   because you need to recharge.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.840]   If you try to go all out in the summer
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.100]   after a hard spring and after a hard fall before that,
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.840]   you might just run out of steam altogether.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.940]   So I think seasonal workload could be fine as well.
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.160]   So let's throw that in here, not just as an epilogue,
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.120]   but I'm gonna throw this in, Jacob,
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.740]   as my third part of my answer.
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.940]   Make your workload seasonal, but keep the systems the same.
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.200]   You're still multi-scale planning,
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.100]   but when you get to some months of the year,
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.080]   the amount of stuff you're putting into your week
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.960]   and the complexity of your daily time block schedules
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.740]   are much easier, and you get that relief of,
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:53.560]   man, this feels great.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.160]   I can really control my time.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.680]   I'm taking Thursdays completely off because why not?
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.120]   I'm using planning so I can move pieces around.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.840]   This is great.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.080]   I can actually extract a lot more relaxation and recharging
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.400]   because I have some structure.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.560]   So I think a seasonal workload could be excellent,
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.320]   but you don't want your systems to come and go seasonally.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.680]   And you wanna make sure that your mindset is one
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.320]   that doesn't require external power.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.140]   So there we go.
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.660]   I upgraded this from two parts to three parts, Jacob,
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.720]   and hopefully you will find that useful.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.600]   All right, let's keep going here, Jesse.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.200]   - Yeah, and then the time management video
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   on our YouTube channel is definitely
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.120]   something you should check out.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:30.960]   - Yeah, so look under the,
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.740]   what's it, core ideas is the playlist?
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.440]   - Right, so youtube.com/calendarportmedia.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.640]   Look at the playlist.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.840]   There's a playlist called core ideas.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.280]   There's one titled, a video titled time management,
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.920]   where I talk about that multi-scale planning.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.160]   Yeah, shows up right in there.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.320]   It's a good place to start.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.900]   (upbeat music)
