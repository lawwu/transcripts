[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   We get a lot of questions in the inbox about how to interpret the Old Testament as a Christian
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.040]   and trying to understand which promises apply to us and which ones don't.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.280]   A podcast listener Joe from Boston writes in with this question, "Pastor John, I often struggle to
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.920]   interpret and apply portions of the Old Testament, specifically the prophetic books, where the word
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.000]   of God was being spoken to God's people as the nation of Israel. How can we discern if warnings
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.360]   or promises directed toward Israel are applicable to other nations, the body of Christ and the
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:38.160]   global church, or even to ourselves as individuals? What benefit or dangers may there be in carrying
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.760]   over meaning from Israel to those other modern-day audiences?" 2 Chronicles 7.14 is one specific
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:53.920]   example. Pastor John, what would you say to Joe? Let me see if I can simplify some very complex
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:03.360]   issues and provide maybe just a two-step process that enables Joe and the rest of us Christians to
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:13.600]   appropriate the Old Testament, especially the promises, for our use as Christians in the 21st
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.280]   century. So here's step number one. 2 Corinthians 1.20 says, "All the promises of God find their
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.640]   yes in Christ." That is why it is through him that we utter the "Amen" to the glory of God.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.720]   Now, I think that means that in union with Christ, the Messiah, Christians become the heirs
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.640]   of all the promises in the Old Testament. And there are different ways to explain why that is.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:53.680]   And one is to realize that in spiritual union with the Jewish Messiah, Jesus Christ, Christians are
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:01.680]   the messianic people, the true Israel, the heirs of everything promised to the true Israel. Here's
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:10.000]   the way Paul puts it in Philippians 3.3. He says, "For we are the circumcision." And he's talking
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.160]   to his Gentile audience there in Philippi. "We are the circumcision who worship by the Spirit of God,
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.880]   glory in Christ Jesus, put no confidence in the flesh." And what he means when he says,
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.400]   "We are the circumcision," he means we Gentiles who are united to the Jewish Messiah, Jesus,
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.040]   are the true circumcised people, the true Israel of God. And therefore, all the promises made to
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:47.120]   the circumcision, the true Israel, belong to us, Jew and Gentile, in Christ Jesus.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:55.920]   Now, parenthesis, this does not exclude a real future for present-day ethnic Israel in God's
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:03.520]   purposes, because they will one day profess faith in Messiah Jesus and be grafted back in and become
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:10.400]   part of the true Israel along with all other Christians who are part of Jesus Christ. That's
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:18.320]   my understanding of Romans 11. So that's step one. Christians may rightly embrace the promises of the
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:26.320]   Old Testament made to Israel because in union with Messiah Jesus, we are Israel. We are the true
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.720]   Israel. Now here's step two. The coming of Jesus, the Messiah, into the world and his atoning work
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.720]   on the cross and his resurrection and his reign in heaven and his authoritative teaching, like in the
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:47.040]   Sermon on the Mount, chapter 5 of Matthew, all of that together alter the way some of the promises
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.440]   of the teachings and the teachings of the Old Testament are to be inherited and applied. In
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.800]   other words, when step one says that we are heirs of all the promises, we have to take into account
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:09.840]   that those promises may be fulfilled differently today because of the changes that have come into
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:18.320]   history through the words and the work of Jesus. For example, in his death for sins, Jesus effectively
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:26.160]   replaces the Old Testament priesthood and the Old Testament sacrifices and all of those ceremonial
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.400]   provisions that surrounded that process of sacrifice. Hebrews 10â€”it's all over the book of
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:40.000]   Hebrews, but here's Hebrews 10, 13 and 14. When Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.360]   for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God. By a single offering, he has perfected for all time
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.440]   those who are being sanctified. That means that some of the promises of the Old Testament are
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:01.200]   fulfilled differently now than they were then. For example, Leviticus 5, 16 says, "If anyone
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:09.440]   sins, he shall bring an offering, a ram, as an offering, and the priest shall make atonement
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:17.200]   for him with the ram of the guilt offering." And here's the promise, "He shall be forgiven." So,
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:26.000]   forgiveness is offered through the offering of a ram, and nowadays, now since Jesus,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.520]   he has replaced the work of that priest and the offering of that ram. Does that mean that
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:40.800]   Leviticus 5, 16 doesn't apply to us? No, it doesn't mean that. We take the teaching of the
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:47.680]   New Testament of how Jesus fulfilled the priesthood, how he fulfilled the sacrifice of that ram,
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:55.920]   and we make the necessary adjustments, and we enjoy this promise, which now says something like,
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:02.320]   "All the more, all the more will we be forgiven for our sins if we embrace the provision,
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.520]   not of the Old Testament ram and the Old Testament priest, but of the work of Christ
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.200]   and the sacrifice of the high priest, Jesus, and the offering of his self."
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.640]   And let me give you one more example, because he asked about it. 2 Chronicles 7, 14,
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:26.400]   "If my people who are called by my name humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.200]   from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:39.600]   land." Now, how do Christians embrace and apply this today? Well, in view of what Christ has done
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:48.240]   in the New Testament, we make at least two changes. First, "my people," if "my people,"
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:54.560]   the people are no longer merely the Jewish ethnic people of God, but the
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:01.680]   blood-bought people of the Messiah united to him through faith. And secondly, the reference to
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:09.120]   "their land," cleanse "their land," heal "their land" does not apply to the land of the church.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.560]   How much less the church in America, referring to the land of America, it doesn't refer to America,
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:26.640]   because the church bought by the blood of Jesus is a pilgrim people drawn from all the lands,
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:33.360]   from every tribe and tongue and people and nation. The church has no homeland except heaven
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:41.760]   and eventually the new earth. Therefore, the application we make of this verse is not that
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:49.200]   if Christians will repent, God will heal America. We have no such promise in the Bible. Rather,
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.720]   if Christians repent, turn from their wicked ways, humble themselves, pray to God,
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:04.640]   he will do a mighty work in and through the church however he please. And I think Joe takes,
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:12.240]   if he takes these two steps and these two illustrations that I've given from Leviticus 5
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:20.720]   and 2 Chronicles 7, he will be well on his way of appropriating the Old Testament for good Christian
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:27.760]   use. Very good. Thank you, Pastor John. And speaking of exegetical questions and hard to
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:33.280]   interpret passages, on Friday we will return to hear from a listener named Kevin in California.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.880]   He wants to know if Jesus' promises in Matthew chapter 6, that if we seek first the kingdom of
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:45.360]   God, that food and clothing and drink will always be provided for us, does that mean that Christians
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.920]   will never go without food or clothing? And if that is true, what about the suffering in the
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:55.520]   lives of New Testament Christians? And what about what we see in the news about Middle East Christians
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:02.560]   today being run out of their homes by threat of violence by ISIS? That's on Friday. I'm your host,
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.920]   Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
