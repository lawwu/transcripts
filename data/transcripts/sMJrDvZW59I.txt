[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500]   And in terms of learning multiple languages during development, my understanding is that
[00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.740]   if one wants to become bilingual or trilingual, best to learn those languages simultaneously
[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.540]   during development, ideally before age 12, if one hopes to not have an accent in speaking
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.900]   them later. Is that correct?
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.820]   The earlier is better. The more intense it is and the more immersive it is, the longer
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.280]   you know that you can be exposed to that is really important. A lot of people can get
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.660]   exposed to early and basically lose it even though it's quote unquote during that sensitive
[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.140]   period. Unless it's maintained, it can be very easily lost. Then I think another aspect
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.700]   of it that's very interesting is some of the social requirements for it too. It's pretty
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.820]   clear that you can only go so far just listening to these sounds from a tape recording or something
[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.700]   like that. There's something extra about real human interactions that activates the brain
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.500]   sensitivity to different speech bounds, allows us to become specialized for them for a given
