[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740]   In 2014, that was the beginning of what's sometimes called the deep learning revolution.
[00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.320]   Since then, we've basically seen these very computation-intensive, but fundamentally simple
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.240]   AI systems achieve a lot of progress on a lot of different unrelated tasks.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.800]   It's looking to me like not totally crazy to imagine that the current way people are
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.400]   developing AI systems, cutting-edge AI systems, could take us all the way to the kind of extremely
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.160]   powerful AI systems that automate roughly everything humans do to advance science and
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.160]   technology.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.440]   It's not so wild to imagine that we could just keep on going with these systems, make
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.900]   them bigger, put more work into them, but basically stay on the same path, and you could
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.600]   get there.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.240]   If you imagine doing that, it becomes a little bit less daunting to imagine the risks that
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.800]   might come up and the things we could do about them.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.900]   I don't think it's necessarily the leading possibility, but it's enough to start thinking
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.900]   concretely about the problem.
