[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   Why Did God Alienate Disabled Persons in the Old Testament?
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.960]   It's a really good question today from a listener named Gina.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.760]   "Hello Pastor John, I'm reading through Leviticus in my Bible reading and one thing
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.280]   that has confused me is why God would not allow people with physical defects to approach
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.280]   the altar, specifically in Leviticus 21, 16-21.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.600]   The tone changes drastically in the Gospels, there Jesus welcomes the blind, the lame,
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.880]   and the diseased right into his own very presence.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.800]   So why would God in the Old Testament not allow them near the altar?
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.080]   Seems sad to me.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.640]   Those people would have certainly felt even worse for it and likely experienced heightened
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.600]   social alienation too.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.520]   I'm thankful for the New Testament because there are so many of us with physical defects.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.720]   But why the discontinuity?
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.440]   To what purpose?"
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.160]   Good, good, good, good, good question.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:11.600]   Leviticus 21, 16-24 deals with whether priests, it's about priests, but her question is still
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:20.920]   really valid, whether priests who have physical disabilities or deformities can enter the
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.040]   holy place to do the work of a priest.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:31.440]   And I think Gina is probably right that in reality when priests with facial defects or
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:40.520]   crushed genitals or injured feet or a hunchback or scabby skin were forbidden from parts of
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.600]   the priestly service, not all of them, but some of them, probably they would have felt
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.520]   sad and discouraged at times and maybe even resentful.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.800]   That would be a normal human response, at least in our culture, we sure feel that.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.800]   And my guess is it's pretty basic to human nature.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:09.480]   So Gina asks, "Why does God in the Old Testament apply such external restrictions for the priesthood?
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.960]   And in the New Testament, we don't have that same kind of restriction.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.600]   They don't assume the same kind of excluding effect."
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.800]   So let me try to give an answer that I think honors the intention of both the Old Testament
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.200]   and the New Testament, because I think both are the inspired Word of God, and what God
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.720]   did when He did it was right to do when He did it, and He had reasons for doing it.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.440]   And it may not be right for us to do it today because such profound things have changed.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:46.080]   But let's look at the key passage, and there's a ground clause that helps us really crystallize
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.040]   the issues.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.000]   Here's Leviticus 21, 16 to 24 with just a few verses left out.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.760]   I'll collapse it down so you can see the clause.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.840]   No man of the offspring of Aaron, the priest, who has a blemish shall come near to offer
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.840]   the Lord's food offerings.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.640]   Since he has a blemish, he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:17.240]   He shall not go through the veil or approach the altar because, and our ears should perk
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:27.080]   up, because he has a blemish, in order that he may not profane my sanctuaries, for I am
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.360]   Yahweh the Lord who sanctifies them.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.440]   In other words, God says, "I am the one who sets priests apart for my service.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.560]   I sanctify them.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:47.720]   I have ordained, I have decreed or instituted or decided that a blemished priest will not
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.080]   blemish or profane my sanctuary."
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:04:00.400]   In other words, God wants to make the perfections of the sanctuary so symbolically and visibly
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:09.080]   clear that he establishes a correlation between the deforming of the physical body and the
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.000]   deforming of the sanctuary.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.400]   Or to say it another way, he insists that there be a correlation between the perfections
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.720]   of those who approach the sanctuary and the perfection of the sanctuary itself, which
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.240]   is a reflection of his own perfection.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:37.080]   So it's entirely possible that the most godly and the most humble, deformed priests would
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:45.520]   not be offended by this divine order of things, but would gladly acknowledge that it is fitting
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:55.040]   for those who approach a perfect God to be free from outward and inward imperfections.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:01.700]   So I don't think there's anything intrinsically wrong with God's Old Testament ordinances
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.700]   in this regard.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.920]   The question is, what's the ultimate meaning of it, especially in relation to New Testament
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.360]   changes?
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.360]   My answer goes like this.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:20.240]   In the Bible as a whole, there are two dimensions to God's nature that shape the way he deals
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.320]   with mankind.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.640]   One is unapproachable holiness.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.020]   That's one massive truth throughout the Bible.
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.360]   God is holy.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.200]   Sinners can't approach him.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.860]   Nothing imperfect can approach him.
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.920]   Nothing evil can approach God without being destroyed.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:48.280]   And so it's fitting that in the presence of God, there can only be perfection, both
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:55.760]   moral and spiritual and physical, which of course means no one qualifies.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.080]   It's not like some of these priests were perfect.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.960]   The other dimension of his nature is his overflowing mercy and grace.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.760]   So those are the two.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:14.520]   Unapproachable holiness and overflowing mercy and grace, which reaches out to the physically,
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:22.360]   morally, spiritually imperfect and finds a way in Jesus Christ to declare them to be
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.920]   perfect.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:32.280]   But the resolution of these two dimensions of God's nature is not that the first one
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:39.500]   is replaced by the second one, like holiness is kind of blunted and decreased in its importance
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.760]   because mercy is going to be the main thing now.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.800]   That's not what happens.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.840]   As though the doctrine of justification by faith alone would be sufficient to create
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.720]   the new heavens and the new earth where God is present among justified sinners without
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.800]   his holiness being compromised.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.560]   That's not going to happen.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.560]   That's not going to happen.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.560]   No.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:12.360]   God also undertakes by sanctification and then by the recreation of everything that's
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.980]   broken, physical dimensions of the world and moral dimensions of the world, and he's going
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:24.900]   to make everything in his presence perfect forever.
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.920]   Not just justified sinners are going to be in God's presence, but no sin is going to
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.240]   be in God's presence.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:36.480]   There won't be any people who sin in God's presence.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.480]   There will be no defects morally.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:45.720]   There will be no defects physically in the presence of God in the age to come.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:53.900]   So I think God highlighted the demands for perfection in the Old Testament in an outward
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:08:02.740]   way so as to make really clear that no form of imperfection would ever stand in God's
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.600]   presence permanently.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.280]   That's how holy he is.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:12.560]   He would one day not only justify the ungodly and be willing to touch lepers, reach out
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:19.560]   and actually touch lepers, God himself touching lepers in the flesh, but he would also utterly
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:27.560]   transform the ungodly into sinless godly people and take away every leprosy and every disease
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.740]   and every disability and every deformity.
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:37.420]   So the Old Testament and the New Testament make both of these dimensions of God's character
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:42.180]   plain, it seems to me, by putting the emphasis in different places.
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:48.620]   So the Old Testament is, as it were, standing on tiptoes, looking over the horizon of the
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:54.880]   future, waiting and wondering how God could ever create a people all of whom could come
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:01.220]   boldly into his presence, and God had put such amazing limits in the Old Testament.
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:06.620]   So the Old Testament rightly makes this seem extremely difficult.
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.840]   I think that was the point.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.580]   He wanted it to look like this can never happen.
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.340]   You can never have anybody with an imperfection walking in here.
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.440]   Just not going to happen.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.520]   God has put such amazing restrictions on it.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:25.620]   And then, in the New Testament, the glorious reality dawns that God has provided a way
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:34.980]   by Jesus Christ, the very perfection, that we must have to approach him now, and he has
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:40.320]   provided by his Spirit the sanctification and resurrection and perfection of bodily
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.600]   and spiritually newness in the age to come so that we can be in his presence forever.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:53.980]   So my bottom line conclusion is we need the Old Testament to sober us about how holy God
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:10:00.780]   is, and we need the New Testament lest we despair of any hope that we could survive
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:05.500]   in the presence of such a holy God, let alone enjoy him forever.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.500]   Amen.
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.500]   That's really helpful.
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.500]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:14.180]   Well, there's a horrifying story out of Colorado that has grabbed headlines since it happened
[00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:20.020]   in August, a story of a man who killed his entire family, his wife of six years, their
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:24.880]   unborn child, along with their two really young daughters.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.240]   It is sickening.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.580]   And just a few months later, he is now in prison for the rest of his life, and he has
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:34.060]   also recently claimed to have found God.
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:39.340]   Can such a malicious animal be saved, and how should we Christians process that possibility?
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:44.780]   It's a raw and honest question, and it's up next time on Wednesday.
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.740]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, and we will see you then.
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.740]   Bye.
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:47.740]   Bye.
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:48.740]   Bye.
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:48.740]   Bye.
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:53.740]   Bye.
