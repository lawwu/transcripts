[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Hey guys, it's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   I haven't been recording much recently because I got sick again.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   And when you're sick, you can't really speak, as you can hear somewhat of a raspy voice right now.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   But it's also been a really tough week with Kobe Bryant surprisingly passing away and his daughter.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   I mean, it was just so, so devastating.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   I heard about the news after I just played tennis Sunday morning with a buddy of mine.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   And I was at the Xfinity Comcast place returning just my cable box.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   And I just saw the news and I thought it was a hoax.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   And everybody said, "Nope, it wasn't a hoax."
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   And it was just so, so devastating because not only was he a great player and a good citizen for America,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   but his daughter and it's just the family and the people he leaves behind.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   He had a daughter in 2019.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   I had a daughter in 2019.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   And I just cannot imagine not being with them right now.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   And I was really surprised by how much his death affected me.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   I woke up that Sunday morning at around 6 a.m.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   And I didn't go to bed really until about 4 a.m. the next morning.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Maybe it was 5 a.m. I just thought to myself, "What if I passed out and I never woke up again?"
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And so it's been really tough.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I probably cried five or six times on Sunday, another five or six times on Monday,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   and another five or six times on Tuesday.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   But then finally on Wednesday, I stopped crying.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   That pain that had been hurting so much is still there, but I've stopped crying.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   And I've wondered about this for a while.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I haven't felt this type of grief in a long time since my grandmother passed away years ago.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And I'm kind of bracing myself for this type of grief because my parents are still alive.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   My in-laws are still alive. My sister is still alive.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   My relatives are still alive.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Yet every day we get older.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   And so I just want to encourage everyone to just appreciate every single moment,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   to drop the grudges that you have with your friends or your colleagues or your relatives,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   to tell each other how much you care for them, how much you love them, how much you appreciate them.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I really don't think we tell people how much we appreciate them enough.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I think we kind of take people for granted.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And we take them for granted, and then one day they're not here with us.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And so tonight or tomorrow, every day that you can, tell someone how much you appreciate them.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Tell them about the specific things that you really, really admire about them, that you love about them.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I think it's going to go a long way.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And please hug your friends and your family tighter every day.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I feel so blessed to have my family, and I also feel the weight, the weight on my shoulders of having to take care of my family.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   And so this fear, this pressure keeps me going.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   It keeps me going every single day because I cannot fail my family.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And I think these type of incidences where someone famous or someone you admire passes away really puts things in perspective.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And it really makes me think about what is the purpose of my life, how I want to be remembered by if I were to suddenly go.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And I thought about it every single day for the past week.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And I think the bottom line is that I'm doing what I really, really love to do.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Back when I worked in finance, I remember one of the CEOs of a company we were taking public said,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   "Sam, you know you have a BS job, right?"
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   And at the time I was thinking, "Well, gee, buddy, that's not really nice to say."
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   But I thought about it and I was thinking, "Well, I'm here trying to help Asian companies go public in the United States or in Asia.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I'm trying to connect capital to help fund their dreams and grow businesses. I don't think that's that bad."
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   But I started feeling a little bit empty inside after about 10 years.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   After 10 years of doing something, just a job, I think any kind of job or most jobs, you kind of get bored and you kind of want to do something else.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   And so when I discovered online writing and more specifically talking about personal finance and living life
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   and going through all of these mysterious things in life, figuring things out, I really loved it.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   And I hope you guys can tell that I really love to write about personal finance, life, happiness, family and so forth.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   I've been doing this since 2009 and I hope to do it for a very long time until my kids hopefully grow up and see what their dad does.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   And maybe they want to learn something about writing and communications and marketing and so forth.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And so how do I want to be remembered? I just want to be remembered as a good father, someone who tried really, really hard
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   and tried to exceed expectations based on the talents that were given to me.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And I want to be remembered as someone who tried every day to help someone figure out how to lead a better financial life.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Because I think if we lead better financial lives, we can live happier lives.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   We can become more confident and we can take care of our family more and we can do the things we really, really want to do.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   It is true that life goes by quicker as we age because we have less years left.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Let's say we were all blessed to live to 100. The first year of your life is 1/100th of your life.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   But if you're 50, the 51st year of your life is 1/50th of your life.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   So it's literally twice as valuable, the time is twice as fast that's passing by.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Let's try to wake up every morning and count our blessings and highlight the things that we are grateful for.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   And then before we go to bed, let's count our blessings again and think about all the things we've accomplished.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   I think it will be absolutely wonderful if we can appreciate every single day and not waste a single moment.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And frankly, I need to focus more on recording some podcasts.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Because one of the key reasons why I want to record a podcast is so that if I were to die an untimely death,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   my children, my two and a half year old and my six week old, can listen to their old man and hear his voice and know, you know, what are some of the things that
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   their dad liked to talk about or felt about and just, you just never know.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   And so I write and I will record for as long as I can.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Thanks so much everyone. I've been up to actually a lot of things.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Again, I had a cold for a couple weeks again.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   There should be a lot of things coming up, so stick around. Keep on reading, keep on sharing, keep on listening.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   I appreciate your support and I'll see you guys around.
