[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   If you really want to give a character an obstacle to overcome, a need,
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.100]   I mean, the base one is life and death.
[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.920]   The following is a conversation with Matthew McConaughey,
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.500]   a legendary Oscar-winning actor and one of the most unique, charismatic,
[00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.580]   and inspiring humans and Texans who walk this earth.
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.500]   He starred in films and shows loved by me and millions of others,
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.680]   including Interstellar, Dazed and Confused, Dallas Bias Club, Killer Joe, Mud, True Detective,
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.560]   and soon a spinoff of Yellowstone.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.420]   Offscreen, his words carry wisdom and power in his book called Greenlights
[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.520]   and his new video course called Road Trip,
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.880]   where Matthew expands on the philosophy in his book and shows how to apply it to your life
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.780]   in order to find more happiness, success, and love.
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.380]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.380]   And now, dear friends, here's Matthew McConaughey.
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.220]   Let's start with love.
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.920]   Your parents had a complicated love story.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.480]   Divorced twice, married three times.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.000]   What did you learn about love from your mom and dad and their love story?
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.980]   That it's messy.
[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.900]   That it takes work.
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.160]   That it's ugly.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.760]   That no matter how ugly or messy it is,
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.640]   don't go to bed
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:48.580]   until you've come back together to either embrace or admit that you truly love each other,
[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.940]   even if you hadn't solved what the hell you're bitching about.
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.340]   That
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:04.020]   love will win in the end, literally three to two with my mom and dad.
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.900]   And that even in the two divorces and in the two times where they couldn't live with each other,
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.060]   they still loved each other.
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.540]   They just couldn't live with each other at that time.
[00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.800]   For whatever reason they needed.
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.980]   And I don't know the details, but they needed their space, freedom or what,
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.460]   but they were never out of love with each other.
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:39.700]   And that as a parent,
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.100]   if you just, when we're not sure what to do,
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.760]   and people give you a thousand books and advice,
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.760]   as a parent,
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.760]   if your kid knows you love them,
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.760]   you're in the black.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.760]   That's the main thing.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.760]   It won't work without that.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.760]   And it can work and will usually can work with that.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.760]   They just know that fact.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.760]   So it's not just love for each other.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.760]   It's the love for the bigger family that ultimately helps you persist through the ups and downs.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.760]   Well,
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.760]   I don't know.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.760]   I don't know.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.760]   I mean,
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.760]   I don't know how much,
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.760]   particularly my mom and dad were staying together at times,
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.760]   maybe when they didn't want to,
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.760]   because they had children.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.760]   I don't actually think they considered that.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:43.760]   I think they were much less conscientious than say I am today.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.760]   I think my mom and dad were more like,
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.760]   they'll be fine.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.760]   We love them.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.760]   They'll be fine.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.760]   But we'll,
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.760]   we'll,
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.760]   we'll cross that bridge when we get there right now.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.760]   They were,
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.760]   let's work it out between you and I is what I think my mom and dad were saying to each other or,
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.760]   or not.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.760]   They,
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.760]   they,
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:09.760]   they wanted and needed a relationship that was a tidal wave,
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.760]   rocky,
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.760]   right angles,
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.760]   tsunamis.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.760]   And to this day in,
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.760]   in my life with Camilla and I,
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.760]   which I don't,
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.760]   I like a river,
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.760]   has some swerves and some,
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.760]   some streams and some rapids,
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.760]   but I'm not looking for a tidal wave.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.760]   My mom's like,
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.760]   what's all this,
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.760]   everything's so smooth stuff.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.760]   Come on,
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.760]   come on,
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.760]   come on,
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.760]   come on.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.760]   So she challenges like vitality,
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.760]   'cause that's what my mom needed to communicate.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.760]   I don't think my dad needed it as much.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.760]   that,
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.760]   the,
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.760]   the,
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.760]   the,
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.760]   the,
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.760]   the,
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.760]   the hard angles that their relationship.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.760]   I don't think my dad needed it as much as my mom.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.760]   But the clashes demonstrated the passion that underlies the love.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.760]   Yes.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.760]   And that's,
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.760]   I've,
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.760]   I've,
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.760]   I've always been asked,
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.760]   you know,
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.760]   when I talk about my parents' love relationship,
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.760]   I tell the stories that are actually sometimes quite violent.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.760]   And.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.760]   There's some good stories there.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.760]   They're beautiful.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.760]   I think they're beautiful.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.760]   I think they're beautiful too.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.760]   But I've had people go,
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.760]   wait a minute,
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.760]   that was unhealthy.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.760]   You can't,
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.760]   you can't do that.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.760]   And I was like,
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.760]   no,
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.760]   that's again,
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.760]   back to the beginning,
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.760]   love's messy.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.760]   And that,
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.760]   what I love about those stories is that's where the love was actually,
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.760]   you could,
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.760]   it was tested.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.760]   And it,
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.760]   it could have broke and been over.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.760]   And it never was.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.760]   Again,
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.760]   the love won.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.760]   In the kitchen floor,
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.760]   the blood's drawn,
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.760]   knives are pulled.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.760]   Ketchup.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.760]   Ketchup's all over.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.760]   But we make love on the kitchen floor.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.760]   I mean,
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.760]   come on,
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.760]   beautiful.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.760]   So as a romantic,
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.760]   I mean,
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.760]   I,
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.760]   so as romantic as it gets right there.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.760]   Whoa.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:58.760]   What's a memory from childhood that helped set you on the trajectory of becoming the man you are today?
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:05.760]   Standing on the corner with Mr.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.760]   Mayor,
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.760]   the principal of St.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.760]   Philip's school.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.760]   I was in kindergarten.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.760]   And I looked up and there was a cloud in the sky.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.760]   And I said,
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.760]   Mr.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.760]   Mayor,
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.760]   is that cloud as big as the world?
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.760]   And he paused for a minute and he goes,
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.760]   well,
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.760]   yes it is,
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.760]   Matthew.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.760]   Now in my seven year old mind,
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.760]   I went,
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.760]   okay,
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.760]   I can see the outlines of it.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.760]   And that must mean it is so far away because if that's as big as the world,
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.760]   I remember it took 15 hours just to drive from church to the church.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.760]   And I was like,
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:25.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:26.760]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.520]   Do you miss your father?
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:37.520]   Think about him.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.520]   When I think about him, I do.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.520]   Now when do I think about him?
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:47.320]   I thought about him yesterday, working through a script I'm working on right now, working
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.360]   on scene work.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:56.720]   And I just had that quick little reaction of wanting to show him, "Hey, check this out.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.720]   I'll show you."
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.720]   I tried it out there.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.460]   And then I don't get sad.
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:08.600]   I go, "He would have loved this."
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:16.080]   Whereas my mom wants to be on the stage, my dad would have been on the front row.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.960]   He's more fun to show stuff to.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.760]   And he would have, as what he would have, he was a character.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.760]   He knew characters.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.720]   I've based parts of all characters.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:33.000]   All kinds of characters I've played and the man that I am on people that he introduced
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.600]   me to and who he was.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:40.720]   He would have loved the creative process of working on a script or talking about, "Hey,
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.720]   movie."
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:46.640]   That's why I always say I love the movie, "Mud," because it's the one that I visualized
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:51.720]   and seen my dad come to me so many times as a 12-year-old and put his arm around me and
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.720]   go, "Hey, little buddy, you seen this movie called 'Mud?'
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.720]   God damn it, it's a good one.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.720]   Let's go watch it."
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.720]   That.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:07.120]   Now, my dad never got to see me start a career in film, but he was alive five days into the...
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.720]   He overlapped the first five days of me working on my first film, "Days Confused."
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.620]   Now, that I think there's something beautiful about that.
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.640]   He didn't ever come to the set.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:22.720]   We didn't talk about it, but he was alive for me to start something that was more than
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.720]   a fad.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.480]   Something that would become something that I love to do.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.480]   And I do miss...
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:43.240]   And then I go out of that, we talked about him two nights ago with our daughter.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.840]   I was rubbing my daughter's feet.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.920]   And my mom who's living with us, 91, comes in and goes, "Oh, look at you, just like your
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.920]   pop."
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.920]   And he's like, "What?"
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.720]   And he goes, "Oh," because my dad loved to rub somebody's feet.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.720]   Rub somebody's feet.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.720]   Rub somebody's feet.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.720]   Rub somebody's feet.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.020]   Rub my mom's feet.
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.780]   Rubbed all of me and my brother's girlfriend's feet.
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:11.200]   When we would have a date, they would come over early because they knew they were gonna
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.120]   get a foot rub from Jim McConaughey.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.480]   And then we'd come out, me and my two older brothers on...
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.200]   This has been on for decades.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.880]   We'd come out, shout, "Ready to go," buttoned up.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.880]   And they looked at me like, "We ain't going anywhere right now."
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.720]   And so we told the story.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:30.440]   I told my daughter and I was like, "Oh yeah, my dad, his hands, I miss his hands.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.440]   His hands could heal."
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.960]   So you carry him in you.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:37.620]   I hope so.
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:43.840]   I hope so.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:51.480]   It's a challenge for me.
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.720]   And I suppose it's like this for any son.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:08.580]   How much do we hang on to and how much do we let go and evolve and update the OS and
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:13.000]   try maybe better or different?
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.720]   It's that there's certain things that I know that I fully believe in.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.720]   It's like when do we...
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.480]   Religious, when do we cast away our father?
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.720]   When do we say, "No, I'm going after the dream.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.720]   I'm not asking your permission.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.720]   I'm asking your permission."
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:38.140]   I question that from time to time for myself because I...
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.480]   And it almost feels blasphemic if that's a word sometimes.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.860]   I feel like, "What are you doing?
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:44.860]   You can't check that."
[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:48.820]   And go like, "Well, no, I'm not sure if I want to really..."
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:55.720]   And then I immediately let myself off because I believe where he is, he's going, "Go, buddy.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.720]   Go.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.720]   You're free, man.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:03.200]   I'm not going to hold you back if you misread that or I didn't teach you that as well as
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.720]   maybe I wish I could have.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.720]   Go.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.720]   You're free.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.520]   You're not going to lose.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.960]   Trust that you're not going to lose.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.480]   It's in your DNA.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.960]   It's in your lineage, young man.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.880]   Still, it's scary to not have a safety net.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.720]   Losing your father is scary in that way.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:23.720]   You realize this world is just you in some deep fundamental way.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.720]   It's just you.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.720]   You're alone.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.720]   Yes.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:32.720]   But also not having that.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:50.720]   It's such a gift of deliverance though as well because it's an awesome feeling to know
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.720]   we're alone.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.440]   To know we don't have that.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.720]   To know you don't have take two or take three.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.720]   That it's one take.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:07.720]   I mean, the peripheral vision improves.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:17.800]   The link and understanding with our past improves because I know for me, I was not ever considerate
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:22.360]   of my past at all because my dad had that if I needed it.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.720]   He was my well for that.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.720]   He's gone.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.720]   Like I said, he had the...
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.720]   Literally, they have our back.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:32.920]   Well, then when they no longer have our back, all of a sudden I'm going, "Oh, well, maybe
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:40.120]   I need to look back and start giving some credit to how I got here, what I'm doing and
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.720]   where I'm heading."
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:46.340]   It gave me the first time courage to even look over my shoulder because again, I didn't
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.340]   have to because I don't have to look.
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.720]   Dad's got my back.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.720]   No, dad's gone.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.720]   He's gone.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.720]   From this life, he doesn't have your back.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.720]   Okay.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:04.720]   So, I mean, I don't know.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:13.720]   Me, because it's inevitable, I very quickly go to...
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.920]   All right.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.720]   In the pain, the loss, and yes, even loneliness, which is just...
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:28.100]   Leanness, which is different from being alone and loss.
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:31.620]   Pretty immediately part and parcel with the pain, I felt it.
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:36.940]   In the pain, you saw the gift, the red light of losing your father.
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.100]   Pretty immediately, less impressed, more involved.
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:45.720]   I came like a couple of weeks after moving on.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.720]   Is there a trick to that, to see the gift and the pain?
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.720]   That's a good question.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   Is there a trick to it?
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.720]   Not that I know of.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.720]   I mean, I don't...
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:11.480]   I have to catch myself from trying to intellectualize my way into the reasoning and not skip over
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.720]   real feelings and discomfort.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:18.720]   I mean, I did get that from my mom and I have to watch it.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.720]   That's so resilient.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.720]   That we just dust ourself off and get up and go.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.720]   You wanna sit in the feeling.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.720]   You wanna feel it.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.720]   You wanna deeply feel the pain.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.720]   I wanna deeply feel it.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:29.720]   I wanna look it in the eye and deeply feel it, but I don't wanna wallow in it.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:35.720]   Now, I was raised where you skip the deeply feel and let's go.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:43.720]   And I've said it before, but that will lead to having turned into a person who is a repeat
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.720]   offender of the same pain.
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:53.020]   of the same crimes because you just get up and you don't,
[00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.140]   you don't have a winter in your life.
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.820]   There's no introspective time.
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.380]   You don't look over your shoulder at the end of the past.
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.220]   And so you just get up and you're like, all right,
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.440]   I've, stepped in the same pile of whatever a hundred times
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.620]   and I'm, fine I'll do it a hundred and first.
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.720]   Doesn't hurt, hell it's good luck.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.800]   Well, hang on a minute.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.600]   Maybe we want to stop and go, what can I learn from that?
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:18.340]   But it, it, it,
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.880]   I don't know of a trick.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:24.920]   I think, I think that, I think that, I think,
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.820]   if there's any trick I would say,
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:32.400]   it's just, how quickly can we admit the inevitable?
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.920]   That's what I'm talking about in the book of Acts.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:39.060]   Once you know it's inevitable, how do we get relative?
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:42.660]   Not skip it, not throw it to the side, not deny it,
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:45.380]   which I'd love to talk about that here sometimes too,
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.560]   but the value of denial sometimes.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.300]   The value of denial.
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.140]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.740]   But how quickly do we, do we,
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.460]   once something's inevitable go,
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:29:00.500]   okay, any mind and heart time I'm spending about going,
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.720]   no, I can't believe that happened.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.300]   No, did that really happen?
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.060]   Anytime we spend it trying to deny
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.540]   that what has already happened, that seems to me to be,
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.140]   I'm not sure the value of that time.
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.060]   So if any, there's any trick I would say,
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.740]   once you know something's inevitable,
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.060]   even though how painful it is or how awesome it is,
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:18.240]   even though how painful it is or how awesome it is,
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.820]   start getting relative with that.
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:26.780]   And in the relativity is seeing there's a gift here.
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:30.880]   And if I realize that gift I'm honoring,
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.980]   now I'm on to building up the beautiful passage
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.140]   of my father leaving this life.
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:42.140]   Now I'm on the march to go, yes, let's let the legacy,
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.000]   let this become omnipresent.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:44.980]   Let him live through me.
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.240]   Let me become more him.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.200]   It's transformed.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.840]   So what value is there then to denial?
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.720]   Any?
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.980]   Oh, I think there's value to denial
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.280]   if you really commit to it.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:03.560]   I get this from my mother.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.600]   So it's a very pragmatic value.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.080]   Commit to the denial.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:09.920]   Okay.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:17.140]   And my mom does it to an extent that I'm like,
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:20.820]   mom, do you have any consideration
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.900]   or context of situations?
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.360]   And she does.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.200]   This is the thing.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.580]   Every time I go, she's not a shallow woman.
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:31.380]   But if it is not, if it is something,
[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:35.900]   if it is something happens in her life,
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:40.900]   that is keeping her from going where she wants to go
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:48.760]   or having a joy in her life that she does.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:52.420]   She'll straight ass deny it happened.
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:53.260]   Didn't happen.
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.520]   No, it didn't.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:58.140]   Mom, we're right here.
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.540]   I heard you.
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:00.380]   Yeah.
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.380]   What you said.
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:02.200]   No, I didn't.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.040]   You heard something else.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:03.880]   Mom.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:07.580]   Now, she gets some amnesty on that.
[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:08.420]   She's 91.
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.460]   Hell yes, she gets some amnesty on that.
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:13.720]   But I've, she's not,
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:14.780]   she's not just a little girl.
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:15.620]   She's a little girl.
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.880]   Yeah. Does she repeat offend?
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.780]   Yeah. But it's misdemeanors.
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:20.860]   You know what I mean?
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.080]   I mean, it's like we all, it's part of that thing.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.440]   When you got a family member, you're like, yep.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.320]   That's just what they do.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:25.580]   Just go with it.
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:26.420]   You know?
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:30.060]   And, and, and it's, and it's, it's ingenious in a way.
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:31.480]   It's a tool.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:32.320]   She does.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.300]   I think it is more of a trick with her,
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.940]   but she wouldn't, so ingrained, it's not a trick.
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.600]   It just, do it.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.440]   Done.
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.900]   And, and I, and I, another reason I bring this up,
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.680]   it's outside of just my mother, is.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:48.680]   I did this road trip course
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:56.060]   in this art of living event a few weeks ago.
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:56.900]   Mm-hmm.
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:03.640]   Out of the hundreds of thousands of chats that came in
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.980]   and responses that came in afterward,
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:09.980]   it seemed to me that about 80% of people's challenges
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.640]   and problems even in their life were,
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:17.800]   were something in the past that they were hung up on.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:18.800]   Mm-hmm.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.760]   That they could not seem to get past.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.620]   And it was, it was holding them from going
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.940]   where they wanted to in their future.
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:28.520]   And so I thought that was revealing.
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.380]   I would've thought, I would've thought that was,
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:31.820]   I don't know, going in 40%.
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:33.320]   It was 80, it seemed to be 80%.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.780]   Yeah.
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:38.040]   And then I thought about, okay,
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:42.520]   if you're here in the live show,
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.520]   and you wanna get the course, you're, you're, you're, you're,
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.300]   you're gonna get into some sort of therapy
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:49.740]   or education or development or self-help, whatever, okay.
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:55.940]   And I have a lot of friends and I know a lot of people
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.680]   that are in weekly and daily therapy.
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.040]   And then I know there's a lot of people
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.880]   that are on prescriptions, drugs.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:10.700]   And while a therapy and the right prescription
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.400]   to the right person for the right,
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.180]   for the right person for the right person,
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:16.720]   is a very important thing.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.220]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:19.060]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:19.900]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:20.740]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:21.580]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:22.400]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.240]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.080]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:24.920]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.760]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.600]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:27.440]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.280]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.100]   And I think that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.360]   that thing in your memory
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:36.360]   where it's got you paralyzed and you're a victim of it.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:40.380]   And you're doing the therapy and you're doing the work
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.580]   and you're taking the prescription
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:42.760]   if that's what you're taking.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.340]   Where is there a value in going,
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.300]   if it's holding you back from going where you want to go,
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.380]   maybe you should just deny
[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:50.640]   the fucking thing ever fucking happened.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.800]   Kick it in the head.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:52.980]   Kick it off the curb.
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:55.640]   I'm done with you.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.480]   I'm sick of you.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.340]   I'm tired of hanging out with you.
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:00.060]   I'm tired of that thing, whatever it is,
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.620]   holding me back from going where I want to go.
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:06.560]   So if I can't wax the car, you know,
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.100]   and get past this thing, just kick it.
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:11.940]   That's so powerful.
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:16.040]   So one thing to do, like with the loss of your father,
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.520]   is to try to transform it, to discover the gift in it,
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.060]   the gift in the pain.
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.600]   But if you can't, keep looking, keep looking,
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.680]   you can't find the gift in the pain,
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:27.080]   just deny it ever happened.
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.740]   You could call that a trick,
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:33.080]   but I think it's more than a trick because let me say this.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.940]   My mom, after my father died,
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:40.280]   went on and found a second love of her life.
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:46.480]   For 19 years, they were together.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.400]   CJ Carlig.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.400]   Love you, buddy.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.460]   He's moved on now.
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:56.840]   Did she check with us a little bit?
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.600]   Like, is this okay?
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:02.040]   She gave us a little lingering half a second look
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.700]   that we knew that maybe is what she was asking.
[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.300]   And we came to her, it was like, yes, it's okay.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.440]   And you know who else is saying it's okay?
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.620]   Who's dancing up there for you?
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:11.520]   Dad.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:17.820]   So was that her denying?
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:22.640]   That the man she was divorced from twice,
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:25.660]   and married to three times, and had three children with,
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:28.360]   had moved on?
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.200]   No.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:33.360]   But she didn't say, I'm not, you know,
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:37.340]   well, what's the book on how long I'm supposed to stay single
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:39.060]   before I can be interested in another?
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:40.960]   There's not a book on these things.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.300]   How do you feel?
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:47.320]   Is loving CJ mean you love dad less?
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.160]   No.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:54.100]   Is finding a new life and a new dance partner in this life,
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.420]   in CJ, mean that?
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:59.080]   That dad wasn't your dance partner?
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:02.300]   That dad wasn't the love of your life?
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:06.640]   No.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:11.340]   So I don't know.
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:13.820]   I mean, in there, maybe, you know,
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.580]   maybe there's another word, I think it's denial,
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:16.720]   but it's not really denial,
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.580]   'cause it's not like it didn't happen.
[00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:21.220]   That's an earlier example I was giving my mom.
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:24.620]   She will absolutely go, that light's not on.
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:25.180]   Mom, the light's on.
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:26.680]   That light's not on.
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.480]   If I say it's not on, sometimes you're just like,
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.340]   that makes no sense.
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.560]   You're just absolutely denying what just happened.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.860]   We even have it recorded.
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.840]   And she'll go, well, the recording's lying.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.680]   Yeah.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.480]   I mean, that's part of a coping deal with her.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.300]   But I mean, what I think is more important
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.960]   or more valuable is to talk about this.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.700]   She didn't deny my dad dying.
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:50.360]   I didn't, but she sure as hell turned the page
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:53.940]   and said, I can still start a whole new category,
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:54.940]   a new life, a new love.
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:59.940]   Let my heart love and be loved by someone living
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:03.320]   in this life today that I'm still living in.
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:09.600]   And that will not trespass on my love for my husband,
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.900]   your father, Jim McConaughey.
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.400]   And I think, I mean, we were just,
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.740]   thought that was beautiful.
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:18.780]   Yes, mom, go.
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.360]   Talk about a green light, go.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:24.440]   Now, if we're hung up going,
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:29.440]   I can't have one or the, can't have them both.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.360]   Gotta have one or the other.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:34.820]   Now we start to make a contradiction of the two ideas again,
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:37.280]   which darn, our contradictions get us in trouble
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.500]   all the time, man.
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.760]   That's life though, the contradictions, right?
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:45.660]   But isn't life, if we just admit the contradictions
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.740]   are so much, don't they become a paradox?
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.260]   We just admit that that's part of it?
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.100]   Yeah.
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:51.560]   If contradictions are inevitable,
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.200]   they, hence, they do become a paradox, don't they?
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.540]   Then we're in the honey hole.
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:01.380]   Then we're singing and dancing
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:03.920]   and have leniency with ourself
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.440]   while still holding ourself to task.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:11.440]   And it's, I think it's holding on to know each contradiction.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.100]   Oh, here it is again.
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.140]   So it's a one-off.
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:17.380]   It lives on its own separate from the last one.
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.220]   No, it doesn't.
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:20.320]   They're connected.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:22.080]   That's why they are a paradox.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.960]   And then that's, I think that's a much,
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.860]   I think that's where life really is.
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:27.920]   In the paradox.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:28.840]   Yes.
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.200]   And the dance of it.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.840]   I think the metaphor of red, yellow, green lights
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:35.120]   is just so simple and so powerful.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.200]   You write about some green lights being engineered
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.940]   and some being mystical, which I love the difference of that.
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:47.600]   What's the difference of the engineered green lights
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:50.580]   and the mystical, such a cool word, mystical.
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.720]   Well, the engineered ones have reason and the mystical ones,
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.560]   have rhyme.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:55.380]   Yeah.
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:59.440]   You know, life's a mystery going forward,
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.940]   but it's a science looking back.
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:05.580]   I've prepared, I've had ideas and written headlines
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:10.580]   and had goals and athlete gets in shape for an event.
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:13.120]   And I get in shape for a role.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:18.120]   I read, I study, I work, I prepare and I go and I'm prepared
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.840]   and I behave and I do it.
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.480]   And I look at it and I go, yes.
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:25.900]   That's what I wanted to do.
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.440]   It's engineered green light.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:36.100]   It's a conscious delayed gratification.
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:42.860]   It's that if I do it today, that pragmatic head down,
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:44.460]   believe there's no cloud out there,
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.560]   but then I trust that there is one out there.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.360]   If I do keep my head down to do it, I'll get that dream.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:52.820]   We can engineer those habits.
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:57.360]   Work ethic, prep, expertise, education.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:02.400]   And the mystical ones though, don't make any sense.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.100]   They're not supposed to make sense.
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:07.240]   They only make sense after, right when they happen,
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:10.600]   you backlog and you connect the dots with how they got there.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:15.600]   That red light you ran into that made you 30 seconds later
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:19.720]   to get to the restaurant.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.200]   As you walked in, she walked out.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.700]   And you went, good morning.
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.700]   And she went, good morning.
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:33.320]   And two months later, you're dating.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:36.180]   Two years later, you're married.
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:39.180]   You're after that, you've got a family.
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:42.040]   And now you're sitting here 40 years later going,
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.360]   I love you.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.080]   Look at what we've built.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.320]   And you go back and go,
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:52.140]   what if I wouldn't hit that red light?
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:56.040]   Those 30 seconds made all the difference.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.880]   And so strange that this life is this way.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:40:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:00.840]   And that's just rhyme.
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.180]   I mean, we can't really add that up.
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.040]   It's a science when you look back,
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:11.040]   you see why it was that you were upset
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:16.700]   and ticked off that you had to pick up the kids' toys
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.180]   before you left and they were supposed to pick them up.
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.380]   And therefore you were late for the thing
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:20.240]   that made you ran into and you ran into the person that was walking in the office.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.100]   And you ran into the person that was walking in the office.
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.100]   And you ran into the person that was walking in the office.
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.100]   That's the guy that you did the interview.
[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:25.260]   That's the guy you were looking for,
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.060]   the job you wanted and you caught him
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.320]   'cause you were in the elevator with him.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.620]   And that 90 seconds on that elevator,
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:33.680]   what got you that job that led you doing what you wanna do.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:37.520]   I mean, the significance is there,
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.660]   but we have to, I think what we also gotta watch is,
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:43.540]   again, in that balance, what do we chase?
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.400]   'Cause if we just chase the engineering, we miss magic.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:52.040]   If we just chase the mystical, we find ourself caught up in magic.
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.360]   I've been trying to give meaning to that Lego set
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:57.040]   that was on the floor that my kids didn't pick up.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.560]   And what color was it?
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.540]   And why did I walk out that door and see,
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:02.980]   almost step on the Legos,
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:04.140]   but if I had gone out the other door,
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:05.720]   I usually go out of, I would've gone there,
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:06.640]   I would've got there early
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.600]   and wouldn't have run into the boss.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:14.040]   So you can start to give too much meaning on that as well.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.440]   I think we can give significance in too many places
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:19.020]   and all of a sudden, I think we've all been there
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:21.980]   where you're seeing art in every single thing.
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:23.920]   Man, that can be paralyzing.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.920]   It's like, it's hard to leave a room
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.400]   if everything's significant,
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:32.220]   or if everything's a sign.
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:37.140]   - How much of success in life do you think is engineered
[00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.380]   and how much is mystical?
[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:41.440]   And how much does it differ from person to person?
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.740]   'Cause for me personally, maybe I enjoy it,
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.200]   maybe I'm genetically built that way,
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.840]   but I exist more in the mystical.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:51.040]   So I don't make plans.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:55.560]   I traveled last summer in Ukraine with no plan.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.120]   I just went there.
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.640]   No plan.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.740]   I didn't know how I'm going to meet
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.540]   the president of the country.
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.120]   I didn't know anybody.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:06.720]   And so there's no plan.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:07.600]   There's no clear thing.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.080]   You're just roaming around.
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:10.740]   And that's how I've existed in life.
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:14.120]   And there's something about giving yourself over
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.920]   to the flow of nature that I just enjoy.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.980]   It makes life so much fun.
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.860]   - It's awesome when you can do it.
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.480]   Did you engineer though,
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:27.180]   I'm going to put myself in the place
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:30.740]   when you got on the plane to go to the destination.
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:33.020]   That was an engineered choice.
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.440]   - Yes, the choice.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.640]   - With the intent of,
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.920]   and maybe I'll meet and I'll run into,
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.260]   and I can work up a sit down with.
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:45.240]   So the engineered choice was putting your shoes on,
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.600]   proverbially, I always say this,
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:47.660]   the hardest part about going to the gym
[00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.120]   is putting your shoes on, right?
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.800]   So getting on the plane, that was an engineered thought.
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:52.800]   With the goal in mind,
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.460]   but I don't know how I'm going to do it.
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:56.300]   - The choice.
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:57.120]   - Yeah.
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.000]   - Putting the shoes on, yeah.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.520]   But there's not a clear,
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:03.800]   it's a fog what happens after the shoes go on.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:04.640]   - Yeah.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.700]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.160]   - Just going to take that leap.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.020]   So I wonder how much,
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:15.040]   for people who are successful in this world
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:19.520]   and finding what makes them truly happy and fulfilled,
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:20.800]   how much of it is engineered?
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:21.740]   How much is mystical?
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:24.780]   How much was it for you?
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:27.060]   - Well, I'll say this,
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:30.300]   like when I went to write the book "Green Lights,"
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.740]   which is basically the last 40 years of my life,
[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:37.120]   I thought that 85, 90% of my successes
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:40.860]   were going to be obviously engineered.
[00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:42.800]   Or I could see the signs, saw the habits,
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.380]   here's what I did, yep, that add up,
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.780]   got the solution, got the conclusion.
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:51.680]   I was very surprised when I noticed that,
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.720]   I noticed that it was probably less than 50%.
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.600]   And that most of the real successes of my life
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:45:00.220]   were when I trusted,
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:05.340]   the when I trusted that I didn't have to define it,
[00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:07.060]   that I only trusted that I didn't have to go,
[00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:08.460]   well, what's the measurement?
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.920]   What's the score?
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:14.340]   This leads to what?
[00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:15.220]   What's next?
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:18.520]   And I,
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:19.360]   I was like,
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.420]   I'm not sure what I was doing.
[00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:21.620]   I was like, I'm not sure what I was doing.
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:26.620]   And for me, that's still a challenge for me daily.
[00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:32.540]   Now is to trust and not be,
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:35.840]   'cause I can be, I think I can be overly practical.
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:39.300]   And I think I can overcompensate and miss out on magic
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:45.400]   because I'm still going, wait, but do you,
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.640]   are we giving enough,
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:51.560]   are we giving enough measure and credit
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.140]   to actuality?
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:57.140]   Are we, am I giving enough credit to this is,
[00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:02.140]   these are the steps to take and this is reality?
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:08.440]   I think I'm reminded when I trust,
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:12.520]   'cause that going with the mystic,
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.480]   just to put yourself on the plane was the engineering,
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:15.560]   but getting there, and as you say,
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.920]   you seem, you say you roll in that mystical,
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:19.560]   it takes a lot of trust.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:23.620]   Trust in the inevitable.
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:25.260]   Amen on that.
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:27.280]   But not knowing where it actually ends you up.
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.840]   It's a feeling more than,
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:33.040]   I don't think it's a clear vision.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.380]   Right.
[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:37.340]   It's kind of like a feeling that guides you towards,
[00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:41.740]   towards a place with,
[00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:46.920]   without a clear name, without clear characteristics,
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:49.780]   it just kind of pulls you there.
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:51.440]   Where do you get that,
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:55.440]   that courage and trust to go with your gut,
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.620]   your feeling?
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:47:01.260]   And is there, for instance,
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:02.940]   three days later you sit down,
[00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:04.520]   is there, if you didn't, if that,
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.440]   if that doesn't happen,
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.920]   is there a sense a week, two weeks later,
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.360]   now when you come back to America,
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.760]   they're like, ah, I failed?
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:21.380]   Sort of looking,
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:23.500]   looking back to try to analyze what went right,
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:26.340]   what went wrong, that kind of thing.
[00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:29.020]   Yeah, that engine is always there.
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:31.180]   But I think what pulls me forward in life,
[00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:34.060]   what makes me really grateful and fulfilled
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.940]   is noticing the thing you mentioned,
[00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:39.800]   noticing the magic and kind of going towards it.
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:42.700]   Sort of just sitting back,
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:47.480]   both in tragedy and in triumph.
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:49.820]   So in war, there's a lot of tragedy,
[00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:51.000]   but there's somehow,
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:55.240]   one of the things you see in war,
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.900]   and this is the first war I've experienced
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:59.060]   and seen the front,
[00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:01.440]   is the loss that people lose their homes
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.320]   and all this kind of stuff.
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:07.520]   The thing that rises from that is the love for each other.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.620]   So they, the people I've spoken with,
[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:12.300]   don't give a damn about the home.
[00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:13.700]   Don't give a damn about the,
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:15.500]   on farms and the animals they lost.
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:18.780]   Don't, don't give a damn about having to move
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:19.620]   and all this kind of stuff,
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:21.260]   as long as the family's still there.
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.780]   As long as the people they love are still there.
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:24.620]   And there's like,
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:28.680]   that's, there's this melancholy smile
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:30.660]   they have on their face.
[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:32.860]   Like, yeah, this world is full of bullshit.
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:34.820]   It's full of tragedy,
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:36.640]   but life is fucking awesome.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.200]   And that, and you just notice that
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.920]   in little ways everywhere.
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.900]   You just sit back and yeah, notice the magic.
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:45.520]   And I want more of that.
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:49.240]   You just kind of follow along like a little ant.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.080]   - Yeah.
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:52.040]   - Or something.
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:53.760]   But I don't know.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:56.200]   I hope, you know, what I think it is,
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.240]   is other people notice that you're the kind of person
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.660]   that notices it.
[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:02.580]   And they're like, I want to hang out with that person.
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:03.960]   He seems all right.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:07.280]   Like he seems one of the, one of the good ones.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.120]   One of the good ants.
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:13.120]   - Do you have any certain non-negotiable structure
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:21.160]   before that freedom to go with the feeling?
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.000]   - I think so.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.600]   There's a set of principles.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:29.440]   I'll just basically integrity of being good to other people.
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.180]   Like whatever that means for me, there's specific things.
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:38.180]   Like I'm really into loyalty above the law.
[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:39.260]   - Right.
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:42.820]   - There's kind of like, there's a circle of friends I have
[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:44.780]   and that means everything.
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:51.100]   There's just the basics, deep kindness, totality,
[00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:52.180]   towards others.
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:58.660]   Empathy, empathy towards people that others might label
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:49:59.660]   as even evil.
[00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:03.740]   I have that kind of empathy.
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:07.180]   I believe all of us have the capacity to do good and evil.
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:10.220]   And so I just kind of see everybody as little babies
[00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:11.940]   that grew up in different conditions.
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:14.640]   And so some do evil, some do good.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:21.040]   And there's, yeah, there's all kinds of other principles.
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:24.880]   I love the dynamic between the different humans
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.420]   and their full diversity.
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:29.280]   I love the dynamic between the masculine and the feminine.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.120]   I enjoy it.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.900]   I enjoy the dance of it.
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:32.740]   Yeah.
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:33.700]   Yeah.
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:38.700]   - So you have a constitution with which you embark.
[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:40.380]   - You do too.
[00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:41.480]   - Into chasing.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:42.320]   Yes.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:43.160]   I hope so.
[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:50.480]   And for me, I'd like to, it's inspiring to hear.
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.480]   I'm not gonna say that I'm gonna be a successful person
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:53.320]   in the future.
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.320]   I'm gonna be a successful person in the future.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:55.160]   I'm gonna be a successful person in the future.
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:56.000]   I'm gonna be a successful person in the future.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:56.840]   I'm gonna be a successful person in the future.
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:57.680]   I'm gonna be a successful person in the future.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:58.520]   I'm gonna be a successful person in the future.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:50:59.360]   I'm gonna be a successful person in the future.
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.200]   I'm gonna be a successful person in the future.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.040]   I'm gonna be a successful person in the future.
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:01.880]   I'm gonna be a successful person in the future.
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:02.720]   I'm gonna be a successful person in the future.
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:03.560]   I'm gonna be a successful person in the future.
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:04.400]   I'm gonna be a successful person in the future.
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.220]   I'm gonna be a successful person in the future.
[00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:06.060]   I'm gonna be a successful person in the future.
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:15.820]   ticket amazon africa yeah and those were spiritual and very pragmatic because they led to
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:24.380]   dealing with with succeeding in other in other ways that are more pragmatic a hundred percent
[00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:30.860]   and gave much more meaning to those things but that's that's to be able to
[00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:38.060]   go out and and say that's how you do you have family i really want to get married and have
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:44.060]   kids but i i'm not married and don't have kids yet okay so actually one of the nice things about that
[00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:51.900]   is you can take bigger risks yes so while i'm not married and don't have kids i feel i owe it to
[00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:59.740]   myself to take just to go go to the amazon yes throw that backpack on a one-way ticket yeah
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:11.020]   because that does get harder to do yeah um i miss that um sometimes the

[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:15.420]   i've stripped a lot of my past symbols and talismans while i was while i was there what i what
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:24.620]   i i remember getting there and and and just having so much adrenaline on the anticipation
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:26.860]   anticipation of getting to the amazon
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:34.780]   in the first 10 days i wasn't really enjoying the trip i was just charging
[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:39.980]   to get to the destination to get to the banks of the river that i had a dream about
[00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:49.260]   and then it just humbled me i got so fatigued on night whatever 12
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:57.900]   and was so sick and tired of the internal dialogue i was having with myself i was not enjoying my
[00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:58.300]   company
[00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:01.740]   that
[00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:10.860]   you know i i i purged and i remember and and and and stripped off
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:18.620]   identity markers that i'd sort of been hanging on to for like everything from

[00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:48.060]   out my father i wasn't casting him out i was just removing to say i don't have to rely on
[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:53.660]   that being all of my identity so to pull that off to to to strip down and just to where i was just a
[00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:54.860]   a mammal
[00:54:54.860 --> 00:55:09.740]   that next morning i i was light i got present i remember writing something down it's like all
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:16.200]   that i want is what i can see and what i can see is in front of me that sense of not i wasn't
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:21.700]   leaning around looking around every corner to get there and as soon as that hit me talk about
[00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:28.560]   mystical successes and realities and truth as soon as that hit me and for the first time in
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:34.040]   12 days i didn't care about getting there what was around the corner guess what was around the
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:42.300]   next damn corner the amazon i mean not around a few corners the next corner there it was
[00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:50.240]   and that was just like a touche you know those times when the prime mover the universe god what
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.660]   we want to
[00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:51.680]   you know
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:57.460]   name or believe in says ding there you go and
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:01.860]   that
[00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:06.360]   form of detachment from
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:16.600]   holding on for dear life to things in past so hard that you're not letting the beauty that's
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:20.680]   right in front of you to feel correctly and follow our intuitions
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:27.260]   to have those not cast them out i didn't burn them i didn't get rid of those things i just took them
[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:33.380]   off and had to recognize you're still here you are you you're much more that is a talisman that's a
[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:38.420]   symbol that means something to you and that's good don't cast out the meaning but it's not like
[00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:43.540]   when the ring's off and the hat's off and the crucifix is off your neck that you're like
[00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:47.520]   you're gonna die and i know those are reminders hang on to what they mean for you and for the rest of your life.
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:48.320]   hang on to what they mean for you and for the rest of your life.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:48.960]   hang on to what they mean for you and for the rest of your life.
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:49.460]   hang on to what they mean for you and for the rest of your life.
[00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:49.900]   hang on to what they mean for you and for the rest of your life.
[00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:50.280]   hang on to what they mean for you and for the rest of your life.
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:57:19.580]   hang on to what they mean for you as we go forward but as we go forward quit worrying about so much about you again i was looking at the proverbial dream the cloud so much that i was tripping over myself to get there and like clockwork just amazing grace boom as soon as it hit me and i was like oh that's it all i want is what i can see and all i can see is in front of me.
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:20.080]   and i was like oh that's it all i want is what i can see is in front of me.
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:20.580]   and i was like oh that's it all i want is what i can see is in front of me.
[00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:21.080]   and i was like oh that's it all i want is what i can see is in front of me.
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:23.240]   literally looking down at the ground.
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:23.740]   literally looking down at the ground.
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:24.300]   literally looking down at the ground.
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:32.300]   at what was a sea of 10,000 wild neon blue amazonian butterflies on the ground.
[00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:34.620]   as soon as they fluttered up my head came up with them.
[00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:36.620]   as soon as they fluttered up my head came up with them.
[00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:40.700]   i took a few more steps and there's the amazon that's what you came over here for oh howdy those kind of that truth like that.
[00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:41.580]   i took a few more steps and there's the amazon that's what you came over here for oh howdy those kind of that truth like that.
[00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:45.580]   i took a few more steps and there's the amazon that's what you came over here for oh howdy those kind of that truth like that.
[00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:45.580]   well the amazon is interesting too because it really has no past or future losing the moment because of how fast it churns it just eats up life.
[00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:51.580]   well the amazon is interesting too because it really has no past or future losing the moment because of how fast it churns it just eats up life.
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:54.540]   well the amazon is interesting too because it really has no past or future losing the moment because of how fast it churns it just eats up life.
[00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:58.540]   it like if a thing dies it just gets swallowed up because uh maybe because of the humidity because of all that because there's so many living creatures to kind of eat each other live on each other so it really exists in the moment and all this kind of diversity of life there.
[00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:01.920]   Because maybe because of the humidity, because of all that,
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:05.480]   because there's so many living creatures that kind of eat each other,
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:06.420]   live on each other.
[00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:08.960]   So it really exists in the moment.
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.640]   And all this kind of diversity of life there.
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:13.060]   It's such an interesting place.
[00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:14.480]   Talk about food chain.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:16.280]   You're just part of it there.
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:20.780]   We humans somehow escaped that food chain.
[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:23.060]   But we're still, the roots are still there.
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:26.280]   I think we're a bit arrogant to think we've escaped.
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:31.300]   Do you think I'm being romantic in that notion?
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:33.240]   Well, sometimes when you're in a big city,
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:37.820]   when you're in Austin, Texas and L.A.,
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:42.300]   you can think like, oh, we're in a car, we're in a house, we're safe.
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:46.660]   But yeah, somehow nature is still a part of us.
[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:48.760]   Our roots are still a part of us.
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:52.640]   I think it is more than we realize, more than we give it credit for.
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:54.640]   I actually have a...
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:57.260]   believe that we...
[00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:01.260]   are...
[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:07.240]   that it's a really arrogant notion to think that we are separate.
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:13.620]   Meaning, you know, people talk about pollution on a larger scale,
[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:15.200]   the climate or what have you.
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:18.300]   I think Earth's going to be just fine.
[00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:21.440]   We may not be here for it,
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:25.060]   but I think we have a bit of arrogance sometimes to think that we...
[00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:28.560]   can trump Mother Nature.
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:32.320]   I think we have more of the natural law in us.
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:36.300]   And I sure hope so if I'm wrong.
[00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:38.960]   Well, there's an interesting...
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:39.920]   I've recently been...
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:45.320]   there's a guy named Max Tegmark at MIT who really worries about nuclear war.
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:50.880]   And he was part of constructing a simulation of what happens when a nuclear war happens.
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:55.020]   It's interesting to see that, you know, some very large percentage of humans,
[00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:57.280]   on Earth, starve to death.
[00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:02.360]   Because they don't die first from the explosion, they die from starvation.
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:10.680]   Because basically, dust covers the entire North America and entirety of Europe.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:14.280]   And so the crops all die, all the food sources all die,
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:17.360]   and people suffocate and starve to death.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:21.560]   But, you know, the lesson you learn from that over a period of a few months,
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:24.260]   even though most of the human population of Earth dies,
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:28.640]   Earth finds a way, life finds a way...
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.640]   - To adapt.
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:30.640]   - Yeah, to adapt.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.220]   And it's going to be just fine.
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:33.220]   - Yeah.
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:38.220]   - In terms of the big living ecosystem that is life on Earth.
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:43.740]   And yeah, it's humbling to think about, well, maybe we're just the stepping stone.
[01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:45.480]   Same thing with...
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:48.480]   we've talked offline about artificial intelligence.
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:54.940]   Maybe humans are just the stepping stone to the development of these other super intelligent entities.
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:55.940]   - Yeah.
[01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:56.940]   Yeah.
[01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:10.940]   And is it unconsciously in our nature that that's just part of the evolution and adaptation of our species?
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:11.940]   And we'll...
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:12.940]   Because we're going to...
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:15.940]   We were talking about earlier what AI becomes.
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:22.940]   It's completely 100% based on who we are.
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:23.940]   - Yeah.
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:24.900]   - Yeah.
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:29.900]   - And we get to see it for some time, a mirror to ourselves.
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:31.900]   Okay, this is what human civilization is like.
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:38.900]   These AI systems, large language models are trained on human communication.
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:41.900]   And you get to ask it questions, and you get to have conversations with it.
[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.900]   You get to realize, wow, this is what...
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:51.900]   The collective intelligence of the human species, our collective wisdom and knowledge, is what it looks like.
[01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:54.860]   All the bias, the hate.
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:58.860]   The paradoxes, all that is in there.
[01:01:58.860 --> 01:01:59.860]   - Yeah.
[01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:02.860]   - The contradictions.
[01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:04.860]   You can even convince those models.
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:08.860]   You can tell them they're lying and they're going to start changing their mind.
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:10.860]   It's interesting to play with them.
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:11.860]   - Yeah.
[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:23.860]   - It's also interesting to consider that maybe they become smarter than us and become almost life forms that live among us.
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:26.860]   And maybe one day, kind of we merge with them.
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:29.860]   There's all kinds of possible trajectories that we take here.
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:30.860]   - How much of that excites you?
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:32.860]   How much of it scares you?
[01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:39.860]   - Is it possible to exist in a place where it's both exciting and scary, but to exist in that dance?
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:49.860]   Mostly, I'm really excited because I see human beings as deeply lonely.
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:51.860]   Like there's a deep loneliness in all of us.
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:52.860]   That's how we see connection.
[01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:54.860]   That's why we see connection in others.
[01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:58.860]   That's why love is so beautiful when we find other people we're connected with.
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:00.860]   And I just think AI can add to that.
[01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:07.860]   It can add friends that you can have great conversations with.
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:13.860]   And some of those friends would be AI systems.
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:17.860]   They'll call you out on your bullshit in the most fascinating and interesting of ways.
[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:21.860]   And challenge you and help you explore ideas together.
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:23.860]   So I'm excited by that.
[01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:25.860]   - Is that different?
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:50.860]   And if so, how from the internet and Facebooks and these groups and communities that were, I think it's fair to say, set out to say this all access of information and people will help us find more common denominators than divisive ones.
[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.860]   Is it similar?
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:55.860]   - Yeah, it's similar, but further into that direction.
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:04:04.860]   I think the internet has done an amazing thing in connecting us and expanding our minds and helping us find community that feels like our community.
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:07.860]   And then the communities that are totally different and you learn from them.
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:15.860]   I mean, Wikipedia alone, one of my favorite websites, just opens your mind to all kinds of cool stuff.
[01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:16.860]   - Yeah, it does.
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:19.860]   Not the Dewey Decimal System anymore.
[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:20.860]   - No.
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:25.860]   And so I think AI just makes that even easier.
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:29.860]   Because Wikipedia, you have to like read and have to do a lot of work.
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:34.860]   With an AI system, like a large language model, you can just shoot the shit.
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:39.860]   It's more like drinking a beer versus like doing homework.
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:40.860]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:43.860]   It's already happening.
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:46.860]   What do you think about that becoming the new family?
[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:51.860]   To where, you know, you said, you're not married, you don't have kids.
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:53.860]   Could you see a future for yourself?
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:58.860]   Or do you have a relationship with AI and that is your family?
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:02.860]   - That's the main, that's the primary, like even romantic relationship.
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:03.860]   - Yeah.
[01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:06.860]   - I can see it.
[01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:08.860]   That one worries me.
[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:11.860]   I like to keep it at friends.
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:12.860]   - Right.
[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:19.860]   - I think I'm not ready to commit to the romantic.
[01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:23.860]   It's, I wonder how much that, now that takes us back to the Amazon in nature,
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:26.860]   how much we still need the human touch.
[01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:27.860]   - Yeah.
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:29.860]   - And whatever magic there is between two humans,
[01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:32.860]   which takes the leap into the romantic,
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:35.860]   versus just the intimacy of a good friendship.
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:36.860]   I don't know.
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:43.860]   - So, correct me if I'm wrong, you see AI as having a deep and meaningful friendship.
[01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:44.860]   - Yes.
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:51.860]   - And hopefully it will be a friend that will help you evolve
[01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:53.860]   and be able to love even more and be loved.
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:57.860]   And you can take that into humanity and find another homo sapien.
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:05:58.860]   - Yes.
[01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:00.860]   - To go, yes.
[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:06.860]   And thank you, AI, my great friend, for opening me up to this beauty that I have in myself.
[01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:11.860]   I can see in you, my fellow human.
[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:12.860]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:13.860]   - And let's come together.
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:14.860]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:17.860]   - And let's come together and biologically create family if we want to.
[01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:18.860]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:21.860]   - And let's all remain friends with my friend
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:24.860]   and make your own friends with my friends' friends on AI.
[01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:27.860]   And let's have these great neighbor.
[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:29.860]   It's a good friend, a great friend that's a neighbor.
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:30.860]   - Yeah.
[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:31.860]   - Okay.
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:32.860]   - Mentor and friend.
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:37.860]   Just like now there's AI systems that play chess far, far, far better than humans.
[01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:40.860]   And we humans still play chess with each other.
[01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:42.860]   Or chess is still a game that's fun for us humans.
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:43.860]   - Right.
[01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:49.860]   - And then we use the AI systems to get better at chess to learn, to train, to discover new
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:53.860]   ideas, but ultimately return to the chessboard between two humans.
[01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:54.860]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:59.860]   - But of course, this world is full of dangerous people.
[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:08.860]   And so those same AI systems can be used to harm, to create false narratives, to do social
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:11.860]   engineering and manipulate the masses in terms of what they believe in.
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.860]   In terms of what they believe and all that kind of stuff.
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:14.860]   That's scary.
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:15.860]   - Yeah.
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:26.860]   Well, and I get it when we, and I have my own fear and distrust of AI is based on my
[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:28.860]   own fear and distrust of myself and others.
[01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:29.860]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:39.860]   - There's something, it's very simple, but I think it's a really fun sort of way to just
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:40.860]   set up this reality.
[01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:47.860]   And everyone, it's kind of a duh, but still needs to be said that AI is a prompt.
[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:50.860]   It doesn't do anything unless we ask it.
[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:51.860]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:57.860]   - So what questions are we gonna ask?
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:01.860]   Is a question, is what we need to ask ourselves, 'cause we're going to be looking in the mirror
[01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:07.860]   at our digital God that we create from ourselves.
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:08.860]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:09.860]   - And just to know that that's that place where we're gonna be.
[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:12.860]   That's that place where it's awesome and scary, exciting and scary.
[01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:17.860]   We go, oh, it's our creation, which is awesome.
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:19.860]   At the same time, oh shit.
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:29.860]   But it's prompted by our questions and gives us patterns from that which we give it.
[01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:38.860]   - But that prompting, that's the art of life.
[01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:41.860]   Like we prompt each other in conversation, our loved ones.
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:48.860]   When you go out about your day today, the next words you say, the next word you say to me,
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:52.860]   the question I ask of you, that's prompting.
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:53.860]   - Yeah.
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:55.860]   - And it could change everything.
[01:08:55.860 --> 01:09:01.860]   I could say so many things right now that will completely, the set of possibilities
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:07.860]   where both of our lives can take given on the selection of words I use and you use.
[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:08.860]   - Yeah.
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:09.860]   - And that's what makes conversation fun.
[01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:10.860]   - Yay.
[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:11.860]   - And then same thing with AI.
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:12.860]   Except the nice thing about AI is it's tireless.
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:13.860]   - Tireless.
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:14.860]   Right.
[01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:15.860]   Let me ask you this.
[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:16.860]   If you can falsely condemn me right now.
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:17.860]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:18.860]   - And I prove you falsely condemn me, I can forgive you.
[01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:19.860]   And we can march forward stronger than before.
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:20.860]   - Yes.
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:21.860]   - And AI is tireless.
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:22.860]   - Yeah.
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:23.860]   - And I can forgive you.
[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:24.860]   - Yeah.
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:25.860]   - And I can forgive you.
[01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:26.860]   - Yeah.
[01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:27.860]   - And I can forgive you.
[01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:28.860]   - Yeah.
[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:29.860]   - And I can forgive you.

[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:35.860]   - And I can forgive you.
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:36.860]   - Yeah.

[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:11.860]   - And I can forgive you.
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:12.860]   - Yeah.
[01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:13.860]   - And I can forgive you.
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:14.860]   - Yeah.

[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:24.860]   - Yeah.
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:25.860]   - And I can forgive you.
[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:26.860]   - Yeah.
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:27.860]   - And I can forgive you.
[01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:28.860]   - Yeah.

[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:36.860]   - Yeah.
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:37.860]   - And I can forgive you.
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:38.860]   - Yeah.
[01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:39.860]   - And I can forgive you.
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:40.860]   - Yeah.
[01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:41.860]   - Yeah.
[01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:42.860]   - And I can forgive you.
[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:43.860]   - Yeah.
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:44.860]   - And I can forgive you.
[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:45.860]   - Yeah.
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:46.860]   - Yeah.
[01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:47.860]   - And I can forgive you.
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:48.860]   - Yeah.
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:49.860]   - Yeah.
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:50.860]   - And I can forgive you.
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:51.860]   - Yeah.
[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:52.860]   - And I can forgive you.
[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:53.860]   - Yeah.
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:54.860]   - And I can forgive you.
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:55.860]   - Yeah.
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:56.860]   - And I can forgive you.
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:57.860]   - Yeah.
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:11:58.860]   - And I can forgive you.
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:11:59.860]   - Yeah.
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:00.860]   - And I can forgive you.
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:01.860]   - Yeah.
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:05.940]   Because the set of ideas that humans have come up with,
[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:07.120]   a lot of them are awesome.
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.980]   Most of them are awesome, I would say.
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:11.380]   But some of them are dangerous.
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:14.160]   The reason they're dangerous is because they become viral.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:17.340]   There's something exciting in us about those ideas,
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:19.920]   but they also harm others a lot,
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:23.180]   because that's who we are as humans.
[01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:27.740]   We're capable of envy and all the dark stuff of hate
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:28.620]   and all this.
[01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:30.900]   - Capable.
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:31.740]   - Yes.
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:36.700]   We also choose it.
[01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:40.700]   - You think most people are good?
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:42.980]   - Yes.
[01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:49.080]   But I also believe we got the good and the evil
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:51.960]   in all of us, and it's which wolf we feed.
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:56.260]   - You ask people to draw a distinction,
[01:12:56.260 --> 01:13:00.880]   to describe where are you acting,
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:03.180]   and where are you being?
[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:04.020]   - Mm.
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:06.700]   - What's the difference?
[01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:10.840]   What's the difference between being fake,
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:13.120]   if I may use that word, and being real?
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:14.480]   - Okay.
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:17.480]   Yeah, and the word authentic gets thrown around a lot.
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:22.260]   And I don't mean,
[01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:25.660]   I used to think, I used to feel this way,
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:28.620]   but Bob Dylan loosened me up on this idea a little bit.
[01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:29.460]   -
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:30.660]   - Usually it was all about, get to be, get to be.
[01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:31.500]   - Yeah.
[01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:34.160]   - To be your only one and only true self.
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.260]   - Yeah.
[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:36.240]   - That's it.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:39.160]   Everything else is fake.
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:40.620]   And then you hear Bob go,
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:43.260]   well, I mean, we are what we create ourselves to be.
[01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:46.840]   We are our own creations, which I'm like, ah, yes.
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:47.680]   Yes, we are.
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:48.920]   Thank you, Bob.
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:49.760]   - Bobby.
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:54.580]   - What?
[01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:59.800]   I'm all for,
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:04.800]   I'm all for bullshitters and bullshitting.
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:09.020]   I'm not as big a fan of liars and lying.
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:11.860]   - What's the distinction?
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:13.960]   You're talking about the art form of bullshitting?
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:16.060]   - A liar's faking it,
[01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:19.380]   but not admitting to themselves that, yeah.
[01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:20.220]   - Oh yeah.
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:21.060]   - It's a fucking creation.
[01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:21.880]   I'm faking it.
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:22.720]   - Yeah.
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:26.060]   - A liar, I'm lying to your face right now.
[01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:28.300]   And I don't give you that hair of a wink out of my right eye
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:29.580]   that lets you know, hey, go with me here.
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:30.420]   - Yeah.
[01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:32.580]   - I think there's value in the bullshitting.
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:33.420]   - Yeah.
[01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:36.500]   - Now the lying becomes troublesome because one,
[01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:38.920]   I've duped you and I didn't let you know,
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:41.000]   come on, I was just telling the story about catching the fish.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.860]   The fish always gets bigger every year we tell a story.
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:44.000]   Come on, go with it, all right?
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:44.840]   - Yeah.
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:47.540]   - But the lying all of a sudden,
[01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:51.040]   I don't know my own.
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:53.580]   I don't know when I'm emanating something
[01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:55.440]   and creating something, telling the truth,
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.740]   being authentic or lying.
[01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:59.360]   And I'm, shit, all of a sudden I'm leaving crime.
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.360]   I'm leaving crimes with myself.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.980]   That constitution gets blurry.
[01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:05.860]   - Lying to yourself and to others.
[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:07.280]   - Yeah, well, you start to lie.
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:08.980]   You lie to others enough, you start to lie to yourself
[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:10.520]   and you don't even know it.
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:13.020]   And that I believe is dangerous territory.
[01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:16.200]   That's why I'm trying to push this admit,
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.860]   because that goes, I'm not,
[01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:21.020]   I'm trying to come in at a kindergarten level
[01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:23.320]   because we immediately jump to,
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:25.320]   well, I'm gonna judge that.
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:26.900]   Boom, that's bad, that's wrong.
[01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:28.600]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:29.140]   Hold back on that.
[01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:31.980]   Let's go back to base level.
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:35.300]   Let's just admit that we all fucking do it.
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:39.600]   Lies we tell others, lies we tell ourselves,
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:42.340]   lies we believe for convenience sake.
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:43.260]   I do it.
[01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:44.560]   I'm guilty of it.
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:45.760]   I try to catch myself on it.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.560]   If I can just call it and go,
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:50.140]   you know you're believing that lie out of convenience.
[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:50.980]   I'm like, I know.
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:51.840]   And then I have to,
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:54.860]   see if I'm saying that in the mirror or writing it down
[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:57.020]   or sharing with a friend, you know?
[01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:58.920]   And I go, okay, well now I've inherently
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:02.380]   become a bullshitter then because I admitted it.
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:04.540]   That I can shake hands with.
[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:07.000]   That's the little slight wink to ourself
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.340]   and someone else go, come on,
[01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:10.880]   it's a better story this way.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:12.920]   In the course Road Trip,
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:17.280]   you start with step one, admit.
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.660]   How do you do that?
[01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:23.340]   How do you, how do you kind of step back and-
[01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:25.800]   Do that inventory?
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:26.620]   Yeah.
[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:31.620]   Is there a trick to that?
[01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:34.080]   Oh, if there's a trick to it,
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:37.660]   I think it's just about courage of having the,
[01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:43.160]   'cause it's, I don't think any of us like to admit
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:48.360]   our lies or look deep enough in to go,
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:53.260]   I've relied so much on that lie that it's become my reality.
[01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:54.960]   Yeah.
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.400]   And I'm, and I, and I, I don't want to admit it.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:00.240]   I don't want to be so puritanical.
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:09.260]   As to say, again, that's why I say admit instead of judge,
[01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:12.220]   but I don't want to be so puritanical as to go
[01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:14.060]   and admit it and get rid of it.
[01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:15.580]   No, I'm just saying to admit it,
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:17.180]   just bring it to the surface.
[01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:21.420]   Yeah.
[01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:26.180]   I'm saying this and I'm doing something different.
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:31.180]   I preach this, but I actually, my actions, just admit it.
[01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:36.320]   Just, just admit the, just admit them.
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:41.320]   And I think that's the first step to where we begin to either
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:47.300]   forgive ourself and give ourselves some amnesty and go,
[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:50.140]   yeah, I'm a human trying to make it through life
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:50.980]   as best I can.
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:52.440]   I'm gonna let myself slide on that one.
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:53.280]   Okay.
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:55.140]   And maybe I've been getting away with it for so long,
[01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:57.280]   whole family, my whole network works well on it.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:58.800]   Okay.
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:00.940]   Forget this, get to the base of the truth of the matter.
[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:03.080]   Let me do it, but just admit it.
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.560]   And then where we'll, and then it will also help,
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:08.260]   it'll be easier to then expose to ourselves.
[01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:09.240]   Which ones do we go?
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:13.440]   No, I'm not letting myself slide on that one anymore.
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.540]   That is actually a lie I've been believing
[01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:17.380]   that's been keeping me from getting more
[01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:19.340]   of what I want in life.
[01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:21.940]   That's actually a lie I've been living
[01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:23.560]   that I haven't admitted that,
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:28.560]   is not allowing me to enjoy life as much as I damn well
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:33.560]   should be, deserve to be, or I've earned to be,
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:35.700]   or just sort of let myself.
[01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:42.520]   Shoot man, I had on, it's not all the hard stuff.
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:45.280]   Sometimes it can be a fun thing.
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:47.560]   I'm talking about how many times we major in our minors.
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:50.000]   Let's admit where we sit there and we go,
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000]   all right, I give myself 12 hour work day,
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.220]   but I noticed I'm spending eight on my high school.
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:56.280]   I'm spending eight on my hobbies and four on my career.
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:57.780]   While I'm majoring in my minors.
[01:18:57.780 --> 01:19:00.880]   Well, let me admit that.
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.060]   There's the math.
[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:03.180]   Why don't we invert that?
[01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:06.160]   How about four hours on my hobbies and eight on my career?
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:09.940]   First off, just admitting it allows me to go,
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:12.780]   well, now I can do the math or rearrange the math
[01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:14.600]   about time of day.
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:17.180]   But I, look, I just found a hobby tennis.
[01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:19.000]   First hobby I've had in 25 years.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.780]   I had to admit that I went to play tennis for the,
[01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:22.980]   it started to love it.
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:26.140]   For the first month, I started feeling guilty.
[01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:30.780]   I was like, I'm having, is it okay to have this much fun?
[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:34.860]   I'm having so much fun and I'm getting a great workout.
[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:39.440]   And I just admit, I was like, yes, it's okay.
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:40.440]   Congratulations, buddy.
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:44.760]   You found something that you're finding quite pleasurable
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:45.900]   for straight pleasure.
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:48.540]   You don't have to forget all this other stuff about,
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:50.160]   yeah, but I'm also getting a workout.
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.540]   We are getting that too, but don't just,
[01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:52.740]   you don't have to get excuse.
[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:56.520]   The pleasure be based on, oh, but it's good for you.
[01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:59.140]   And you're, no, you're, damn it.
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:00.880]   The real reason you love it is 'cause you're having
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.240]   so much damn fun at it.
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:05.680]   I had to admit that to let myself go, damn right,
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:08.480]   I'm going to play tennis again today or tomorrow.
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.620]   It was a simple fun thing.
[01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:13.760]   So it's not always about the hardcore stuff
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:17.260]   that we have to go, this is a deep dark lie
[01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:20.080]   that I'm been living by and it's having me live falsely
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:22.200]   and it's having harmful consequences on my loved ones.
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:27.200]   Some of those will probably arise when we admit,
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:29.260]   but I think it's just having a look around
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:33.260]   and just saying, and when we admit it,
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:36.380]   then we go, when we admit a lie,
[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:41.380]   then we become something much more valuable, a bullshitter.
[01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:43.060]   Yeah.
[01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:44.360]   You had the little wink in your eye.
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:45.600]   I love the distinction.
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:47.120]   I'm bullshitting myself on that thing.
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:48.180]   Yep, I'm lying.
[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:49.700]   Therefore, if I call it a lie, I'm admitting a lie.
[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:51.320]   Yep, well now, yep, I'm bullshitting.
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:52.200]   Yep.
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:56.420]   I just out, didn't judge it, but now I'm bullshitting.
[01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:58.400]   That I think we can work with.
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.700]   Well, you're an interesting case study
[01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:01.820]   because you're one of the most famous,
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:06.820]   one of the most charismatic, successful humans in the world.
[01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:10.540]   There's a lot, millions of people love you,
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:13.920]   hang on every one of your words.
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:16.060]   That's a hard place to be.
[01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:17.180]   How do you call yourself?
[01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:22.080]   How do you admit that you've been living a lie?
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:25.480]   How do you admit yourself in big ways and small ways on lies
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:28.800]   at this point, given how many people love you,
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.000]   how famous you are?
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:36.200]   10 years ago, I don't know.
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:43.360]   I don't know, someone was talking about like,
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:47.320]   yeah, they really admire this so-and-so person
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:50.080]   'cause they're not someone who looks in the mirror.
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:51.200]   And I was like, yeah.
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:54.000]   And all of a sudden I was like,
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.500]   man, I gotta catch myself looking in the mirror a lot.
[01:21:56.500 --> 01:22:03.500]   And then I go in and I look at my wife's side
[01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:07.000]   of her bathroom, how many different creams
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:07.840]   and stuff she has out there.
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.940]   I look at my side, I got a lot more on my side.
[01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:14.940]   I'm like, oh, I notice how if I'm out and public working out,
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:19.640]   maybe doing pushups and maybe I do a few more.
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:19.640]   If there's a group of people that I'm working with, I'm like, oh, I'm out.
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:20.600]   I'm like, oh, I'm out.
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:21.980]   If there's a group of people walking by
[01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:23.320]   that maybe I'd like to impress,
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:25.420]   then I may do a few more than I'd do if I was on my own.
[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:28.560]   I'm like, you are vain, McConaughey.
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:32.500]   Yeah.
[01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:35.060]   And the knee jerk is, oh, vanity bad.
[01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:36.460]   And all of a sudden I was like,
[01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:40.320]   all of a sudden I became a bullshitter once I admit it.
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:43.360]   And then I was like, well, bravo, vanity.
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:45.040]   Let's go, vanity.
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:50.540]   Instead of putting it in the cupboard in the lie section,
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:52.220]   I'm like, oh, I don't want to put it in the vain,
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:53.860]   'cause that's a debit.
[01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:56.360]   No, admit it.
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:58.320]   And then go, what's the value in it?
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:00.520]   Well, I can look at, yeah, I actually got in better shape
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:01.680]   because of my vanity.
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:05.880]   Actually, I eat better and I have more energy.
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:12.580]   And that led to being a better husband, better dad,
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:15.560]   doing something with my kids when I'd rather be over there
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:18.440]   writing this work I'm working on.
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:19.660]   But I know that tomorrow, you're gonna get it.
[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:21.400]   Tomorrow.
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:24.660]   But when they leave town,
[01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:26.920]   they're gonna remember this time that we had together.
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:29.980]   That's a selfish act to go spend that time with my kids
[01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:32.180]   or my, even though I'd rather not be doing it at that time,
[01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:34.080]   I'd rather be doing something for myself.
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:35.720]   Because when they leave tomorrow,
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:37.460]   they've got, they'll have this great memory
[01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:39.700]   that they spent with their dad right where they went.
[01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:42.840]   That, I could call that vanity.
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:47.780]   I could group that and say, that's very vain of you.
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:48.840]   That was for self.
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:49.680]   Yeah.
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:50.500]   Yeah.
[01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:53.900]   'Cause it was also for something
[01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:55.640]   and someone that I cared about.
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:24:00.640]   Are there people in your life that call you on your bullshit
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:02.780]   in the bad sense of the word bullshit?
[01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:04.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:07.280]   Sometimes it's either, I got a pretty thick threshold
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.380]   for how far I can go with my bullshit.
[01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:15.580]   Like what bruise, what tickles me might bruise others
[01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:16.420]   to watch it.
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:17.320]   Mm-hmm.
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:18.160]   Mm-hmm.
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:19.920]   That's a good line.
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:23.520]   Yeah.
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:26.060]   Tickles me might bruise others.
[01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:31.000]   But I also, I go back and talk about the bullshit.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.480]   That's over there with those mystical successes.
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:39.100]   It's the, yeah, no, don't go with it.
[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:41.500]   Don't pull a parachute yet.
[01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:42.620]   Let's see how far we can go.
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:43.540]   Let's see how hard I can get.
[01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:44.920]   Let's try it one more time.
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:46.500]   Yes, two more, please.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:47.340]   Yeah.
[01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:52.340]   That's where a lot of great pleasure and stories
[01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:55.320]   and successes will come from.
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:56.160]   Those are mystical.
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:56.980]   They don't add up.
[01:24:56.980 --> 01:24:59.280]   It's like, we're not talking about reason right now.
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:00.560]   We're not talking logic.
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:01.400]   Just go with this.
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:05.320]   Let's talk about the virtual and making it real.
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:07.660]   The old line of fake it till you make it.
[01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:08.960]   I mean, what is that?
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:11.020]   There's something to that.
[01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:13.240]   There's definitely something to it.
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:16.160]   But I would, where people go fake it,
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:19.060]   I would go back to Dylan's and create it.
[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:21.020]   Recreate it, create and recreate it.
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:26.260]   Until it becomes, till you make it.
[01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:29.800]   So I'll have people call my bullshit.
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.360]   And a lot of times you're right.
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:37.180]   I think when I handle it the most healthy way is I admit yes.
[01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:41.840]   And I'm aware.
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:44.600]   So I'm, and I'm going to keep going.
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:48.080]   So you're not like resisting it, denying it, putting it away.
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:48.920]   Oh, I will.
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:49.760]   I will.
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:52.260]   And I have to watch that where I'm like, no, I'm not.
[01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:53.320]   That's not what I'm doing.
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:56.040]   And usually when it's coming from people that I care,
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:56.920]   they're going, no, you are.
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:58.960]   It's like, I want to bid it.
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:01.360]   And then that's where I'm telling a lie.
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:03.240]   And that'll come up, get me later.
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:06.500]   And I'll go, I didn't see it.
[01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:07.960]   I didn't see I was doing that.
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:10.920]   I was either unaware.
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:11.820]   I wouldn't let myself be aware.
[01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:14.120]   I was denying that I was doing that.
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:16.700]   Would you say that's ego?
[01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:18.500]   Has ego been bad or good for you?
[01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:23.420]   Gosh, I think it's been, I'm so thankful for ego.
[01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:33.440]   Does it get off the bridle for me sometimes
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:38.440]   and run loose and run places where it's not of service
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:46.680]   to others and has it hurt loved ones and even strangers?
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:47.500]   Yes.
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:57.180]   But I also, when my ego is really strong,
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:27:05.800]   it's in sync with serving.
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:11.420]   It's in sync with where I serve myself.
[01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:13.580]   It's in sync with how I serve myself.
[01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:15.540]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:17.540]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:18.660]   It's the most important thing.

[01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:10.760]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:11.600]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:12.440]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:13.280]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.100]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:14.940]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:15.780]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:16.600]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:17.440]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:18.260]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:19.100]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:19.940]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:20.760]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:21.600]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:22.440]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:23.260]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:24.100]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:24.940]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:25.760]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:26.600]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:27.440]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:28.260]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:29.100]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:29.940]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:30.760]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:31.600]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:34.300]   - I shanked that one out of bounds, man.
[01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:37.660]   - That's beautifully put.
[01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:40.480]   So ego can be constructive, not destructive.
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:46.920]   You won an Oscar for your performance in Dallas Buyers Club.
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:49.180]   Can you tell the story of becoming that character,
[01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:50.120]   Ron Woodruff?
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:52.340]   What was the toughest part?
[01:28:52.340 --> 01:29:01.220]   - Toughest part, which was the most enlightening part,
[01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:06.220]   was getting to know who he was in between the lines.
[01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:09.860]   We're basing a life story in an hour and a half of film.
[01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:13.060]   And the script is great.
[01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:18.840]   But who was he in between the lines?
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:21.840]   Who was he before he started a business,
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:23.400]   before he was on a crusade,
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:28.000]   before he went to alternative medicines?
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:33.840]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:34.680]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:35.500]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:36.340]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:37.180]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:38.000]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:38.840]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:39.680]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:40.520]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:41.360]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:42.180]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:43.000]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:43.840]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:44.680]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:45.500]   And I think that's the most important thing.
[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:46.740]   2.5 pounds in a week.
[01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:48.440]   So I'm gonna give myself five months to do that.
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:51.940]   2.5 times that is 10.
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:54.320]   There's go, there's 47 pounds.
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:55.780]   That was like clockwork.
[01:29:55.780 --> 01:29:56.620]   So that was easy.
[01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:57.780]   That decision was made.
[01:29:57.780 --> 01:30:01.200]   I didn't go to the Pizza Hut buffet
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:02.320]   and have temptation in front of me.
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:03.160]   I had certain meals.
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:06.200]   I ate that and the weight just went off like clockwork.
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:09.940]   It was the, who is Ron Woodruff in between the lines?
[01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:13.420]   And what the gift I got given that gave me the insight
[01:30:13.420 --> 01:30:15.420]   to who that man was.
[01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:17.420]   And what the gift I got given that gave me the insight
[01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:20.420]   was his, I went to see his family.
[01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:24.300]   And his, before I was, as I was leaving,
[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:28.400]   his family offered me his diary.
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:33.460]   And I remember it kind of has it going, wow, yes.
[01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:36.160]   But I kind of hesitated 'cause it felt
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:39.320]   maybe a little too intimate of a thing for me to have.
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:42.400]   It felt like it was kind of maybe infringing a bit,
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:44.940]   but I opened my hand and took it.
[01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:49.700]   And what I got in the diary was I got to know who Ron was
[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:51.240]   before he had HIV.
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:55.660]   And little thing, the diary he'd write in
[01:30:55.660 --> 01:31:00.660]   and the dreamer he was and getting all set on a Sunday night
[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:05.820]   and laying his shirt out and ironing it for the next morning,
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:09.000]   making sure that his little pager had fresh batteries in it.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.660]   'Cause tomorrow morning he was going across town
[01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:14.900]   to hook up some speakers for 38 bucks or whatever.
[01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:17.660]   And then getting up that morning
[01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:21.180]   and writing about what kind of coffee he drank
[01:31:21.180 --> 01:31:24.140]   and how much gas it was gonna take to get over across town
[01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:25.920]   to do that job and hook up those speakers.
[01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:28.180]   And then on the way over,
[01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:31.080]   Paige coming in to say, no, we don't need you.
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:33.180]   We've gone with somebody else to hook 'em up.
[01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:38.620]   And here he was all buttoned up, two cups of coffee in,
[01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:43.620]   hair slicked over, shirt ironed, little less than half tank.
[01:31:44.420 --> 01:31:46.840]   Gas, but enough to get back home.
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:50.800]   Now where's this Monday go?
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:55.380]   The hope and the disappointment.
[01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:57.100]   You have to take all that in.
[01:31:57.100 --> 01:31:58.420]   That's part of that, man.
[01:31:58.420 --> 01:32:00.020]   I'm just gonna go to Sonic
[01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:03.380]   and get a double cheese bacon burger.
[01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:06.460]   'Cause Sheila over there, man, she's kind of cute.
[01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:08.580]   She always gives me high price on it.
[01:32:08.580 --> 01:32:09.920]   Yeah.
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:11.120]   Which leads to
[01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:16.040]   rolling the joint,
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.380]   hanging off till Sheila gets off the work,
[01:32:18.380 --> 01:32:20.120]   sneaking over to the local motel
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:21.600]   and shagging up in room 16.
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:23.600]   That's my lucky number, 16 Sheila.
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:28.320]   Then wandering out that night,
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:33.900]   getting home one in the morning, no plans for Tuesday.
[01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:37.240]   And maybe later in the week,
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:41.060]   think about what am I gonna do about work or job?
[01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:43.320]   And these little dreams would get me peak and want to,
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:45.020]   and then something would happen
[01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:46.160]   where he wouldn't follow through
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:48.660]   or the deal would go down, the deal would go south.
[01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:54.700]   That, knowing that there's,
[01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:58.560]   in there was where I saw who, he was a dreamer.
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:02.460]   And he just couldn't catch the break
[01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:03.440]   and didn't follow through.
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:05.040]   And then I remembered his family said like,
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:06.460]   "Oh yeah, he invented it.
[01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:08.100]   He got patents on a whole bunch of things,
[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:09.160]   but he never would."
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:10.800]   He had things to get patent,
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:12.840]   but never would follow through to get the government patent.
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:17.340]   And then later on, you'd see the product be made
[01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:18.880]   or sold on QVC or something.
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:21.120]   They'd be like, "Ron, that was yours.
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:23.800]   Are they still your idea?
[01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:24.640]   Did you patent that?"
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:25.920]   He'd be like, "No."
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:27.960]   Like never would that,
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:30.260]   there's something beautiful and sad about that.
[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:31.100]   Yeah.
[01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:33.780]   That let me inside who he was in his heart
[01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:35.860]   and who he wanted to be.
[01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:37.860]   And what he was hoping to be and trying to be,
[01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:40.160]   but couldn't quite pull off.
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:42.180]   When you go that deep, this, I mean, I mean, I, I, I, I,
[01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:44.860]   I mean, I don't know if I've ever been that deep, but.
[01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:45.860]   I mean, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:46.700]   I mean, I hope so.
[01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:47.700]   I get, I look, there's a tenacity to survive that I got from him.
[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:48.700]   I, look, hopefully I can try and find some of that in different ways in any character
[01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:49.700]   that I go play.
[01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:54.700]   'Cause that's, if you, if you, if you really wanna give a character an obstacle to overcome,
[01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:58.560]   a need, I mean, the base one is life and death.
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:15.700]   Whether that's the need to survive or the need to stave off extinction.
[01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:21.940]   I'm not talking about what the rules, the laws are, the social mores, the manners and graces.
[01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:23.940]   I'm fighting, you, you gonna fight.
[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:27.900]   I'm not talking about the rules, the laws are, the social mores, the manners and graces.
[01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:34.460]   You, you gonna fight for your own life in a world that's not supporting you to do so?
[01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:41.140]   You, there's a wonderful courage of, okay, watch this.
[01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:47.560]   What do I got to lose?
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:54.560]   My life or I'm in charge of extending it?
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:56.540]   Get out of the way.
[01:34:56.540 --> 01:34:57.540]   And I'll pick your pocket along the way.
[01:34:57.540 --> 01:34:57.540]   I'm gonna get you out of the way.
[01:34:57.540 --> 01:34:57.540]   I'm gonna get you out of the way.
[01:34:57.540 --> 01:34:57.540]   I'm gonna get you out of the way.
[01:34:57.540 --> 01:34:57.540]   I'm gonna get you out of the way.
[01:34:57.540 --> 01:34:57.580]   I'm gonna get you out of the way.
[01:34:57.580 --> 01:34:57.620]   I'm gonna get you out of the way.
[01:34:57.620 --> 01:34:57.660]   I'm gonna get you out of the way.
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:34:57.700]   I'm gonna get you out of the way.
[01:34:57.700 --> 01:34:57.740]   I'm gonna get you out of the way.
[01:34:57.740 --> 01:34:57.780]   I'm gonna get you out of the way.
[01:34:57.780 --> 01:34:57.860]   I'm gonna get you out of the way.
[01:34:57.860 --> 01:34:57.900]   I'm gonna get you out of the way.
[01:34:57.900 --> 01:34:57.940]   I'm gonna get you out of the way.
[01:34:57.940 --> 01:34:58.220]   I'm gonna get you out of the way.
[01:34:58.220 --> 01:34:58.320]   I'm gonna get you out of the way.
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:34:58.360]   I'm gonna get you out of the way.
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:34:58.360]   I'm gonna get you out of the way.
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:34:58.440]   I'm gonna get you out of the way.
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:34:58.500]   I'm gonna get you out of the way.
[01:34:58.500 --> 01:34:58.540]   I'm gonna get you out of the way.
[01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:00.140]   I'm gonna get you out of the way.
[01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:10.200]   So there's a tenacity to live by whatever means necessary to survive that I, that I, that I'm reminded of, that I learned from Ron.
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:23.360]   So on that line of survival between life and death, you starred in True Detective, which I think explores some darker aspects of human nature.
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:26.380]   What did you take from that?
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:27.620]   From that one?
[01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:27.700]   Yeah.
[01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:27.820]   Yeah.
[01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:27.840]   Yeah.
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:27.840]   Yeah.
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:36.320]   role in that experience philosophically psychologically the freedom of of being on an island
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:47.440]   he was such a singular character and of a singular mind and as you know it wasn't a
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:53.920]   dance party up there in his mind it was it was some some heavy stuff but also
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.560]   existentially for him always like
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:06.720]   death would be a deliverance for him
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:11.840]   it'd also be a cop-out in a way it'd also be
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:18.080]   he was not not a man who was going to give himself amnesty
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:23.840]   and didn't allow it from the rest of the world wouldn't give himself an out
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:29.840]   of the world and while living in his head and heart and spirit was
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:39.280]   more of a hell than arguably dying there was not no alternative that's not negotiable for that man
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:43.920]   and that's why he was such a that's why he's the best detective that ever
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:51.040]   walked the earth that's why he was such a superhero in a way to have that singular you don't
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:53.680]   go oh i wish i was him no but you're like wow
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:57.600]   that constitution that clarity of identity
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:07.680]   talk about a measure in a man's constitution he didn't allow anybody off the hook especially
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:15.200]   himself you wanted him to forgive a little bit or give himself a little amity you wanted him to like
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:22.640]   man it's saturday bro can you go on a date you wanted him to like enjoy something but he was
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:32.560]   connected to something in his dna who's who he was doing something much more baseline truth and
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:36.800]   that's why he was such a good detective so that but there's an island as much as that company can
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:43.600]   be i said earlier on that amazon trip i wouldn't join the company there's parts i think that i maybe
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:49.600]   gave to myself to rustin cole and also that rustin curl has given back to me that are like yeah when
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:54.080]   you're when you want to pull the parachute because you can't stand the company that you're in mcconaughey
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:38:00.160]   in your own mind the socratic dialogue is driving you freaking crazy don't pull the parachute stick
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:06.560]   with it go through it so you were able to walk around with that tormented mind of his tormented
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:14.560]   i did i i didn't have very much patience for mendacious talk i didn't have as much patience for
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:18.240]   small talk i wasn't tormented
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:24.160]   but the character was and you have to embody him so is that i mean does some of that bleed over are
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:34.240]   you able to uh separate the man you are from the character it's not look am i able to separate yeah
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:39.360]   i came home to my kids and when they walk in the door and greet me and go what'd you do today
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:48.240]   and you got three kids under 10 years old you don't tell them about the scene where you're like
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:50.240]   oh i'm a little bit scared and i'm a little bit scared of the man you're talking about
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:53.040]   and i'm like oh i'm a little bit scared of the man you're talking about and i'm like oh i'm a little
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:55.360]   bit scared of the man you're talking about and i'm like oh i'm a little bit scared of the man
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:57.360]   you're talking about and i'm like oh i'm a little bit scared of the man you're talking about and
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:59.120]   i'm like oh i'm a little bit scared of the man you're talking about and i'm like oh i'm a little
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:01.200]   bit scared of the man you're talking about and i'm like oh i'm a little bit scared of the man
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:03.360]   you're talking about and i'm like oh i'm a little bit scared of the man you're talking about and
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:05.200]   i'm like oh i'm a little bit scared of the man you're talking about and i'm like oh i'm a little bit
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:07.980]   so
[01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:12.580]   I
[01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:15.180]   did I go, did I bring it home
[01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:17.160]   I didn't bring torment, did I bring
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:18.440]   introspection into my own
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:21.200]   characters for me and I think this is
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:22.380]   true for a lot of
[01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:24.400]   actors and actresses
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:27.140]   we don't, it's not a separation
[01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:29.300]   if I've got
[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:31.220]   we each have
[01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:32.060]   everyone
[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:35.120]   else in us
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:37.060]   it's just seeing
[01:39:37.060 --> 01:39:39.240]   diving into
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:40.640]   Rust and Cold, knowing where
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:43.440]   his mind and heart is from the hand
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:45.340]   of Nick Pizzolatto who wrote
[01:39:45.340 --> 01:39:47.600]   the character and wrote the whole series
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:49.120]   understanding
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:51.400]   number one, what the hell am I saying
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:53.080]   what's he talking about
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:54.800]   then going deeper into that, well
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:56.820]   this person really believes that
[01:39:56.820 --> 01:39:58.840]   what does that say about how they
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:01.420]   move, then I'm going all of a sudden
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:03.400]   well who is that in me, what part of my
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:04.800]   left brain
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:06.800]   is locked into that, what part of my
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:08.800]   reptilian brain is
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:10.800]   latched onto that
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:12.800]   this other stuff is non-negotiable
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:14.800]   then I just live in that
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:16.800]   and it's I always talk like a
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:18.800]   70s equalizer, remember the old
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:20.800]   Atmarantz equalizers you can
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:22.800]   you move up your 500 HKZ
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:24.800]   you move up your 60
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:26.800]   you just re-
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:28.800]   re-
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:30.800]   rebalance the equalizer
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:34.800]   and we all have, so it's just going to those parts of me where I'll turn up the volume
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:38.800]   some parts of the bass, the treble and the equalizer and turn down other parts of myself
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:42.800]   and I'll, I'm not coming home tormented
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:44.800]   as Rust and Cold
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:46.800]   am I coming home
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:48.800]   seeing
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:50.800]   torment
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:52.800]   where it should be seen
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:54.800]   am I reading the news differently
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:56.800]   are things coming out of the news and catching my eye
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:58.800]   as being tormented
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:00.800]   as being
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:02.800]   bullshit or lies
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:04.800]   or truth that is just hard
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:06.800]   and going, yep, yeah
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:08.800]   I'm seeing it through a different lens
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:10.800]   but I'm seeing my own life through a different lens
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:12.800]   a lens that was opened up
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:14.800]   and an aperture that was opened up through Rust and Cold
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:16.800]   I mean the
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:18.800]   process of being an actor and actress
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:20.800]   I guess is a really interesting
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:22.800]   way to be a philosopher
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:24.800]   of human nature
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:26.800]   yeah, I mean it's an incredible
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:28.800]   really in it, dive into the humanity
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:30.800]   and all the
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:32.800]   ologies
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:34.800]   and philosophy
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:36.800]   and as I said I
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:38.800]   going to
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:40.800]   as I opened up
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:42.800]   the question like that
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:44.800]   being on an island is a vacation
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:48.800]   I am also conscious
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:50.800]   for five months when I'm playing Rust and Cold
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:52.800]   that, this is an interesting
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:54.800]   fact, I've
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:58.800]   I've never
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:00.800]   I was as strong spiritually
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:02.800]   with my relationship
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:04.800]   with God
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:08.800]   when I did True Detective as I've ever been
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.800]   why is that?
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:12.800]   okay
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:14.800]   which you would say, wait a minute
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:16.800]   in some ways that's a
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:18.800]   those are antonyms
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:20.800]   no, but my
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:22.800]   I
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:24.800]   pretty sure, pretty safely can say
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:26.800]   that my own
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:28.800]   strength of spirit in my own personal life
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:30.800]   Matthew's life
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:32.800]   gave me the confidence to go further away
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:36.800]   deeper into the
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:38.800]   torture and deeper into the
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:40.800]   but it was still
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:42.800]   he was still always going after truth
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:44.800]   that was the thing, he was not
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:46.800]   not an evil man, I don't even know if you can call him
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:48.800]   a non-believer, but he was always going after the truth
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:50.800]   and the truth burned
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:52.800]   and he would take the scar and get burned
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:54.800]   for it
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:56.800]   he'd die for it
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:58.800]   that, something was actually from
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:00.800]   biblical about that
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:02.800]   you know
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:04.800]   and so, but I
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:06.800]   I don't think it's
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:08.800]   coincidence that I was
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:10.800]   had so much
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:12.800]   of
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:14.800]   of diving into
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:16.800]   the depths of that tortured
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:18.800]   character
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:20.800]   because
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:22.800]   I trusted that
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:24.800]   when I go out, I'll come up the other side
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:26.800]   it's always like jumping in a pool of water
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:28.800]   and
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:30.800]   you trust you'll come up the other side and not
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:32.800]   you know, you go play a criminal
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:34.800]   you trust you're not gonna come out the other side
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:36.800]   a tyrant in real life
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:38.800]   you just go
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:40.800]   "Ah, glad I got to go
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:42.800]   do that, came out and I'm still alive
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:44.800]   got all my faculties, I'm not in jail
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:46.800]   I'm whatever it is"
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:48.800]   and so my own spirituality
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:50.800]   at that time definitely I think gave me
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:52.800]   a certain trust and confidence to go further
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:54.800]   into the dark
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:58.800]   It was announced that you'll be
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:00.800]   starring in a Yellowstone spin-off show
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:04.800]   What do you think about the
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:06.800]   cowboy ethos that permeates
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:08.800]   Yellowstone and other shows created by
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:10.800]   Taylor Sheridan?
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:12.800]   You're a Texan. I am a Texan
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:14.800]   Yeah. What do you think about that
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:16.800]   philosophy and way of life?
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:20.800]   I admire
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:22.800]   the simplicity of it
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:24.800]   I mean
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:26.800]   one way you could explain
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:28.800]   what a
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:30.800]   Yellowstone and
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:32.800]   Costner's role is
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:34.800]   what will
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:36.800]   mmmm
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:38.800]   what will man do to protect
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:40.800]   land and family
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:42.800]   in a world that's trying to
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:44.800]   encroach
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:46.800]   in a world where
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:50.800]   there's a cowboy ethos that deems
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:52.800]   trespassing more clear
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:54.800]   earlier
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:56.800]   Yeah. than
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:58.800]   than other
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:00.800]   other hats
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:02.800]   um
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:04.800]   I admire
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:06.800]   that simplicity
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.800]   of right and wrong
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:10.800]   and that
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:12.800]   the simplicity of that right and wrong
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:14.800]   doesn't always
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:16.800]   correlate coincide with the law
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:18.800]   No. It's above the law
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:20.800]   It's you mentioned something earlier
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:22.800]   I remember where it was in the conversation
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:24.800]   a little bit of like okay if the law ain't handling this
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:26.800]   I am. Yeah.
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:28.800]   and then it is
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:30.800]   the law's not gonna handle this
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:32.800]   therefore I am
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:34.800]   and then it is
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:36.800]   I'm handling this
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:38.800]   the law
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:40.800]   talk to them when you get to them
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:42.800]   I'm handling this
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:44.800]   There's a
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:46.800]   honesty to that
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:48.800]   it just seems
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:50.800]   of course it's dangerous
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:52.800]   because it's a slippery slope
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:54.800]   because of the power
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:56.800]   and that power culture
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:58.800]   that corrupts it can be a slippery slope
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:00.800]   where you completely disregard the law
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:02.800]   and you can hurt a lot of people
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:04.800]   but when done right
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:06.800]   you know there feels to
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:08.800]   be a
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:10.800]   something really authentic
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:12.800]   and human about that protect family
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:14.800]   protect land above all else
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:16.800]   Yeah
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:18.800]   Look
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:20.800]   I you know
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:24.800]   this is a broader question
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:26.800]   but I'm gonna piggyback it off this
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:28.800]   and then I'm gonna go back to the
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:30.800]   I think I'm gonna go back to the
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:32.800]   I think I'm gonna go back to the
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:34.800]   back to the dreams and reality
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:36.800]   and evolved species
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:38.800]   and how and what we do
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:40.800]   in creating a digital god
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:42.800]   and AI
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:44.800]   and these communities and friends
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:46.800]   that challenge us and think like us
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:48.800]   we like to hang out with
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:50.800]   are
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:52.800]   do you think we're a less evolved
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:54.800]   species than we give ourself credit for
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:56.800]   do you think we give ourself credit
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:58.800]   for being more evolved
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:00.800]   than we actually are
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:02.800]   I think we do
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:04.800]   I do
[01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:06.800]   I think we need to admit that
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:08.800]   I think probably the cowboy ethos is a
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:10.800]   is a step towards
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:12.800]   admitting that
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:16.800]   and that's why it's so appealing to people
[01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:18.800]   and kind of wakes them up
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:20.800]   to realize that we are
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:22.800]   we're not so far
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:24.800]   from our ancestors
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:26.800]   and that we're not so far from our ancestors
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:28.800]   and that we're not so far from our ancestors
