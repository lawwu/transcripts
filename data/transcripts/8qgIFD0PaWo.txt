[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   If you really want to give a character an obstacle to overcome, a need,
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.040]   I mean the base one is life and death.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:15.520]   The following is a conversation with Matthew McConaughey, a legendary Oscar-winning actor
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.520]   and one of the most unique, charismatic, and inspiring humans and Texans who walked this earth.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.000]   He starred in films and shows loved by me and millions of others, including Interstellar,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.640]   Dazed and Confused, Dallas Bias Club, Killer Joe, Mudd, True Detective, and soon a spin-off
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.680]   of Yellowstone. Off-screen, his words carry wisdom and power in his book called Green Lights
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.440]   and his new video course called Road Trip, where Matthew expands on the philosophy in his book
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.680]   and shows how to apply it to your life in order to find more happiness, success, and love.

[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   And now, dear friends, here's Matthew McConaughey.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.560]   Let's start with love. Your parents had a complicated love story. Divorced twice,
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.000]   married three times. What did you learn about love from your mom and dad and their love story?
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:31.680]   That it's messy. That it takes work. That it's ugly. That
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.480]   no matter how ugly or messy it is, don't go to bed
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:48.240]   until you've come back together to either embrace or admit that you truly love each
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.120]   other, even if you hadn't solved what the hell you're bitching about. That
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:03.920]   love will win in the end, literally, three to two with my mom and dad.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.580]   Yeah.
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:13.840]   And that even in the two divorces and in the two times where they couldn't live with each other,
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.920]   they still loved each other. They just couldn't live with each other at that time for whatever
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.120]   reason they needed. And I don't know the details, but they needed their
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:39.520]   space, freedom or what, but they were never out of love with each other. And that as a parent,
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:51.600]   if you just, when we're not sure what to do, and people give you a thousand books and advice,
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:02.000]   as a parent, if your kid knows you love them, you're in the black. That's the main thing.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.680]   It won't work without that. And it can work and will usually can work with that.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.560]   They just know that fact. So it's not just love for each other. It's the love for the bigger family
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.040]   that ultimately helps you persist through the ups and downs.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:26.800]   Well, I mean, I don't know how much, particularly my mom and dad were
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:34.480]   staying together at times, maybe when they didn't want to, because they had children. I don't
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.360]   actually think they considered that. I think they were much less conscientious than say,
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:50.400]   I am today. I think my mom and dad were more like, they'll be fine. We love them. They'll be fine.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.800]   But we'll cross that bridge when we get there. Right now, let's work it out between
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.040]   you and I is what I think my mom and dad were saying to each other or not.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:13.120]   They wanted and needed a relationship that was a tidal wave, rocky, right angles, tsunamis.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:20.800]   And to this day in my life with Camille and I, which I don't, I like a river,
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.160]   has some swerves and some streams and some rapids, but I'm not looking for a tidal wave.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:33.760]   My mom's like, what's all this, everything's so smooth stuff. Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:41.040]   So she challenges vitality, because that's what my mom needed to communicate. I don't think my dad
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:51.360]   needed it as much, the hard angles that their relationship drew. I don't think my dad needed
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.600]   it as much as my mom. But the clashes demonstrated the passion that underlies the love.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.360]   Yes. And I've always been asked, when I talk about my parents' love relationship,
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.840]   I tell the stories that are actually sometimes quite violent.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.960]   There's some good stories there. They're beautiful. I think they're beautiful.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.960]   Yeah, I think they're beautiful too. But I've had people go, wait a minute,
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.720]   that was unhealthy. You can't... And I was like, no, that's, again, back to the beginning,
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.560]   love's messy. And what I love about those stories is that's where the love was actually. It was
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.200]   tested. And it could have broke and been over. Yeah.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.960]   And it never was. Again, the love won. In the kitchen floor, the blood's drawn,
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.160]   knives are pulled. Ketchup.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:47.840]   Ketchup's all over. But we make love on the kitchen floor. I mean, come on, beautiful.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.760]   So as romantic as it gets right there.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:56.960]   What's a memory from childhood that helped set you on the trajectory
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.480]   of becoming the man you are today?
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:10.000]   Standing on the corner with Mr. Mayor, the principal of St. Phillip School. I was in
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.920]   kindergarten. And I looked up and there was a cloud in the sky. And I said, "Mr. Mayor,
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:26.800]   is that cloud as big as the world?" And he paused for a minute and he goes, "Well, yes, it is,
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:35.040]   Matthew." Now in my seven-year-old mind, I went, "Okay, I can see the outlines of it.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:44.960]   And that must mean it is so far away, because if that's as big as the world..." I remember it took
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:52.240]   15 hours just to drive from Longview to Florida last year. And I can't even see that far. So
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:07:01.440]   that cloud must be so far off that it's not worth me even considering space, dreams,
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.760]   any of that. I was like, "Army, I'm looking down. I'm gonna put my head to the ground. I'm gonna
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.880]   look right in front of me and deal with what's in front of me." Because dealing with dreams and
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.760]   what's out there and not on this earth that gravity holds down, not worth considering. You
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:27.680]   never make it. It's not even worth imagining. It's fairy dust. So I think I learned a lot of
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:35.360]   self-reliance from that. I think I got a work ethic from that. I think I got a, "Hey, focus
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:41.200]   on what's right in front of you. Do the deed. Take care of what's in front of you one at a time and
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:49.440]   slowly notch up your way, and hopefully there's some ascension to that." And it wasn't until
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:57.840]   quite years later, in some ways decades later, that I started to go, "Oh,
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:05.280]   I can project. I can dream. Why?" Because literally the first time I got in a plane
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.720]   and in 30 seconds I was in a cloud, I'm like, "Whoa, we must be going a trillion miles an hour
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.920]   because we're already in that cloud that was as big as the world that I saw the edge of."
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.760]   And then I grew and learned enough to go, "Well, that's not true. Planes don't go that fast."
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:27.120]   Oh, what Mr. Mayor said wasn't really true. That cloud is not as big as the world and it's
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:33.040]   not near as far away as I thought. But I'm glad he lied to me.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.240]   What do you think about that, that tension of a way of living life
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.840]   between being a dreamer and a pragmatist? Yeah.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.600]   Which is a better way?
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:54.720]   Donnie holds the reciprocity of the two of them. I mean, I can't be present unless I got plans.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:01.120]   I want to have the big picture in mind, but I got to go a day at a time. I like to
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:07.360]   write the headline or I think we need to have a North Star, something to look forward to.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:14.800]   But we all know that if we're staring at it, we're tripping on the way. If we're just,
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:20.960]   you know, the old, you read the Hallmark cards, which like irked me, you know, dream it, you can
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:31.600]   do it. I think that's a half-assed, horrible thing to tell somebody. And then on the other side,
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.480]   you have things like, you know, people say, "Hope means nothing." Well, yes, it does.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:43.200]   That's the dream. You just don't stop there. It's not a period after that word. Now, what do we do
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:50.240]   practically? And I think that constant tension, when that tension's a dance is when it's beautiful.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.320]   There's an Osmond, but to see those as contradictions, I think is where we've
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:00.160]   just fallen short. So, I don't, I, one on their own, if we silo the two,
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:08.880]   or if you silo the two, I guess the pragmatics the one to go with, because at least you'll get
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.160]   something done. But if you only silo the dream and don't do anything about it, that's, you're
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.120]   kind of living an illusion and kind of living in a virtual reality.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.800]   Yeah, it's tricky. Even the people you love can sometimes suffocate the dream,
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:28.160]   can make you believe that it's not possible. It feels like a lot of parents kind of
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:35.920]   want you to be safe, want you to be stable, want you to have a plan so that everything's
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:44.960]   gonna be okay. And the dream feels like a threat to that. Yeah. How much of that though, I wonder,
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:52.960]   is proper initiation? Because if you throw in dreams out, I call it conservative, very liberal
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:58.880]   late. Let's learn to block and tackle. Let's learn that work ethic, those things, those pragmatics
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:04.960]   first. Learn the rules of the road, the rules of the game, the things that we can all kind of
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.920]   rely on. This is how the world's supposed to work. Now, it doesn't always work that way.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.720]   You teach a child to drive. It's like, yeah, you stay in the lane, you go to speed limit,
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.760]   this is all helpful, but that doesn't guarantee that no one else is running the red light,
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:26.080]   but we learn that later. There's an initiation, I think, that's proper.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:39.200]   With the dream. I mean, I think parents, my parents were very much that way. The idea of
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:47.360]   going to chase an acting career or something was, what? That was a different vernacular. That was
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:54.640]   like not in our, I was taught to work your way up a company ladder and nine to five, do your job.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.960]   But the day I brought it up and said, I want to go to film school.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:04.240]   And I thought my dad was going to go, you want to do what boy? He was like,
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:10.000]   gave me some of the best advice ever and told me not to half-ass it. And he said, go.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:19.760]   In between the lines, what he heard from me was that made him so happy as a father, I believe,
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:25.680]   and makes any parent happy is when our child doesn't ask us permission to go chase a dream.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:32.480]   When they're going, I'm bringing it up to you with full respect, but I'm doing this with or
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:41.120]   without you. That's when a parent goes, oh, yes. I've done something right enough. I helped my
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:47.600]   child be secure enough in the pragmatics to have a foundation enough where they have the courage to go,
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.680]   I'm flying the nest.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:57.600]   To take the leap. You wrote after my dad died, I had a dream that left me with a statement,
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.600]   less impressed, more involved.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.280]   What do those words mean to you?
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:06.720]   We got to be more than just happy to be here.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:14.480]   I'm big on gratitude, but we got to be more than just thankful to be here. Dream it, you can do
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:20.560]   it. It's got to be more than just dream it, you can do it. That's impressed. The dream is still
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:37.440]   other than. If I'm here and so impressed with talking to you today, if I have a reverence
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:45.280]   to an extent, I will not be able to be involved in this conversation.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:52.240]   I'll be too impressed. I'll be anticipating, oh, what's that question he's going to ask? Oh,
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.960]   I think I know where he's going with this. Oh, I think I know what answer he might love to hear.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:02.400]   Oh, I'm not involved in conversation. I'm too impressed. So I'm removed from the present.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.440]   For me, what that literally meant to me when that came to me in a dream, and I carved it in,
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.320]   I remember carved it in a tree. It took a couple hours. I still know where that tree is,
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:27.440]   Santa Monica. It was, my father had moved on. He'd left this life. All of a sudden, it hit me.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:33.920]   Oh, I don't have the safety net. My dad was above law and above religion to me. He had me.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.520]   If I really was in the shit, if I really needed him, I trusted that he had my back,
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:48.720]   above law, above anything. All of a sudden, he's gone. I go, okay. It hit me how much I'd been
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:57.040]   pretending to be the young man I was trying to be and not actually put my ass on the line and
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:03.040]   have enough courage to take risk and actually own up to the man that he was teaching me to be.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.280]   And I remember the world got flat.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:18.080]   That cloud that Mr. Mayor, that I saw there was not way up there. It was fog in front of me now.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:27.840]   And let's go into it. I'd say I probably gained even more respect for people and things,
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:35.520]   but I lost a certain amount of reverence that was keeping me from feeling like I deserved or
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:44.640]   I'd earned things or looking out for myself or holding myself to task. And I remember
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.960]   all the things that I, and I was just getting, going into Hollywood at the time. So I was
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:56.560]   getting famous out there as one of those clouds, with being an actor and all of a sudden celebrity
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:05.760]   and becoming famous. The reverence I had, I remember it just, it lowered down to eye level
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:12.080]   and I was able to realize and go, that's not fairy dust. And don't give it so much credit
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:19.280]   to make it fairy dust. Like, oh, not me. No, I could never. No, look that in the eye with
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:26.160]   full respect, but less reverence. And at the same time, equidistant, almost equal sublimation,
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:34.880]   I noticed where I had been condescending people and things and patronizing and sloughing things
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:42.080]   off as like less than me and not worthy of my time. It raised up to eye level. And so they were
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:49.120]   all flat in front of me and the world was flat and I was able to, shoulders went back, my heart rose
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:55.200]   up, my chin lifted up. I looked things in the eye. I became probably less sentimental.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.920]   Hopefully not to level that I got callous, but I know I became less sentimental.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:08.800]   I became more courageous because when you have someone pass in your life,
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:16.880]   or maybe it's similar to a situation you're going on in your own life, with your homeland,
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:27.920]   you sober up on these mendacities that we deal with every day. And this bullshit that we give
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.360]   too much credit or too much significance to. And you're like, what am I doing?
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:39.120]   I'm not even gonna let myself emotionally get brought down or over-related by this situation.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:49.360]   'Cause it doesn't really matter in the big scheme. And so certain things that I found reverence for
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:57.280]   and hesitated from in my life, I was now engaging with because I was like, oh, it's live. This life
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:03.040]   is live. Let's look it in the eye and go forward through it and deal with the consequences.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.720]   What do you make of death? Does it scare you?
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:12.080]   I'm not looking forward to it, but it does not scare me.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.840]   Do you think about it? Do you visualize it?
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:25.200]   I do. I do. And it's a beautiful visualization and a beautiful dream when I go as part of the
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:32.880]   food chain. It's not a good visualization when I go as part of a random act of violence in a
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:40.000]   fricking drive-by or something. Because the second, the accident,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:51.920]   it breaks a story that I believe has already been written. At least I don't have the capacity yet to
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:19:02.000]   put it into a story, a divine story of the lives that we live. And so there's something ugly and
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:11.040]   gross about it. And it happens all the time to people all the time. I just feel like when it's
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:16.240]   part of the food chain, when I go as part of the food chain, I'm like, ah, that's poetry.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.200]   Part of the flow of nature, you return to nature.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.720]   Yeah, there's grace and poetry in that.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:30.880]   Do you miss your father? Think about him.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:37.280]   Mm-hmm.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:44.080]   When I think about him, I do. Now, when do I think about him? I thought about him yesterday,
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:50.640]   working through a script I'm working on right now, working on scene work. And I just had that
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:59.120]   quick little reaction of wanting to show him, "Hey, check this out." I tried not to. And then
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:06.080]   I don't get sad. I go, "He would have loved this."
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:13.280]   Whereas my mom wants to be on the stage, my dad would have been on the front row.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:17.840]   He's more fun to show stuff to.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:25.120]   Yeah, and he would have... He was a character. He knew characters. I've based
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:32.160]   parts of all kinds of characters I've played and the man that I am on people that he introduced
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:39.680]   me to and who he was. He would have loved the creative process of working on a script or
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:45.120]   talking about, "Hey, movie." That's why I always say I love the movie Mud, because it's the one
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:51.280]   that I visualized and seen my dad come to me so many times as a 12-year-old and put his arm around
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.680]   me and go, "Hey, little buddy, you've seen this movie called Mud? God damn it, it's a good one.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:03.520]   Let's go watch it." That. Now, my dad never got to see me start a career in film, but he was alive
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:09.840]   five days into the... He overlapped the first five days of me working on my first film,
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:14.800]   Days Confused. Now, that I think there's something beautiful about that. He didn't
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:21.760]   ever, ever come to the set. We didn't talk about it, but he was alive for me to start something
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:29.600]   that was more than a fad, that was something that would become something that I love to do.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:38.640]   And I do miss... Not him... And then I go out of that, do I... We talked about him two nights ago
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:48.640]   with our daughter. I was rubbing my daughter's feet, and my mom, who's living with us, 91,
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:53.200]   comes in and goes, "Oh, look at you, just like your pop." And he's like, "What?" And he goes,
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:22:01.120]   "Oh," 'cause my dad loved to rub somebody's feet, rub my mom's feet, rubbed all of me and my
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:10.480]   brother's girlfriend's feet. When we would have a date, they would come over early because they
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:15.360]   knew they were gonna get a foot rub from Jim McConaughey. And then we'd come out, me and my
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.040]   two older brothers on... This has been on for decades. We'd come out of the shower ready to
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:24.400]   go, buttoned up, and they looked at me like, "We ain't going anywhere right now." And so we told
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.600]   the story to my daughter, and I was like, "Oh, yeah, my dad's... His hands, I miss his hands.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.200]   His hands could heal." So you carry him in you?
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:55.040]   I hope so. I hope so. And it's a challenge for me, and I suppose it's like this for any son.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:06.720]   How much do we hang on to, and how much do we let go and evolve and update the OS and
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:17.680]   try maybe better or different? It's that there's certain things that I know that I fully believe in.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:23.520]   It's like when do we... Religious, when do we cast away our father? When do we say, "No,
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:36.800]   I'm going after the dream. I'm not asking your permission." I question that from time to time
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:41.840]   for myself, and it almost feels blasphemic if that's a word sometimes. I feel like,
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.800]   "You can't... What are you doing? You can't check that," and go like, "Well, no, I'm not sure if I
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:52.960]   want to." And then I immediately kind of let myself off because I believe where he is, he's going,
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:24:02.160]   "Go, buddy. You're free, man. I'm not gonna hold you back if you misread that or I didn't
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:08.080]   teach you that as well as maybe I wish I could have. Go, you're free. You're not gonna lose.
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:12.960]   Trust that you're not gonna lose. It's in your DNA. It's in your lineage, young man."
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:19.760]   Still, it's scary to not have a safety net. Losing your father is scary in that way.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.160]   You realize this world is just you. In some deep fundamental way, it's just you.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.480]   You're alone.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:35.280]   Yes. But also not having that.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:49.600]   It's such a gift of deliverance, though, as well. Because it's an awesome
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:58.720]   feeling to know we're alone, to know we don't have that, to know you don't have take two
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:06.960]   or take three, that it's one take. I mean, the peripheral vision improves.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:17.200]   The link and understanding with our past improves. Because I know for me, I was not ever
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:23.360]   considerate of my past at all because my dad had that. If I needed it, he was my well for that.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:28.640]   He's gone. I said, "He had the," literally, "had," they have our back.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:33.120]   Well, then when they no longer have our back, all of a sudden, I'm going, "Oh, well, maybe I need
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:41.440]   to look back and start giving some credit to how I got here, what I'm doing, and where I'm heading."
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:46.720]   It gave me the first time courage to even look over my shoulder. Because again, I didn't have to
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:54.880]   because I don't have to look. Dad's got my back. No, dad's gone from this life. He doesn't have
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:12.240]   your back. Okay. I don't know. Me, because it's inevitable, I very quickly go to,
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:23.600]   "All right, in the pain, the loss, and yes, even loneliness, which is different from being alone,
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:30.480]   and loss." Pretty immediately, part and parcel with the pain, I felt it.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:36.640]   In the pain, you saw the gift, the red light of losing your father.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.520]   Pretty immediately, less impressed, more involved. That came like
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:49.280]   a couple weeks after moving on. Is there a trick to that, to see the gift in the pain?
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:58.560]   That's a good question. Is there a trick to it? Not that I know of. I mean, I don't, I have to
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:06.800]   catch myself from trying to intellectualize my way into the reasoning
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:17.600]   and not skip over real feelings and discomfort. I mean, I did get that from my mom, and I have
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:22.320]   to watch it, that so resilient that we just dust ourself off and get up and go.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:26.800]   You want to sit in the feeling. You want to feel it. You really deeply feel the pain.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.000]   I want to deeply feel it. I want to look in the eye and deeply feel it,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.640]   but I don't want to wallow in it. Yeah.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.360]   Now, I was raised where you skip the deeply feel and let's go.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:43.840]   I've said it before, but that will lead to having
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:51.440]   turned into a person who is a repeat offender of the same crimes because you just get up and you
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:57.920]   don't have a winter in your life. You know what I mean? There's no introspective time. You don't
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:04.160]   look over your shoulder into the past. You just get up and you're like, "All right, I've stepped
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:08.720]   in the same pile of whatever a hundred times, and I'm fine. I'll do it a hundred first. It doesn't
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:13.280]   hurt. Hell, it's good luck." Well, hang on a minute. Maybe we want to stop and go, "What can
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:26.320]   I learn from that?" But I don't know of a trick. I think if there's any trick, I would say,
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:35.440]   how quickly can we admit the inevitable? That's what I talk about in the book of Agatha. Once
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:41.680]   you know it's inevitable, how do we get relative? Not skip it, not throw it to the side, not deny
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:47.360]   it, which I'd love to talk about that here sometimes too, but the value of denial sometimes.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.320]   The value of denial.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:59.120]   Yeah. But how quickly do we, once something's inevitable, go, "Okay, any mind and heart time
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:04.320]   I'm spending about going, 'No, I can't believe that happened. No, did that really happen?'
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:09.360]   Any time we spend trying to deny what has already happened, that seems to me to be,
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:14.640]   I'm not sure the value of that time." So if there's any trick, I would say, once you know
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:18.320]   something's inevitable, even though how painful it is or how awesome it is,
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:23.360]   start getting relative with that. And in the relativity is seeing,
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:32.560]   there's a gift here. And if I realize that gift, I'm honoring. Now I'm onto building up
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:41.360]   the beautiful passage of my father leaving this life. Now I'm on the march to go, "Yes,
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:45.920]   let's let the legacy, let this become omnipresent. Let him live through me. Let me become more him."
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.080]   It's transformed.
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:48.720]   Yeah.
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:53.120]   So what value is there then to denial? Any?
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.920]   Oh, I think there's value to denial if you really commit to it.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:03.440]   I get this from my mother.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:03.940]   Yeah.
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:08.960]   So it's a very pragmatic value. Commit to the denial.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:19.760]   Okay. And my mom does it to an extent that I'm like, "Mom, do you have any consideration
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:26.960]   for context of situations?" And she does. This is the thing, every time I go, she's not a shallow
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:40.240]   woman. But if it is something, if something happens in her life that is keeping her from
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:51.280]   going where she wants to go or having a joy in her life that she does, she'll straight ass deny
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:31:00.400]   it happened. Didn't happen. No, it didn't. "Mom, we're right here. I heard you, what you said."
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:08.160]   "No, I didn't. You heard something else." "Mom." Now, does she get some amnesty on that? She's 91.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:17.040]   Hell, yes, she gets some amnesty on that. But she's not... Yeah, does she repeat offend? Yeah,
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:22.160]   but it's misdemeanors. You know what I mean? It's like we all... It's part of that thing when you
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.960]   got a family member and you're like, "Yep, that's just what they do. Just go with it."
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:33.200]   It's ingenious in a way. It's a tool. She does. I think it is more of a trick with her,
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:37.760]   but she wouldn't... So ingrained in her, it's not a trick. It's just, "Do it. Done."
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:43.600]   Another reason I bring this up, it's outside of just my mother, is
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:48.400]   I did this
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:55.680]   road trip course in this Art of Living event a few weeks ago.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:05.200]   Out of the hundreds of thousands of chats that came in and responses that came in afterward,
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:13.280]   it seemed to me that about 80% of people's challenges and problems even in their life
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:21.600]   were something in the past that they were hung up on, that they could not seem to get past,
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.120]   and it was holding them from going where they wanted to in their future. And so
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.640]   I thought that was revealing. I would have thought that was, I don't know,
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:37.520]   going in 40%. It seemed to be 80%. Yeah. And then I thought about, "Okay,
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:45.280]   if you're here in the live show and you wanna get the course, you're into some sort of therapy or
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.280]   education or development or self-help or whatever. Okay."
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:33:00.320]   And I have a lot of friends and I know a lot of people that are in weekly and daily therapy.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:05.520]   And then I know there's a lot of people that are on prescriptions, drugs.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:11.840]   And while a therapy and the right prescription to the right person for the right
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:19.600]   diagnosis is necessary, I'm questioning, "Is there a value to going,
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:26.240]   if you're not getting past this today, this week, this month, this year, almost in a decade goes
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:34.320]   by and you're still hung up and you can't get rid of that thing in your memory where it's got you
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:40.320]   paralyzed and you're a victim of it, and you're doing the therapy and you're doing the work and
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:44.480]   you're taking a prescription if that's what you're taking, is there a value in going...
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:48.800]   If it's holding you back from going where you wanna go, maybe you should just deny the fucking
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:54.480]   thing ever fucking happened. Kick it in the head, kick it off the curb. I'm done with you.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:59.920]   I'm sick of you. I'm tired of hanging out with you. I'm tired of that thing, whatever it is,
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:08.160]   holding me back from going where I wanna go. So if I can't wax the car and get past this thing,
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:13.920]   kick it. That's so powerful. So one thing to do
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:18.640]   like with the loss of your father is to try to transform it, to discover the gift in it,
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:24.480]   the gift in the pain. But if you can't, keep looking, keep looking, you can't find the gift
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:30.240]   in the pain, just deny it ever happened. You could call that a trick, but I think it's more
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:39.120]   than a trick because let me say this, my mom, after my father died, went on and found a second
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:50.160]   love of her life. For 19 years, they were together, CJ Carlick. Love you, buddy. He's moved on now.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:35:01.680]   Did she check with us a little bit? Like, is this okay? She gave us a little lingering half a second
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.880]   look that we knew that maybe is what she was asking. And we came to her, it was like, yes,
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:10.960]   it's okay. And you know who else is saying it's okay? Who's dancing up there for you? Dad.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:23.680]   So was that her denying that the man she was divorced from twice and married to three times
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:36.000]   and had three children with had moved on? No. But she didn't say, "Well, what's the book on how long
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.920]   I'm supposed to stay single before I can be interested in other?" There's not a book on
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:51.600]   these things. How do you feel? Is loving CJ mean you love dad less? No. Is finding a new life and
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:58.720]   a new dance partner in this life and CJ mean that dad wasn't your dance partner?
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:05.920]   That dad wasn't the love of your life? No.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:15.360]   So I don't know. I mean, in there, maybe there's another word. I think it's denial,
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:20.560]   but it's not really denial because it's not like it didn't happen. That's an earlier example I was
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:25.920]   giving my mom. She will absolutely go, "That light's not on." "Mom, the light's on." "That
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.360]   light's not on. If I say it's not on." Sometimes you're just like, "That makes no sense." You're
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:33.440]   just absolutely denying what just happened. We even have it recorded and she'll go, "Well,
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:38.160]   the recording's lying." Yeah. I mean, that's part of a coping deal with her. But I mean,
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:43.200]   what I think is more important or more valuable is to talk about this. She didn't deny my dad
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:53.040]   dying. I didn't, but she sure as hell turned the page and said, "I can still start a whole
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:59.600]   new category, a new life, a new love. Let my heart love and be loved by someone living
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:09.200]   in this life today that I'm still living in and that will not trespass on my love for my husband,
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:14.320]   your father, Jim McConaughey." And I think, I mean, we were just,
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:20.080]   thought that was beautiful. "Yes, mom, go. Talk about a green light, go."
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.920]   Now if we're hung up going,
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:31.920]   "Can't have one or the, can't have them both. Gotta have one or the other." Now we start to
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:37.200]   make a contradiction of the two ideas again, which, darn, our contradictions get us in trouble
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.320]   all the time, man. That's life though, the contradictions, right?
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:46.960]   But isn't life, if we just admit the contradictions are so much, don't they become a paradox?
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.520]   We just admit that that's part of it? Yeah.
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:54.320]   If contradictions are inevitable, they, hencely, they do become a paradox, don't they?
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:38:03.920]   Then we're in the honey hole. Then we're singing and dancing and have leniency with ourself while
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:12.480]   still holding ourself to task. And it's, I think it's holding on to know each contradiction,
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:17.280]   "Oh, here it is again." So it's a one-off. It lives on its own, separate from the last one.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:23.200]   No, it doesn't. They're connected. That's why they are a paradox. And then that's, I think that's a
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:27.760]   much, I think that's where life really is. In the paradox.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.440]   Yes. In the dance of it.
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:34.720]   I think the metaphor of red, yellow, green lights is just so simple and so powerful.
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:40.240]   You write about some green lights being engineered and some being mystical,
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:47.440]   which I love the difference of that. What's the difference of the engineered green lights
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.840]   and the mystical? Such a cool word, mystical.
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.480]   Yeah. Well, the engineered ones have reason and the mystical ones have rhyme.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.160]   [Lex laughs]
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:00.560]   Life's a mystery going forward, but it's a science looking back.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:06.560]   I've prepared, I've had ideas and written headlines and had goals and
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:15.280]   an athlete gets in shape for an event. I get in shape for a role. I read, I study, I work,
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:22.880]   I prepare and I go and I'm prepared and I behave and I do it. And I look at it and I go, "Yes,
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:29.200]   that's what I wanted to do." It's engineered, green light.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:42.240]   It's a conscious delayed gratification. It's that if I do it today, that pragmatic head down,
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:46.960]   believe there's no cloud out there, but then I trust that there is one out there. If I
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:52.480]   keep my head down and do it, I'll get that dream. We can engineer those, habit,
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:40:02.240]   work ethic, prep, expertise, education. And the mystical ones though, don't make any sense.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:07.120]   They're not supposed to make sense. They only make sense after, right when they happen,
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:15.280]   you backlog and you connect the dots with how they got there. That red light you ran into that
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:21.840]   made you 30 seconds later to get to the restaurant. As you walked in, she walked out
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:29.680]   and you went, "Good morning." And she went, "Good morning." And
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:35.600]   two months later, you're dating, two years later, you're married.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:40.960]   You're after that, you've got a family. And now you're sitting here 40 years later going,
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:45.920]   "I love you. Look at what we built." And you go back and go,
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.320]   "What if I wouldn't hit that red light?"
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:58.800]   Those 30 seconds made all the difference. So strange that this life is this way.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:02.560]   Yeah. And that's just rhyme. I mean, we can't really add that up.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.620]   Yeah.
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:15.280]   It's a science when you look back, you see why it was that you were upset and ticked off that
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.080]   you had to pick up the kids' toys before you left and they were supposed to pick them up. And
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:21.520]   therefore you were late for the thing that maybe you ran into and you ran into the person that was
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:24.960]   walking in the office. That's the guy that you did the interview. That's the guy you were looking
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:28.320]   for, the job you wanted. And you caught him because you were in the elevator with him.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:32.800]   And that 90 seconds on that elevator is what got you that job that led you doing what you want to
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:41.200]   do. I mean, the significance is there, but I think what we also got to watch is, again, in that
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:47.920]   balance, what do we chase? Because if we just chase the engineering, we miss magic. If we just
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:54.560]   chase the mystical, we find ourself caught up in trying to give meaning to that Lego set that was
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:42:00.880]   on the floor that the kids didn't pick up. And what color was it? And why did I walk out that door
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:04.800]   and see, almost step on the Legos? But if I had gone out the other door, I usually go out, if I
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:08.160]   would have gone there, I would have got there early and wouldn't have run into the boss.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:15.600]   So you can start to give too much meaning on that as well. I think we can give significance in too
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:21.040]   many places and all of a sudden, I think we've all been there where you're seeing art in every
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:28.480]   single thing. Man, that can be paralyzing. It's like, it's hard to leave a room if everything's
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:35.760]   significant, or if everything's a sign. How much of success in life do you think
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:41.280]   is engineered and how much is mystical? And how much is it different from person to person?
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:46.080]   'Cause for me personally, maybe I enjoy it, maybe I'm genetically built that way,
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:54.480]   but I exist more in the mystical. So I don't make plans. I traveled last summer in Ukraine with no
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:43:02.320]   plan. I just went there. No plan. I didn't know how I'm going to meet the president of the country.
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:08.880]   I didn't know anybody. And so there's no plan, there's no clear thing. You're just roaming around
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:14.480]   and that's how I've existed in life. And there's something about giving yourself over to the flow
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:21.680]   of nature that I just enjoy. It makes life so much fun. It's awesome when you can do it.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:29.040]   Did you engineer though, I'm going to put myself in the place when you got on the plane to go to
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:33.200]   the destination? That was an engineered choice. Yes.
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:40.800]   With the intent of, and maybe I'll meet and I'll run into, and I can work up a sit down with.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:46.400]   So the engineered choice was putting your shoes on, proverbially. I always say this,
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:50.400]   the hardest part about going to the gym is putting your shoes on. So getting on the plane,
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.600]   that was an engineered thought with the goal in mind, but I don't know how I'm going to do it.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.640]   The choice. Yeah.
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:02.320]   Putting the shoes on. Yeah. But there's not a clear, it's a fog what happens after the shoes
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:07.520]   go on. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.480]   Just going to take that leap. So I wonder how much,
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:18.800]   for people who are successful in this world and finding what makes them truly happy and fulfilled,
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:24.640]   how much of it is engineered, how much is mystical? How much was it for you?
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:31.520]   Well, I'll say this, like when I went to write the book Greenlights, which is basically the last 40
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:39.840]   years of my life, I thought that 85, 90% of my successes were going to be obviously engineered,
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:44.560]   where I could see the signs, saw the habits, here's what I did. Yep, that add up, got the
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:52.960]   solution, got the conclusion. I was very surprised when I noticed that it was probably less than 50%
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:59.840]   and that most of the real successes of my life were when I trusted,
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:06.960]   when I trusted that I didn't have to define it, that I only trusted that I didn't have to go,
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:14.880]   "Well, what's the measurement? What's the score? This leads to what? What's next?"
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:32.960]   For me, that's still a challenge for me daily now is to trust and not be, 'cause I can be,
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:38.960]   I think I can be overly practical and I think I can overcompensate and miss out on magic
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:51.680]   because I'm still going, "Wait, but are we giving enough measure and credit to
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:46:01.760]   actuality? Am I giving enough credit to these are the steps to take and this is reality?"
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:13.440]   I think I'm reminded when I trust, 'cause going with the mystic, just to put yourself on the
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:17.760]   plane with the engineer, but getting there, and as you say, you roll in that mystical,
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:23.280]   it takes a lot of trust. - Yeah. Trust in the inevitable.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:26.640]   - Aim in on that. - But not knowing where it actually
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:32.480]   ends you up. It's a feeling more than, I don't think it's a clear vision.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:35.760]   - Right. - It's kind of like a feeling
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:47.040]   that guides you towards a place without a clear name, without clear characteristics. It's just
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:55.840]   kind of pulls you there. - Where do you get that courage and trust to go with your gut, your
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:47:03.920]   feeling? And is there, for instance, three days later you sit down, is there, if you didn't,
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:11.520]   if that doesn't happen, is there a sense a week, two weeks later, now when you come back
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:23.360]   to America, that like, "Ah, I failed?" - Sort of looking back to try to analyze what went right,
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:30.080]   what went wrong, that kind of thing. Yeah, that engine is always there, but I think what pulls
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:35.760]   me forward in life, what makes me really grateful and fulfilled is noticing the thing you mentioned,
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:42.240]   noticing the magic and kind of going towards it. Sort of just sitting back,
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:50.400]   both in tragedy and in triumph. So in war, there's a lot of tragedy, but there's somehow,
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:57.360]   one of the things you see in war, and this is the first war I've experienced and seen,
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:02.240]   seen the front, is the loss, the people lose their homes and all this kind of stuff.
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:10.400]   The thing that rises from that is the love for each other. So the people I've spoken with,
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:15.600]   don't give a damn about the home, don't give a damn about on farms and the animals they lost,
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:21.200]   don't give a damn about having to move and all this kind of stuff, as long as the family's still
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:28.880]   there, as long as the people they love are still there. And there's this melancholy smile they have
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:35.440]   on their face. Like, yeah, this world is full of bullshit, it's full of tragedy, but life is
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:41.760]   fucking awesome. And you just notice that in little ways everywhere. You just sit back and
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:48.560]   notice the magic. And I want more of that. And just kind of follow along like a little ant.
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:56.800]   Keep noticing that kind of thing. But I don't know, I hope, what I think it is, is other people
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:01.120]   notice that you're the kind of person that notices it. And they're like, I want to hang
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:07.840]   out with that person. He seems all right. He seems one of the good ones. One of the good ants.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.840]   Do you have
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:20.640]   any certain non-negotiable structure before that freedom to go with the feeling?
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:29.040]   I think so. There's a set of principles of just basically integrity of being good to other people.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:34.720]   Like, whatever that means for me. There's specific things. Like, I'm really into loyalty
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:44.400]   above the law. There's a circle of friends I have, and that means everything.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:51.520]   There's just a basic deep kindness towards others.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:58.640]   Empathy. Empathy towards people that others might label as
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:06.000]   even evil. I have that kind of empathy. I believe all of us have the capacity to do good and evil.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.680]   So I just kind of see everybody as little babies that grew up in different conditions.
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:23.440]   Some do evil, some do good. And there's all kinds of other principles. I love the dynamic between
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:28.560]   the different humans and their full diversity. I love the dynamic between the masculine and
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:32.000]   the feminine. I enjoy it. I dig the dance of it. Yeah.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:38.480]   So you have a constitution with which you embark?
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:39.920]   You do too.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:50.000]   You're chasing. Yes, I hope so. And for me, I'd like to, it's inspiring to hear
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:57.280]   someone like yourself go, "I go and I just land and I just go, I'm gonna feel it." I can go back
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:01.520]   and go, "Yeah, my greatest truths I've crossed, my greatest successes in my life were when
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:06.480]   I trusted that." And go, "I took a one-way ticket."
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:09.120]   Amazon, Africa.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:15.840]   Yeah. And those were spiritual and very pragmatic because they led to
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:25.600]   succeeding in other ways that are more pragmatic 100% and gave much more meaning
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:36.720]   to those things. But to be able to go out and say that's how you... Do you have family?
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:41.040]   I really wanna get married and have kids, but I'm not married and don't have kids yet.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:41.520]   Okay.
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:45.360]   So actually, one of the nice things about that is you can take bigger risks.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:46.580]   Yes.
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:52.800]   So while I'm not married and don't have kids, I feel I owe it to myself to take,
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.440]   just to go, go to the Amazon.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:59.520]   Yes. Throw that backpack on and a one-way ticket.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:00.020]   Yeah.
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:02.160]   That does get harder to do.
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:16.320]   I miss that sometimes. The whim, a song that comes on, you know.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:19.280]   "Where's that guy from?"
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.560]   Yeah.
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:24.560]   "Oh, they're from the place that I wanna go, that I dream about. I'll go there.
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:32.400]   One-way ticket. What do I gotta do? Oh, get a couple shots. Okay, go." That was fun.
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:32.960]   [chuckle]
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:33.600]   Gotta do this.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:35.040]   It's get up and go, you're free to go.
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:37.200]   Yeah. And go, "When are you back?"
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:41.120]   "When I get there?"
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.000]   It's a beautiful, beautiful thing.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:44.800]   Maybe never.
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:45.840]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:50.000]   Yeah. "You'll be coming to visit me."
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.160]   "In this new place, maybe." Yeah.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:57.040]   How did the Amazon, how did the trip there change you? What do you remember of it?
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:58.800]   Such a magical place.
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:10.960]   I stripped a lot of my past, symbols and talismans while I was there. I remember getting
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:18.320]   there and just having so much adrenaline on the anticipation, anticipation of getting
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.120]   to the Amazon.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:30.080]   In the first 10 days, I wasn't really enjoying the trip, I was just charging to get to the
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:36.880]   destination, to get to the banks of the river that I had a dream about. And then it just
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:48.400]   humbled me. I got so fatigued on night, whatever, 12, and was so sick and tired, I was just
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:55.680]   whatever, 12, and was so sick and tired of the internal dialogue I was having with myself.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:58.320]   I was not enjoying my company.
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:15.120]   That I purged, and I remember, and stripped off identity markers that I'd sort of been
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:26.240]   hanging on to for everything from what it means to be an American, my dad's ring, M
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:31.440]   from McConaughey, a meltdown of my mom and dad's class rings from University of Kentucky were
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:40.960]   gold from her teeth, and his class ring melted down. Taking that off was really hard to go,
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:47.200]   "Am I casting out my father?" I wasn't casting him out, I was just removing to say, "I don't
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:52.800]   have to rely on that being all of my identity." So to pull that off, to strip down and just
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:54.880]   to where I was just a mammal.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:55:09.360]   That next morning, I was light, I got present. I remember writing something down, it was
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:14.800]   like, "All that I want is what I can see, and what I can see is in front of me." That
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:20.480]   sense of not, I wasn't leaning around, looking around every corner to get there. And as soon
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:26.320]   as that hit me, you talk about mystical successes and realities and truth, as soon as that hit
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:32.160]   me, and for the first time in 12 days, I didn't care about getting there or what was around
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:38.640]   the corner, guess what was around the next damn corner? The Amazon. I mean, not
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:45.200]   around a few corners, the next corner, there it was. And that was just like a touche.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:52.720]   You know, those times when the prime mover, the universe, God, what we want to name or
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:56:10.480]   believe in says, "Ding, there you go." And that form of detachment from holding on for
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:16.640]   dear life to things in past, so hard that you're not letting the beauty that's right
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:23.120]   in front of you to feel correctly and follow our intuitions, to have those, not cast them
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:27.840]   out, I didn't burn them, I didn't get rid of those things, I just took them off and
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:32.880]   had to recognize you're still here, you are you, you're much more, that is a talisman,
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:36.880]   that's a symbol, that means something to you, and that's good, don't cast out the
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:42.320]   meaning. But it's not like when the ring's off and the hat's off and the crucifix is
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:48.800]   off your neck that you're like, "You're gonna die." And I know, those are reminders.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:55.360]   Hang on to what they mean for you as we go forward, but as we go forward,
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:57:02.640]   quit worrying about so much about, again, I was looking at the proverbial dream,
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:09.440]   the cloud, so much that I was tripping over myself to get there. And like clockwork,
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:14.800]   just amazing grace, boom, as soon as it hit me, and I was like, "Oh, that's it,
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:22.320]   all I want is what I can see and all I can see is in front of me." Literally looking down at the
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:31.600]   ground at what was a sea of 10,000 wild neon blue Amazonian butterflies on the ground,
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.640]   as soon as they fluttered up, my head came up with them.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:41.680]   Took a few more steps and there's the Amazon, that's what you came over here for. Oh, howdy.
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:49.600]   Those kind of, truth like that. Well, the Amazon's interesting too, because it really has no past or
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:56.240]   future, losing the moment 'cause how fast it churns, it just eats up life. If a thing dies,
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:02.400]   it just gets swallowed up. Maybe because of the humidity, because of all that, because there's so
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:08.880]   many living creatures that eat each other, live on each other, so it really exists in the moment.
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:13.440]   And all this kind of diversity of life there, it's such an interesting place.
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:14.560]   Talk about food chain.
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:16.160]   Yeah, you're just part of it there.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:23.040]   We humans somehow escaped that food chain, but the roots are still there.
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:26.320]   I think we're a bit arrogant to think we've escaped.
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:31.520]   You think I'm being romantic in that notion?
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:38.320]   Well, sometimes when you're in a big city, when you're in Austin, Texas and LA, you can
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:46.400]   think like, "Oh, we're in a car, we're in a house, we're safe." But somehow nature's still a part of
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:52.080]   us. Our roots are still a part of us. I think it is more than we realize, more than we give it
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:59:04.800]   credit for. I actually believe that it's a really arrogant notion to think that
[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:14.640]   we are separate. Meaning people talk about pollution on a larger scale, the climate,
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:22.960]   what have you. I think Earth's gonna be just fine. We may not be here for it, but I think we have a
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:30.480]   bit of arrogance sometimes to think that we can trump Mother Nature. I think we have more of the
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:39.680]   natural law in us, and I sure hope so if I'm wrong. Well, there's an interesting, I've recently been,
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:46.240]   there's a guy named Max Tegmark at MIT who really worries about nuclear war, and he was part of
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:52.480]   constructing a simulation of what happens when a nuclear war happens. It's interesting to see that
[00:59:52.480 --> 01:00:00.160]   some very large percentage of humans on Earth starve to death, because they don't die first
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:08.240]   from the explosion, they die from starvation. Because basically dust covers the entire North
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:14.160]   America, and entirety of Europe, and so the crops all die, all the food sources all die,
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:21.120]   and people suffocate and starve to death. But the lesson you learn from that over a period of a few
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:28.800]   months, even though most of the human population of Earth dies, Earth finds a way, life finds a way.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:32.000]   - To adapt. - Yeah, to adapt. And it's gonna be just fine.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.080]   - Yeah. - In terms of the big
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:42.160]   living ecosystem that is life on Earth. And yeah, it's humbling to think about, well, maybe we're
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:48.800]   just a stepping stone. Same thing with, we've talked offline about artificial intelligence,
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:52.400]   maybe humans are just a stepping stone to the development of these other
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:01:00.400]   super intelligent entities. - Yeah. Yeah. And is it
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:09.360]   unconsciously in our nature that that's just part of the evolution and adaptation
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:15.760]   of our species? Because we're gonna, we were talking about earlier, what AI becomes
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:29.680]   is completely 100% based on who we are. And we get to see it for some time, a mirror to ourselves.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:35.920]   - Okay, this is what human civilization is like. These AI systems, large language models are
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:41.520]   trained on human communication, and you get to ask it questions, and you get to have conversations
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:48.480]   with it. You get to realize, wow, this is what the collective intelligence of the human species,
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:54.240]   our collective wisdom and knowledge, is what it looks like. All the bias, the hate,
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:59.280]   the paradoxes, all of that is in there. - Yeah.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:07.120]   - The contradictions. You can even convince those models, you can tell them they're lying,
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:10.800]   and they're gonna start changing their mind. It's interesting to play with them.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:17.440]   It's also interesting to consider that maybe they become smarter than us and
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:27.200]   become almost life forms that live among us, and maybe one day we merge with them. There's all
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.000]   kinds of possible trajectories that we take here. - How much of that excites you? How much of it
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:38.320]   scares you? - Is it possible to exist in a place where it is both exciting and scary, but to exist
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:50.560]   in that dance? Mostly I'm really excited because I see human beings as deeply lonely. There's a
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:55.040]   deep loneliness in all of us. That's how we seek connection. That's why we seek connection with
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:59.680]   others. That's why love is so beautiful when we find other people we're connected with. I just
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:07.120]   think AI can add to that. It can add friends that you can have great conversations with.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.600]   And then some of those friends would be AI systems.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:18.000]   They'll call you out on your bullshit in the most fascinating and interesting of ways,
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.920]   and challenge you and help you explore ideas together. So I'm excited by that.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:34.880]   - Is that different? And if so, how from the internet and Facebooks and these groups and
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:43.280]   communities that were, I think it's fair to say, set out to say this all access of information
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:52.160]   and people will help us find more common denominators than divisive ones. Do you see it
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:58.400]   as similar? - Yeah, it's similar but further into that direction. I think the internet has done an
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:04.560]   amazing thing in connecting us and expanding our minds and helping us find community that feels
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:08.640]   like our community and then the communities that are totally different and you learn from them.
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:15.440]   I mean, Wikipedia alone, one of my favorite websites, just opens your mind to all kinds
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.120]   of cool stuff. - Yeah, it does.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.560]   - And- - Not the Dewey Decimal System anymore.
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:28.880]   - No. And so I think AI just makes that even easier because Wikipedia, you have to read and
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:34.640]   you have to do a lot of work. With an AI system, like a large language model, you can just shoot
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:39.840]   the shit. It's more like drinking a beer versus like doing homework.
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:46.800]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's already happening. What do you think about that becoming the new
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:53.680]   family to where you said, "Mary, you don't have kids. Could you see a future for yourself where
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:58.560]   you have a relationship with AI and that is your family?"
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:02.800]   - That's the main, that's the primary, even romantic relationship.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:06.880]   - Yeah. - I can see it.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:11.120]   That one worries me. I like to keep it at friends.
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:14.560]   - Right. (laughing)
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:17.040]   - I think I'm not ready to commit to the romantic.
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.040]   (laughing)
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:26.000]   I wonder how much, now that takes us back to the Amazon in nature, how much we still need the human
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:32.320]   touch and whatever magic there is between two humans, which takes the leap into the romantic
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:36.320]   versus just the intimacy of a good friendship. I don't know.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:43.680]   - So, correct me if I'm wrong, you see AI as having a deep and meaningful friendship.
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:49.120]   - Yes. - And hopefully it will be a friend that will
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:56.560]   help you evolve and be able to love even more and be loved. And you can take that into humanity
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.560]   and find another homo sapien. - Yes.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:06.560]   - To go, "Yes." And thank you, AI, my great friend, for opening me up to this beauty that I have
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:16.320]   myself and I can see in you, my fellow human. And let's come together and biologically create
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:22.880]   family if we want to. And let's all remain friends with my friend and make your own friends with
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:28.400]   my friend's friends on AI. And let's have these great neighbor. It's a good friend,
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:29.920]   a great friend that's a neighbor. - Yeah.
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:33.040]   - Okay. - Mentor and friend. Just like now
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:38.640]   there's AI systems that play chess far, far, far better than humans. And we humans still play chess
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:45.760]   with each other. Or chess is still a game that's fun for us humans. And then we use the AI systems
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:52.640]   to get better at chess, to learn, to train, to discover new ideas, but ultimately return
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:07:00.400]   to the chessboard between two humans. But of course, this world is full of dangerous people.
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:09.120]   And so those same AI systems can be used to harm, to create false narratives, to do social
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:14.320]   engineering and manipulate the masses in terms of what they believe and all that kind of stuff.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.680]   - That's scary. - Yeah.
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:27.360]   - Well, and I get it when we, and I have my own fear and distrust of AI is based on my own fear
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:35.120]   and distrust of myself and others. There's something, it's very simple, but I think it's a
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:43.680]   really fun sort of way to just set up this reality. And it's kind of a duh, but it still
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:54.800]   needs to be said that AI is a prompt. It doesn't do anything unless we ask it. So what questions
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:08:01.040]   are we gonna ask is a question, is what we need to ask ourselves. 'Cause we're going to be looking
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:10.560]   in the mirror at our digital God that we create from ourselves. And just to know that that's that
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:15.040]   place where it's awesome and scary, exciting and scary. We go, "Oh, it's our creation,
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:19.840]   which is awesome." At the same time, "Oh shit."
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:30.160]   But it's prompted by our questions and gives us patterns from that which we give it.
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:41.440]   - But that prompting, that's the art of life. Like we prompt each other in conversation,
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:49.040]   our loved ones. When you go about your day to day, the next word you say, the next word you say to me,
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:53.440]   the question I ask of you, that's prompting. - Yeah.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:59.120]   - And it can change everything. I can say so many things right now that will completely just,
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:07.120]   the set of possibilities where both of our lives can take given on the selection of words I use
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:14.240]   and you use is crazy. So it makes conversation fun. And the same thing with AI.
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:24.480]   Except the nice thing about AI is it's tireless. - Tireless, right. Let me ask you this. If you
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:29.360]   can falsely condemn me right now, and I prove you falsely condemn me,
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:35.360]   I can forgive you and we can march forward stronger than before.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:40.000]   - Yes. - And AI's tirelessness and retention,
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:51.600]   can it forgive? I mean, can it go, "Oh, oh, okay. Yep. Sorry about that one. That was wrong." Can it
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:57.280]   amend? - Yes. Yeah. You could prompt it to ask for forgiveness, it'll forgive you.
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:05.920]   - Well, like when I talk it around with it, and you ask, "What should I be afraid of with you?
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:10.240]   Or what's the dooms toward you?" Its answer was always, "Well, it's up to you."
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:13.920]   Which it was awesome, right? - Yeah.
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:19.040]   - There you go again, it's up to us. And it brought up, you know,
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:24.880]   maybe synonymous with your human values and ethics and responsibilities. But it doesn't
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:30.480]   deal, that I didn't find anyway, deal with defining or making choices on its own of what those are.
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:39.600]   - Yeah, I think some of that is manually, those are constraints put on by it, by the creators of
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:48.400]   those large language models, basically not letting the systems have an identity of their own. And
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:54.720]   some of it is just not engineered in yet, but I believe that we'll have systems that have an
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:59.040]   identity, have a belief, have a set of opinions that carry through time.
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:04.480]   - And will we go to them, like certain states where we agree with the law and disagree with
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:13.600]   the law, or nations? "I'm a member of this AI." "Oh, well, you're from this AI tribe.
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:17.520]   Y'all believe this." - Yeah, there'll be an anarchist
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:25.920]   set of AIs, there'll be the communists, there'll be the Nazis, there'll be the Democrats and the
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:33.520]   Republicans, there'll be the people who are on the keto diet, and the people that are on this other
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:37.600]   kind of diet, this other kind of lifestyle, just like we have now, there's little groups,
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.160]   and there'll be AI systems. - They're gonna be supercharged.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:46.800]   - Yeah, they'll be either the leaders or the foundation on which we build those groups, and
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:57.280]   the possibility of all the fun we can have is endless. Of course, the dangers always rise up
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:04.560]   there, because I mentioned the Nazis, I mentioned all the dangerous ideas. The set of ideas that
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:08.720]   humans have come up with, a lot of them are awesome, most of them are awesome, I would say,
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:13.920]   but some of them are dangerous. The reason they're dangerous is because they become viral,
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:19.520]   there's something exciting in us about those ideas, but they also harm others a lot,
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:28.000]   'cause that's who we are as humans, we're capable of envy and all the dark stuff, of hate and all
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:36.400]   this. - Capable, yes. We also choose it.
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:47.200]   - Do you think most people are good? - Yes, but I also believe we got
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:51.760]   the good and evil in all of us, and it's which wolf we feed.
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:13:02.400]   - You ask people to draw a distinction, to describe where are you acting and where are you
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:11.600]   being. What's the difference? What's the difference between being fake, if I may use that word,
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:15.680]   and being real? - Okay, yeah, and the word authentic
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:27.040]   gets thrown around a lot, and I don't mean, I used to feel this way, but Bob Dylan loosened
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.520]   me up on this idea a little bit. (Rhett laughs)
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:38.000]   He was all about get to be your only one and only true self, that's it, everything else is fake.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.040]   And then you hear Bob go, "Well, I mean, we are what we create ourselves to be,
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:49.120]   we are our own creations," which I'm like, "Ah, yes, yes, we are, thank you, Bob, Bobby."
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:14:09.600]   I'm all for bullshitters and bullshitting. I'm not as big a fan of liars and lying.
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:13.440]   - What's the distinction? You're talking about the art form of bullshitting?
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:20.480]   - A liar's faking it, but not admitting to themselves that, "Yeah, it's a fucking creation,
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:27.280]   I'm faking it." A liar, I'm lying to your face right now, and I don't give you that hair of a
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:31.600]   wink out of my right eye that lets you know, "Hey, go with me here." I think there's value
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:37.200]   in the bullshitting. Now, the lying becomes troublesome because one, I've duped you,
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:40.800]   and I didn't let you know, come on, I was just telling the story about catching the fish,
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:43.840]   the fish always gets bigger every year we tell a story, come on, go with it, all right?
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:44.340]   - Yeah.
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:53.600]   - But the lying, all of a sudden, I don't know my own. I don't know when I'm emanating something,
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:58.720]   creating something, telling the truth, being authentic or lying, and I'm, shit, all of a
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:02.880]   sudden I'm leaving crumbs with myself, that constitution gets blurry.
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:05.760]   - Lying to yourself and to others.
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:08.800]   - Yeah, well, you start to lie, you lie to others enough, you start to lie to yourself,
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:14.160]   you don't even know it, and that, I believe, is dangerous territory. That's why I'm trying to
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:21.840]   push this admit, because that goes, I'm trying to come in at a kindergarten level, because we
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:27.200]   immediately jump to, "Well, I'm gonna judge that." Boom, that's bad, that's wrong. No, no, no, no,
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:34.960]   no, no, hold back on that. Let's go back to base level, let's just admit that we all fucking do it.
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:42.960]   Lies we tell others, lies we tell ourselves, lies we believe for convenience sake. I do it,
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:47.840]   I'm guilty of it, I try to catch myself on it, if I can just call it and go, "You know you're
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:51.360]   believing that lie out of convenience." I'm like, "I know." And then I have to,
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:57.040]   see if I'm saying that in the mirror or writing it down or sharing with a friend, you know? And I go,
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:01.200]   "Okay, well, now I've inherently become a bullshitter then, because I admitted it."
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:08.000]   That I can shake hands with. That's the little slight wink to ourself and someone else goes,
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:14.480]   "Come on, it's a better story this way." In the course of a road trip, you start with step one,
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:22.880]   admit. How do you do that? How do you kind of step back and...
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.920]   Do that inventory? Yeah.
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:35.680]   Is there a trick to that? Oh, if there's a trick to it, I think it's just about courage
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:42.880]   of having the... 'Cause it's... I don't think any of us like to admit
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:52.880]   our lies or look deep enough in to go, "I've relied so much on that lie that it's become my reality."
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.840]   Yeah. And I don't wanna be so puritanical
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:10.960]   as to say... Again, that's why I say admit instead of judge, but I don't wanna be so puritanical as
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:16.720]   to go and admit it and get rid of it. No, I'm just saying admit it, just bring it to the surface.
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:26.160]   Yeah, I'm saying this and I'm doing something different.
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:36.560]   I preached this, but I actually... Just admit it. Just admit them. And
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:40.720]   I think that's the first step to where we
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:48.320]   begin to either forgive ourself and give ourselves some amnesty and go, "Yeah, I'm a human.
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:52.320]   Trying to make it through life as best I can. I'm gonna let myself slide on that one."
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:56.640]   Okay? And maybe I've been getting away with it for so long, whole family, my whole network works
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:02.000]   well on it, okay? Forget this get to the base of the truth of the matter, but just admit it.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:08.800]   And then it will also help... It'll be easier to then expose to ourselves. Which one do we go?
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:15.040]   No, I'm not letting myself slide on that one anymore. That is actually a lie I've been
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:20.320]   believing that's been keeping me from getting more of what I want in life. That's actually a lie
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:28.400]   I've been living that I haven't admitted that is not allowing me to enjoy life as much as
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:35.280]   I damn well should be, deserve to be, or I've earned to be, or just sort of let myself.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:45.280]   Excuse me, I had on... It's not all the hard stuff. Sometimes it can be a fun thing. I talk
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:48.960]   about how many times we major in our minors. Let's admit where we sit there and we go,
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:54.000]   "All right, I give myself 12 hour workday, but I noticed I'm spending eight on my hobbies
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.360]   and four on my career while I'm majoring in my minors."
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:04.080]   Well, let me admit that. There's the math. Why don't we invert that? How about four hours on
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:10.240]   my hobbies and eight on my career? First off, just admitting it allows me to go, "Well, now I can do
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:17.200]   the math or rearrange the math by time of day." But look, I just found a hobby, tennis. First
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:23.360]   hobby I've had in 25 years. I had to admit that I went to play tennis, started to love it for the
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:31.920]   first month. I started feeling guilty. I was like, "Is it okay to have this much fun? I'm having so
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:38.240]   much fun and I'm getting a great workout." I just admit, I was like, "Yes, it's okay.
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:45.120]   Congratulations, buddy. You found something that you're finding quite pleasurable for straight
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:49.920]   pleasure. You don't have to forget all this other stuff about, 'Yeah, but I'm also getting a workout.'"
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:55.120]   "Well, yeah, you're getting that too, but you don't have to excuse the pleasure based on, 'Oh,
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:20:00.800]   but it's good for you.'" No, damn it. The real reason you love it is because you're having so
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:06.560]   much damn fun at it. I had to admit that to let myself go, "Damn, Ron, I'm going to play tennis
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:13.280]   again today or tomorrow." It was a simple fun thing. So it's not always about the hardcore
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:19.280]   stuff that we have to go, "This is a deep, dark lie that I've been living by and it's having me
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:25.280]   live falsely and it's having harmful consequences on my loved ones." Some of those will probably
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:32.160]   arise when we admit. I think it's just having a look around and just saying. And when we admit it,
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:40.640]   then we go, when we admit a lie, then we become something much more valuable, a bullshitter.
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:45.440]   You had the little wink in your eye. I love the distinction.
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:48.960]   I'm bullshitting myself on that thing. Yep, I'm lying. Therefore, if I call it a lie,
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:52.800]   I'm admitting a lie. Yep, well, now, yep, I'm bullshitting. Yep, now, it's just out. Didn't
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:58.160]   judge it. But now I'm bullshitting. That, I think we can work with.
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:02.320]   Well, you're an interesting case study because you're one of the most famous, one of the most
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:10.400]   charismatic, successful humans in the world. There's a lot, millions of people love you,
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:17.360]   hang on every one of your words. That's a hard place to be. How do you call yourself? How do you
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:25.360]   admit that you've been living a lie? How do you admit yourself in big ways and small ways on lies
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:29.680]   at this point, given how many people love you, how famous you are?
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:35.920]   10 years ago, I don't know.
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:42.960]   I don't know. Someone was talking about like,
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:48.720]   they really admire this so-and-so person because they're not someone who looks in the mirror.
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:56.240]   And I was like, yeah. All of a sudden, I was like, man, I catch myself looking in the mirror a lot.
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:07.200]   And then I go in and I look at my wife's side of her bathroom, how many different creams and stuff
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:13.120]   she has out there. I look at my side, I got a lot more on my side. I'm like, oh, I notice how if I'm
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:20.960]   out in public, working out, maybe doing pushups, maybe I do a few more. If there's a group of
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:25.040]   people walking by that maybe I'd like to impress, then I may do a few more than I do if I was on my
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:35.280]   own. I'm like, you are vain, McConaughey. And the knee jerk is, oh, vanity bad. And all of a sudden,
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:41.120]   I was like, all of a sudden, I became a bullshitter once I admitted I'm vain. I was like,
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:50.000]   well, bravo vanity. Let's go vanity. Instead of putting it in the cupboard in the lie section,
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:58.080]   oh, I'm vain because that's a debit. No, admit it. And then go, what's the value in it?
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:02.240]   Well, I can look at, yeah, I'm actually got in better shape because of my vanity. Actually,
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:14.160]   I eat better. And that led to being a better husband, better dad, doing something with my
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:20.720]   kids when I'd rather be over there writing this work I'm working on. But I know that tomorrow,
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:28.480]   when they leave town, they're gonna remember this time that we had together. That's a selfish act to
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:32.560]   go spend that time with my kids, even though I'd rather not be doing it at that time. I'd be doing
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:37.440]   something for myself because when they leave tomorrow, they'll have this great memory that
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:44.800]   they spent with their dad right before they went. I could call that vanity. I could group that
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:54.160]   and say, that was very vain of you. That was for self. Yeah. Because it was also for someone
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:59.920]   that I cared about. Are there people in your life that call you out on your bullshit,
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:06.240]   in the bad sense of the word bullshit? Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes it's either, I got a pretty
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:14.960]   thick threshold for how far I can go with my bullshit. Like what tickles me might bruise
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:22.520]   others to watch it. That's a good line. [laughter]
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:30.560]   Yeah. Tickles me might bruise others. But I also, I go back and talk about the bullshit,
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:38.640]   that's over there with those mystical successes. It's the, yeah, no, go with it.
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:43.840]   Don't pull a parachute yet. Let's see how far we can go. Let's see how hot I can get. Let's try it
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:46.520]   one more time. Yes, two more, please. Yeah.
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:55.840]   That's where a lot of great pleasure and stories and successes will come from. Those are mystical,
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:00.400]   they don't add up. It's like, we're not talking about reason right now. We're not talking logic.
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:04.640]   Just go with this. Let's talk about the virtual and making it real.
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:09.680]   The old line of fake it till you make it. I mean, what is that? There's something to that.
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:17.200]   There's definitely something to it. But I would, where people go fake it as, I would go back to
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:26.000]   Dillinger and create it, recreate it, create and recreate it, until it becomes, till you make it.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.640]   So I'll have people call my bullshit and a lot of times are right.
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:36.720]   I think when I handle it the most healthy way is I admit yes.
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:44.400]   And I'm aware. So I'm, and I'm going to keep going.
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:47.760]   So you're not like resisting and denying it.
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:53.200]   Oh, I will. I will. And I have to watch that where I'm like, no, I'm not. That's not what I'm doing.
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:57.520]   And usually when it's coming from people that are there going, no, you are, it's like, I want to
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:03.520]   admit it. And then that's where I'm telling a lie. And that'll come up, get me later and I'll go,
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:11.760]   I didn't see it. I didn't see I was doing that. I was either unaware, I wouldn't let myself be
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:17.520]   aware. I was denying that I was doing that. Would you say that's ego? Has ego been bad
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:23.120]   or good for you? Gosh, I think it's been, I'm so thankful for ego.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:38.240]   Does it get off the bridle for me sometimes and run loose and run in places and where it's
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:46.880]   not of service to others and has it hurt loved ones and even strangers? Yes.
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:27:07.760]   But I also, when my ego is really strong, it's in sync with serving. It's in sync with
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:18.480]   where I serve myself also serves others. Those two are part and parcel. They're intertwined.
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:25.680]   And that's the capital E, ego that I think and hope we all need more of. And that's what I mean
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:31.040]   when I talk about selfish. That's the redefining that the real true meaning of that is not doing
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:40.720]   something for self at expense of your neighbor or harming others. It's for personal profit and
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:49.200]   pleasure that also is profit and pleasure for a utilitarian sense more of others. And there's,
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.080]   again, back to the paradox that I think there's a place, I know there's a place,
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:28:00.160]   I believe there's a place where those are in sync. And when my ego is healthy, I'm able to
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:08.400]   say I'm sorry sooner for a lie or a misdemeanor or harm to somebody.
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:17.360]   I'm able to be more empathetic because I got the confidence to be so. I'm able to be more humble.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:30.480]   But still have my chin high and my heart high and look in the eye and go, yep, my bad, bogey,
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:35.000]   guilty. I shanked that one out of bound, man. -
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.920]   That's beautiful. So ego can be constructive, not destructive.
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:48.000]   You won an Oscar for your performance in Dallas Buyers Club. Can you tell the story of becoming
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.000]   that character, Ron Woodruff? What was the toughest part? -
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:00.880]   Toughest part, which was the most enlightening part,
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:08.800]   was getting to know who he was in between the lines. We're basing a life story in an hour and
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:19.520]   a half of film, and the script was great. But who was he in between the lines? Who was he before
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:27.680]   he started a business, before he was on a crusade, before he went to alternative medicines?
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:35.040]   You know, the obvious thing people always talk about, well, how'd you lose all that weight?
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:42.560]   That was not hard. That was just a militaristic decision. This is what I can eat each day.
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:47.440]   And if I do this each day for a week, I'll lose 2.5 pounds in a week. So I'm going to give myself
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:54.560]   five months to do that. 2.5 times that is 10. There you go. There's 47 pounds. That was like
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:30:01.200]   clockwork. So that was easy. That decision was made. I didn't go to the Pizza Hut buffet and
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:05.280]   have temptation for certain meals. I ate that and the weight just went off like clockwork.
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:12.160]   It was the, who is Ron Woodruff in between the lines? And the gift I got given
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:24.000]   that gave me the insight to who that man was, was I went to see his family before I was leaving.
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:33.280]   His family offered me his diary. And I remember it kind of has it going, wow, yes,
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:39.120]   but I kind of hesitated because it felt maybe a little too intimate of a thing for me to have.
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:45.360]   It felt like it was kind of maybe infringing a bit, but I opened my hand and took it. And
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:50.880]   what I got in the diary was I got to know who Ron was before he had HIV.
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:31:01.760]   And little thing, the diary he'd write in and the dreamer he was and getting all set on a Sunday
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:07.200]   night and laying his shirt out and ironing it for the next morning, making sure that his little
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:11.040]   pager had fresh batteries in it. Because tomorrow morning he was going across town to hook up some
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:19.440]   speakers for 38 bucks or whatever. And then getting up that morning and writing about what
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:24.480]   kind of coffee he drank and how much gas it was going to take to get over across town to do that
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:30.640]   job and hook up those speakers. And then on the way over, Paige coming in to say, "No, we don't
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:36.640]   need you. We've gone with somebody else to hook them up." And here he was all buttoned up, two
[01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:44.960]   cups of coffee in, hair slicked over, shirt ironed, a little less than half a tank of gas,
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:50.400]   but enough to get back home. Now where's this Monday go?
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:58.240]   The hope and the disappointment. You have to take all that in. That's part of that, man.
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:03.440]   I'm just going to go to Sonic and get a double cheese bacon burger because
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:08.080]   Sheila over there, man, she's kind of cute. She always gives me high price on it.
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:17.680]   Which leads to rolling the joint, hanging off till Sheila gets off the work,
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:23.440]   sneaking over to the local motel and shagging up in room 16. That's my lucky number 16, Sheila.
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:33.440]   Then wandering out that night, getting home one in the morning, no plans for Tuesday.
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:40.800]   And maybe later in the week, think about what am I going to do about work or job?
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:44.960]   And these little dreams would get me peak and want to, and then something would happen where
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:55.040]   he wouldn't follow through or the deal would go south. That, knowing that there's in there
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:33:03.280]   was where I saw who he was a dreamer and he just couldn't catch the break and didn't follow through.
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:07.600]   And then I remembered his family said, "Oh yeah, he invented it. He got patents on a whole bunch
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:12.160]   of things, but he never would." He had things to get patent, but never would follow through to get
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:18.720]   the government patent. And then later on, you'd see the product be made or sold on QVC or something.
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:25.200]   They'd be like, "Ron, that was yours. They stole your idea. Did you patent that?" He'd be like,
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:32.240]   "No." There's something beautiful and sad about that. That let me inside who he was
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:37.680]   in his heart and who he wanted to be. And what he was hoping to be and trying to be,
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:44.640]   but couldn't quite pull off. When you go that deep, does a part of him stay in you forever?
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:55.120]   Are you able to let go? I hope so. I get, I look, there's a tenacity to survive that I got
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:34:00.480]   from him. Hopefully I can try and find some of that in different ways
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:07.360]   in any character that I go play. Because if you really want to give a character an obstacle to
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:15.920]   overcome, a need, I mean, the base one is life and death. Whether that's the need to survive
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:24.800]   or the need to stave off extinction. I'm not talking about what the rules, the laws are,
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:30.480]   the social mores, the manners and graces. You're going to fight for your own life in a world that's
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:43.520]   not supporting you to do so. There's a wonderful courage of, "Okay, watch this. What do I got to
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:57.440]   lose? My life or I'm in charge of extending it? Get out of the way. And I'll pick your pocket
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:03.840]   along the way, whatever it takes." So there's a tenacity to live by whatever means necessary
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:10.160]   to survive that I'm reminded of, that I learned from Ron.
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:16.720]   So on that line of survival between life and death, you starred in "True Detective," which I think
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:26.240]   explores some darker aspects of human nature. What did you take from that?
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:32.320]   From that role, that experience, philosophically, psychologically?
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:36.320]   The freedom of being on an island.
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:47.440]   He was such a singular character and of a singular mind. And as you know, it wasn't a
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:58.000]   dance party up there in his mind. It was some heavy stuff. But also existentially for him,
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:11.840]   always like death would be a deliverance for him. It'd also be a cop-out in a way. It'd also be...
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:22.400]   He was not a man who was going to give himself amnesty and didn't allow it from the rest of the
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:29.840]   world. He wouldn't give himself an out. And while living in his head and heart and spirit was
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:39.280]   more of a hell than arguably dying, there was no alternative. That's not negotiable for that man.
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:43.920]   And that's why he was the best detective that ever
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:50.720]   walked the earth. That's why he was such a superhero in a way, to have that singular.
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:55.920]   You don't go, "Oh, I wish I was him." No, but you're like, "Wow, that constitution,
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:37:04.880]   that clarity of identity?" Talk about a measure in a man's constitution. He didn't allow
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:12.640]   anybody off the hook, especially himself. You wanted him to forgive a little bit or give himself
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:18.880]   a little amnesty. You wanted him to like, "Man, it's Saturday, bro. Can you go on a date?" You
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:27.120]   wanted him to enjoy something. But he was connected to something in his DNA, who's who he was,
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:34.800]   to something much more baseline truth. And that's why he was such a good detective. So that...
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:38.880]   But there's an island, as much as that company can be. I said earlier on that Amazon trip that
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:44.320]   I went and joined the company. There's parts, I think, that I maybe gave to myself,
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:50.960]   to Rustin Cole, and also that Rustin Cole has given back to me, that are like, "Yeah, when you
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:54.080]   want to pull the parachute, because you can't stand the company that you're in, McConaughey,
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:59.920]   in your own mind, the Socratic dialogue is driving you freaking crazy, don't pull the parachute.
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:03.840]   Stick with it. Go through it." So you were able to walk around with that
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:11.680]   tormented mind of his? Tormented. I didn't have very much patience for mendacious talk.
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:18.240]   I didn't have as much patience for small talk. I wasn't tormented.
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:25.200]   But the character was, and you have to embody him. So does some of that bleed over? Are you able to
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:30.000]   separate the man you are from the character?
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:35.760]   It's not... Look, am I able to separate? Yeah, I came home to my kids,
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:39.840]   and when they walk in the door and greet me and go, "What'd you do today?"
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:48.960]   And you got three kids under 10 years old, you don't tell them about the scene where you
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:55.680]   help someone commit suicide. It's just... So you turn it into a parable. Actually,
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:58.720]   I've always said this, having kids has made me a better actor and a better storyteller,
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:04.240]   because I have to parabolize certain things, and tell it in ways that they go, "Oh, neat."
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:18.960]   So did I go, did I bring it home? I didn't bring torment. Did I bring introspection into my own?
[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:24.320]   Characters for me, and I think this is true for a lot of actors and actresses,
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:36.960]   it's not a separation. If I've got... We each have everyone else in us. It's just seeing,
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:44.400]   diving into Rustin Cole, knowing where his mind and heart is from the hand of Nick Pizzolatto,
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:50.160]   who wrote the character and wrote the whole series, understanding, number one,
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:54.720]   what the hell am I saying? What's he talking about? Then going deeper into that, well,
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:40:00.960]   this person really believes that. What does that say about how they move? Then I'm going,
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:06.880]   all of a sudden, well, who is that in me? What part of my left brain is locked into that? What
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:14.000]   part of my reptilian brain is latched onto that? This other stuff is non-negotiable.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:20.720]   Then I just live in that, and I always talk like a '70s equalizer. Remember the old
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:31.440]   Epmiront equalizers? You move up your 500 HKZ, you move up your 60, you just rebalance the
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:37.280]   equalizer. It's just going to those parts of me where I'll turn up the volume, some parts of the
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:42.160]   bass, the treble on the equalizer, and turn down other parts of myself. I'm not coming home
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:53.200]   tormented as Rustin Cole. Am I coming home seeing torment where it should be seen?
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:58.080]   Am I reading the news differently? Are things coming out of the news and catching my eye
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:07.600]   as being bullshit or lies or truth that is just hard and going, "Yep, yeah." I'm seeing it through
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:12.320]   a different lens, but I'm seeing my own life through a different lens, a lens that was opened
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:15.440]   up and an aperture that was opened up through Rustin Cole.
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:21.120]   I mean, the process of being an actor, an actress, I guess is a really interesting way
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:23.760]   to be a philosopher of human nature.
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:26.960]   Yeah. I mean, it's an incredible-
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:27.680]   Really, isn't it?
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:35.360]   Dive into the humanities and all the ologies and philosophy. As I said,
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:44.800]   I'm going to, as I opened up that question, being on an island is a vacation.
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:51.200]   I am also conscious for five months when I'm playing Rustin Cole that,
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:42:03.600]   this is an interesting fact. I was as strong spiritually with my relationship with God
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:06.880]   when I did True Detective as I've ever been.
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:08.480]   Why is that?
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:16.240]   Okay. Which you would say, "Wait a minute." In some ways, those are antonyms.
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:16.740]   Yeah.
[01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:26.640]   No, but I pretty safely can say that my own strength of spirit in my own personal life,
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:30.800]   Matthew's life, gave me the confidence to go further away.
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:31.300]   Mm-hmm.
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:32.660]   Further away.
[01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:42.400]   Deeper into the torture and deeper into the... But he was still always going after truth.
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:43.120]   Mm-hmm.
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:47.200]   That was the thing. He was not an evil man. I don't even know if you can call him a nonbeliever,
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:52.160]   but he was always going after the truth and the truth burned and he would take the scar
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:43:00.880]   and get burned for it. He'd die for it. That, something was actually biblical about that.
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:01.760]   [laughs]
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:09.920]   You know? And so, but I don't think it's coincidence that I had so much
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:21.680]   journe of diving into the depths of that tortured character because I trusted that
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:26.160]   when I go out, I'll come up the other side. It's always like jumping in a pool of water.
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:32.800]   And can you trust you'll come up the other side and not... You go play a criminal,
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:36.800]   you trust you're not going to come out the other side a tyrant in real life.
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:44.000]   You just go, "Oh, God, I got to go do that. Came out and I'm still alive. Got all my faculties.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:49.680]   I'm not in jail. I'm whatever it is." And so my own spirituality at that time,
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:54.720]   definitely I think gave me a certain trust and confidence to go further into the dark.
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:00.880]   It was announced that you'll be starring in a Yellowstone spinoff show.
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:08.480]   What do you think about the cowboy ethos that permeates Yellowstone and other shows created
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:11.200]   by Taylor Sheridan? You're a Texan.
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:11.680]   [laughs]
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:13.600]   I am a Texan. Yeah.
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:16.160]   What do you think about that philosophy and way of life?
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:29.520]   I admire the simplicity of it. I mean, one way you could explain Yellowstone and
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:38.960]   Costner's role is what will man do to protect land and family
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:45.280]   in a world that's trying to encroach, in a world where
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:59.520]   there's a cowboy ethos that deems trespassing more clear earlier than other hats.
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:08.720]   I admire that simplicity of right and wrong.
[01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:16.480]   And that the simplicity of that right and wrong doesn't always correlate, coincide with the law.
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:21.440]   No, it's above the law. You mentioned something earlier, I remember where it wasn't in
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:25.440]   conversation, but a little bit of like, "Okay, if the law ain't handling this, I am."
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:36.880]   And then it is, "The law's not gonna handle this, therefore I am." And then it is, "I'm
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:43.040]   handling this." The law, talk to them when you get to them, "I'm handling this."
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:52.560]   There's an honesty to that. It just seems, of course, it's dangerous because it's a slippery
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:59.360]   slope. Because of the power in that, power corrupts, it can be a slippery slope where
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:04.240]   you completely disregard the law and you can hurt a lot of people. But when done right,
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:14.000]   there feels to be something really authentic and human about that. Protect family, protect land,
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.920]   above all else. Yeah.
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:26.320]   But this is a broader question, but I'm gonna piggyback it off of this.
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:40.000]   Back to the dreams and reality and evolved species and how and what we do in creating a
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:43.120]   digital God and AI and these communities and friends that
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:46.640]   challenge us and think like us, we like to hang out with.
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:56.000]   Do you think we're a less evolved species than we give ourself credit for? Do you think we give
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:01.760]   ourselves credit for being more evolved than we actually are? I think we do. I do.
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:09.120]   I think we need to admit that. I think probably the cowboy ethos is a
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:17.040]   step towards admitting that. And that's why it's so appealing to people.
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:24.000]   Kind of wakes them up to realize that we're not so far from our ancestors.
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:36.560]   That the values of loyalty are really important. Trust on the basic human level.
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:44.240]   How do you know if you can trust someone? I don't know if I can trust someone. Well,
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:49.120]   I don't know a trick to it. I do not know a trick to it, but I do come in,
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:57.040]   as I believe you do, with high trust. I come in with a, I'm told, sometimes I think,
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:02.080]   I'm told that I trust too much sometimes. Have you been hurt? Have you been betrayed?
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:07.280]   And if you have, has that hurt your willingness to trust?
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:17.360]   No, it hurt. And I put that person and those people in another category back here and do my
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:23.520]   best not to let them know that it bothered me at all, but I know when I am with those people.
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:25.280]   But a new person, you're still willing to trust.
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:30.000]   No, I'm not going to do that. I think that's the beginning of cynicism, which I think is a
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.960]   horrible disease of getting older. I'm not going to do that.
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:35.120]   So you're fighting cynicism off as much as you can.
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:44.240]   No, no way, no way, no way. I mean, there's no residual in it. There's no win. It's easy,
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:52.880]   it's clever, gets the laugh at the party. And if it sleeps well, it shouldn't be.
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:59.440]   Don't get comfortable in the cynicism. I have to ask you about being a Texan.
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:06.320]   You're like, when I think Texas, I think Matthew McConaughey. What's it mean to be a Texan to you?
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:13.840]   I recently moved to Austin, Texas, two years in.
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:17.280]   All right, all right. Welcome.
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:21.680]   What's it mean to be a Texan? Educate us.
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:31.360]   Texas is about independence. Politically, Texas is not about Republican or Democrat.
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:42.880]   It's about independence, independence of spirit, sovereignty. Texas is about exploration. One of
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:47.680]   the things I love about Texas is I run into so many Texans around the world.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:50:01.600]   Texans are taught to go be conservative or learn who we are, then go, go, explore,
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:10.160]   pioneer, journey, and hopefully you come on back with some goods and some stories, you Texan.
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:19.680]   And underneath that is this kind of freedom of being an individual in the full meaning of that
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:28.000]   word. Yeah, well, Texas is liberal on your entrance. Very liberal on your entrance.
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:37.280]   Less regulation. Hey, welcome. High trust. High trust, sir. Welcome to our state. Come on in.
[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:48.080]   Yes, yes, yes. But if you light sheet steel, we're conservative on our consequences.
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:50.160]   (laughing)
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:56.400]   Oh, yeah, that's a good line. You've briefly pondered running for governor. I don't know
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:03.440]   if that's in your future. I hope it is. You had a few good lines about it. Do you think about that
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:08.560]   kind of stuff? About what the future holds in terms of political office?
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:14.160]   I don't think about it in terms of political office. I've graduated to a broader, larger
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:24.080]   thought of what's my future hold and where would I be most useful as a leader. I think that's a
[01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:33.520]   fair word. Whether that's thought, whether that's the leader of my family right now, as a parent,
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:49.760]   as a father, the leader of people that work with me. Politics, I'm not gonna say it's,
[01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:58.160]   'cause it's not small. That's why I say that out loud. It's not small. I do think it needs
[01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:04.720]   to re-engineer and redefine what its purpose is before, because it's just chasing its own tail
[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:12.000]   right now with the two parties that seem to me to be completely about just invalidation
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:21.440]   of the opposition instead of vision of themselves. So I think it needs redefinition of what it is,
[01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:25.680]   because it is important. That's what I mean. That's why I said I don't mean small. It needs
[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:31.600]   to think bigger about what it is and how it's useful. When it seeks to invalidate, it's small.
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:37.440]   When it seeks vision, it can be big. Yes. Well, one's affirmative. One's
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:40.400]   going into that cynicism we were talking about. Yeah.
[01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:48.240]   And validation of any opposing thought, or maybe that we're even opposing. Opposition
[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:53.840]   is an arrogant term. That's too strong. So a lot of times it's not even opposition. Alternative,
[01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:58.960]   other than, another way of thinking about it. Oh, could both be true? Oh, how could we parlay
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:09.280]   those two ideas? One of the challenges with these ideas of a third party or
[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:15.360]   meet you in the middle, it's kind of got this historic notion of being, oh, well,
[01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:21.760]   comme ci, comme ça, it's sort of Mr. In-between, kind of go which way the wind blows.
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:29.200]   I think, done in the right way, it's the, and it doesn't have to be under a third party's name
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:37.280]   necessarily, but it's actually an incredibly rebellious position right now. And it's actually,
[01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:44.240]   and I love sports, it's tactically the place with which
[01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:51.680]   to move most advantageously. I think of their free safety in the game of football. They're
[01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:57.760]   in the middle of the field and they're deep. They choose to defend left or right according
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:04.960]   to the play that's been called by the offense. Similar to the offense, the running back,
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:09.200]   you read the defense and then you're gonna run right to run left to go away from that opposition.
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:17.680]   It's a tactical spot. To be truly independent and respond and respond.
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:22.240]   So do you think you have a role in that in political officers?
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:30.000]   I don't know. It's on mind. It's not out of my mental box. And I gave it real sincere thought
[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:40.880]   and discernment for over a year. And it's a wonderful, whether I end up in politics or not,
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:47.440]   it was a wonderful exercise. One that if anyone else got time to do it, do it. To ask yourself
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:54.640]   what you would do if you were CEO of a state, CEO of a nation, CEO of the world, that's a great
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:55:00.480]   thing to go. You wanna get your values in line? You wanna admit where you lie and throw yourself
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:06.880]   some pop quizzes? And what if this phone call comes at 4 a.m.? Who you wanna surround yourself
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:11.920]   with? It's really great questions to ask and I think has helped me at a more micro level,
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:17.120]   be a better father, a better man. Taking considerations that I did not maybe take
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:22.480]   in as seriously before considering it. I don't know if that's in my future.
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:29.280]   Useful is a big word. It would have to be useful. I have to be useful in the right way. And is that
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:36.000]   my lane to be most useful? It's a good question for a leader to ask. How can I be useful?
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:45.680]   I have to ask you about "Interstellar." So I think it's an incredible film. I've seen it
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:51.120]   inspire so many scientists and engineers. It's just philosopher, everybody, humans.
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:57.760]   It explores space travel, physics of space time, human nature, human condition, human connection.
[01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:06.160]   How has that film expanded your understanding of the universe and our place in it?
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:16.000]   Yeah. Well, it's got the old Mr. Mayor on the corner, how big is that cloud
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:22.960]   metaphor in it? Because that was the character I played, Cooper's, that was the existential
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:27.920]   question for him. Head down, practical, stay here, be a father to my children.
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:36.720]   But his dream before his children were to go explore space. So when he's taking that
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:43.040]   truck out and the countdown's going down, that's the hinge of the existential question
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:57.680]   that we all face in some form. The sense of time, which I think everyone loves, that sense of
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:03.920]   where time can run at different speeds. And there's an incredible scene where
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:13.280]   Cooper as a father is getting video feed from his children who've aged and he's realizing he's
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:19.920]   missed all that. Yeah.
[01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:30.880]   You know, I mean, overall, that concept makes me consider and imagine.
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:36.240]   We talk about mystical successes instead of engineered ones, like the engineered ones,
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:44.560]   there's ethos from that film and what Nolan put into that film and theories that make me go,
[01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:52.400]   "Yeah, what does any of this matter? Maybe we are, maybe we're AI." It makes me go,
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:59.840]   "It's already all been written. What's happening right now in this blip of time you're here,
[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:07.440]   53 years so far, we'll see how many we get. What other parallel timelines are happening out there
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:16.160]   do, is it small minded of us to define life on other planets as only something that can live
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:23.280]   within a climate that has water in this amount of O2?" Those terms may be too small. What do you
[01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:28.160]   mean? Who are we saying only life has to have water in this amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide?
[01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:32.320]   There's a whole redefinition of the ingredients that other life forms need.
[01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:39.040]   It's sure in a similar way to Contact, which is a movie I did with Bob Zemeckis,
[01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:48.880]   inspires me that the universe is more active and lively and God's backyard's bigger than I thought.
[01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:56.080]   And wow, that's exciting. And people go now, "Yeah, you believe in extraterrestrial life?"
[01:58:56.080 --> 01:59:00.560]   I said, "Yes, man, I think it'd be arrogant not to. I sure hope so."
[01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:07.120]   You think there's alien civilizations all out there, intelligent ones, just far on distant stars?
[01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:17.760]   I hope so. And I think it's possible. May have many among us right here.
[01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:27.920]   And I go for the why not in that just to keep that train of thought open to learn and consider
[01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:32.320]   those existential questions. I think it'd be arrogant not to.
[01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:38.320]   There's so many hundreds of billions of planets just in our galaxy.
[01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:39.840]   Just in ours.
[01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:48.960]   I can't imagine there's not life out there. But I suspect it's very different, like you said,
[01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:54.480]   than we are. And we have to have a humility to open our eyes to how different life could be.
[01:59:55.440 --> 02:00:03.440]   And if and when we cross it, unlike we've had a tendency to do when we tried to go with some
[02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:20.320]   nation takeovers, I think it would be our inherent glitch to go in believing that any other life
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:26.640]   form civilization wants to take over territories. To go into it with thinking that, "Okay, this is
[02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:35.040]   an opposition." I think that's a human trait of ours. And to consider that another life
[02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:44.800]   form would have an interest that more land or more territory is good for them,
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:51.040]   I think is a shallow idea. I think of it more like when I think of heaven,
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:01:00.720]   those considerations are not in anyone's mind, heart, or intent in the heaven that I think of.
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:07.920]   So in other civilizations, these things, I hope that if we would just see and learn,
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:14.960]   that would be the natural side of welcoming. It wouldn't be a primate response to, "No, I have
[02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:19.920]   fire and you're coming over trying to put it out," or, "I have food and you're trying to steal my
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:27.680]   food." I don't think it would be... I think it's a shallow thought to think that, "Oh, it's gonna
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:35.360]   be about ownership and we'd be trespassing." I don't think they would have a sense of borders
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:40.960]   as we do. I just hope we humans are smart enough to detect and to see aliens,
[02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:49.360]   because of how different they are. We often have a very narrow definition of what is intelligence.
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:54.320]   It's very possible that trees are extremely intelligent if we kind of zoom out at a
[02:01:54.320 --> 02:02:02.160]   different time scale, a different... Just look at stuff from a bigger perspective that's outside
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:08.640]   of being so human-centric. It's a great quote that someone told me, this astrophysicist told me this,
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:14.080]   how accurate it is or not. Someone else can argue the validity of what I'm about to say or not,
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:19.120]   but I thought it really was a perspective grabber for me. Like, look, see, the universe was created
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:30.640]   at midnight. Humans came around at 11.59 and 36 seconds. I love the little analogies that frame,
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:34.800]   like that make, "Oh, yeah, the pale blue dot, there it is." That perspective,
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:40.960]   something so relaxing and empowering about that at the same time and humbling,
[02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:52.400]   but confidence boosting, allows forgiveness, allows ambition. I just love the perspective
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:55.680]   of that, that picture, to picture it that way in our timeline.
[02:02:57.200 --> 02:03:03.840]   Do you hope humans become a multi-planetary species as we're trying to do, as SpaceX is
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:09.760]   pushing forward, traveling out to Mars, potentially colonizing Mars, colonizing other planets?
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:13.760]   Yeah. [Lex laughs]
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:23.280]   I'm, yeah, go explore. I love the ambition of it. I love the pioneering nature of it. I love the
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:29.600]   extension of what we consider as our backyard becoming more four-dimensional like that.
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:34.160]   Not at the expense of,
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:40.800]   "We still got stuff to take care of. We got gardens to tend right here."
[02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:47.440]   And sure as hell not to go, not to quit on us, to go, "Oh, let's get out of here 'cause this
[02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:53.920]   isn't really working." No, no, no, no, no, no, no. We got a tithe we're still supposed to pay here.
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:58.800]   That's part of this pressure testing us as a civilization and a species.
[02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:05.280]   Whether you call that restoration order or whether you call that,
[02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:15.760]   "Let's figure out how to adapt best we can." No, not at the expense of quitting here on Earth.
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:20.080]   But let a few select folks explore.
[02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:20.560]   Yeah.
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:21.280]   'Cause that's like...
[02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:23.360]   God said, "Go for it, please."
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:27.040]   One of the coolest things that we humans do is kind of embodies the human spirit,
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:34.640]   reach out into the unknown. But it's hard. I mean, as interstellar shows and so on.
[02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:36.720]   Yeah.
[02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:37.440]   It's painful.
[02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:42.400]   Well, and Elon talks about it. This is not gonna be a weekend daisy trip.
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:47.520]   And he's just speculating how hard it could be. It'd be much harder in different ways
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:48.720]   that he doesn't understand yet.
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:55.280]   Well, that dance between the impossible and the inevitable, that's definitely there
[02:04:55.280 --> 02:05:03.360]   with what SpaceX is doing, what all the folks who are trying to become a multi-planetary species
[02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:11.040]   are doing. It's really hard. It's like, to build rockets that fight off gravity
[02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:19.680]   at a cost-effective way is really hard. SpaceX is close to being bankrupt several times.
[02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:26.160]   It's just hard. But it's also inspiring that some people are just crazy enough,
[02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:27.840]   bold enough to keep trying.
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:28.080]   Yeah.
[02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:32.960]   What advice would you give to young folks?
[02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:35.520]   What advice would I give?
[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:41.440]   In high school and college that are thinking of how to make their way in this world?
[02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:56.800]   If you haven't already, can you define what you have an innate ability for
[02:05:56.800 --> 02:06:00.720]   and match that with what you're willing to hustle to get?
[02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:01.840]   Yeah.
[02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:10.880]   Sometimes we have an innate ability, but we don't wanna work for it. We take it for granted.
[02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:18.240]   And we end up doing something that may work, may pay the bills, may get us by day to day.
[02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:24.240]   But we don't really like it. We have trouble finding a way to enjoy it. Definitely don't love
[02:06:24.240 --> 02:06:31.600]   it. And then sometimes we don't know what our innate ability is and we're hustling and working
[02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:40.320]   our tail off and breaking a sweat to do something that we really aren't that good at on an innate
[02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:48.560]   level. And that's a good challenge. And you can work and become good at something
[02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:57.680]   that you don't have an innate ability for, but if you can match those two, what do you have an
[02:06:57.680 --> 02:07:02.080]   innate ability to do? 'Cause we have an innate ability to do, when we do that well, we do enjoy
[02:07:02.080 --> 02:07:02.480]   it.
[02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:07.120]   Yeah. And one of the things that requires is to be really honest with yourself
[02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:12.800]   at what your innate ability is. 'Cause oftentimes there's a lot of noise when you're growing up,
[02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:17.200]   people telling you what you're good at and not good at. Really, you have to look at yourself,
[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:24.000]   listen to yourself, that inner, like a deep, rigorous self-analysis of what am I actually
[02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:27.520]   good at? Not what I hope to be good at, but what I'm actually good at.
[02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:33.520]   Right. And then if you look at that and you can define those two,
[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:45.680]   hopefully, you can activate it in a way where there's a demand for what you supply.
[02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:51.840]   You found love with Camila Elvis McConaughey.
[02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:57.680]   What advice would you give to people on how to do just that? How to find love?
[02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:09.120]   This wonderful subject's been discussed since the beginning of time, hadn't it?
[02:08:09.120 --> 02:08:16.240]   Love it. So, I can tell you what things I've kind of learned and I'm still learning.
[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:25.120]   You know, love is one of those mystical successes. It doesn't make sense.
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:43.920]   You know, when I was, before I met Camila, I had had, I was coming on to my late 30s.
[02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:51.920]   As much as I'm not a person that is guided by timelines, I was, my life had not really added
[02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:56.960]   up to what I thought it was gonna be relationship-wise. I thought by that time I would have
[02:08:56.960 --> 02:09:03.200]   met the woman I loved, got married and started family. And that hadn't happened. And I did find
[02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:08.480]   myself doing that thing I was doing at the Amazon, looking around the corner.
[02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:17.280]   Any prospective possible female I met that I was attracted to, I was like, "Maybe this is the one."
[02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:22.800]   I make the joke, but it's true. It's like at every red light, I'm like checking out who's next to me
[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:26.480]   in the produce section at the supermarket. I'm like, "Who's down in the produce section?" You
[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:35.520]   know, it's like looking. When you're in that zone, you can also be a little intrusive.
[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:41.520]   You can trespass on people's, you can get outside of yourself. You can be overly impressed and not
[02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:47.520]   as involved and have your own constitution and sit back. And therefore, if you're outside of
[02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:58.480]   yourself, you're less attractive to your possible mate. I've got a series of dreams that are written
[02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:06.320]   about, but I had one then that was very spiritual. That was me as a 88-year-old bachelor who never
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:12.560]   got married. And it was a beautiful dream. Where on paper, I thought that should be a nightmare.
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:20.240]   It wasn't. What that dream did for me was allowed me to go, "You may not find the woman
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:28.720]   for you and get married and have a life with her. That may not be."
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:33.120]   And for the first time in life, I was okay with that.
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:40.080]   More than intellectually, spiritually, I was grounded. I was like, "Okay."
[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:47.920]   Then I'm moving through the world and on this particular night as myself, not intruding. I was
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:54.320]   inviting. I did see her move across the room and did not say, "Who is that?" I said, "What is that?"
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:11:02.320]   And then did move to call her across the room. So I did invite, but I was not outside of myself.
[02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:13.040]   And I was able to be myself with her. What my eyes saw, everything that she turned out to be
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:18.880]   when the lens got zoomed in, more details got known, and we began to talk and got more intimate
[02:11:18.880 --> 02:11:24.720]   and closer together and spend more time, became true and then some. But not every single thing
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:29.440]   that I imagined when I saw her move across the room turned out to be true and then some.
[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:44.800]   In just the image. We found a similar moral bottom line about life, each other,
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:49.680]   how we treat ourselves, what we respect, what our own constitutions were. We had similar
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:58.000]   perspectives on raising children, which was very important to me and her.
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:02.320]   And then we just enjoyed each other's company.
[02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:03.600]   Yeah.
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:08.880]   And we laughed together and we support each other and we promoted more of each other and we lit
[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:16.640]   each other's fire. And if one was rolling, we kept dishing, "Go, go, go again. Take the next shot.
[02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:20.080]   More, more, more, more." This was a biggie too.
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:23.280]   Getting excited for each other's success.
[02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:34.800]   Yes. Yes. To be able... I think it's very important. We all have jealousy. I get it.
[02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:43.120]   But it's very important to be able, if you can, be happy for your lover when they succeed
[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:48.720]   or are succeeding or are across the room at the party laughing with a stranger,
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:52.720]   to be happy for them when it has nothing to do with you.
[02:12:52.720 --> 02:13:00.720]   She was... I would be away, she would... The questions and the talks we would have,
[02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:04.800]   she was happy for me about how excited I was about my day and my day had nothing to do with her.
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:05.120]   Yeah.
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:09.120]   She wasn't there. And I found myself not telling myself to be happy for her, but being
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:14.800]   really, really happy for her when she would tell me about something that happened that day with her.
[02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:17.760]   And as much as I went through my head, "Oh, it would have been great if I would have been there,"
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:23.120]   I was like, "No, I'd only trespass on that. You had that independent of me. Bravo."
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:29.200]   That's a choice you make not to give any time to the jealousy,
[02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:31.840]   to the very natural jealousy that we humans have.
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:35.760]   It sure doesn't have any... I don't see the residuals in it.
[02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:37.920]   True.
[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:40.480]   I've got it. I've had it. And I have it. I just don't...
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:45.600]   I haven't seen where it has any payback.
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:52.320]   I gotta ask you the biggest possible question. What's the meaning of this whole thing?
[02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:53.520]   Ugh.
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:54.560]   What's the meaning of life?
[02:13:54.560 --> 02:13:55.060]   Right?
[02:13:55.060 --> 02:14:02.160]   Matthew McConaughey, why? Why are we here?
[02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:14.160]   I don't know why we're here. I prescribe to, in a religious sense, the Restoration Order.
[02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:20.000]   We're here to restore order. And in a religious sense, I really, I purchased that and love that
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:26.720]   incentive and love that view. But I don't really know why we're here. But I do know,
[02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:33.200]   to go back to the front, we are here. That part's inevitable.
[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:37.280]   So now let's flip the script and go to the why not.
[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:46.880]   Just keep living. What are we doing? The base of everything, Eric, and we can argue it all,
[02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:53.360]   at the base of it, all I can come up with is, well, just keep living, man. I mean,
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:58.080]   what else are we supposed to do when we don't have any idea what to do?
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:02.000]   When we know exactly what we wanna do?
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:06.080]   Make it matter.
[02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:16.160]   Even when it doesn't matter, that matters. Not for what? I don't know. For the fun of it,
[02:15:16.160 --> 02:15:16.800]   that matters.
[02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:23.360]   Yeah, our ability to create meaning and beauty in the mundane, in the absurd, it's kinda cool.
[02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:23.860]   Yeah.
[02:15:23.860 --> 02:15:26.560]   And we share it with each other.
[02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:26.800]   Yeah.
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:28.080]   We get excited.
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:28.400]   Yeah.
[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:30.480]   And we create some pretty cool stuff along the way.
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:40.720]   I mean, I say I'm confident enough, and I might be arrogant of me to say, but I do believe
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:46.640]   that we're here to, each generation, have a small ascension.
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:47.780]   Yeah.
[02:15:47.780 --> 02:15:53.680]   Or else, what's it for?
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:57.840]   And we're not really sure what the ascension is towards. Just kinda--
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:15:59.120]   No? No?
[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:04.480]   I just think it's up. I do think it's up. I do think that
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:10.960]   it is definitely arrogant to think
[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:21.280]   that we as a species or generation or people or humanity are going to reach the top of the
[02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:30.560]   ascended staircase and go, "Ta-da!" I think that is not only false, but I think it's full-hearted,
[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:35.920]   and I think it's a recipe for having more angst and even cynicism we talked about,
[02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:40.320]   and unrest and lack of seeing beauty and joy in this life while we're in it.
[02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:45.520]   I think life's a verb.
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:54.640]   Live it as best we can. Hopefully. I mean, I don't know. Sometimes I'm just--I
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:58.160]   don't have a grand plan, man. I'm just trying to connect the damn dot.
[02:16:58.160 --> 02:17:04.320]   I'm confused, frustrated. I don't know what--I don't feel any gravity or building or
[02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:06.880]   lineage towards what I'm doing, and I'm just going--
[02:17:06.880 --> 02:17:13.760]   What's that Peterson line? "If you don't believe in heaven, do what you can to get
[02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:15.360]   as far away from hell as possible." Sometimes--
[02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:16.740]   Yeah.
[02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:20.880]   It's a great line. Sometimes I'm just trying to like, "Man, just don't sink the ship right now.
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:25.440]   Just keep your head above water. Maintain. Just try and hold on."
[02:17:25.440 --> 02:17:32.480]   And hopefully give yourself a chance to notice the magic, the mystical. I try to do that--
[02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:33.200]   Yeah.
[02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:34.000]   --when it gets rough.
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:38.000]   'Cause it's there. I do believe it's all around us all the time.
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:38.560]   Yeah.
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:42.720]   Just are we on a frequency, and do we allow ourselves to receive it and see it?
[02:17:42.720 --> 02:17:44.720]   We gotta tune the radio.
[02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:50.720]   Yeah. Because if we look for it too hard, we see false idols, and if we don't look at all,
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:52.400]   we become callous and miss it all.
[02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:55.760]   Yeah. It's a fun little life we got.
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:17:56.260]   Yeah.
[02:17:56.260 --> 02:18:03.840]   Matthew, I'm a huge fan. I think you're an incredible person. Thank you for all the--
[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:06.560]   everything you've created in this world. Thank you for being a unique
[02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:11.440]   human that inspires millions, and thank you for talking today.
[02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:14.800]   I was nervous, but you made me feel at home. That was beautiful.
[02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:19.760]   Well, I felt at home talking with you as well. Thanks for sharing that with me.
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:20.560]   I could go on and on.
[02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:21.600]   Just two Texans.
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:22.880]   That's right.
[02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:24.000]   Having a good old chat.
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.160]   Newly moved to Austin, Texas. Here we go.
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:27.280]   All right. Thank you, brother.
[02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:27.780]   Thank you.
[02:18:27.780 --> 02:18:33.200]   Thanks for listening to this conversation with Matthew McConaughey. To support this podcast,

[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:46.320]   Matthew McConaughey himself. "Don't walk into a place like you want to buy it. Walk in like you
[02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:51.360]   own it." Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.
[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:52.100]   [END]
