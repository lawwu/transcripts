[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:11.040]   So I don't know.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.400]   I mean, in there, maybe, you know, maybe there's another way.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.520]   I think it's denial, but it's not really denial because it's not like it didn't happen.
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.180]   That's an earlier example I was giving my mom.
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.440]   She will absolutely go.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.440]   That light's not on, Mom, the light's on.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.680]   That light's not on.
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:53.260]   I say it's not on. Sometimes you're just like, that makes no sense.
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:55.340]   You're just absolutely denying what just happened.
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.680]   We even have it recorded.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:56.680]   And she'll go, well, the recording's like, yeah.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:56.680]   I mean, that's part of a coping deal with her. But I mean, what I think is more important or more valuable is to talk about this. She didn't deny my dad dying. I didn't. But she sure as hell turned the page. Instead I can still start a whole new category, a new life, a new love. Let my heart love.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:56.680]   I think it's not on. Sometimes you're just like that makes no sense.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:26.680]  , and I think I mean, we were just thought that was beautiful. Yes, Mom, go. I dream like go. Now, if we're hung up going.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:34.780]   or
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:55.680]  , the the was to have
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:06.120]  ,
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.020]   you,
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:56.300]   and
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:56.460]   in the paradox. Yes. And the dance of it. I think the metaphor of red, yellow, green lights is just so simple and so powerful. You write about some green lights being engineered and some being mystical. I love the difference of that. What's the difference of the engineered green lights and the mystical? Such a cool word. Mystical. Yeah. Well, the engineered ones have reason and the mystical ones have rhyme. Yeah.
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:26.520]  obedient. And the mystical ones, though, don't make any sense. They're not supposed to make sense. They only make sense after, right when they happen, you backlog. And you connect the dots with how you got there. That red light you ran into that made you 30 seconds later to get to the restaurant. As you walked in, she walked out. And you went, "Good morning." And she went, "Good morning."
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:51.180]  obedient. And two months later, you're dating. Two years later, you're married. You're after that, got a family. And now you're sitting here four years later going, "I love you. Look at what we built." And you go back and go, "What?"
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:52.460]   I wouldn't hit that red light.
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:56.040]   Those 30 seconds made all the difference.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:56.380]   And
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:41:26.400]   and
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:26.400]   That's just rhyme.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:26.400]  , we can't really add that up.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:56.420]   You're not going to you. You're not going to do what you're doing.

[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:27.840]   We're in a time of crisis. All that is in there. The contradictions. You can even convince those models. You can tell them they're lying and they're going to start changing their mind. It's interesting to play with them. It's also interesting to consider that maybe they become smarter than us and become almost life forms that live among us and maybe one day we merge with them. There's all kinds of things that we can do.
[01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:57.860]  Miraculous.
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:57.860]   It's interesting to see how much of that is possible trajectory that we take here.
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:57.860]   How much of that excites you? How much of that scares you?
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:23.900]  obediently: I think AI can add to that. You can add friends that you can have great conversations with. And then some of those friends would be AI systems. They'll call you out in your bullshit in the most fascinating and interesting ways and challenge you and help you explore ideas together. So I'm excited by that.
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:27.880]   Is that different? And if so, how would you describe it?

[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:38.580]   The difference between being fake, I mean, he's a word and being real. Okay. Yeah. And the word authentic gets thrown around a lot. And, you know, I, I, and, and I don't mean I used to think each of the pillars way, but, but Bob Dylan loose me up on this idea a little bit. Do you think it was all about get to be your only one and only true self. That's it. Everything else is fake.
[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:38.580]   Yeah.
[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:38.580]   That's it. Everything else is fake.
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:14:08.600]   and then you hear Bob go, well, I mean, we are what we create ourselves to be. We are our own creations, which I'm like, Oh, yes, yes, we are. Thank you, Bob. Bobby. I'm all for bullshitter and bullshitting. I'm not as big a fan of the liars.
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:38.620]  , and lying. What's the distinction? You're talking about the art form of a liar. A liar's faking it, but not admitting to themselves that, yeah. Oh, yeah. Fucking creation. I'm faking it. A liar, I'm lying to your face right now, and I don't give you that hair of a wink out of my right eye that lets you know, hey, go with me here. I think there's value in the bullshitting. Now the lying becomes troublesome because one, I've duped you and I didn't let you know, I was
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:15:08.640]   come on. I was just telling the story about catching the fish. The fish always gets bigger every year we tell a story. Come on, go with it. All right? Yes. But the lying all of a sudden, I don't know my own. I don't know when I'm emanating something and creating something, telling the truth, being authentic or lying. And I'm, shit, all of a sudden I'm leaving crumbs with myself. That constitution gets blurry. Lying to yourself and to others. Yeah. Well, you start to lie. You lie to others enough. You start to lie to yourself.

[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:51.700]   didnt have to start a lot of it the first month after I feel guilty. I was like, I'm happy. Is it okay to have this much fun? I'm having so much fun. And I'm getting a great workout. And it's like, yes, it's okay. Congratulations. I found something that if you're finding quite pleasurable, for straight pleasure. You don't have to forget all this other stuff that yeah, but it's also getting a workout. We are getting that too. But don't just you don't
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:51.700]   have to get excused.
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:20:20.720]   the pleasure based on Oh, but it's good for you. And you're no, you damn it really do it because you're having so much damn fun at it. I had to admit that to let myself go. Damn, I'm going to play tennis again today, or tomorrow. It was a simple fun thing. So it's not always about the hardcore stuff that we have to go. This is a deep dark lie that I've been living by and having me live falsely and it's having harmful consequences.

[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:50.740]  , some of those will probably rise and we admit.
[01:20:50.780 --> 01:21:20.760]  , some of those will probably rise and we admit.
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:20.760]   That's a hard place to be. How do you call yourself? How do you admit that you've been living in a very difficult situation?
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:20.760]   It's a hard place to be. How do you call yourself? How do you admit that you've been living in a very difficult situation?

[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:50.540]   underway. And I was like, "Oh, man, that's a group of people walking by that maybe I'd like to impress. I mean, I'd do a few more than I'd do if I was on my own." I'm like, "You are vain, McConaughey." And the knee jerk is, "Oh, vanity bad." And I was like, all of a sudden, I became a bullshitter once I admitted it. And then I was like, "Well, bravo, vanity. Let's go, vanity. Instead of putting it in the cupboard, in the live section,
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:50.540]   I'm gonna go and do it."
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:50.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:23:20.560]   I'm like, "Oh, I'm not in the vein, because that's a debit." No. Admit it. And then go, "What's the value in it?" Well, I look at, yeah, I've actually gotten better shape because of my vanity. Actually, I eat better. I look better and I have more, and that led to being a better husband, better dad, doing something with my kids when I'd rather be over there writing the work I'm working on. But I know that tomorrow,
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:20.560]   I'm not in the vein, because that's a debit. No. Admit it. And then go, "What's the value in it?" Well, I look at, yeah, I've actually gotten better shape because of my vanity. Actually, I eat better and I have more, and that led to being a better husband, better dad, doing something with my kids when I'd rather be over there writing the work I'm working on. But I know that tomorrow,
[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:50.580]  , when they leave town, they're going to remember this time that we had together. That's a selfish act to go spend that time with my kids, even though I'd rather not be doing it at that time. I'd rather be doing something for myself. Because when they leave tomorrow, they'll have this great memory that they spent with their dad right where they went. I could call that vanity. I could group that and say, "That's very vain of you. That is for self. Yeah. So, that's a great thing.
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:55.620]   Because it was also for something and someone that I cared about.
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:24:02.800]   Are there people in your life that call you on your bullshit in the bad sense of the word bullshit?
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:09.380]   Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes it's either, I got a pretty thick threshold for how far I can go with my bullshit.
[01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:16.340]   Like what bruise, what tickles me might bruise others to watch it.
[01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:19.980]   That's a good line.
[01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:20.460]   Yeah.
[01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:20.460]   Yeah.

[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:20.400]   Nik
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:36.500]  ,,, didn

[01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:34.740]   It's a little bit of like, okay, if the law ain't handling this, I am. Yeah. And then it is. The law is not going to handle this. Therefore, I am.
[01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:34.740]   It's you've missed something earlier. I remember where it was in conversation. It's a little bit of like, okay, if the law ain't handling this, I am. Yeah. And then it is. The law is not going to handle this. Therefore, I am. And then it is. The law is not going to handle this. Therefore, I am.
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:02.800]   It's a little bit of like, okay, if the law ain't handling this, I am. Yeah. And then it is. The law is not going to handle this. Therefore, I am. Yeah. And then it is. I am handling this.
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:02.800]   There's a honesty to that. It just seems, of course, it's dangerous because it's a slippery slope. Because of the power in that power corrupts, it can be a slippery slope where you completely disregard the law and you can hurt a lot of people. But when done right, you know, you're not going to be able to do anything.
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:32.000]   and human about that protect family protect land above all else. Yeah. But I, you know. This is a broader question, but I'm going to piggyback it off this.

[01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:06.180]   I think we need to admit that.
[01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:12.180]   I think probably the cowboy ethos is a step towards admitting that.
[01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:18.180]   And that's why it's so appealing to people.
[01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:24.180]   It kind of wakes them up to realize that we are, we're not so far from our ancestors.
[01:47:28.420 --> 01:47:56.420]   and I think we need to admit that.
[01:47:56.420 --> 01:47:56.420]   And that's why it's so appealing to people.
[01:47:56.420 --> 01:47:56.420]   And that's why it's so appealing to people.
