[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360]   The following is a conversation with Ye,
[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.020]   the legendary artist, producer, and designer
[00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.520]   formerly known as Kanye West.
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.260]   On this, the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.180]   - Based off of our connection and just you being a friend,
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.560]   I need to show you my two tech companies
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.680]   and get your perspective on it.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.540]   'Cause now I have friends that can give a perspective.
[00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.160]   Like when I would work on albums,
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.060]   I had other friends that worked on albums
[00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.680]   and they would give me their perspectives on it.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.120]   You wanna do this?
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.960]   - We are doing it.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.800]   This is part of it.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.620]   - This is part of it?
[00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:33.460]   - Absolutely.
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.300]   - All right, beautiful.
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.740]   - Oh, well, I wanted to finish.
[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.220]   The thing is, okay, you're gonna ask me different questions,
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.660]   but I'm about growing and building
[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.020]   and bringing the idea to life.
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.700]   So when I see you, I say,
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.020]   oh, this guy understands how to hire engineers.
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.620]   Where I'm coming from, coming from Hollywood,
[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.920]   coming from press, coming from media,
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.300]   all of the guys that,
[00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.540]   so many of the guys that have been like voices and faces
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.340]   and talking heads, whatever,
[00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.860]   have not understood how to engineer product.
[00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.140]   And that's the reason why I was able to jump past
[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.520]   everyone in the entertainment field and become,
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.980]   whatever the net worth is, 11 billion.
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.020]   I'm gonna stop putting the whole black thing on my worth.
[00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.480]   Like, let's just see where I am on the scale of life,
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.540]   because that's a cop-out for me to say,
[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.740]   Rich is a black guy of all time,
[00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.580]   because that's feeding into the same trauma economy
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.700]   that Black Lives Matter feeds into.
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.460]   That's why I love and respect engineers.
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.780]   That's the only thing that we really need to teach
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.540]   in school is engineering.
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.700]   We don't need to teach history.
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.420]   We don't need to teach anything that is subjective.
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.380]   It needs to only be engineering taught in school,
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.860]   and everything else needs to be recess.
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.960]   Nothing at all, any force subjective information
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.960]   is just to weaken and indoctrinate our species.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.760]   And that's what schools do now.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.940]   - As an engineer, I love hearing you say that,
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.520]   but to push back, history is not,
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.440]   the interpretation of history might be subjective,
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.320]   but history has some facts,
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.760]   and they're useful to give a grounding
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.060]   to the way you do engineering.
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.400]   - I don't 100% believe in anything,
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.220]   any concept of the future or any concept of history,
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.920]   because history was just written by the victors.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.760]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.720]   - So if I see stuff happen on the day
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.240]   that later that day is reported wrong,
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.780]   so how wrong is something reported 1,000 years ago?
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.020]   And why would we argue about something
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.200]   that's not in the now?
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.400]   Because that's the only thing that everyone can agree upon
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.200]   is that it is now, right now.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.480]   - Yeah, well, you're trying not to make
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.280]   the mistakes of the past.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.040]   That's the usefulness of history,
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.360]   the limited usefulness of history.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.040]   - The biggest mistake from the past
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.440]   that we keep making is looking at the past.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.080]   - Too much, giving too much value to the past.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.480]   - Too much value to the past, we are now.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.320]   We are now, we are here, we are one species,
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.760]   we are one race, we're here,
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.600]   and it's time, and the leadership is changing,
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.320]   because you have Elon as a leader,
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.120]   Ye as a leader, and we are the top leaders.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.720]   We're more influential than the presidents.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.960]   - So you're a human being
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.400]   with engineering challenges before you,
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.640]   with a stem player, with parlor.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.040]   What's the hardest thing in front of you
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.960]   on the engineering front?
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.600]   - That's the first sentence that any of our species
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.960]   needs to hear when they're born.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.560]   You are a human being with engineering challenges,
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.160]   and I consider challenges to be opportunities
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.280]   in front of you.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.800]   Literally, like, let me see a piece of paper,
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.760]   I need to write that down.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.240]   That's the beginning of our new species constitution.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.000]   I'm gonna do the paper like this wide.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.160]   I'm gonna put it in widescreen.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.720]   This is for Ridley.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:01.760]   You are, no, let me like,
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.560]   you are a being with engineering challenges.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.560]   Being with engineering.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:25.520]   - Opportunities or challenges?
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.080]   - Opportunities.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.760]   I'm sorry, I don't spell as good as John Legend.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.680]   Opportunities in before you.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:45.160]   I like the before 'cause it can mean,
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.880]   actually can mean forward or before you.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.800]   This right here, I've always said I'm the top five writer
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.200]   in human existence, but this is like,
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.280]   this right here is pushing me to like number four
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.120]   or number three.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.960]   - It's a good one.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.160]   - Because who would you say is the top,
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.800]   it's top writer in human existence,
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.640]   we know who it is.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.480]   - It's subjective.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.320]   Who's that?
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.140]   - It's factual though.
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.760]   It's like, okay, who's the top person in tech history?
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.800]   It's not subjective.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.680]   - Wow.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.280]   - There's a non-subjective answer to both of those.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.280]   Both of those people have influenced 30% of our existence.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.680]   - So the influence is the main metric of greatness.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.160]   - Okay, one person, 30% of our language was,
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.600]   the English language was written by them.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.920]   The other person, 30% of the products we use
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.760]   was led by them.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.600]   So it's obvious.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.520]   - 30% of our language was written by, oh, Shakespeare.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.360]   - And it was--
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.080]   - And then the product, product, product, product.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.640]   - Look, look.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.480]   - Steve Jobs.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.320]   - Yeah.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.200]   - You put Steve above like Elon's of the world?
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.360]   'Cause Steve is a designer, not,
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.440]   he's a designer and engineer, but he's a design,
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.860]   he's a visionary in the design space.
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.720]   - Well, I would lean to him
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.120]   because I'm not an engineer, right?
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.960]   So I'm more like--
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.840]   - But then you're an engineer.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.280]   If Steve is an engineer, you're an engineer.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.280]   - Essentially.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.960]   - He's a cultural engineer.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.760]   Like the people who run the emotions of the world
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.040]   and run the world off of people's emotions right now
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.000]   are social engineers.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.640]   And social engineering is so important,
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.760]   like city design.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.360]   There's a fancier word for that.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.200]   But I was in Oxnard last night to see Anthony Jeselnik,
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.640]   and I gotta find out what his opening joke was
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.120]   because I'm doing interviews and I'm thinking I'm funny.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.840]   And I like that he said,
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.520]   he just kept on saying 20 year anniversary,
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.480]   I've been doing this for 20 years.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.360]   And his opening joke was so high level,
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.500]   I realized that I wasn't funny.
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.280]   I realized that this dude is a professional at what he does.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.660]   And so many things are subjective.
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.620]   I always talk about this.
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.720]   It's like, you know, people are arguing like,
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.980]   is Emily Ratajkowski the hottest person?
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.980]   And I'm like, that's such a subjective thing.
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.260]   But like, if you go and shoot three pointers
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.800]   with Steph Curry, it's not subjective, right?
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.560]   Or if you go and compare bank accounts with Elon,
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.940]   it's not subjective.
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.920]   And another thing that's not subjective, porn.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.640]   - What about it?
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.720]   - Dick size, it's not subjective.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.560]   You can measure.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:29.700]   But porn is more about, more than just dick size
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.340]   and greatness is more than the size
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.760]   of the bank account, right?
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.100]   So there's a subjective--
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.940]   - But greatness is subjective though.
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.260]   - Right, so do you care about the stuff
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.300]   that's objective or subjective more?
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.140]   Because greatness to me is what matters.
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.100]   The bank account comes and goes.
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.160]   The impact on our society, like you said,
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.100]   social engineering, the impact on the collective
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.660]   intelligence of our species, that what permeates
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.140]   throughout the rest of time.
[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.020]   - I like what you said, the impact.
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:06.460]   I'm taking notes.
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.420]   How did you, what'd you say?
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.260]   The impact--
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.420]   - On the collective intelligence of our species.
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:15.420]   - Impact on the collective intelligence.
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.200]   - When Ye is writing down the words
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.720]   that came out of my dumb mouth, I have made it in life.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.940]   - There's a lot of people that have kind of like
[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.680]   sat through, I wanted to wear a different color hoodie
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.880]   'cause I was just tired of seeing this hoodie
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.000]   in all the interviews.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.720]   And there's a lot of kids that are with me,
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.300]   they see what I'm saying.
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.240]   And they had to sit through all of the muck
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.140]   of all the previous interviews to get to this.
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:55.140]   Every interview has been just an emotional,
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:00.600]   it's just like been an argument up to this point.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:05.600]   This is the first of, this is the next frontier
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.640]   of where our species is gonna head.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.120]   It starts here, it starts with you, Lex.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.040]   - So this is the first time I heard you
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.720]   say the word engineering at least so many times,
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.120]   which I love hearing.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.880]   So this is where you're at.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.280]   You're like that newborn, you're a being
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.960]   with engineering opportunities.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.840]   - Yeah, and we're all a newborn,
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.400]   'cause in Christianity we say born again.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.080]   We're all newborns and everyone can,
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.240]   everyone shall, I don't like the word can.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.640]   Shall, the only thing about shall is like,
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.880]   it kind of dictates and can kind of lets people off the hook.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.880]   So I haven't found the perfect post Shakespeare
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.160]   and post Steve Jobs and post Elon and post Ye
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.320]   and post Drake way to communicate this.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:00.280]   But we update and we do.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.120]   And what the current media structure,
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.840]   no, it's not actually nothing that's holding us,
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.280]   there's nothing actually holding us back
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.600]   because I'm still alive.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.880]   I'm still alive.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.760]   Like they could have killed me at,
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.840]   George Bush don't care about black people.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.840]   They could have killed me at,
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.520]   Beyonce had the best video, but we're here now.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.320]   So we just keep on leaning and leaning and leaning
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.880]   and there's these things where I just think about,
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.520]   there'll be times when I'm at war
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:34.720]   and every now and then when the bomb stopped going off
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.080]   and all the headlines and the smearing
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.080]   and all that stopped going off,
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.880]   I think about my family and I'll think about Kim
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.480]   and I'll think about how King Koopa
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.720]   has her in the castle right now.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.600]   And just on Mario Brothers, you know how it is,
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.040]   just go for the princess and you get to this level
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.200]   and it's like, I sung the song wrong, right?
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.560]   And then they take the princess again.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.160]   - Which one are you, Mario?
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.000]   - Yeah.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.680]   - What's your favorite thing,
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.560]   the thing you love the most about Kim
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.320]   from a Mario perspective and the princess?
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.680]   Looking back, was there a moment--
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.800]   - She's definitely my favorite of all time.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.800]   - Yeah, was there a moment that catches you off guard
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.680]   and you say, I love this human being?
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:40.720]   - Yeah, I mean, it's just the DNA is so different
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.480]   and the DNA is like, she's a mix of Rob and Chris.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.080]   - Can you explain?
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.760]   - I mean, that's like a really high pool right there.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.320]   Those are like two geniuses.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:03.360]   - So, okay, so like the entire history of evolution
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.400]   of the human species created this DNA
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.280]   that created this being, there's a life there,
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.920]   there's a set of memories in the history
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.880]   that brought you together and you're like,
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.960]   damn, I like this DNA.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.800]   - Yeah, certain people have just like high DNA.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.440]   Ivanka Trump has high DNA.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.040]   - How's your DNA, pretty good?
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.080]   - I think we've seen that, it's been proven.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.160]   I mean, but look at my mom and look at my dad.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.440]   Me and my dad have a water purification center
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.120]   in the DR right now.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.720]   And my dad is the original Steve Jobs
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.360]   and he was blocked by people around him
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.600]   and people were using him and taking advantage
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.960]   and not believing in his vision.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.120]   My dad's the educated version of Ye.
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.720]   - What'd you learn about life from your dad?
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.120]   - And my dad got girls too.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.680]   - But those are small details.
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.080]   - That's a big detail being that I found my dad's playboy
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.440]   when I was five years old,
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.160]   it greatly affected my motivation.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.240]   - Yeah, all right, so that's part of the engine
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.400]   that drives Ye.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.720]   - Absolutely, I remember when Pharrell
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:19.720]   was first in all the videos and my girl was like,
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.960]   girls like Pharrell and I was like,
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.880]   I want girls to like me too.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:28.320]   - Funny that that's behind all the ambition, all the drive.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.560]   - It's how we make people, it's how people are made.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.960]   - It's the desire to be loved.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.040]   Is that at the individual level just being noticed
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.440]   and also at the societal level of scale?
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.440]   - Well now, I've gone past, I'm like at that place
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:52.200]   where Nikolai Tesla was later into his career
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.840]   where it wasn't about being loved,
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.600]   it wasn't about sitting at the dinner parties
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.400]   next to Anna Wintour and stuff,
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.480]   it was about getting the idea across.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.480]   So I have these cells that are very,
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.480]   and I just keep on saying Ridley Scott,
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.040]   but Ridley Scott has a special anointing,
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.700]   it isn't just sci-fi what he's doing,
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.240]   there's something in there, just like George Lucas,
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.040]   there's something different that's there.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.040]   So-- - What are you drawing?
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.420]   - I'm drawing these new living cells that we will exist in.
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:41.960]   And this is over, okay, let's do like,
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:46.380]   I don't like talking about money
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.240]   because man made money up anyway,
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.280]   it's like four quadrillion respected dollars
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.680]   and then you have other forms of currency.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.360]   Of course, social currency is super important right now,
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:03.360]   but this is a drawing and it's at a pretty good place now.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.520]   This will be 40,000 square feet,
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.040]   I wanna start just talking in meters,
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.200]   I just think we should go to anything
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.520]   to restore the Tower of Basel, like they said when the,
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:21.000]   I'm just drawing a person here for scale.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   - Yeah, that would help.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.760]   - Okay, what do you think of that?
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.240]   Look at my person, see the scale?
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.800]   In this room?
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.720]   All right, so-- - Wait, the dot is the person?
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:38.080]   - Yeah, I'm saying it's 40,000 square feet,
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.880]   but that would be like-- - What are the other parts
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.400]   of the cell?
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.520]   - Okay, so it's a screen, it doesn't go all the way
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.640]   to the top and it's one hole for light,
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.480]   but the water and the light and air all come in from the top
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:55.480]   so that's like the mouth and then this is the belly button.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.800]   We're God's iPhone, we're his greatest creation.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.640]   - So this is all connected, these are all connected?
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.360]   - Yeah, so I'm drawing how these other cells
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.360]   go next to each other.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.600]   - What's the vision here?
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.480]   - Happiness, then we talk about what's the motivation,
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.120]   like yeah, there's a motivation somewhere
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:19.120]   in the back of my mind of my family
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:24.320]   and if it's like where Moses smithed the rock
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:29.320]   and God didn't allow him to get to the promised land
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.400]   because the promised land is family,
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.240]   that is the promised land, that is earth,
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.440]   I mean that is heaven on earth, is family.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.840]   Family is heaven, that's the promised land
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.140]   and for your family to be together.
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:47.320]   So say I smithed the rock and God doesn't let me
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.760]   have my family back, my mission in life is still
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:56.760]   to promote families at all costs
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.880]   and make families existence easier.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.380]   So you take this thing, you put a localized farm,
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.660]   say if it's in a community, that we do localized growing
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:12.200]   and then we partner with big farmer and say,
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.000]   hey, you're actually gonna make more money
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   by making better food 'cause at the end of the day,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.440]   you want money right now, it's like everyone knows
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.520]   that between the pesticides and between the medical industry
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.920]   and especially America that we're keeping people sick
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.020]   and we know that McDonald's makes food that kills people
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.680]   and Coca-Cola's selling sugar water and all this,
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:37.080]   just in case I haven't pissed off enough people in power.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.680]   - Yeah. - Okay, so.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.960]   - You're gonna piss off the sugar,
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.840]   anybody that's powered on sugar.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.880]   - Sugar, well sugar, what's the health
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.520]   was actually a documentary on sugar.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.120]   It wasn't about how bad meat was,
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.560]   it was like a reverse documentary on sugar.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.200]   A reverse, I don't know if you call it a reverse,
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.980]   like a sub, but if you watch it again,
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.240]   when they show sugar in it, it's just,
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.660]   the sugar looks super clean.
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:06.700]   - Yeah, it's just like-- - So as I state these things,
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.640]   I know that, I know I have protection.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:13.240]   I have God's protection, that's why I'm here
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.280]   to this date, right?
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.960]   So it's for me to have this platform
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.480]   and express exactly what I feel
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.920]   because it's kids out there, right?
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:26.760]   That it's kids that are gonna save the world
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.300]   through engineering and through facts.
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:34.300]   And I've gotta get, download as much of the information
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:39.220]   and as much of the, don't be afraid to state your facts,
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.200]   is the biggest thing because the world
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.400]   is being ran by fear and that is,
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.760]   no, actually God runs the world,
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.360]   but there's just like little cloud,
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:51.840]   this patina of our ego that deals with the money
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.880]   and the car and the girl we're dating
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.160]   and all this and the clothes you wear
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.480]   and spending too much on clothes
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.600]   and a lot of stuff that I've been involved with promoting.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.380]   So now what I'm promoting is,
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.200]   you have the idea, you say it out loud,
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:06.360]   like if you had Tourette's, say your truth out loud.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.760]   If you hate, yay, you hate me, say that out loud.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.240]   Say whatever you feel out loud.
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.840]   Like you say it non-violently, non-violent,
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.800]   non-violent, I have to say that like as,
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.520]   as a shout out to Alex Jones and Trump,
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.120]   where they try to say that when they say their truths
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.520]   out loud, that it's inciting violence.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.800]   So let's be like really clear.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.080]   I'm saying that they have criminalized free thought.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.680]   I hate when people use they,
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.440]   like they gets the blame for everything, right?
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.560]   It's always they.
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.480]   Who the fuck is they, exactly?
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.600]   - The problem is they is us.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.160]   - Yeah, well, I love that.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.920]   What we needed to do is turn I to we.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.640]   So we take the responsibility and turn they to us.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.540]   So we take accountability to us.
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:02.760]   They, I to we, and they to us.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.320]   And that relates, it's a language at the same time.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.520]   You're seeing the language of our surroundings.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.640]   You're seeing the language of,
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.640]   one of the things, okay,
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.120]   let's go back to the cell explanation,
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.520]   because I'm also doing a,
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.120]   what's that thing when Elon just put all the information
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.400]   in the open and people could figure out,
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.520]   they could figure it out and open source.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.360]   - Yeah, open source.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.240]   - So I'm open sourcing this idea right now,
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:32.240]   so that engineers and anointed people,
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:37.700]   beings, anointed beings can collectively contribute
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.160]   to this, to push our species forward.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:45.520]   So where I've got to with my research
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.200]   is that there will be a hole at the top
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.720]   that allows natural light, natural air,
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.800]   and there's a constant water system,
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.840]   so it becomes like a water city,
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.600]   where it's a constant flow that's not,
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.580]   it's regenerative, it's not wasting the water,
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.240]   and it's just a constant flow.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.580]   So I put the toilet really close to where this,
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.080]   I don't want to call it a wave pool,
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.160]   but in the pool, the water is not still.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.960]   - So that exists in water, surrounded by water.
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.520]   - Well, the living room is, you have two rooms.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.760]   You have the dry room,
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.320]   which people have called a living room before,
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.200]   and then you have the wet room.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.640]   - How is that a source of happiness?
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.480]   What is broken about our world today
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.400]   that that gives you in terms of the pursuit of happiness,
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.760]   which is one of the things--
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:41.760]   - Well, all of our buildings--
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.200]   - In the previous declaration of independence.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.880]   - All of our buildings are based on just
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.800]   the industry and the economy,
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.640]   and then people lean into what people are used to seeing,
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:57.840]   like what we think is attractive,
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:02.840]   'cause then you go back to the women who give life.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:08.360]   So everyone wants to be attractive
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.560]   to the attractive,
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:16.560]   and that's the reason why the media goes and gets
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:22.240]   Bella Hadid, Kim Kardashian, Emily Ratajkowski.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:29.720]   Those are the only ones I'm gonna--
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.800]   - There's more?
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.720]   - There's more, but I'm thinking of ones
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.440]   that I think are attractive.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.600]   - It is subjective.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.560]   - Yeah, 'cause it's subjective.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.840]   So to my subjective, which I think
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.440]   the only guys that could argue with me
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:49.600]   on my opinion on girls would be Brad and Leo,
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.560]   because we're the only ones with the track record.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.080]   Everything else, so for everybody else, it's subjective.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:55.960]   We've got history.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:00.080]   - Are you happy?
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.240]   - Absolutely, I'm just here.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.800]   It's actually,
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:10.120]   it's difficult to make me unhappy.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:15.880]   Now I could deal with frustrations,
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.920]   but when those frustrations are, it's like
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.600]   when you've allowed people to be in your life
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.880]   that shouldn't be there,
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.280]   and then they do the thing you knew they were gonna do,
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.400]   and you're screaming at them,
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.520]   but you really need to scream at yourself.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:37.080]   - Yeah, so you realize anything that's anger or frustration,
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.720]   that's something that's wrong with you
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.120]   that needs to be dealt with.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.120]   - Yes, like right now, okay,
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.680]   say I got this pattern cutter that I wanted
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:51.160]   to remove because I felt like she was
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.400]   copying our patterns into the computer,
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.120]   and I didn't know why she wanted to do that,
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.080]   and I just wanted to do the patterns by hand,
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.120]   and then--
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.560]   - You mean like automating the patterns?
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.640]   Is that what you mean? - Yeah.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.800]   And my head of it, because they just,
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:05.640]   that's the whole thing.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:10.640]   It's like, it's a war of human beings and robots.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.280]   - Yeah, but that makes it more efficient, right?
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.440]   You don't like the efficiency.
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.800]   You like the creativity of the singular nature
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.800]   of the pattern.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.600]   - I believe that the human beings,
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.920]   and I'm saying this to you as a person who makes robots
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.000]   and a person who's friends with Elon--
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.360]   - I'm deeply offended right now.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.320]   - Yeah.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.960]   - But I'll let it go.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:28.800]   - Okay. - It's good.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.600]   - So yeah, I believe that the--
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.000]   - EA hates robots.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.280]   I'm not gonna put that out there.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.400]   It's a joke.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.520]   - Robots have feelings too.
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.000]   - Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.880]   - That was also a joke.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.600]   - We need to clarify that for future robots.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.840]   But the pattern cutter, the pattern cutter,
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.680]   you don't like that.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.580]   That had to be, you can't have that part of your life.
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:54.480]   - That's not what I'm, my,
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.680]   everything that I'm doing is for
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:03.680]   the sake of the human race.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:08.280]   There's things in capitalism,
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.280]   there's things in technology.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:16.280]   Well, technology and original human species
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:21.440]   can exist in a peaceful way.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.400]   As long as the people that know how to make robots
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.200]   aren't using their robots to control the humans.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.240]   Lex?
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.080]   - Definitely something you have to be concerned about
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.480]   as we become more technologically savvy.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:39.920]   That, my friend, is why engineering isn't everything,
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:44.200]   that you have to desperately study the lessons of history.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:49.200]   In Nazi Germany, science was used to create atrocities.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.840]   Engineering, the same.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.440]   Engineering could be a tool of war.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.800]   - We're still in the Holocaust.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.440]   A Jewish friend of mine said,
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:05.800]   come go visit the Holocaust Museum.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.040]   And my response was,
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.720]   let's visit our Holocaust Museum, Planned Parenthood.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:15.240]   - With all due respect, I grew up in the Soviet Union.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.280]   I'm Jewish.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:22.720]   Parts of my family perished in the Holocaust
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.560]   of Nazi Germany.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.360]   I have to push back that there is a difference
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:32.400]   of the atrocities at that scale, at that time,
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.240]   on an entire people.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.680]   - I was gonna say the number, that's the difference.
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.800]   - It's not the number.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.680]   - Because six million, well, also,
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.080]   African Americans are actually Jew also.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:43.920]   The lost tribe of Israel.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.360]   - I can push back on that too.
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.680]   - Okay, so, well, everyone came from Africa.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.840]   - I am African.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.720]   I'm basically African American.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.560]   We're brothers.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.440]   - And we're both Jew.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.880]   - And we're brothers.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.400]   So-- - We're human.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.560]   - Six million people died in the Holocaust.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.800]   Over 20 million have died by the hands of abortion.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:06.440]   And the media promotes the My Body, My Choice,
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:11.040]   which is actually still a promotion for Planned Parenthood.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:16.040]   50% of black deaths a year is actually abortion.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.240]   It's not the cop with the knee.
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.520]   It's not black on black violence and gang violence.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.600]   It's not heart attacks.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.800]   It's actually abortion.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:28.320]   The most dangerous place for a black person in America
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.800]   is in their mother's stomach.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:34.440]   - There's 900 to a million abortions
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.680]   in the United States a year.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.520]   I hear you.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:43.000]   But there's something about the rape, the torture,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.040]   the murder of children, women, men,
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.240]   the complete humiliation and just the suffering
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.480]   that was endured during World War II.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.120]   - That's what we deal with on our TVs.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.200]   Right now with black people.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:03.200]   Soros would use black trauma economy to win an election.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:08.240]   What I love is having a healthy conversation.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.720]   And as opposed to, there's certain things,
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.480]   you know, boom, this drops,
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.880]   people are gonna have pussy hats on.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:16.120]   Boom, this drops, it's gonna be black people
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.480]   and white people with signs.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.520]   Boom, this drops.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:23.000]   So hey, China, hey, left agenda, hey,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.880]   what we're gonna do is say that our species
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.480]   can have a healthy conversation.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.320]   - Can I just linger on this?
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.200]   Because when you say Jewish media,
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:37.400]   there's a echo of a pain that people feel
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.240]   that reminds an entire--
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.520]   - You're saying it's redundant, right?
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.240]   - No, I'm not saying it's redundant.
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.360]   I'm saying-- - I'm saying it's redundant.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:45.840]   - You're saying it's redundant.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.680]   - It's a redundant statement.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.880]   - I'm saying it's something that--
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.680]   - I'm saying that it's something that Joseph Goebbels,
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.880]   the propaganda minister of Nazi Germany said.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.680]   I'm saying it's been said so many times
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:01.680]   in order to murder and torture Jewish people
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.720]   that it just rings wrong.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.680]   - And that's the thing-- - Just like the N word
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:12.240]   when spoken by people that have the same skin color as me,
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.960]   it reminds people of a very dark time.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.440]   - I know, if Jewish people would accept that I'm Jew,
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.080]   then they would see what I'm saying in a different way.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.280]   They would hear it in a different way.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.680]   - But see, the people, you saying you're Jewish, that--
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.120]   - No, I'm Jew, not Jewish.
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.520]   Jewish means like that of a Jew.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.760]   I'm saying I'm Jew.
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.600]   - You're Jew.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.680]   - Blood of Christ, Orthodox Christian.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:38.680]   - Right, but are you a follower of the philosophy
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:44.400]   of the black Hebrew Israelites?
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.720]   'Cause that's where the idea comes from.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.460]   Not all of those folks are extremists,
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.040]   but some are extremists.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.080]   - I'm a follower of the idea,
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:30:00.080]   I have a vague idea that all people came from Africa.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.960]   But what I wanted to do, okay,
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:08.080]   now I could Andy Kaufman this about seven more minutes
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.600]   and then tell you what it is, what the whole point is.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.240]   - Let's count, seven minutes.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.200]   - No, I did this to do a spoiler alert.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.440]   - Sure, spoiler.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.880]   - What's the first thing I said at the beginning?
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:23.560]   - We're talking about engineering and humans.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.800]   We're all human.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.280]   - And then what did I say we shouldn't focus on?
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.200]   - Race.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.040]   - Not just that.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.760]   I said they shouldn't teach this in school.
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:33.600]   - History.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.480]   - The history, because what they do,
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:41.060]   what schools are doing is exactly what the CIA does
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:43.800]   with Pixar films and Disney films.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.400]   They make Bambi's mom die in the beginning, right?
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:52.400]   And off that pain comes a purchase of ice cream.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.440]   Off that pain comes, I need some more toys.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.480]   Off that pain comes, I need a bigger house.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.440]   Off that pain comes, I need more girls than my wife.
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:05.440]   Off that pain comes, so they put that pain in to make us,
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.600]   now we're the orphans of capitalism,
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:12.780]   to make us be consumers and we need to be a community,
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.500]   not just consumers.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.500]   So I could have went another seven minutes
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:22.080]   by being a person who presents himself in a way that says,
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.220]   well, I don't have to feel your pain
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:27.040]   because I also have pain too that's not being recognized.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.040]   And in every interview, when I say,
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.260]   well, why did I get to the point of putting up the tweet?
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:36.420]   No one wants to understand why I got to that point, right?
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.400]   - You had pain, you had pain.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.240]   - Yeah, but no one--
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.080]   - Pain in your heart.
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:43.420]   - But let's say this, undoubtedly Jewish people
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:48.420]   have a lot of movies about that pain
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:51.460]   and black people have a lot of movies
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.820]   about the pain of slavery, right?
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:59.720]   It's almost impossible to find a movie about Mansa Munsa.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.560]   When you go to the African History Museum in Washington, DC,
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:08.560]   it doesn't start with the idea of Africans being kings.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:13.260]   It starts with the idea of Africans being slaves.
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:16.280]   But here's another interesting point about this.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.220]   This was said to me one time and it stuck with me
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.580]   as a family member of mine.
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:24.380]   With Africans, how many times you've heard like a rapper
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:27.220]   talk about we were kings?
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:32.280]   That's incorrect if we're Jew.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:38.280]   If we're Jew, and since we are, we weren't the kings.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.560]   We were the slaves that Moses freed.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:45.340]   Africans have always said, we've heard,
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.220]   you've listened to rap music and hear black people say,
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:50.040]   we kings, we blood of the pharaohs.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:56.200]   And if we are Jew, then we weren't.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.080]   We were the people that Moses freed.
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.640]   And when we talk about, have you heard black people
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.260]   talk about 400 years of slavery?
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:10.080]   All right, that is, and we're having this history lesson.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.660]   - I thought history doesn't matter.
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.160]   You're exploring ancient history
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.620]   and drawing deep wisdom from it.
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:20.160]   And at the same time saying we need to forget all of it.
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.920]   We need to put that behind us.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:22.740]   - Absolutely.
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:26.320]   We need to forget it and we need to move forward.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.460]   - There's so much wisdom to draw from history.
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.280]   Even the 20th century.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.980]   Look at this, communism.
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:37.520]   Without the lessons of history of the 20th century,
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.120]   communism sounds like a great idea.
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:43.600]   Except that some of the worst atrocities
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.920]   conducted by Stalin and Mao that killed
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:51.560]   50, 100 plus million people, not just killed,
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:55.320]   tortured, starvation, where people, cannibalism,
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.080]   they ate each other, they ate their children.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:03.080]   There's just dark, people should read some books on this,
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.800]   on the Holland and more, it's in the 1930s.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:06.640]   - But I disagree.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.800]   - With that lesson, we would, and now it's becoming
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.560]   more popular, Marxism and communism.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.800]   - I'm not disagreeing that that happened.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:18.160]   I'm disagreeing that we need to harp
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:21.000]   on the things that happened because the truth is,
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   I'm giving a fact, 50% today of,
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.680]   let's say, you don't call black people Jew, right?
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:34.680]   Black people's deaths today is abortion, today, right now.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:40.600]   Like that, it's not racism, that's too wide of a term.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.980]   It's genocide and population control
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:48.600]   that black people are in today in America
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:52.700]   that is promoted by the music and the media
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:56.400]   that black people make that Jewish record labels
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.640]   get paid off of, or media companies.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.920]   Record label's a media company also,
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.920]   so let's give it a wider--
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.680]   - I agree with Martin Luther King.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.000]   I have a dream, too.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.560]   - Martin Luther King-- - That one day,
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:11.800]   you would not be judged by the color of your skin
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:15.000]   or your race, black or Jew,
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.640]   but by the content of your character.
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.840]   All the assholes that fucked you over in the music industry,
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:24.560]   fuck artists over in the music industry, are individuals.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.160]   They're not Jews.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:29.200]   - Can you-- - They are Jewish.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:33.560]   - It doesn't, they're human with opportunities,
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.480]   and they took those opportunities.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.400]   I don't care if they're Jewish or Jew--
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.360]   - Do you feel like I should release that pain
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.280]   and separate it?
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.400]   - Yes.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.000]   - Okay, so if that, okay.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.440]   So if you're saying I should release that pain
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.240]   and separate it, then I'm telling you,
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:52.080]   you should release your pain and separate it,
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.880]   and we could get to this, the list
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:59.160]   of how you are being with engineering opportunities.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.360]   - That's 100%, I see what you're doing,
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.800]   that's exactly what you're doing.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.480]   The pain, I'm gonna let it go.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.720]   Engineering challenges, I get it.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.320]   One of the problems you highlight
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:13.040]   is people get fucked over in the music industry
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.080]   and get fucked over in the media,
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:17.040]   get fucked over all over the place.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:21.520]   - They created, there was a Jewish trainer
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.800]   that brought me to the hospital and put in press
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:25.960]   that I went to the hospital.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.000]   I know friends that, off of exhaustion,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.320]   a Jewish doctor that diagnosed me--
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.520]   - Why do you keep saying Jewish?
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.480]   - Because they were, right?
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:37.080]   Diagnosed me with bipolar disorder
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:40.240]   and shot me with medication and put me on medication,
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.000]   then put it in the press, and every time,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.200]   even if I wore the wrong color hat
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:48.720]   that a nigger is not supposed to wear, right?
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.160]   Then they immediately say, he's off of his shit,
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.400]   he's off his meds, he's off his rocker,
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.240]   and it's literally used as a scarlet letter
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:00.840]   control mechanism for the, people understand.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:04.000]   The kids, the colleges, the high schools,
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.640]   what do you think they put me right now?
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:10.920]   They put me as the prophet, not the leader.
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.280]   It doesn't have to be the leader, right?
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:16.360]   'Cause we need a more intelligent person to be the leader,
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.400]   but at least, right, they put me as the prophet,
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.200]   they put me as the only person that would say this,
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.960]   and I'm just saying that was four Jewish members
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:29.520]   that controlled my voice because for the fact
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:33.200]   that 90% of black people in entertainment,
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.040]   from sports to music to acting,
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:40.720]   are in some way tied into Jewish business people,
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.880]   meaning that in some way, just like if Rahm
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.200]   is sitting next to Obama or Jared's sitting next to Trump,
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:53.200]   there's a Jewish person right there controlling the country,
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:56.280]   the Jewish people controlling that,
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.200]   who gets the best video or not,
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.760]   controlling what the media says about me.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.840]   - It's a person, not Jewish.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.680]   Let me just say one thing.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:04.800]   - But they are, though.
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.440]   That's the only thing, it just so happens that they are.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.800]   It just happens that they are.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.600]   That doesn't mean that I hate them.
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.000]   - Yes, yes, yes. - That just means
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:12.960]   that they are.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.960]   - But it's a dog whistle, too.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:20.520]   Let me just say, as I would love to add more love
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.160]   to the world, I would love you to do that
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.080]   as a person with a big voice, with a big, powerful voice
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.680]   that a lot of people look up to.
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:30.200]   And when you say Jewish media,
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.840]   it's funny how this world works that way.
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:35.840]   When you say Jewish media or Jews are controlling
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:40.520]   the voice of black artists, black people, black artists,
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:41.360]   when you say that--
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.160]   - Am I not allowed to say it out loud?
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.200]   - You can say it.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.040]   There's a large number of people that are hurting
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:50.480]   and have anger and even have hate in their heart
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:55.480]   when they hear Jewish media, that hate starts being directed
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.640]   towards the Jewish people.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:01.520]   Do you acknowledge that?
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.520]   Do you understand?
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.360]   Can you feel the hate in the world
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:10.960]   that comes to the surface when you say stuff like that?
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:11.800]   - Okay.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:16.360]   I feel that when we go into therapy,
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.000]   my dad was a therapist, and obviously I've got some
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.880]   therapy skills myself.
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:23.920]   A lot of people, my music is healing.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:28.560]   These type of spa-like existences are healing.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.680]   The color palettes I use are healing.
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.720]   And we can use healing words, right?
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:38.600]   What I really feel, I feel that there's no accountability
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.720]   and no responsibility on Jewish people in media
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:47.080]   to at least start with owning up with the facts
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.360]   of what's dealt with and tell me,
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:53.560]   if I say the facts out loud, to the point of Ari Emanuel
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.520]   writing a letter in the Financial Times
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.160]   trying to take food out of my children's mouth,
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.960]   telling people that they're not allowed to work with me.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:06.960]   Even Chris Como or Piers Morgan getting me to apologize
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:12.280]   and separate Jewish business people
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.760]   from the families of the Jewish business people,
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:18.480]   which I did, update, I did that, that already happened.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.040]   And the way I-- - That was a shitty apology.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.640]   That wasn't really an apology.
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.520]   But shout out for that conversation.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.240]   Great conversation. - I need to get on my knees
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:29.240]   and kiss the dick of Howard Stern and--
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:31.040]   - You don't need to kiss anyone's dick.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.000]   - But that's what you guys are acting like.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.360]   - You guys, look at that.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:37.640]   - Because you're talking about it as a shitty opinion,
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:41.200]   apology, but where's our fucking apology?
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.520]   Watch this. - Sorry.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.200]   - We don't get, thank you.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.880]   Now let's move on. - What, sorry.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.000]   (laughing)
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Oh, do I need to get on my knees or no?
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.200]   - And kiss my dick. - Oh, shit.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.320]   - So-- - This escalated quickly.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.920]   - So, that's escalated quickly.
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.560]   So the-- - Nice.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.480]   (laughing)
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.760]   So what-- - No, I'm saying,
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.960]   where's our apology?
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.800]   But we can't get to apology because you're telling me
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:09.600]   there's no right way for me to word it.
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:14.600]   So tell me, for me, a person who's been fucked on my deals
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:18.360]   and a person that has friends that never figured out
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:20.840]   how to make shoes with a German company
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:23.280]   that couldn't tell me to wear a BLM shirt
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.640]   and take off my red hat like what would have happened
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.440]   if I was at Nike, right?
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:34.360]   Tell me exactly how to engineer the situation I'm in.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.440]   - I'll tell you exactly how.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.400]   You got a big voice, have the balls as a man
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.120]   to call out the individuals.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:43.400]   Don't call 'em Jews, call 'em by their name
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.000]   and start a war against those individuals.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:46.880]   They're not Jewish.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:50.240]   - But if that's the case, will you help me with that?
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.480]   - Sure, 100%.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:55.280]   Assholes are, well, let me flip that too.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.360]   I don't understand the industry well.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.500]   I see that people are fucking people over for sure,
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.800]   but how do you solve that?
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:06.200]   If you right now run the world's,
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.360]   you're doing a million things,
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:10.120]   but say you ran also a record label.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.200]   - I have ran a record label.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.880]   Well, I've been ran by a record label
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.880]   where I was the face of a record label
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.280]   and had Big Sean and different people complaining to me
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.240]   and I knew fuck about running a record label.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:24.560]   I was simply just a talented producer and an influencer
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.960]   that then started Good Music,
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.840]   but I wasn't the one running Good Music.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.480]   - How would you do it differently?
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.320]   - This is something I propose.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:36.320]   I would look at the top 10 execs in three fields,
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:41.680]   in sports, film, and music.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:45.600]   And I would look at the top 10 clients,
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:50.240]   participant talent.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:53.040]   I would look at the top talent in each of those fields,
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.360]   the top 10 of them.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.520]   And some of them are gonna be Tom Brady.
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.040]   Some of them are gonna be Taylor Swift.
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:59.760]   Some of them, they're not all gonna be black, right?
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:04.760]   Some of them, so some of them will be Adele, right?
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:10.480]   And we'll look at all their contracts transparently
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:15.920]   and we'll compare the notes and re-engineer
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.800]   like it's a new constitution.
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:20.240]   Because when I told my dad when I was 19
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.480]   that I was gonna get into the music industry,
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.680]   he begged me not to.
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.840]   He said, "I heard it's treacherous."
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.160]   Now I'm in a position where I've been through it.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:29.360]   I saw it.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:31.880]   I went out, made some money somewhere else.
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.480]   I saw my name get smeared.
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.680]   I saw my family get destroyed.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.840]   I saw my reputation get destroyed.
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.360]   And I'm back here to have this kind of,
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:44.000]   I'm back here as a being with engineering opportunities.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:44.840]   - So--
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.280]   - Wait a second, if you say it as a shitty apology,
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:51.200]   what is the version of the apology
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.880]   short of kissing Howard Stern's dick?
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:56.000]   - I don't think anyone wants to kiss Howard Stern's dick.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.200]   - That's the whole point, Howard Stern.
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.520]   Nobody wants to kiss your dick, so shut the fuck up.
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.720]   I said, by the way, I'm antagonizing you, Howard Stern.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.760]   I used to be a fan of you.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:05.840]   - Yeah, me too.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.680]   - Yeah, now--
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.520]   - I'm still a fan sometimes.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:12.000]   - Now you're just doing clickbait like everybody else.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.720]   Now you're just a sad old man, Howard.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.040]   - All right.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.440]   - Now, Howard Stern, this is the first time
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:21.680]   anyone's said your name in years.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.440]   Your own family doesn't say your name
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:25.800]   unless they're calling to get their bills paid.
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.240]   (laughing)
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:28.240]   - You're going hard.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:32.680]   See, that's beautiful right there.
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:35.480]   That's much better than calling Jewish media.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.040]   Go after individuals.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:37.880]   - Okay, so--
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.700]   - Go after individuals.
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:41.080]   If you don't talk shit about me, talk shit about me.
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:41.920]   This is great.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:42.760]   - And you know what that is?
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:43.720]   - Yeah, what's that?
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:46.440]   Engineering.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.880]   - That's an engineer's approach.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.920]   - Yeah, engineers, yeah, yeah.
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.640]   You should learn some of that.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:54.120]   - We all can use our pain against each other,
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:58.920]   or we can say we're being with engineering opportunities,
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.680]   and we can know about history.
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.440]   So let me change something.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:06.960]   We can have a, just to be judgmental,
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:09.000]   people say thou shalt not judge.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.440]   I was talking to Camille Vasquez.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:11.720]   She says, "I'm very judgmental."
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:12.560]   That's what we're doing.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:16.040]   I believe, now you could go to Bible,
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.160]   and one thing's gonna say one thing,
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:19.800]   another thing may be contradicted in a way,
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.480]   and then the pastor has to unpack it.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:26.920]   I believe that we are to judge.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.680]   If you look at some food,
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.360]   and it's got a fly coming out of it,
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:35.080]   you can then judge at that point.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.000]   You're supposed to use your better judgment.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.280]   But whenever someone doesn't wanna change
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:42.480]   something they're doing, they'll say, "Don't judge me,"
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:46.080]   right, but as a species, you called for me.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.360]   You got the breakthrough, and by the way,
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:51.560]   it's only an engineer that I would respect
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:56.560]   to tell me of how to update how I'm communicating,
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:58.320]   because this started off, right?
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:01.840]   I've been through all these interviews.
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:03.520]   Let me go to this.
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:07.000]   You said this was a sorry apology.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.400]   I was very specific.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.480]   I said the Jewish, because by the way, it's a barrage,
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:13.640]   right, it's a thing where I don't even remember the names
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:14.880]   at a certain point, right?
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:19.880]   It's like if a girl was getting raped by men,
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:25.640]   if that person's not 18, right,
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.440]   and she was getting raped since 14, right,
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:31.080]   and she still got this face,
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:34.200]   this super like Irina Shayk level face, right,
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:39.960]   she might say, "I hate men."
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:41.920]   That woman may say, "I hate men."
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:45.440]   She might get to that point because she was raped.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:49.040]   All my contracts, and no one can say this is ramped up.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.240]   No one, Howard Stern can't say this is ramped up.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.360]   Ari Emanuel can't say this is ramped up.
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:57.160]   George Soros knows damn well that I'm not ramped up.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:02.120]   George Soros knows like, wow, this guy's like a younger guy
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:04.520]   that's looking at what I did
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:08.040]   and looking at how I control the world silently,
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.640]   and he's calling it out,
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.880]   and he's not using any of the fear tactics.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.560]   I can't send his homeboys around him.
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.320]   I can't send his wife to him.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.240]   This guy, that's what George Soros sees, right,
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:20.560]   when he's dealing with me, right?
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:23.840]   So what you guys are actually asking me to do,
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:28.840]   I'm comparing myself to that 18-year-old beautiful woman
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:31.120]   that had been mistreated by men
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:34.120]   for four years of her life, right,
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:37.680]   and you're saying, you know, as a man,
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.720]   you can't blame all men,
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:44.720]   and I'm saying as a responsible forward philosopher leader,
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:50.600]   okay, I'll drop the pain, and I will specify,
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:54.440]   because I'm up here, I lost my fucking family.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.200]   I lost my kids.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:59.120]   I lost my best friend in fashion.
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:01.520]   I lost the black community.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:04.960]   I lost, you know, people said I lost my mind.
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:07.480]   All of these things, lost my reputation,
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:11.880]   and I'm up here just like, I just want my family,
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:15.000]   but I don't want my family to have to say
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.960]   what the left wants us to say,
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.800]   to have to say what China wants us to say.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.560]   I wanna be an American and protect my kids
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:26.560]   and protect my wife and raise my kids as Christians
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:30.280]   and have my wife be a Christian and innovate
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:31.720]   and America may rock and roll.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:34.040]   I wanna innovate as a creative person
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.400]   and be a successful American,
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.560]   but all of that had been taken away from me.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.600]   So I'm coming back and I'm removing the PSTD right now,
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.920]   right, I'm standing up and saying the only way
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:46.640]   that we're gonna be able to get past this
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:50.840]   and the way God is gonna use me right now
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:53.480]   is for me to stop talking about the pain,
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:56.880]   stop talking about what happened and do something about it,
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:00.080]   and that's where I'm at right now in this moment.
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.640]   Like, yeah, people agree,
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:03.360]   at least there was something where you could say
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:06.600]   he has a reason of why he got to that tweet,
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.900]   and what you're doing for me today is saying,
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:14.680]   yo, that was a sorry apology and let's specify.
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:18.600]   I'm not asking for anyone out here to empathize
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:23.600]   or sympathize for a dude worth $11 billion
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.880]   that can make money disappear,
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:30.120]   I mean, appear at a thin air in five different industries.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:33.760]   I'm not asking for anybody to sympathize
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:36.920]   with someone who's married to Kim Kardashian,
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:38.920]   dated Irene and Shay, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:43.000]   like, I feel like I'm just not gonna get the sympathy vote
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.360]   in this situation, right?
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.520]   So--
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:48.200]   - I feel your pain, I feel your pain, yeah.
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.920]   - I feel like no one's gonna feel my pain,
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.880]   only Brad and Leo can feel my pain, right?
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.480]   So the, so--
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.600]   - But still.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:59.920]   - But here today, when you said it's a sorry apology,
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:04.400]   what's the apology that you're looking for
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:07.440]   as a Jewish engineer?
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.480]   Oh, no, no, I'm saying, as Lex,
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:13.120]   let's not talk about you being Jewish, as Lex,
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:18.120]   what's the apology that you want me to say to,
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.720]   am I allowed to say Jewish?
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:23.980]   Tell me, is it anti-Semitic for Ye to say Jewish out loud?
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:26.800]   - No, there's, I don't like the "allowed"
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.880]   that presumes censorship.
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.640]   I think you choose, you have a powerful voice.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.680]   - Did I prove, did I prove that there was censorship
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:36.000]   over the past two weeks?
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.460]   I proved it. - Who censored you?
[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:38.680]   Oh, Drink Champs.
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:40.680]   - Oh my Lord.
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:41.720]   (laughing)
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.120]   - Oh, like Twitter and so on?
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:43.960]   - Twitter.
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:44.960]   - That has less to do--
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.360]   - Drink Champs.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.200]   - That hurt you, the Drink Champs,
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:51.960]   that nor took it down, took down your conversation?
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:52.800]   - No.
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.920]   - It didn't hurt you?
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:57.840]   Man, you gotta be honest about that.

[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:23.960]   you know, I went to Japan for two to three months, right?
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:27.680]   The day I had Sunday service,
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:29.920]   my kids are supposed to be there,
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.440]   and my kids were nowhere to be found.
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:36.200]   And I text Kim and said, "Where are my kids?"
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.600]   We get into an argument,
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:42.720]   and then I get a text from a number I don't know,
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:45.060]   and it's Pete Davidson bragging
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.280]   about being in bed with my wife.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:50.160]   Then--
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:53.680]   - Just fucking with you?
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:55.880]   - Well, at that point, it's like,
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:58.720]   they're trying to put me in jail,
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:00.320]   or put a friend of mine in jail,
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:05.920]   because then I'm gonna go surround the hotel
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:10.920]   and do something which would have me not be able to be here.
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:13.640]   And instead, I walked away from that situation.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:17.000]   I went to Japan, like the samurai that I am,
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.800]   and went to the top of the mountain.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:22.960]   'Cause I knew that, I mean,
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:27.600]   I knew there was no way she could love this dude,
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:29.560]   not just because he's ugly, he's not black.
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:30.480]   She likes black guys.
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:34.160]   Every guy that she is with looks exactly the same.
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:38.600]   Ray J, Reggie Bush, at that time Kanye West,
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:41.320]   she has a type, just like how I have a type.
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:43.120]   A lot of my girls look kind of similar to her,
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.680]   because in a video game character,
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.760]   people have their type, right?
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.920]   So I knew that this was like--
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:52.140]   - The princess has a type, and she likes Mario.
[00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:53.480]   - Right, there you go.
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:54.960]   - As somebody who cares for you,
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:57.400]   and hopefully can be a friend,
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:00.200]   yay, I gotta say these words,
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:02.560]   and the words about Jews,
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:04.400]   is not the words of a samurai,
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:07.680]   of a great man.
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:12.680]   I would say, you said something that inspired,
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:14.520]   that resonated with a lot of people,
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:18.200]   when you said George Bush doesn't care about black people.
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:21.160]   I have to say, as somebody who cares for you,
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:25.700]   that yay, the artist formerly known as Kanye West,
[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:29.180]   doesn't care about Jewish people.
[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:32.260]   In the same way you spoke about George Bush,
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:34.920]   being a politician, and not giving a fuck
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:38.700]   about the poor people that suffered after Katrina,
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:41.360]   you're not giving a fuck about the suffering
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:43.420]   of the Jewish people across the world.
[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.140]   - Why am I not?
[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:49.060]   - Because you're feeding, you're giving strength,
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:49.900]   motivation to hate groups.
[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:51.980]   - We already updated, I gave an apology,
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:53.400]   you said it wasn't good enough.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:54.240]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.180]   - And now you're telling me, no, I'm not gonna--
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:58.140]   - You don't need to kiss anyone's dick.
[00:53:58.140 --> 00:53:59.100]   What you have to do-- - You're asking me
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:00.380]   to kiss the dick. - Is to say what's wrong,
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:04.300]   to say there's no Jewish media, there's no Jewish--
[00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:05.220]   - There isn't?
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:08.460]   - There's no control of the media by Jewish people.
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:10.080]   - You're an engineer, brother.
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.700]   If you're an engineer, and you're not holding to the truth,
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:13.860]   that's not engineering.
[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:17.700]   - Engineering is not, that's not, that's hate,
[00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:18.540]   that's not engineering.
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:19.900]   - No, it's called-- - Engineering says,
[00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:22.180]   I'm gonna build a better record label.
[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:24.380]   - It's called stereotypes. - And I'm going to respect--
[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:25.820]   - Stereotypes exist for a reason.
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:27.540]   - Engineers don't do stereotypes.
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:29.060]   - I do. - Stereotypes are dumb.
[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:32.580]   They allow you to channel hate towards the other.
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:33.900]   - You know what the biggest thing is?
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:35.020]   - Yeah.
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:38.820]   - With something, a veteran that was sitting next to me
[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:42.260]   at Cheesecake Factory last night, he said,
[00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:47.100]   you know, the general justice, he serves
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:49.340]   for whoever is the president, right?
[00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:53.220]   And he said, what's happening in politics is,
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:56.180]   we're forgetting we're on the same side.
[00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:59.180]   We're forgetting we're on the, this is someone
[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:02.700]   is practically, now he's a nurse, so he's still,
[00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.980]   you know, fighting for humanity in a way.
[00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:08.620]   He went from holding, you know, guns in battle
[00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:13.140]   to being a nurse, and when people are battling
[00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:16.660]   for their lives, and he said, we're forgetting
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:20.820]   we're on the same side, this is a person that,
[00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:24.580]   no matter who becomes president,
[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:27.260]   he can still be told to go to war.
[00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:32.180]   And the chaos that's created by the media
[00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:37.980]   has split the country in half, and what we,
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:41.540]   what us as beings with an engineer opportunity
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:45.620]   need to do right now is find the blue water.
[00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:49.620]   Where do we, where are places that we agree on?
[00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:53.060]   And I want you to finish everything,
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:57.460]   hey, I'm gonna let you finish, everything that you--
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:59.060]   - I've heard that before.
[00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:02.380]   - Want to express to me, get off all,
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:05.780]   I'm your scarecrow today, I'm your punching bag today
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:07.980]   for everything I did, and I want you to stand up
[00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:11.220]   for all of the hate that, I'm your Al Gore
[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:12.700]   when he lost the election.
[00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:15.380]   Remember, he almost became a punching bag
[00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:18.180]   for the lady that had voted on him,
[00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:20.220]   and she just said all this stuff, and he's like,
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:22.580]   I know, I agree with you, right?
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:26.220]   But there's nothing that he could do about it.
[00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:28.700]   With this, it's like, things that you're saying,
[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:30.100]   I agree with you.
[00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:32.220]   You know, it's like if you sit some kids
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:36.180]   in the principal's office and I punch somebody, right?
[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:41.180]   I took my hand as what it really means.
[00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:45.220]   Even Ari Emanuel had to say, this is a pop,
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:47.020]   this is an icon, right?
[00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:52.020]   And I went and just punched an entire people at one time
[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:57.900]   or said that I was about to, I went like this, right?
[00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:01.060]   And I got blacked out, black mirrored, done, right?
[00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:03.020]   And it's like, what were you even gonna do?
[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:04.780]   And why did you go like this?
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:10.740]   I went like this because I can't even,
[00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:17.140]   I would look insane to physically show you a metaphor,
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:24.460]   a physical representation of my last 20 years
[00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:29.460]   of what I've been through as a musician, as a father,
[00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:32.300]   and as a black person with a political opinion.
[00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:35.980]   - A great man still through the pain does the right thing,
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:39.620]   and I think the right thing is to not say
[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:41.820]   that there's Jewish control of the media.
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:45.100]   - That's incorrect though, that's a fucking lie, there is.
[00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:47.660]   And they did come and bully me, it proved the point.
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:50.180]   - No, the reason you don't say it
[00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:54.340]   is because the world is much bigger than the, forgive me,
[00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:57.280]   the narrow little world you exist in.
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:59.700]   Your impact stretches way past
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:02.220]   those little boardroom meetings over contracts.
[00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:03.540]   - So what should I have done?
[00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:04.380]   What should I have done?
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.220]   - Not say that you should be a strong man
[00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:10.860]   that doesn't mention religion or people and then fight.
[00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:11.980]   - Do you wanna win this fight?
[00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:13.740]   - How do I win, how do we win?
[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:15.660]   - Call out individual people,
[00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:17.500]   that's one way because they have a big voice,
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:21.540]   the other voice that I prefer is to build another label.
[00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:26.540]   - I feel like you're controlling my creative narrative,
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:28.500]   because just like how you're telling me
[00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:29.740]   I shouldn't have said that,
[00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:30.940]   do you think there are people telling me
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.540]   I shouldn't have wore a red hat?
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:37.420]   - No, 'cause you asked me what should I have done.
[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:39.180]   You're supposed to be a scarecrow,
[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:41.420]   so I thought I'm gonna beat the shit out of the scarecrow
[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:42.700]   with my words, right?
[00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:45.220]   You let me, it was consensual.
[00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:46.260]   - The punching bag is a better,
[00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:48.900]   'cause scarecrow actually has a different real name.
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:51.980]   So let's say a punching bag, I shouldn't say a scarecrow.
[00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:55.060]   But every single person that I've sat with
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:57.500]   from the point when I wore the red hat to now
[00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:59.140]   has done the same thing.
[00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:03.420]   Sit in the principal's office and don't do what you're doing.
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:05.700]   - We're in the general's closet right now together,
[00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:08.300]   and I'm not, the red hat is very different.
[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:12.540]   The red hat is, you have a set of beliefs,
[00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:17.540]   you represent half the country that has a hope,
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:19.820]   a vision for the future of America,
[00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:23.060]   that's very different than without any purpose whatsoever
[00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:25.500]   saying Jewish media, Jewish control of the media.
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:27.600]   - You said that there's no purpose,
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.900]   so you're taking away my history
[00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:31.960]   and my reason of what my purpose was.
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:36.860]   - I'm saying-- - Also, also, also--
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:39.180]   - I'm speaking my voice vocalizing it.
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:43.060]   - Also, it's God's plan.
[00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:44.500]   There's a lot of things that open up.
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:45.540]   Let me tell you something that opened up.
[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:49.620]   There's a guy, like I told you, that was running STEM Player
[00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:52.380]   who I've had issues with, we hadn't got paid on time,
[00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:53.820]   certain things, right?
[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:57.780]   And he took his IQ, his know-how,
[00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:59.820]   his engineering know-how to,
[00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:02.700]   he basically was trying to Adidas me
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:05.980]   with even though I was the bigger money in the situation.
[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:07.940]   That was fun and we funded together
[01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:11.060]   and he hired these engineers and he said,
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:12.180]   "Well, because of your comments,
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:14.940]   "we're not gonna be able to hire anybody else."
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:16.400]   And I was like, "Well, how many Jewish people
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.420]   "do we have in our company?"
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:18.600]   He said, "I don't know."
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.420]   He didn't say exactly, right?
[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:21.740]   I said, "Do we have black people?"
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.100]   He said, "Yes."
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:23.940]   I said, "How many?"
[01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:24.960]   He said, "Two."
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.900]   So we have like 60 full-time employees,
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:30.140]   like 40 half-time and part-time.
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:33.380]   And I,
[01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:37.500]   I took as a responsibility,
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:41.820]   let's take a step back from us being one species
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:44.300]   and say, "Hey, you're Jewish, I'm black."
[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:45.860]   - Why step back?
[01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:48.300]   - For this example, for the sake of this example.
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:52.300]   And I said, "Wow, I'm sure I can hire
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:55.700]   "more than two black engineers."
[01:00:55.700 --> 01:01:00.700]   And what happens is because there are so many businessmen
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.820]   that just so happen to be Jewish,
[01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:05.020]   that it's good business, right?
[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:07.380]   Just to monopolize, that's what people are looking.
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:09.260]   Everybody wants to be Elon, right?
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:13.460]   So the--
[01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:14.420]   - I disagree with that.
[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:16.260]   - Okay, but let me finish this point.
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:17.100]   - I'm gonna let you finish.
[01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:18.180]   - A lot of-- - I'm gonna let you finish.
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:21.960]   - A lot of businessmen want to be as successful as Elon
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.780]   and as popular as Elon, a lot.
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:26.540]   Like, just worded like that,
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:28.140]   which I hate the term a lot, actually.
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:31.340]   I wanna be more specific, but I haven't done the math on it.
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:32.860]   Let's say some.
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:36.700]   Factually, for sure, there are some business people
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:39.420]   of all different walks and backgrounds
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:43.340]   that would like to be as rich and as popular as Elon Musk.
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:46.960]   So let me just take a step back from the we're one species
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:50.540]   into the we're separated by race, gender,
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.220]   socioeconomic class conversation and say,
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:56.240]   as a black owner of two tech platforms,
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:00.040]   hardware and software, I need to take action.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:02.040]   Let's not call it affirmative.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:04.940]   Let's just say I need to take action
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:08.420]   and I need to take accountability
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:13.420]   in ensuring that black engineers are hired
[01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:18.940]   and guess what, hired together.
[01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:22.300]   Because when the black people that are brilliant
[01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:26.620]   are separated from our culture, we forget who we are.
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:29.720]   And we'll get to a point where, you know,
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:32.880]   OJ would say, I'm not black, I'm OJ.
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:36.160]   Because just to be on the golf course,
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:39.320]   we put on the golf shirt, but the golf shirt
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:42.280]   might not be something that our culture would have done.
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:47.280]   And now our culture in poor communities is,
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.200]   oh, everybody's got Draco on them.
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.160]   Everybody's got a gun on them.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.960]   Oh, if you run up on me on the gas station,
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:54.800]   I'm gonna kill you.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.320]   Hey, you ain't gotta talk to me like a man
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.160]   if I haven't killed at least five people.
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.380]   But you know what happens is we can kill five people.
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:05.580]   We could kill 10 people and still be in the media
[01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:08.140]   as long as we play by the rules, right?
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:11.340]   'Cause what would happen is any of these guys
[01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:13.940]   that have talked about killing people
[01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:16.980]   and different things, unless Trump had pardoned them, right?
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:19.220]   But let's say, even if Trump had pardoned them,
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:22.620]   they could still go to someone like a Lil Boosie
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:26.340]   or Meek Mills or Puff Daddy, anybody,
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:30.320]   and say, hey, we need you to talk shit about yay right now.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:33.520]   And also, you're not allowed, if you do wanna vote for Trump
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.600]   or vote outside of what this arrangement is,
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.560]   then we're gonna put you in jail.
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.800]   It ain't, we're not gonna bring you down.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:44.440]   We have this on you.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:45.400]   You get what I'm saying?
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:50.400]   If I had ever killed someone, if I wasn't the bitch
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:54.240]   with the pink polo on, I wouldn't be able to be
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:57.020]   the vocal man that I am today.
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:57.860]   You understand what I'm saying?
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:03:59.180]   This is the reason why I'm happy
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:02.260]   that my gangster disciple brothers
[01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:04.780]   kept me from the initiations,
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:09.780]   which made me feel like a pussy my whole life, right?
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:14.840]   But now I am someone who legally can say this.
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:20.060]   Other people in my position, they legally cannot speak.
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:23.120]   They legally cannot speak.
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.860]   Or they will go to prison.
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:27.980]   I am in a bit of a glass prison,
[01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:29.700]   because I don't have say so
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.540]   of where my children go to school.
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:35.220]   But I'm in a freedom place
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:37.660]   where I can have this conversation with you right now.
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:41.720]   And that is, I don't like the word breakthrough.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:46.080]   That's God's hand on this situation.
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.180]   But you get what I'm saying about,
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:48.940]   if I hadn't said the tweet,
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:51.900]   I wouldn't have had to take the accountability myself
[01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:55.520]   to hire black engineers into my two tech platforms.
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:56.960]   - Yeah, and do you get what I'm saying?
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.600]   That's a beautiful personal journey you're on.
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.440]   But do you get what I'm saying?
[01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:03.360]   - It's not personal, it's for my people as a whole.
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.160]   As a tribal person-- - It's a small company.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.560]   It's a small company.
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:11.560]   - As a tribal person, I believe that I am my people.
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.800]   - Yeah. - And the thing
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:17.760]   that businessmen have done to my people
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:21.680]   have pulled the brightest out of our tribes and siloed them.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:25.300]   And made us lose our culture and lose who they were.
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:28.460]   All the only thing I wanted to say at Virgil's funeral,
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:31.800]   which I wasn't allowed to, right?
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.340]   It was a white pastor
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:35.540]   that talked the majority of the funeral.
[01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:39.060]   Half the funeral was pissed, pissed, right?
[01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:44.700]   And this pastor actually married me and Kim, right?
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:47.420]   He looks like Justin Timberlake a little bit.
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:51.060]   And he talked half the funeral.
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:52.580]   He knew Virgil was passing,
[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:56.240]   did a collaboration with him before he passed, by the way.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.220]   Right, a clothing collaboration.
[01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:00.520]   I didn't know Virgil was passing.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.220]   But the thing I wanted to say,
[01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:08.400]   I saw ASAP Rocky and I saw some other members of his gang
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:12.060]   in the audience at the funeral.
[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:16.380]   And all I wanted to tell him is,
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:19.300]   don't let them split the gang up.
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:22.620]   Don't let them split the gang up.
[01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:27.440]   When I did the first Yeezy,
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:31.940]   'cause I did Kanye West two fashion shows before
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:36.340]   as a high-end luxury, all leather kind of designer.
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:38.540]   Not all leather, but high-end materials.
[01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:41.740]   Mink, this kind of thing.
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:47.420]   And then I came back with Yeezy, with Adidas.
[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.820]   And this fashion show was so popular
[01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:53.300]   that Justin Bieber had to sit in the second row.
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:55.580]   This thing had every name you could think of.
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:07:00.580]   It had Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Kendall Jenner.
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:03.980]   It was Kylie's first fashion show she'd been in.
[01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:05.460]   And in the second fashion show,
[01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:08.220]   I put Kylie and Bella Hadid next to each other
[01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:09.340]   in the fashion show.
[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:10.260]   You had Puff Daddy.
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:14.700]   At that time, Puff Daddy had beef with Drake.
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:16.740]   Drake still came to the show
[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:19.720]   and Jay-Z had to break up the fight backstage.
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:22.000]   The designers, you had Jerry Lorenzo,
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.180]   that's head of Fear of God.
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:24.860]   You had Kim Schraub, head of Skims.
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:27.140]   You had Virgil Abloh, head of Louis Vuitton.
[01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:29.620]   You had Demna, head of Balenciaga,
[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:34.340]   all working for Ye, for the leader,
[01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:37.700]   for the philosopher, for the person that put,
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:38.940]   who put this together?
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:40.700]   Me, that's who.
[01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:44.380]   You had these people working for the king of New York,
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:46.660]   basically the boss, Ye.
[01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:51.180]   You had Jay-Z in the audience, Rihanna in the audience,
[01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:54.120]   Beyonce in the audience,
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:56.920]   sitting next to Anna Wintour in this audience.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.320]   And guess who heard wind of this?
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.640]   One of the richest men in the world, Bernard Arnault,
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:03.400]   caught wind of this.
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:04.760]   What's going on?
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:08.200]   They're building up something and we need to stop it.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:12.880]   So then he met with me and politely offered me
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.640]   backing for my clothing line.
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:16.600]   It would be Kanye West.
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:20.840]   They would get 49%, 51%, I would get 49%.
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.640]   They'd have control and they were gonna give me
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.320]   all of the support from Louis Vuitton.
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:27.680]   So I had to go to Adidas and I told Adidas,
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:32.240]   "Hey, let's Ademnify the apparel."
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.560]   So Adidas, you're not gonna do the apparel anymore.
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:36.280]   Hey, we had a good time,
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:38.120]   but we're gonna run off with Giselle now, right?
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.760]   So that's like you told your girl that,
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.440]   and she's like, "Oh, no, we're supposed to,
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:44.400]   "we had the proudest moment of our career."
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:49.400]   So then he offers me to deal and Alexander Arnault,
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:52.800]   who's went to gone on and rape and pillage
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.000]   from all of the talent that I had afterwards,
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.760]   said, I say, "Before I tell Adidas
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:58.880]   "to Ademnify the apparel,
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:03.880]   "can I get a written contract from your dad, Bernard Arnault?"
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:07.040]   And he says, "My dad will never go back on his word."
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.000]   So you already know what this thing is going, right?
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.600]   You can spoiler alert, right?
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.440]   He went back on his word.
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:17.360]   So three months into the deal, I get Anna Wintour,
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:18.960]   I say, "Who should I use for my lawyer?"
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:21.880]   She picks my lawyer for me, right?
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:24.060]   I just found out even a couple of days
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:28.440]   that the lawyer demanded an airplane during negotiations.
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:30.300]   Had nothing to do with me, right?
[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.560]   They said that Bernard Arnault got freaked out,
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:35.380]   and then Alexander Arnault calls me and says,
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:37.380]   "The deal got dropped at the board."
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:42.400]   I went back and told my high maintenance wife,
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:45.320]   I was supposed to become this designer at Louis Vuitton,
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:47.240]   or the Louis Vuitton group was gonna back
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:48.100]   the Kanye West line,
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.880]   'cause that's how good I've done in fashion, babe.
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.560]   And now the deal is dropped.
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:54.720]   Now the deal is dropped.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:57.160]   So then I did a second collection,
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.240]   and we didn't have any support
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:00.900]   to be able to build the collection.
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:04.680]   Then I went and found, and third collection, we did it.
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:05.800]   We took over MSG.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.600]   Fourth collection went, and the show started an hour late.
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:12.040]   Then a week later, Kim got robbed.
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:15.240]   Then I told Scooter Braun, my manager at that time,
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:20.240]   I say, "I need to go to Japan.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:23.480]   "I'm tired, I'm tired."
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.840]   He says, "No, you need to make more money."
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:31.520]   I do four more shows on a second leg of the tour,
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:36.080]   and I suffer from exhaustion and go to the hospital,
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:40.000]   and then get diagnosed with a disorder.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.720]   This is the first time I ever suffered from exhaustion.
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:45.420]   By the way, I haven't been to the hospital since.
[01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:48.400]   Haven't been to the hospital since,
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:53.400]   and haven't taken medication in two years.
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:57.120]   And I'm sure there'll be people in the media,
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.720]   we won't say, where from, will say,
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.000]   "Well, that's obvious."
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.480]   So right now, I'm talking to you.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.480]   I'm not on medication.
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:09.040]   I just go to sleep, I have sleep.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.440]   - Have you been able to sleep?
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:14.440]   - That's too low-hanging fruit for you.
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.560]   You're more, I expect more.
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.400]   - I agree, I agree.
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:18.240]   - I expect more.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.060]   - I agree, that was dumb.
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:19.900]   I regret it.
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:24.480]   - That's like Piers Morgan trying to grab ratings.
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.200]   You got a whole life ahead of you.
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:28.520]   You got a whole life ahead of you.
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:29.920]   These guys are at the end of their life.
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:31.240]   - Oh, good God.
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.080]   - So this story is--
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.760]   - Call me out on my shit, I love it.
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:39.120]   - But then, amidst that, the same guy
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.080]   that dropped my deal, Bernard Arnault,
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:42.960]   goes and hires my best friend.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:47.280]   Goes and hires my main engineer, right?
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:52.200]   It would've been like them hiring Elon from Peter
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:54.360]   before they figured out Paul,
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.040]   before they figured out PayPal.
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.880]   But Paul sounds like,
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.800]   Powell sounds like Paul.
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.720]   I just say it 'cause I'm a Christian, I thought it was cool.
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:03.760]   But it would've been like,
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.280]   what if someone could've went in
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:10.280]   and took Elon away from Peter before they paid Paul?
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:12.080]   I just, 'cause they paid Paul.
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:13.680]   - Yeah, before they paid Paul.
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:15.360]   - Before they, it's just too close.
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:16.200]   - Yeah, too close.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.400]   - It just sounds so fresh, the fact that it's so close.
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.980]   And that's what happened, right?
[01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:23.600]   They broke the gang up.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:26.440]   And I'm telling you right now,
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:29.960]   that hadn't happened, Virgil's alive, I'm still married.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:30.800]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:34.080]   Our structure was broken then, right?
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.200]   Because we were building some,
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:36.680]   Kylie wasn't a billionaire.
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:37.520]   You know what I mean?
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.040]   We were building something together
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:45.040]   that a French colonizer came in and caught it early
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:47.080]   and tried to destroy it.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:52.080]   But the only thing is, God is alive and I'm anointed.
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.640]   And even with those drawbacks,
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:58.620]   losing my wife, losing my friend, exhaustion,
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.600]   all of these late night tweets
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.760]   that piss off an entire group,
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:08.760]   like this, the frustration still there.
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.920]   We work, I work for God and God runs the world
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:14.040]   and we'll see what happens.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:19.040]   - But in those words, don't you feel that being split up,
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:21.280]   don't you feel you're doing the thing
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:24.720]   that you stand against, which is playing victim?
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:29.720]   Aren't you playing victim to the forces in the world?
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:31.560]   - I didn't play victim, I didn't even get a chance to play.
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:32.880]   I just said I was about to.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.440]   I said like this, like.
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.400]   - No, you played pretty damn well.
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:37.240]   What do you mean?
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:39.240]   What do you mean about to?
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:42.040]   You're like one of the greatest designers in history,
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:43.960]   fashion designers.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:46.440]   You were playing, you are playing.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:47.360]   What does that even mean?
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:49.600]   - I thought you were referring to the tweet.
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:50.440]   - No, all of it.
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:51.260]   - Saying I'm playing victim there.
[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.760]   - Well, there's a full set of things
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:55.800]   that you're under attack for.
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:59.640]   The tweet and everything beyond that.
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:03.200]   But like you're blaming, not blaming,
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:05.960]   but you're saying that the Jewish media,
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:09.680]   the Jewish record label, the Jewish people,
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:12.120]   forget Jewish or not, it doesn't matter.
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:15.120]   It's playing victim, right?
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:20.080]   - Ultimately, I am fighting a battle in the spiritual form.
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:21.600]   And anyone that believes in God
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:23.280]   and is looking at this interview
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:24.840]   would agree with that.
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:29.840]   And I just so happen to be a bright part of God's army.
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.960]   I'm fighting for us to live.
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:35.120]   The greatest gift is life itself.
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:37.620]   I am pro-life.
[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:38.840]   I am pro-God.
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:43.360]   I believe that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.040]   and died for our sins.
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:52.440]   - What do you feel about another attack,
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:53.480]   another painful thing?
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:56.840]   I imagine super painful is Balenciaga pulling.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:02.560]   You had a really close relationship and friendship
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:05.080]   with their creative director.
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:06.960]   Like, how do you feel about all of it?
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:10.760]   - I told you I sang the song.
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:14.240]   I sing another song from one of my mentors, Future.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:16.120]   I never feel pain.
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.440]   I done felt too much pain.
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:22.040]   Like there was a day where I was headed to Nashville
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:26.200]   to meet with George Farmer, who is the CEO of Parla,
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:29.360]   the day when we made the announcement.
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:34.360]   At that same day, Balenciaga was taking my imagery
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:37.480]   off of their site.
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.520]   And the Drink Champs was being taken down.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:45.200]   And I said, "This is the happiest day of my life.
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:48.800]   "I love cutting the grass low.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:51.260]   "People wasn't really with you.
[01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:52.520]   "They was part-time.
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:54.760]   "People switch up when it's war time.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:58.400]   "I'd rather have people who are really with me
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:01.120]   "and not people who are just trying to use me."
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:04.400]   - Listen, as a friend, somebody cares for you,
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:07.460]   you have to be really careful by the people,
[01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:09.400]   by all people, always.
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:12.240]   The people that are gonna try to be close to you now,
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:14.600]   you don't know if you can trust them anymore.
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:15.440]   - Even more.
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:18.240]   With the Balenciaga, I have more to say about it though.
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.640]   - Yeah.
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:21.120]   - Let's do this.
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:26.120]   Demna will still work for Ye someday.
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:30.080]   And this is just speeding the process up.
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:32.100]   - Have you talked?
[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:33.860]   Can you share if you've talked?
[01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:35.620]   - Yes, I talked to Demna.
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:37.380]   This is like, we're kindred spirits.
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:39.740]   None of this can keep us away from each other.
[01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:43.820]   I brought Demna to Gap to be able to bring
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:45.780]   the best product in the world.
[01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:48.020]   At that time, I wanted to go under $100.
[01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:50.420]   Now I'm like, okay, we're gonna go $20 a product.
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:56.360]   I brought Demna in to engineer,
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:59.720]   that's why I said engineer by Balenciaga,
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:01.520]   Yeezy Gap engineer by Balenciaga,
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:04.520]   to engineer the best product for the people.
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:09.520]   The people that they say are at the bottom
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:15.280]   of the Maslow hierarchy of need chart.
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:17.080]   They're at the bottom of the pyramid.
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:22.300]   So Gap didn't want that.
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:23.920]   Balenciaga didn't want that.
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.940]   Our agendas were not aligned.
[01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:31.460]   I was brought in to the Gap for political reasons
[01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:35.300]   and influence, like a Virgil, like a George Floyd.
[01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:37.300]   When popular celebrities are brought
[01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:41.200]   into Fortune 500 companies, it's not to raise the stock.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:45.200]   It's to strengthen the position and influence.
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:50.020]   And it's definitely not to be out here
[01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:51.960]   letting a nigga think he Steve Jobs.
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:57.560]   - Yeah, there's people like that.
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:02.400]   But you as a great man, a visionary,
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:08.600]   your job is to understand that game and be one step ahead.
[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:11.740]   - Well, that's why I'm telling them.
[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:13.840]   That relationship, you know some relationships
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:15.040]   only last for a summer?
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:17.880]   You know, some last for a year?
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.540]   The relationship ran its course.
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:24.760]   In that relationship, I invested a lot
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:28.840]   of my social capital and actual capital.
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:31.600]   I spent somewhere between five to $10 million
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:34.000]   personally on Balenciaga.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.820]   How much money do you think Balenciaga had paid me
[01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:38.020]   in the past two years?
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:42.000]   Just take a really wild guess, a really wild--
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:42.920]   - Less than that?
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:45.520]   - Just take a super wild one.
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:49.980]   Just go to the furthest extent of your imagination.
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:53.340]   - 1.2 million.
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:55.360]   - Lower.
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.920]   - 500,000.
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.520]   - Lower.
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:00.360]   - Zero.
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:01.960]   - Zero.
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:06.960]   And actually, two weeks ago, I paid at a Saint's account,
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:12.080]   $862,000, not in clothes for me from Balenciaga
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:16.760]   from the store, in royalties to Balenciaga
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:19.380]   where the deal had been engineered
[01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:20.960]   where I was coming out of my pocket.
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:25.360]   So I paid, last year I paid Demna $3 million
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:31.240]   to design the collection, right?
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:34.620]   And we got it out of the Gap Marketing Fund
[01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:39.440]   and he was gonna deliver 160 SKUs or 120 SKUs.
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:42.920]   100 SKUs are separate items of clothing,
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:46.840]   so styles of clothing.
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:49.400]   So he ended up delivering about 60.
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:51.840]   I feel like we're on the people's court
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:52.720]   'cause we actually are, right?
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:54.560]   We're in the court of public opinion.
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:58.920]   So he delivered about 60.
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:00.760]   There were all kinds of people that were working.
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.920]   Part of the reason why I had to get Demna,
[01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:06.320]   like I didn't wanna have to, I wanted to compete with him.
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:08.240]   I didn't wanna have to like get him.
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:09.760]   You know, when I made "Stronger,"
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:13.680]   I did it to compete with Timbaland and Justin Timberlake
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:16.720]   because my fiance at that time liked Justin Timberlake
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.200]   just a little bit too much.
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:20.560]   So I made it to compete.
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:22.600]   And then we had the song out.
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:24.900]   It's number one on Apple, it's blowing up.
[01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:27.240]   I play it in a club and it sounds muddy.
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:32.200]   It doesn't sound the way Sexy Back sounded in the club.
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:37.200]   So I go to Pharrell Williams to do the song.
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:40.520]   Williams to do the drums.
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.880]   And it doesn't, it sounds like a different record.
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.120]   And so it can't be a different record
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:47.080]   because I'm like, I'm gonna swap it out on radio, right?
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.360]   Then I go to Swiss Beats.
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:50.840]   It sounds like a different record.
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:54.360]   I go to Timbaland, the person who did Sexy Back.
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:59.360]   And he did it in five minutes
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:03.000]   and then spent the rest of the hour
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.080]   talking about how nobody could have done it except for him.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.480]   Running around the studio.
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:09.240]   I'm the best, no one could have done it.
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:11.720]   That's why he had to go to me, he had to go to the king.
[01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:13.320]   - Well, he had a point, right?
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:14.680]   - He had a point, right?
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:15.680]   So--
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:16.920]   - What makes the song muddy?
[01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:17.760]   Is it the beat?
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:18.880]   - It was in the drums.
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:20.680]   It was something that Timbaland had in those drums.
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:22.400]   Like now watch this.
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:27.320]   I said, I'm going Def Con 3, right?
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:29.880]   And the actual, I spelled it wrong.
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:30.840]   I have a tendency to do that.
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:33.920]   I'm not quite John Legend, tight sweater level,
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:36.280]   spelling B level.
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:41.280]   So I feel a parallel to me going to Timbaland
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:44.400]   to when I said, hey, you as an engineer,
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:48.360]   I need to work with you as an engineer that is Jewish
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:52.840]   to look at these contracts and what my people,
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.920]   not just black people, let's say artists
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:56.960]   are dealing with in our contracts.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:59.400]   These contracts need to be fixed.
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:03.240]   Everyone could be so mad at the messenger, right?
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.880]   Yay, you said it the wrong way.
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.440]   You're offensive.
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:10.360]   You're like Hitler now 'cause you said it.
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:13.080]   You said this out loud, but it does not,
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:15.120]   you weren't getting enough sleep.
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:20.080]   All this shit does not negate the fact
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:22.840]   that we do have Houston, we have a problem.
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:27.000]   - Yeah, but we is just the music industry.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.080]   Like there's a lot of hate that was created
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:30.760]   by just saying that, you know?
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.600]   - But you're saying what is just
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:34.000]   is everything to me, right?
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:34.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:37.960]   - One person can mean everything to me, right?
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:40.520]   - And for George Bush, winning an election was everything.
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:41.840]   And then when you said George Bush
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:43.960]   doesn't care about black people,
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:46.120]   that you woke him up.
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:47.800]   You woke the people up to the fact
[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:50.200]   that he was narrowly being selfish.
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:53.920]   There's a sense to which you're being corrupted
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:55.400]   by your own greatness.
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:57.480]   You're focusing too much on the industry
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:01.200]   that you've made great, that you've rose to the very top.
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:03.760]   - One of the richest artists in history,
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:05.640]   one of the greatest designers.
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:09.360]   - I am the richest artist in history.
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.800]   - Probably the richest artist in history.
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:14.720]   Yeah, I don't, you know.
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:15.840]   - The funny thing is they're like,
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:17.000]   oh, Rich is Blackfriars.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000]   Like, oh, also Rich is actor, Rich is musician,
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.200]   Rich is fashion designer.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:24.600]   Like it's a bunch of Riches in that one.
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:25.440]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:27.040]   It's like Richer than Ralph Lauren,
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:30.400]   like Richer than Imani, like Richest, like of that.
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:33.400]   But still low, 'cause where do you put that?
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:35.680]   You know, like on the totem.
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:37.240]   'Cause I don't even want to--
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:39.240]   - Man's bank account isn't everything.
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:45.000]   I would say you and I are equal in a certain deep sense,
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.560]   no matter what the bank account says.
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:52.640]   - Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom.
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:57.640]   So I wanted to give you some theme music for your moments.
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:23:58.520]   - It sounded a little muddy.
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:23:59.960]   - Let me give you the Timberland version.
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:01.560]   Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom.
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:02.880]   - Thank you.
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.240]   - But okay. - Play that at the club.
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:07.960]   - So the other thing about, like say like Balenciaga is
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:12.600]   Demna will work with Ye someday.
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:17.600]   And for Cedric and for Francois Pinault,
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:24.040]   and Selma is a beautiful human being,
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:32.560]   five years from now, you'll hear and know the name Ye
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:35.440]   and know things that we did.
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:40.760]   And Balenciaga is not gonna make it onto your questions.
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:44.760]   Would you, as a gambling man, would you bet on that?
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:45.600]   - I would bet on that.
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:46.880]   I can see it in your eyes.
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:47.720]   (laughing)
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:48.560]   Let me ask you a question.
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:50.640]   - So it was actually a sad day for me.
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:53.680]   Not for me, but more for Balenciaga.
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:59.040]   When I heard that, I was just like, oh, shame.
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:04.560]   - Let me ask you a silly question just about Demna.
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:07.440]   I read something that you two talked about,
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:10.280]   like buttons for a few hours.
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:11.860]   - Them my gumdrop buttons?
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:14.760]   - Just in that accent.
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:16.760]   - Me and Demna only speak in Shrek.
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:20.280]   - What's your philosophy with which you approach design?
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:23.800]   You are one of the great fashion designers of our time.
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:26.920]   How do you think about it?
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:28.400]   Do you have a philosophy?
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:30.800]   - You know what I like about the zipper is,
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:35.600]   the zipper hoodie replaces the dress shirt
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:38.640]   'cause you could get on your douchebag shit
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:42.920]   and unzip it and give it a little bit of that type of look.
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:45.280]   - Which is the douchebag?
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:49.040]   - When the douchebags that go to Vegas
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:51.200]   are unbuttoning their dress shirt.
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:55.920]   And the problem with the pullover hoodie is
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:58.800]   you can't do the douchebag thing where you unbutton it,
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:00.680]   but then still get the stomach.
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:04.200]   'Cause the thing is, the ultimate look would be like
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:07.600]   military tank pullover hoodie.
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:10.700]   And if you get a little hot, you take off the hoodie,
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:12.820]   but you're like crazy in shape.
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:15.500]   - So it gives you that flexibility.
[01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:17.960]   - Yeah, the zipper's giving some flexibility.
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:21.840]   And it's like, maybe you wanna keep your jacket on.
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:24.520]   Like, it's considered a hoodie to be like a jacket.
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.440]   If you wanna keep your jacket on,
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:30.440]   then you might wanna do this
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:32.360]   as opposed to pulling it all the way off.
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:36.400]   And it's just comfort, but then you get,
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:41.000]   "Okay, can I do a jogging pant on this?
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.560]   "What elasticity?"
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:44.380]   Now, people argue about climate,
[01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:47.440]   where we are with the climate.
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:50.560]   I take a responsibility as being the most influential
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:54.840]   designer of all time
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:27:00.800]   to say we're gonna use biodegradable clothing.
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:04.720]   Now, the issue there is
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:11.120]   the elastic is not biodegradable.
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:17.000]   So that means it's actually better to use jeans and a belt.
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:20.020]   Then to have an elastic waistband,
[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:24.400]   because elastic waistband is not biodegradable.
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:29.400]   So I use the planet as a big,
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:33.320]   the future of the planet is a big piece
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:37.640]   of the way I engineer
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:39.840]   and the way we talk about where designs are going.
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:42.320]   - The constraints on your design and engineering
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:44.800]   is given by the planet, by the future of the planet.
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:45.640]   - Yes.
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.400]   - That could almost make Jewish people like me again.
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:54.720]   - Every time you say Jewish people,
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:57.280]   I think I've been maybe reading a little too much
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:00.120]   about World War II, but man,
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:04.680]   I'd recommend you listen to some audio books
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:07.360]   or read some books on the Holocaust,
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:11.400]   'cause it's heavy, it's heavy.
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:16.120]   It will put into context the impact of your words.
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:18.560]   - Would you read books on the current Holocaust
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:19.880]   that black people are in?
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:21.440]   - No, I mean, I read.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:24.600]   - What have you read about abortion?
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:28.880]   - I've read a lot of short form writing
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:31.320]   and I've listened to a lot of debates,
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:35.800]   'cause it's really humbling that the question
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:40.800]   of when does life begin is a really difficult question.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:43.680]   For me as an engineer and scientist,
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:45.640]   it's a philosophical question.
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:47.520]   - I mean, we could just go on population control,
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:50.400]   not like if abortion is right or wrong.
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:55.400]   We could say factually the clinics were made by eugenics
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:29:01.400]   for population control and it is controlling the population
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:05.520]   as is the never being given a 40 acres and a mule,
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:07.000]   so you don't have the opportunity.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.440]   And when the people that do have the opportunity
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:12.480]   are separated from our people, our tribe
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.800]   and placed in suburban communities next to us,
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:16.960]   Chris Rock will put it, the dentist,
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:20.280]   and whitewashed and made to shut the fuck up
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:24.320]   and vote left or whatever niggers are supposed to do
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:28.240]   when we make it, as opposed to saying,
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:33.240]   okay, we're building schools, we're building up choirs,
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:38.800]   we're building up our own leagues, basketball teams,
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:40.800]   our own factories.
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:45.680]   We started the first sportswear factory in America
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:50.680]   since World War II was actually this factory
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:52.080]   I put in Cody.
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:57.080]   So, I'm 45 years old, we're on this journey right now.
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:30:01.280]   It's the other thing about this is like people,
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:02.920]   just in general, they love me so much.
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:05.680]   I'm like actually a hard guy to really hate
[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:06.880]   for a long period of time,
[01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:10.200]   just 'cause of like my huge cock.
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:12.000]   - That's what I noticed.
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.720]   I didn't understand why you showed it to me
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:16.220]   when we first met, but now I understand.
[01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:18.400]   - Yeah. - It's very nice.
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:19.440]   Congratulations.
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:24.080]   I know you don't talk about it, but your hat does say 24.
[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:27.480]   If you run for president,
[01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:29.440]   what kind of ideas would you represent?
[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:37.280]   That we're beings with engineering opportunities.
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:39.000]   I would represent...
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:31:00.360]   Just as you served a platform here,
[01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:04.720]   there's something that happened on my last run
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:09.720]   that I thought, I feel, I know was brilliant.
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:14.020]   It was noisy, but it was brilliant.
[01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:17.600]   I had one rally and in the rally,
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:20.760]   I just let people come up and I gave them a platform.
[01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:26.960]   It's our responsibility to listen to the pain
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:29.840]   and hear the pain and understand,
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:34.700]   even when we're the ones that cause the pain,
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:36.240]   like with my tweet.
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:39.280]   It's my responsibility to hear you
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:42.680]   and understand why you feel like that,
[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:44.960]   but it's our responsibility as a people
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:46.580]   to understand each other.
[01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:51.840]   - To give people a voice.
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:53.600]   - People need the voice.
[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:58.600]   And even right now, what I'm doing or how God is using me,
[01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:03.000]   I'm showing where our voices are being muted.
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:07.200]   There's professors that are actually intelligent,
[01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:09.200]   actually have multiple degrees
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:13.900]   that have been canceled from their schools.
[01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:17.680]   And they don't have a music industry or a fan base
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:22.680]   or a shoe design or a smoking hot ex-wife to complain about.
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:25.520]   They've just got the truth of what they saw
[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:29.920]   and what they dedicated to this country and to education
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:33.720]   that has been muted by schools
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:36.240]   that have been taken over with an agenda.
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:40.560]   And so you want the brightest minds to be these professors
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:44.640]   and then you mute them and they have nowhere to go.
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:47.080]   And you might get a guy now
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:50.160]   that went from being someone's favorite professor
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:55.040]   to he's working at Starbucks like he was back at school
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:57.360]   or like he was back in high school.
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:00.640]   - So even if that voice is about anger and hate,
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:02.300]   it still deserves to be heard.
[01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:05.640]   - Yeah, it deserves to be heard.
[01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:07.600]   And we deserve to ask why.
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.800]   You have to ask why.
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:11.560]   I just feel like that's what's,
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:14.880]   I feel like that is sympathizing with Mr. Hugecock.
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:19.880]   I'm just saying that it just needs to be.
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:23.840]   - You should change that to your name on Twitter.
[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:26.720]   While you're still allowed on there.
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:29.200]   - Yeah, do you think that would get censored?
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:32.500]   I feel like they definitely cut it down some inches.
[01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:39.880]   I'm pointing out this truth.
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:42.660]   Now I'm saying this is not a Christian thing, right?
[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:50.400]   And I wonder right there, when I say these jokes,
[01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:56.040]   is it something that, 'cause I do feel like laughter
[01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:59.280]   is the key, engineering and laughter, right?
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:02.280]   Is the key to peace.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:06.800]   Like when I go get my teeth cleaned and I have the nitrous,
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:11.600]   there's something that I wanna go and hug Kris Jenner.
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:13.120]   I wanna go and hug Corey Gamble.
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:16.040]   I wanna go and hug Howard Stern.
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:17.640]   No one wants to hug Howard Stern,
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:18.960]   but just if one--
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:20.840]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:24.160]   I would love to see you two hug it out and make up,
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:26.680]   even though all this shit talking back and forth.
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:28.080]   - What about talking it out
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:30.600]   or is he gonna be screaming at me?
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:32.240]   - Yeah, judgmental and that kind of stuff.
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:34.540]   No, I hope there's love there.
[01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:39.540]   - You know, the thing is, I think Howard's just jealous.
[01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:45.120]   Not just jealous of my cock.
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:50.120]   He's also, he's jealous that I started my campaign
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:51.280]   earlier than him.
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:54.840]   - You gotta let go of that jealousy.
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:57.240]   - You gotta let go of that jealousy, Howard.
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:58.600]   You gotta let go of it. - Howard and everybody else.
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:00.960]   Jealousy is a natural human thing, man.
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:02.700]   - I wonder just as a Christian, right?
[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:04.640]   When I joke and say this stuff,
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:10.000]   it's like, hmm, am I being disobedient to God?
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.160]   Because as a boss, right?
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:17.160]   I'll talk to an employee and I'll be like,
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:21.200]   why didn't you just listen?
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:23.580]   Because I've got the bigger plan, right?
[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:26.640]   So it's like me talking to God,
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:30.440]   were there things that I did in this interview
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:32.600]   that were disobedient to God?
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:37.320]   And for those things, I pray and I repent
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:41.520]   for anything that I've said that was disobedient to God.
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:43.680]   But humor is not one of them.
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:46.920]   Joking is, I feel like humor is the way we avoid
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:48.400]   so much suffering in the world.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:51.880]   It's the way to, it's like a catalyst for love.
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:55.080]   Like it's a way to, people that have gone
[01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:57.160]   through some of the darkest trauma that I've ever met,
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:59.620]   so through war, I just came back from Ukraine,
[01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:04.360]   they're laughing, they're making jokes.
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:07.120]   That's the best way to deal with dark times.
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:08.880]   I don't know what it is about humans.
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:12.000]   I feel like humor, that's the best way
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.160]   to socially engineer a good future, I think is humor.
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:16.800]   Not taking shit too seriously.
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:17.960]   That's the problem with censorship.
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:22.080]   One of the things that really suffer is humor, jokes.
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:23.840]   Maybe going too far in the jokes.
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:27.240]   You mentioned Anthony Jeselnik, that guy goes hard.
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:29.560]   That guy goes really hard and it's great.
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:34.000]   He crosses all the lines and that's why he's a genius.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.440]   And that's what people, feels refreshing when he does it.
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:38.280]   I don't know what it is.
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:40.520]   But then it's hurtful when I do it.
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:42.040]   But I'll tell you something that was interesting.
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:46.760]   I'm pretty sure Anthony doesn't like,
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:49.240]   sorry for the assumption, but just,
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:52.500]   most comedians I know didn't vote for Trump.
[01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:56.120]   - That's interesting.
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:58.300]   - Not saying there aren't comedians that did,
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:36:59.140]   but just the ones I know,
[01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:00.240]   'cause I live in California, right?
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:02.240]   - But they have an appreciation for Trump
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:04.040]   'cause of the sense of humor.
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:06.160]   Gotta ask you about parlor engineering,
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:07.480]   'cause I'm interested about that.
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:08.640]   - Doom, doom, doom, doom.
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:12.700]   Hey man, I'm actually trying to hold it together.
[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:15.980]   You're pretty offensive towards a lot.
[01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:19.320]   - I'm not looking to be offensive.
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:20.720]   I really wanna bring people together
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:21.560]   and get these sales done.
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:24.360]   - I know, but 100% I see your vision.
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:25.200]   - How do we do that?
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:28.380]   - As somebody who care, well, don't say Jewish media
[01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:30.920]   and Jewish controlled media.
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:31.760]   - JM.
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:38.320]   - Like, man, you sound like,
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:42.800]   it sounds too much like 1930s Nazi Germany
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:44.760]   that was leading up to the atrocities.
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:47.160]   - Oh, he would say JM?
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:49.840]   - Yeah, he was a brand of JM, that's right.
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:53.240]   No, it's just the implied,
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:56.480]   like this memefied
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:02.540]   prejudice towards a group
[01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:04.680]   in a way that's going to lead to hate.
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:06.240]   And I know you don't mean that.
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:08.200]   I know you have love in your heart.
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:09.040]   That's what I'm trying to--
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:09.860]   - You know what was the prejudice
[01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:11.840]   towards a group that led to hate?
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:12.760]   BLM.
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:16.380]   BLM took a black person,
[01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:20.300]   showed his death on camera,
[01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:25.160]   because okay, there are examples
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:29.700]   of us being killed and being killed on camera,
[01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:31.560]   but if it was spread on camera,
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:35.320]   it was done on purpose by the media,
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:40.320]   because 14, 20 kids get killed in Chicago every week,
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:45.680]   and it's not spread that much.
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:50.240]   They, like you said, singled out a person,
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:54.560]   directed everything on that person, right, as the martyr,
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:59.160]   and raised the people that hadn't had any.
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:00.840]   We didn't have our 40 acres and a mule.
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:03.920]   We didn't have a lot of things, right,
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:05.960]   that black people have not ever been given.
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:07.860]   So once we're given just a little bit,
[01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:12.140]   your life matters, right,
[01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:16.560]   then we literally like, oh, okay, now we're being heard.
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:21.840]   But actually the death toll is up.
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:24.720]   The city where this happened
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:26.840]   has completely been turned to a war zone.
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:30.620]   It's actually something like Candace Owens
[01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:34.100]   can actually specify this better,
[01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:36.900]   but it's like its own city or something.
[01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:40.160]   Like they made it not be a part of the actual state
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:42.360]   or something, it's like DC and stuff.
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:45.200]   It's like Washington, DC now and stuff,
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:49.000]   like and that has to be from a government,
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:55.360]   you know, that's got higher level agenda
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:57.020]   written all over it.
[01:39:57.020 --> 01:40:00.300]   - Yeah, they're using the death of an individual, yeah.
[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:02.040]   - Sure, the media are.
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:04.120]   Not the Jewish media, the media.
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:05.920]   And that's the media is fucked up.
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:10.920]   That machine takes whatever tragedy
[01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:15.160]   and pushes it towards whatever narrative
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:17.320]   that gets more clicks and views and so on.
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:19.240]   Sure, and then politicians do the same.
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:21.240]   They use the media, they influence the media
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:22.280]   to tell a story.
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:26.080]   - This is a simple thing I'll put.
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:31.080]   I believe that the idea of anti-Semitism
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:37.420]   and the closeness of the Holocaust
[01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:44.740]   is used by certain individuals in media
[01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:51.620]   to not take accountability for the bad things
[01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:53.900]   that are happening.
[01:40:53.900 --> 01:40:58.000]   And what's happening is there's a new frontier, right?
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.520]   Meaning like it used to be okay for somebody
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:02.480]   to be a billionaire.
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:06.400]   We thought about a billionaire, right?
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:07.880]   A lot of times you think of actually kind of
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:10.400]   being out of shape and you know, 20 years ago,
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:13.720]   30 years ago, like Onassis or something like,
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:14.640]   you thought about it a different way.
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:15.480]   Now you think about a billionaire,
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:19.000]   you think about Elon, you think Kim, you think Ye,
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.960]   you think it's a new kind of billionaire.
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:23.840]   It's not just Soros who's a billionaire.
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:25.740]   It's a new form of billionaire.
[01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:30.580]   Well, right now what I'm calling for the industry
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:33.980]   is I'm calling the industry out and saying like,
[01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:38.340]   "Hey, it just so happens that there's been times
[01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:40.800]   "where I had my lawyer was Jewish,
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:41.860]   "my regulator was Jewish."
[01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:45.060]   But like eight people that basically would collude
[01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:48.580]   and talk without me were in groups saying,
[01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:50.140]   "Okay, this is what the tour is gonna be.
[01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:51.260]   "This is this next house."
[01:41:51.260 --> 01:41:52.900]   And they were making all these decisions
[01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:54.980]   and they're making all this money.
[01:41:54.980 --> 01:41:55.820]   And at the end, I was like,
[01:41:55.820 --> 01:41:57.460]   "I ended my tour and I don't have the money."
[01:41:57.460 --> 01:41:59.660]   And it just so happens that that's the case,
[01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:00.500]   that what they were.
[01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:03.880]   But what I'm saying is if everyone can say,
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:06.740]   "Hey, you can't point out this fact
[01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:08.660]   "or we're gonna say you're anti-Semitic
[01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:10.580]   "and we're gonna call you Hitler."
[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:15.580]   I feel that there has to be at least 1% of safeguarding
[01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:19.620]   the ability to screw the artist
[01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:22.300]   based on saying it's anti-Semitic
[01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:27.080]   by pointing out that they just so happen to all be Jewish.
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:30.420]   And I don't think that's anti-Semitism.
[01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:33.060]   I just think that's, "Hey, this is another thing."
[01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:37.020]   Like, okay, the Kardashians, when you hear that,
[01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:40.140]   do you think male or do you think female?
[01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:41.580]   You think female.
[01:42:41.580 --> 01:42:42.420]   You get what I'm saying?
[01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:43.880]   You think this is the realities.
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:45.660]   This is why rap works, right?
[01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:50.160]   They're gonna make an anti-women thing in a second, right?
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:51.000]   And it's gonna say,
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.220]   "So if you point out that these five women, six women
[01:42:55.220 --> 01:42:57.760]   "are having a meeting on where the Christmas party is
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:00.160]   "and none of the ballplayers or rappers
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:02.800]   "that they have babies with have any say so,
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:05.160]   "so that Christmas happened at Kourtney's house
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:07.280]   "all eight years when I was there
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:09.120]   "and it never happened at anyone else's
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:12.680]   "black family house, right?"
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:14.420]   If I'm the one that pointed it out,
[01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:17.120]   they just don't have their,
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:21.180]   all your anti-Semitic word to say, "Shut the fuck up."
[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:22.020]   Yeah, but--
[01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:23.140]   'Cause this is the way it runs
[01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:23.980]   and this is the way we wanna do it.
[01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:28.980]   If you say that women are silencing the black voice,
[01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:33.060]   yes, you're gonna get the same response,
[01:43:33.060 --> 01:43:36.060]   but especially if it historically resonates--
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:38.820]   But what about the fact that it's true?
[01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:43.660]   When you talk in groups, that breeds hate.
[01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:46.340]   When you talk about individuals, it solves problems.
[01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:48.260]   You're an engineering.
[01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:51.140]   Okay, but this is something I pointed out on Pierce.
[01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:55.260]   I said, if a black person gets pulled over with a car
[01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:57.080]   and it's three other people in the car,
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:59.620]   they're also going to jail.
[01:43:59.620 --> 01:44:02.220]   They're not going to single them out.
[01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:04.780]   They're gonna say, "You guys are all in collusion."
[01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:09.780]   I just described collusion five times in this interview
[01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:14.380]   and you keep on going back to this is like 1930,
[01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:16.860]   this is like this, this is like that.
[01:44:16.860 --> 01:44:20.340]   What I'm saying is, look, I want to work with you
[01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:24.180]   as an engineer to free my people.
[01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:26.220]   Can we start as a being
[01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:28.420]   with engineer opportunities right here?
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:33.300]   I am sorry to the people who had to be hurt
[01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:35.760]   and affected by that.
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:40.760]   Now we are here and I'm looking to solve it.
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:43.580]   But what happens is every time,
[01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:46.780]   if I talk to any of these business people one by one,
[01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:48.740]   'cause mind you, I didn't get to the tweet
[01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:50.580]   by not having a conversation.
[01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:52.580]   I had the conversations beforehand
[01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:54.060]   before I got to the tweet.
[01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:56.620]   Now we're gonna take it to the stage.
[01:44:56.620 --> 01:44:58.860]   Now we're on the world stage, right?
[01:44:58.860 --> 01:45:03.200]   And you saw Ari Emanuel do exactly the kind of thing
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:05.820]   that I was saying had been done behind closed doors.
[01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:08.280]   Now he's doing it and open doors.
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:13.280]   They told Candace Owens, "I couldn't be on the daily wire."
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:16.460]   You can't even explain yourself.
[01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:19.660]   And we don't care how you got to that point either.
[01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:21.740]   And that's fucked up.
[01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:23.900]   - They told Candace you can't be on daily wire?
[01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:25.860]   - It's not even about, yes, she did.
[01:45:25.860 --> 01:45:27.260]   That's what they said.
[01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:28.580]   And you know what?
[01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:30.460]   And you can have my voice raised or lower.
[01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:31.740]   I'm gonna do it lower, right?
[01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:33.920]   Because what's happening to me by,
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:37.240]   I'll put it in your words, the media is saying,
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:42.220]   not only can you not explain yourself,
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:44.540]   we don't care how you got to that point,
[01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:47.260]   you need to apologize and you can't explain.
[01:45:47.260 --> 01:45:48.800]   And that's the end of the story.
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:50.780]   So just apologize so we can have Mel Gibson
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:52.560]   do some more films.
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:55.140]   It's exactly what Ari Emanuel was saying.
[01:45:55.140 --> 01:45:58.380]   No one is looking to change the problem
[01:45:58.380 --> 01:46:02.220]   that led so many people to that same level of frustration.
[01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:03.660]   And I just so happen to be the one
[01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:07.820]   that's not gonna back up on it until this changes.
[01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:09.180]   'Cause you know what?
[01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:11.220]   I'm sorry I had a sleepy text.
[01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:13.720]   I'm sorry I wrote, I'm sorry,
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:18.720]   I'm sorry that I put, that I was 5'12" or 5'11" on Tinder.
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:24.540]   Okay, my cock is not 14 inches.
[01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:25.780]   I lied, okay?
[01:46:25.780 --> 01:46:27.300]   It's only 13.
[01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:29.340]   So I'm sorry, right?
[01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:32.380]   So the-- (laughs)
[01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:34.700]   - Why are you dropping so many facts today?
[01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:37.420]   - So what I'm saying is, but where do we get to this?
[01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:41.820]   'Cause even you, as engineering, as intelligent as you are,
[01:46:41.820 --> 01:46:45.620]   you, just like everyone else that I say was colluding,
[01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:48.660]   won't let us get to the point of fixing it.
[01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:51.740]   - But I'm not, I think you're more powerful than the media.
[01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:54.300]   I'm not saying you need to apologize because the media.
[01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:56.620]   I'm saying everything we've been talking about,
[01:46:56.620 --> 01:46:58.980]   just 'cause I care for you and I want you to be
[01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:01.740]   the best possible man you can be.
[01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:03.820]   To me, a definition of a great man,
[01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:05.700]   I'm with Martin Luther King on this.
[01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:08.500]   You don't talk about Jews or black people.
[01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:10.540]   You talk about engineering, you talk about humanity,
[01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:11.700]   you solve problems.
[01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:13.420]   You identify the problems in the world
[01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:15.820]   and you don't come from a place of resentment.
[01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:18.980]   This group did this, this, fuck all that.
[01:47:18.980 --> 01:47:20.340]   That is in the past.
[01:47:20.340 --> 01:47:22.220]   You just build solutions.
[01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:23.900]   I'm gonna create a new record label.
[01:47:23.900 --> 01:47:25.460]   I'm gonna create a new design firm.
[01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:27.420]   I'm gonna create a new social network.
[01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:29.340]   I'm gonna do it better, I'm gonna do it right.
[01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:31.140]   I'm gonna do it right by the people that I know
[01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:31.980]   don't have a voice.
[01:47:31.980 --> 01:47:34.460]   I'm gonna give 'em a voice and talk about that.
[01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:36.660]   Is it okay to call out collusion?
[01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:38.740]   Do people collude in your business under you?
[01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:40.980]   Like the engineers, they come together and say,
[01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:42.860]   they collude against the bosses, right?
[01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:44.860]   You know why Bernard Arnault offered the deal
[01:47:44.860 --> 01:47:46.180]   and took it away from me?
[01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:47.020]   Collusion.
[01:47:47.020 --> 01:47:49.740]   Because I was too powerful
[01:47:49.740 --> 01:47:51.780]   with the collective that I had right there.
[01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:53.660]   He had to stop that at all costs.
[01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:56.700]   They said, for whatever reason, this kid, yay,
[01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:59.660]   it has the ability to have all of the Kardashians,
[01:47:59.660 --> 01:48:03.540]   Jay-Z and Beyonce, Justin Bieber, Demna, Virgil,
[01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:05.660]   all these people in the same room
[01:48:05.660 --> 01:48:07.940]   working towards the same goal.
[01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:11.540]   I've been that person since preschool.
[01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:13.340]   That's called a leader, right?
[01:48:13.340 --> 01:48:16.140]   And right now, what I'm saying is,
[01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:20.500]   hey, for the people in business,
[01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:21.660]   whatever their background is,
[01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:25.140]   whether they turn their cell phones off on Friday or not,
[01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:27.820]   there's been some bad business done,
[01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:29.460]   there's some bad business practices,
[01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:31.060]   and we have to change that
[01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:34.820]   because this game is like boxing.
[01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:37.340]   More people end up retarded than rich.
[01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:42.580]   And I'm saying like, beat to a pulp, driven crazy,
[01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:44.300]   beat by the media to a pulp.
[01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:47.300]   Right now, the media has done everything they could
[01:48:47.300 --> 01:48:50.580]   to make me apologize and to make me look crazy.
[01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:53.100]   And that one person has done anything
[01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:57.260]   to find out why I was frustrated enough to do that tweet,
[01:48:57.260 --> 01:49:00.460]   and that's facts, and that's fucked up.
[01:49:00.460 --> 01:49:02.900]   - Well, I was hoping to, I am finding out.
[01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:05.780]   We found out, but I want solutions.
[01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:07.460]   See, there's something about human nature
[01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:09.780]   where if you focus too much on resentment--
[01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:11.620]   - We're not focusing on it anymore.
[01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:13.900]   Fuck the resentment, we're moving forward.
[01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:16.020]   - Right, so there's two things I think
[01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:17.460]   that are required for, I mean,
[01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:20.060]   this is how I've lived my life, for great engineering.
[01:49:20.060 --> 01:49:23.520]   You surround yourself in your personal life
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:25.620]   by people you trust.
[01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:27.580]   And then in your professional life,
[01:49:27.580 --> 01:49:28.900]   from the engineering perspective,
[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:32.420]   with the team, with an incredible team.
[01:49:32.420 --> 01:49:33.580]   And everything else doesn't matter.
[01:49:33.580 --> 01:49:35.940]   That allows you not to focus on other groups,
[01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:37.500]   how they're fucking you over,
[01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:39.740]   how they're trying to manipulate you,
[01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:41.020]   collude and all that kind of stuff.
[01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:42.940]   You focus on solutions, and you find a way
[01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:44.620]   around all the difficult shit.
[01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:46.280]   That's it.
[01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:48.420]   If you have people in your life you can trust,
[01:49:48.420 --> 01:49:51.280]   that's lifelong.
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:54.380]   You said some people you're with for the summer,
[01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:56.660]   for a year, find people you can be with
[01:49:56.660 --> 01:49:58.060]   for your whole life.
[01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:00.780]   Do you have people in your life that you trust?
[01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:01.780]   Like really trust?
[01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:04.060]   - No, I trust God.
[01:50:04.060 --> 01:50:07.680]   At any point, a human being,
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:14.820]   if I go and really treat this guy like a piece of shit
[01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:21.020]   or do this, da-da-da, am I supposed to trust him
[01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:23.740]   to be loyal and stay in the situation?
[01:50:23.740 --> 01:50:25.260]   No, I trust people to be people,
[01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:26.940]   and people are flawed.
[01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:28.860]   And people can have the right intentions,
[01:50:28.860 --> 01:50:31.580]   but it only makes sense for us to work together
[01:50:31.580 --> 01:50:33.800]   when our agendas align.
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:38.800]   When Kim was pulled really far to the left,
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:42.540]   our agendas no longer aligned.
[01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:45.900]   So that made the marriage impossible.
[01:50:45.900 --> 01:50:48.380]   It aligned where it's like, oh, I could wear a red hat,
[01:50:48.380 --> 01:50:50.780]   that can help her to get Alice Johnson out of jail
[01:50:50.780 --> 01:50:53.220]   because Trump's willing to do that for my wife
[01:50:53.220 --> 01:50:56.740]   because I was the only person in my position
[01:50:56.740 --> 01:50:59.140]   that stood up and said, "Wait a sec, I like you."
[01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:01.620]   - But isn't there a deeper agenda,
[01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:03.860]   the human agenda of just being in love?
[01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:08.300]   What you're talking about, red hat is just politics, right?
[01:51:08.300 --> 01:51:10.140]   - I mean, the world is becoming more and more
[01:51:10.140 --> 01:51:12.260]   transactional every day, and actually,
[01:51:12.260 --> 01:51:16.260]   marriages were actually originally based on transactions.
[01:51:16.260 --> 01:51:17.980]   And that's why they're less needed,
[01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:20.180]   the more autonomous as we come.
[01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:21.860]   Or the world makes it less needed.
[01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:23.420]   I feel like we do need each other.
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:25.120]   I feel like we do need someone.
[01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:28.120]   We can always count on.
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:31.740]   It's like, I'm yay, pulled away by Kim Cooper,
[01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:34.600]   which is the media, the politics, the promise,
[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:35.660]   oh, we're gonna keep you safe.
[01:51:35.660 --> 01:51:39.900]   So the reason why I get really frustrated
[01:51:39.900 --> 01:51:44.460]   with Kris Jenner is she says losing Rob Kardashian
[01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:46.700]   was the greatest mistake of her life,
[01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:49.540]   but she never gave Kim's hand over in marriage
[01:51:49.540 --> 01:51:51.540]   because this is the bottom line.
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:56.120]   When me and Kim met, we were millionaires or whatever,
[01:51:56.120 --> 01:52:00.080]   you're telling me you just hand her hand over in marriage
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:02.440]   that your daughter's not successful,
[01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:04.920]   handing your hand over in marriage to,
[01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:07.480]   but no, she had to still be the husband
[01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:09.040]   to all of her daughters.
[01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:13.000]   And we see what the results are consistently.
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.200]   So that's where I get frustrated.
[01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:20.640]   It's like, let that go, let this person do
[01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:22.580]   what you made mistakes on.
[01:52:22.580 --> 01:52:24.740]   Don't make this person relive those same mistakes
[01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:27.220]   and then put that agenda into my daughters too.
[01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:31.320]   - Is there somebody in your life close to you
[01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:35.540]   that you trust enough to call you out on your bullshit?
[01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:37.940]   We're all full of shit sometimes.
[01:52:37.940 --> 01:52:39.180]   - What's my bullshit?
[01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:42.740]   - Well, some of it I pointed out today,
[01:52:42.740 --> 01:52:44.700]   but I don't know you deeply enough.
[01:52:44.700 --> 01:52:45.540]   - What was the bullshit?
[01:52:45.540 --> 01:52:46.660]   - Jewish media, Jewish--
[01:52:46.660 --> 01:52:48.540]   - That's not bullshit.
[01:52:48.540 --> 01:52:50.460]   The bullshit is that the Jewish media
[01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:51.300]   won't admit--
[01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:52.680]   - Your dad was right.
[01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:53.740]   Your dad was right.
[01:52:53.740 --> 01:52:56.880]   The words you used, you weren't--
[01:52:56.880 --> 01:52:59.000]   - And I said it, you're not gonna make me say it
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.540]   800 more times.
[01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:02.720]   - I don't know if it resonated,
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:04.840]   'cause you keep saying the words--
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:06.400]   - Did it resonate to y'all that y'all
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:07.840]   ain't do nothing about it?
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:10.720]   And that all y'all wanna do is have somebody apologize
[01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:13.100]   and sweep under the rug your bullshit
[01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:15.520]   that you've been doing the whole time.
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:18.000]   You own the same bullshit as the other people.
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:22.040]   So you're doing the same thing that the other,
[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:25.700]   let's say media, 'cause I'm not allowed to say, has done.
[01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:27.280]   So until somebody stands up--
[01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:28.480]   - Which is what, man?
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:29.600]   Which is what?
[01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:32.120]   I'm trying to call you out on your bullshit,
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:34.440]   'cause I hope I'm somebody you can trust.
[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:36.440]   That's it. - I don't fucking trust you.
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:40.480]   - Well, you should find people in your life you can trust.
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:42.080]   - Don't tell me what I should do.
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:44.760]   I'm not one of your BLM marchers.
[01:53:44.760 --> 01:53:47.240]   - Listen, I'm with you on the BLM.
[01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:50.960]   A lot of organizations use tragedy.
[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:54.620]   And I watched the Candace Owens documentary.
[01:53:54.620 --> 01:53:57.680]   - And what was your take on it?
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:53:59.200]   - I think it's important to question
[01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:02.520]   the mainstream narratives, but I don't agree with it.
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:06.840]   I still believe that George Floyd died
[01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:11.400]   from the knee of the cop, not from fentanyl.
[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:13.700]   - And even if that was the case,
[01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:17.380]   there's still 50% of black deaths is actually abortion.
[01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:22.460]   So let's get into engineering.
[01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:23.700]   Let's just go, 'cause that's--
[01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:24.540]   - How do you fix that?
[01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:26.640]   - Population control is social engineering.
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:30.860]   And it's most literal form.
[01:54:30.860 --> 01:54:35.900]   The blacks are under population control.
[01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:39.220]   That's something that, I mean, that's just what it is.
[01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:41.500]   - African Americans are not choosing to get the abortion.
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:42.340]   I mean, it's a choice.
[01:54:42.340 --> 01:54:43.600]   It's an individual choice.
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:45.160]   But we're being influenced to.
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:48.660]   - Well, then speak to the community and help.
[01:54:48.660 --> 01:54:50.420]   I mean, I don't know what the engineering solutions
[01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:51.260]   there are.
[01:54:51.260 --> 01:54:54.860]   It could be you're doing that in part
[01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:57.180]   by speaking to the value and the power of family.
[01:54:57.180 --> 01:54:59.060]   - Well, watch this.
[01:54:59.060 --> 01:55:02.940]   I was building shelters.
[01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:06.420]   I bought land in Calabasas.
[01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:09.060]   I bought two ranches in Wyoming.
[01:55:09.060 --> 01:55:13.180]   300 acres in Calabasas, 12,000 acres in total in Wyoming.
[01:55:13.780 --> 01:55:16.520]   And I started building ideas for shelters.
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:21.120]   And God set it on my heart to make monasteries,
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:24.120]   which would be modern day facilities
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:28.580]   that don't turn people down, that have farms,
[01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:32.360]   that have shelter, clothing.
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:33.920]   But first of all, water.
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:36.240]   First of all, knowledge.
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:39.440]   Because knowledge is the most important resource
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:41.800]   to our species above water.
[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:44.920]   Knowledge itself.
[01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:46.420]   Because then you can go get water.
[01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:47.760]   I mean, you can argue like if you're a baby,
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:48.600]   how do you get water?
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:51.420]   But the baby doesn't have it.
[01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:56.420]   So someone with the knowledge then feeds the baby the water.
[01:55:56.420 --> 01:56:02.600]   But it's important that those with the knowledge
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:06.420]   teach the baby how to find the water themselves.
[01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:10.220]   And the business people that I've been dealing with
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:11.900]   have been keeping the baby sick
[01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:16.140]   by not sharing the information and the knowledge
[01:56:16.140 --> 01:56:17.900]   with inside of those contracts.
[01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:20.620]   My people are sick.
[01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:24.660]   If I load up Apple Music right now
[01:56:24.660 --> 01:56:28.580]   and I play the top songs in the rap chart,
[01:56:28.580 --> 01:56:31.540]   I would tell you my people are sick.
[01:56:31.540 --> 01:56:35.560]   If I go to the restaurants in Opportunity Zones
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:38.780]   and we look at the calorie rating and the cholesterol,
[01:56:38.780 --> 01:56:42.060]   I would tell you that my people are sick.
[01:56:42.060 --> 01:56:44.940]   If we look at the obesity rate,
[01:56:44.940 --> 01:56:47.620]   if you go to just a restaurant
[01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:50.380]   somewhere in middle America, Denny's or something,
[01:56:50.380 --> 01:56:52.180]   I went to Denny's the other day,
[01:56:52.180 --> 01:56:54.440]   you would see that my people are sick.
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:56.500]   And my people meaning all people, right?
[01:56:56.500 --> 01:56:59.580]   But black people are very influential to all people.
[01:56:59.580 --> 01:57:04.580]   So right, if the media picks a overweight black woman
[01:57:04.580 --> 01:57:07.180]   and says this is body goals,
[01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:12.180]   then the media are influencing my people to stay sick.
[01:57:12.180 --> 01:57:17.440]   And it just so happens that that night,
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:20.500]   I was so frustrated after 20 years
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:24.980]   that I had to call it out in one tweet.
[01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:28.620]   That now, even if I say, hey, okay,
[01:57:28.620 --> 01:57:30.500]   I was frustrated for these reasons,
[01:57:30.500 --> 01:57:32.080]   now it's not good enough.
[01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:35.380]   You've literally tried to make me re-apologize
[01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:39.140]   10 times in this meeting, re-say this, re-say that,
[01:57:39.140 --> 01:57:42.820]   but it doesn't change the fact that my people are sick
[01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:44.580]   and I'm the only person in my position
[01:57:44.580 --> 01:57:46.600]   that will say that my people are sick.
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:50.140]   Today, not 30 years ago, not 60 years,
[01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:51.780]   my people are sick today.
[01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:55.660]   50% of my people's deaths are abortion today.
[01:57:55.660 --> 01:57:58.820]   My people don't have the opportunities today,
[01:57:58.820 --> 01:58:00.020]   even to the point that,
[01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:02.240]   because if JP Morgan had been nice to me
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:04.060]   and if Alex Klein, a STEM player,
[01:58:04.060 --> 01:58:05.940]   had been fair to me at different things,
[01:58:05.940 --> 01:58:06.980]   then I wouldn't even point it out
[01:58:06.980 --> 01:58:09.940]   that we don't have any black, we have two black engineers.
[01:58:09.940 --> 01:58:12.260]   So I have to have a responsibility,
[01:58:12.260 --> 01:58:16.300]   obviously to all people, but specifically to my tribe,
[01:58:16.300 --> 01:58:20.580]   because tribes, tribes move.
[01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:22.380]   Tribalism is real with black people.
[01:58:22.380 --> 01:58:25.280]   To separate the brightest from the tribe
[01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:26.580]   or to separate the leaders,
[01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:29.940]   it is factual that the CIA removed the leaders
[01:58:29.940 --> 01:58:33.080]   from the black community, put crack in the communities,
[01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:34.420]   put guns in the communities,
[01:58:34.420 --> 01:58:37.820]   and locked up all the leaders and called them gangly.
[01:58:37.820 --> 01:58:40.180]   Locked up all the leaders, locked up all the fathers.
[01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:45.180]   Now 72% of black mothers are raising children by themselves.
[01:58:45.180 --> 01:58:48.060]   This is a gender like a Tuskegee experiment
[01:58:48.060 --> 01:58:50.060]   set on my people.
[01:58:50.060 --> 01:58:51.860]   And what I'm calling out
[01:58:51.860 --> 01:58:54.460]   for the black people in entertainment is,
[01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:56.700]   what are we doing?
[01:58:56.700 --> 01:58:58.140]   We have to collude.
[01:58:58.140 --> 01:59:00.620]   And if we don't collude, because even if I said,
[01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:04.220]   "Hey, I'd like to make a company that's all black."
[01:59:04.220 --> 01:59:07.400]   Right, is that okay for me to say?
[01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:08.960]   Is that okay for me to say?
[01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:10.920]   Or is that anti-Semitic?
[01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:13.580]   See, if I hadn't crossed the line so far,
[01:59:13.580 --> 01:59:16.280]   then that would have sounded anti-Semitic.
[01:59:16.280 --> 01:59:18.600]   Now I've stretched a bit.
[01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:22.040]   So now we can go to, okay, let's make an all black company.
[01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:25.080]   But that would have been anti-Semitic.
[01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:26.040]   Just that concept.
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:27.800]   'Cause you could word that in a different way
[01:59:27.800 --> 01:59:29.960]   that would sound anti-Semitic.
[01:59:29.960 --> 01:59:30.800]   - I don't know, man.
[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:32.140]   I have to be-- - No, no, listen.
[01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:33.900]   If I said I didn't wanna have
[01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:35.540]   the Jewish people in the company,
[01:59:35.540 --> 01:59:36.900]   would that be anti-Semitic?
[01:59:36.900 --> 01:59:39.760]   It would sound like it, right?
[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:41.900]   You'd say I'm from 1930s, right?
[01:59:41.900 --> 01:59:43.860]   But for me as a tribe to say,
[01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:45.620]   "No, I want an all black company."
[01:59:45.620 --> 01:59:48.500]   - I'm generally against that kind of thing.
[01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:50.140]   But first of all, you have the right
[01:59:50.140 --> 01:59:51.300]   to do whatever the hell you want.
[01:59:51.300 --> 01:59:52.500]   This is America. - Well, what I'm saying is,
[01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:55.820]   that's what I feel may need to happen
[01:59:55.820 --> 01:59:58.000]   for my people to have power again.
[01:59:58.000 --> 01:59:59.900]   Because when my people have been left
[01:59:59.900 --> 02:00:03.380]   under the media's control, we've been made sick.
[02:00:03.380 --> 02:00:04.540]   We've been allowed to be sick.
[02:00:04.540 --> 02:00:06.700]   We've been promoted, and we're promoting sickness.
[02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:09.520]   - I think, at least in the engineering realm,
[02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:14.060]   I haven't met an engineer who happens to be black
[02:00:14.060 --> 02:00:16.420]   who would like to be called a black engineer.
[02:00:16.420 --> 02:00:19.060]   And when you have a company of all black people
[02:00:19.060 --> 02:00:21.580]   that are engineers, I don't know the creative arts,
[02:00:21.580 --> 02:00:23.760]   I apologize, but engineering,
[02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:28.320]   they really try to look at each other as humans
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:29.980]   and look at the problem.
[02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:32.840]   And you want to know, you want to have the confidence
[02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:36.280]   that everybody on the team is the best possible person
[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:37.120]   for the job.
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:40.940]   - What I can say is, the world is sick.
[02:00:40.940 --> 02:00:46.880]   And I have slight images of utopia,
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:50.280]   slight images of happiness,
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:54.320]   slight images as a visionary and a creator.
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:58.320]   And I know for a fact, the way that business deals
[02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:02.840]   have been done for me are keeping the world sick.
[02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:05.440]   - Fix 'em.
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:08.760]   I see that's what you're trying to do.
[02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:13.520]   And you probably, listen, people should not doubt, yay.
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:15.620]   But I gotta tell you, I have to be honest,
[02:01:15.620 --> 02:01:20.160]   this is silly 'cause you don't know me,
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:22.120]   but it hurt when you say you don't trust me.
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:23.960]   You kinda lost me.
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:26.160]   I don't think anyone's ever said that to me.
[02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:29.320]   I don't know, man.
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:31.040]   Fuck that.
[02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:33.920]   I don't care about views or clickbait
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:35.120]   or any of that bullshit.
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:40.000]   I just thought you were one of the greatest artists ever.
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.440]   It'd be cool to talk to you.
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:44.880]   And I just, I feel like you got pain you're working through.
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:47.000]   And never had anyone say that to me.
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.560]   Maybe I'm just being a mess about it, I guess.
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:50.880]   That's fucked up though.
[02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:52.920]   But maybe it's not, maybe you shouldn't trust it,
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:55.080]   but I just haven't had that experience.
[02:01:55.080 --> 02:01:57.280]   - Yeah, do you think I would trust
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:01:59.000]   anybody at this point in my life?
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.760]   - Yeah, it's tough.
[02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:03.060]   It's tough, it's tough, I hear you.
[02:02:03.060 --> 02:02:07.340]   And it's also kind of good to see how much strength you got.
[02:02:07.340 --> 02:02:09.120]   You're not broken by any of this.
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:11.400]   You're under a lot of attack,
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:15.200]   a lot of attack by a lot of people.
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:17.560]   You have a vision and you're trying to feel
[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:18.560]   your way through it.
[02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:20.960]   And you might get destroyed for it.
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:24.040]   That's the human, that's the risk you take.
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:27.840]   - It's a wonderful life though.
[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:29.920]   - What do you hope your legacy is?
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:30.920]   - To be forgotten.
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:33.800]   - You think you'll be forgotten?
[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:36.680]   - 'Cause the memory, there's ego and memory.
[02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:38.400]   And the memories.
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:41.320]   Who designed the sidewalk?
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:42.720]   Who designed the water fountain?
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:44.440]   Who designed the stop sign?
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:46.840]   Who designed the stoplight?
[02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:49.000]   These things are so ubiquitous
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.200]   that the person that designed them is forgotten.
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:58.160]   If it's a good idea, it's a God idea.
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:01.220]   And no VCs can own it.
[02:03:01.220 --> 02:03:06.520]   - So you want your designs in all realms of life
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:11.520]   to be so simple that they permeate everything.
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:16.120]   They take over and you are forgotten.
[02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:18.800]   That's a successful design is you're forgotten.
[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:19.640]   - Yes.
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:21.600]   - Do you have advice for people?
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:24.760]   A lot, a lot, a lot of young people look up to you.
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:26.520]   Do you have advice for young people
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:29.800]   of how to live a life they can be proud of?
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:34.280]   - Don't tweet while you're sleepy.
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:36.160]   - Take a nap?
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:39.120]   Surely there's other things.
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:40.480]   I love the humor.
[02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:43.200]   Don't take it seriously, I suppose is what that means.
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:46.800]   - Don't send sleepy tweets.
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:51.320]   Unless you buy your own social platform
[02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:53.800]   the very next week called Parler.
[02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:55.080]   But other than that,
[02:03:55.080 --> 02:03:58.040]   if you're not gonna buy your own social platform, then don't.
[02:03:58.040 --> 02:04:00.000]   - Is that why you bought Parler
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:03.520]   so you could be sleepy and send messages out into the world?
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:04.800]   I actually am really interested
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:06.400]   in the engineering aspects of Parler.
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:07.960]   Is there a vision there?
[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:10.800]   'Cause I'm also super interested in Elon buying Twitter.
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:15.800]   - I like Instagram better than Twitter.
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:20.600]   And I'm sure Mark Zuckerberg liked Instagram
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:25.600]   better than Facebook or saw how valuable that was
[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:27.440]   and he bought it.
[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:28.680]   - So you'd like to take Parler or something,
[02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:31.080]   whatever is the magic that makes Instagram work
[02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:31.920]   you wanna push it there?
[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:34.320]   - Well, I thought it was interesting how
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:38.160]   it felt like Snapchat made the Kardashians bully Instagram.
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:43.160]   - What's the point of Snapchat going to war on Instagram?
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:45.440]   - Yeah, I mean, just everyone wants to say,
[02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:47.760]   well, this is our value, Snapchat.
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:49.000]   No one wants to lose their value
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:50.480]   to someone else's value, whatever.
[02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:53.200]   And everything is just,
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:56.680]   what's the difference between permanent and temporary?
[02:04:56.680 --> 02:04:59.480]   Is this a permanent structure?
[02:04:59.480 --> 02:05:02.960]   And until God says it's not, it's like,
[02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:05.320]   nothing's permanent, our life is not permanent.
[02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:07.960]   So how do we just let go of those things?
[02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:10.560]   Even going from the name Kanye West to Ye
[02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:15.560]   was the beginning of just letting go of some things,
[02:05:15.560 --> 02:05:17.040]   of these titles.
[02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:18.800]   Like we need to remove the titles, like,
[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:22.880]   hey, if I have to leave Adidas
[02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:25.600]   and I have to go next computers,
[02:05:25.600 --> 02:05:30.600]   that may take me out of the billionaire standing altogether.
[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:34.680]   And I gotta get low for however long God says
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:37.120]   I have to get low and refocus.
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:42.120]   I've been reshaping, refocusing my staff.
[02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:43.680]   I had some people that were good
[02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:45.080]   and I had some people that weren't,
[02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:48.320]   I had too many people and I've got a vision inside of me.
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:51.200]   And I'm like, this is how I make this vision.
[02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:53.280]   I have to bring this vision to life.
[02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:56.600]   I have to bring these houses to life.
[02:05:56.600 --> 02:06:01.600]   I was talking to one of our architects on,
[02:06:01.600 --> 02:06:04.160]   you know, we're actually getting close on it.
[02:06:04.160 --> 02:06:06.560]   I've like built it a few times.
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:08.600]   I had like the domes you probably saw
[02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:13.600]   and I said, you know, how he transformed Kim's house.
[02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:16.280]   And no, we're getting there.
[02:06:16.280 --> 02:06:18.280]   - So you wanna get into architecture.
[02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:21.660]   Like you really want this to become physical reality.
[02:06:21.660 --> 02:06:23.680]   - Yes, and I've got close.
[02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:25.300]   Rome wasn't built to today.
[02:06:25.300 --> 02:06:27.720]   - Yeah, but Rome had to start somewhere.
[02:06:27.720 --> 02:06:29.620]   I gotta call you out on the advice.
[02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:31.720]   There really is a lot of people that look up to you
[02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:33.720]   and you've lived a really difficult life
[02:06:34.760 --> 02:06:36.520]   and you made it through all of it.
[02:06:36.520 --> 02:06:40.280]   What do you advise them to do?
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:41.940]   - Do everything that you feel.
[02:06:41.940 --> 02:06:47.640]   Even if you are told that it's the wrong thing.
[02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:51.040]   No, no, no, no, no, no, but not anything violent.
[02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:53.320]   - So do what you feel, say what you feel.
[02:06:53.320 --> 02:06:54.560]   Like trust your heart.
[02:06:54.560 --> 02:06:56.760]   - Yeah, trust your gut.
[02:06:56.760 --> 02:06:59.480]   Trust your instincts because that instinct
[02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:02.200]   is who God made you to be.
[02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:05.920]   Not what lines up with your life, frat brothers,
[02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:09.280]   or what lines up with what your dad wanted,
[02:07:09.280 --> 02:07:11.400]   or what lines up with your classmates.
[02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:16.120]   God has something inside of you.
[02:07:16.120 --> 02:07:17.400]   And when you walk down the street,
[02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:18.440]   you're thinking about it
[02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:20.560]   and then you just see it in the window.
[02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:22.840]   And you go down another street and you see the same thing,
[02:07:22.840 --> 02:07:24.980]   or you're thinking about a number and that number pops up,
[02:07:24.980 --> 02:07:26.760]   or you see it on a license plate.
[02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:28.120]   And that's just,
[02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:35.120]   something is trying to say, be the maximum, yay.
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:39.280]   Be the maximum you.
[02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:43.080]   And God will give you anything that you can't handle.
[02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:47.720]   So for me, everything is a yes.
[02:07:47.720 --> 02:07:49.960]   I think they say be like water.
[02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:51.400]   I know Bruce Lee said that.
[02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:55.320]   Or matter of fact, just be.
[02:07:56.320 --> 02:08:00.920]   Because we are beings with engineering opportunities.
[02:08:00.920 --> 02:08:03.280]   - Beautifully put.
[02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:04.640]   Yay.
[02:08:04.640 --> 02:08:07.920]   I have hope, I have faith that,
[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:09.080]   however this turns out,
[02:08:09.080 --> 02:08:12.000]   that you have the skill and the capacity
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000]   to really add love to the world.
[02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:15.160]   And I hope you do that.
[02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:18.320]   I really, really hope you do that.
[02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:20.720]   And we talked about the tension of that,
[02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:23.520]   the challenges and the opportunities of that.
[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:27.640]   I mean, I see how we could be of use to each other.
[02:08:27.640 --> 02:08:30.760]   You actually have a particular thing for me
[02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:33.600]   as I eject from media.
[02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:36.240]   'Cause even also, you know, I'm really big at like,
[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:38.280]   you know, burning the Phoenix too.
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:40.400]   All you know as an engineer that your cells
[02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:42.480]   completely regenerate every seven years.
[02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:45.160]   I think I rush the process a little bit.
[02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:48.040]   So I run around looking like a burn victim sometimes.
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:48.860]   - Yeah.
[02:08:48.860 --> 02:08:51.720]   But I gotta tell you, anyone I am close with,
[02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:53.760]   I work with, there has to be trust,
[02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:55.240]   there has to be love.
[02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:58.080]   And I think you've been burned quite a bit in your life.
[02:08:58.080 --> 02:09:00.800]   - Sometimes I did it myself.
[02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:02.760]   I put my hand on the stove.
[02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:06.880]   So how do we get to engineering?
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:08.540]   There's a deal to be done here.
[02:09:08.540 --> 02:09:10.480]   Not saying you're making this money off of that,
[02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:11.760]   I'm making that money off, but there's--
[02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:13.200]   - I don't care about money, by the way.
[02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:14.240]   - Same, twins.
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:16.100]   So there's dealings here.
[02:09:16.100 --> 02:09:19.480]   You got pain, I got pain,
[02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:22.800]   but we're beings with engineering opportunities.
[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:24.680]   - For a long time, I thought somebody should create
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:26.460]   a new social network.
[02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:30.720]   And it looks like great engineering could do that.
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:31.760]   - You got two at one time,
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:33.440]   from two of your homeboys at one time.
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:34.260]   - Yeah.
[02:09:34.260 --> 02:09:35.960]   And that's a great way to, I mean,
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:37.400]   you know, it can be done from scratch
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:39.300]   or it can be done anew
[02:09:39.300 --> 02:09:41.300]   with an already established platform.
[02:09:41.300 --> 02:09:42.160]   Yeah.
[02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:44.100]   I'm very excited by that possibility.
[02:09:44.100 --> 02:09:48.000]   Parlor is smaller, Twitter is larger.
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.120]   I wonder whether you can do any kind
[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:52.640]   of revolutionary engineering with a large company.
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:55.160]   If anyone can, I would say it's Elon.
[02:09:55.160 --> 02:09:58.560]   - Well, Elon can look at what we do over here.
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:02.240]   That's why I like, God does this a lot of times.
[02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:05.960]   He creates doppelgangers.
[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:08.980]   There's a lot of examples where a theory happened
[02:10:08.980 --> 02:10:10.960]   two places at one time.
[02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:14.960]   A really similar type of personality happens at one time.
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:16.280]   - It's weird, it's beautiful.
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:17.920]   It's hilarious, actually.
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:18.760]   - Yeah.
[02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:19.580]   - It's kind of humorous.
[02:10:19.580 --> 02:10:24.580]   - So we should just share every piece of information
[02:10:24.580 --> 02:10:29.740]   together as I go build Parlor
[02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:31.200]   and as he builds up Twitter
[02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:32.680]   and see how to make both those better.
[02:10:32.680 --> 02:10:36.700]   But I'll be like, hey, I'm not gonna let Snapchat bully me
[02:10:36.700 --> 02:10:40.320]   out of adding something to it that's best.
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:45.040]   It should just be the best platform possible.
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:50.040]   - That means that TikTok has amazing features.
[02:10:50.040 --> 02:10:52.640]   Twitter has amazing things about it.
[02:10:52.640 --> 02:10:54.000]   I know this girl that's like,
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:57.400]   I like Instagram better than Twitter.
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:11:00.000]   It's just, she likes it, Twitter has porn.
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:01.040]   But other than that, Instagram.
[02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:03.840]   But I was like, well, Instagram is porn also.
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:06.100]   It's like soft, it's more subtle.
[02:11:06.100 --> 02:11:11.100]   It's not telling you, it's not conservative by any means.
[02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:14.520]   - I mean, that's the thing,
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:17.080]   you have to please a lot of people with these platforms.
[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:20.640]   And I think the goal of a platform should be
[02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:25.640]   to help individuals maximize their long-term happiness
[02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:32.280]   and growth, like intellectually, spiritually,
[02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:33.760]   psychologically, all of that.
[02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:36.600]   And it's a tricky thing to figure out how to do that.
[02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:38.040]   Of course, you could just have a platform
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:39.320]   that's just strictly for fun.
[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:41.040]   I think that's where TikTok leans.
[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:45.720]   But I think there's a balance to strike.
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:47.840]   Like Twitter, there's a lot of intellectual,
[02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:49.720]   philosophical stuff going on on Twitter,
[02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:51.760]   but it somehow currently makes it too easy
[02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:54.400]   to be divisive and hateful towards each other
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:56.280]   and cancel and all that kind of stuff.
[02:11:56.280 --> 02:11:59.400]   - I think we need to have these healthy conversations.
[02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:02.640]   That's what it is, healthy conversations, healthy dialogues.
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:03.600]   That's the biggest thing.
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:07.440]   Like when I first wore the red hat,
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:10.440]   the conversation is less healthy than it is today.
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:15.040]   The conversation about George Floyd,
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:18.400]   it's like, did I send the tweet the right way?
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:22.320]   Is Candace Owens' documentary perfect?
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:25.800]   Michael Moore, is that documentary perfect?
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:28.920]   Is Century Self, is it fully accurate?
[02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:33.680]   It's two to three hours of a transmit of information
[02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:37.720]   through a particularly, usually one person's view.
[02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:41.240]   And anything you want to research,
[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:42.640]   if you're interested in it,
[02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:48.000]   you gotta look at 10 versions of it, 20 versions of it.
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:51.400]   George Floyd, we've looked at one version of that.
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:52.960]   Now we have a second.
[02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:56.880]   Well, by the time we get to the,
[02:12:56.880 --> 02:13:01.560]   I know this is like, it's not my last hoodie,
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:04.960]   but it's definitely not my first hoodie that I put on.
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:06.080]   It's like, that's how we got to it.
[02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:10.720]   Like even this particular size of zipper,
[02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:15.060]   or the fact that, for people who know,
[02:13:15.060 --> 02:13:16.800]   they know that it's like Carhartt,
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:20.720]   even though the Carhartt tag isn't there anymore,
[02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:22.880]   you just know by the shape of it, you feel it.
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:26.400]   So it abstracts, it takes into like this cubist place,
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:28.880]   like Picasso or Matisse or African cubism
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:33.000]   or Dire Straits, money for nothing and your chicks for free.
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:34.280]   Look at that. - Great band.
[02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:37.120]   I wouldn't think you could reference Dire Straits.
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:38.680]   Look at you. - That video.
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:40.960]   - Yeah, I know, it's a great video.
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:43.320]   Your encyclopedic knowledge of music is great.
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:48.160]   - I think that, you know, porn is not just sexual.
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:51.240]   That term actually relates to torture.
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:52.080]   Like, you know what I'm saying?
[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:54.840]   Like watching people beat each other up
[02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:56.640]   on Worldstar or something, you know?
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:13:58.680]   It's like, that's called torture porn.
[02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:00.680]   - There's also food porn.
[02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:01.800]   How do you explain that?
[02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:02.800]   - What's food porn?
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:05.560]   - Food porn is like looking at really delicious cakes
[02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:07.200]   and cookies and steak and so on,
[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:08.520]   and you're like, holy shit.
[02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:10.040]   - Exactly, architecture.
[02:14:10.040 --> 02:14:12.160]   Like, there's people who love architecture.
[02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:13.900]   When they see architecture, I know,
[02:14:13.900 --> 02:14:15.920]   I got friends that be like, oh, that's porn.
[02:14:15.920 --> 02:14:17.240]   - Yeah. - Architecture.
[02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:21.220]   - Yeah, yeah, it's like, that's like love,
[02:14:21.220 --> 02:14:25.040]   like dopamine-fueled love for a thing.
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:26.920]   Yeah, we need, that's beautiful.
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:28.080]   I think that's beautiful.
[02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:29.720]   - Well, I think-- - As long as nobody's
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:32.440]   getting hurt. - The intoxication
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:35.160]   that people have.
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:37.080]   You know, the worst part is like,
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:39.920]   when one person's in love and the other person's in like.
[02:14:39.920 --> 02:14:42.100]   - That's us right now.
[02:14:42.100 --> 02:14:44.320]   - Well, who's in like?
[02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:47.240]   - No, 'cause you said you love Bill Maher and you like me.
[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:50.760]   - No, and-- - And I love you,
[02:14:50.760 --> 02:14:53.360]   so that was-- - No, I actually love you both.
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:54.640]   - Right, right.
[02:14:54.640 --> 02:14:59.640]   - And the funny thing is like, as a visionary,
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:06.560]   visionaries are more extreme than business people
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:14.200]   because a visionary would do bad business for their vision.
[02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:17.640]   A business person will never do bad business.
[02:15:17.640 --> 02:15:20.440]   - It's well put, yeah, it's really well put.
[02:15:20.440 --> 02:15:21.960]   - So when you say I don't care about money,
[02:15:21.960 --> 02:15:23.240]   it's like, yeah, I feel you.
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:26.640]   Like I feel that I care in a way that I need that,
[02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:31.640]   but I care about the vision that I have
[02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:39.480]   to a Steve Jobs level to the point of putting that
[02:15:39.480 --> 02:15:46.920]   above my regular human existence,
[02:15:46.920 --> 02:15:50.480]   meaning having to go and take all the arrows
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:54.520]   that I become a soldier of the vision
[02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:59.200]   because someone could say, a wife could say to,
[02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:00.760]   like say like in the '60s,
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:03.840]   their husband's about to go to war.
[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:08.600]   The wife may not want their husband to go to war
[02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:11.640]   because of their children,
[02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:18.440]   but he's going to war because of their children.
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:23.360]   - Definitely, do you regret any aspect
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:25.800]   of just giving everything to your vision?
[02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:27.600]   I mean, you've spoken about that saying like,
[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:29.880]   I got fucked over in the business side.
[02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:34.880]   - I promise that I had to stop envying cool people
[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:43.360]   at their current cool time.
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:49.680]   If anything, if someone's cool and I say their name a lot,
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:54.840]   I'm going to flash the light on them so much
[02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:57.400]   that it ages their coolness.
[02:16:57.400 --> 02:17:02.400]   It's actually a war technique, showered in compliments.
[02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:05.660]   You know, because that, that you,
[02:17:05.660 --> 02:17:08.760]   to be able to stay at 45 years old
[02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:11.560]   and still be the bad kid in class,
[02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:14.960]   at 45, I'm still in the principal's office.
[02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:17.960]   Because if you look at like, say fashion, right?
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:20.160]   If you think of something fashionable,
[02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:22.480]   it's probably going to look like the kid
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:24.580]   in the principal's office.
[02:17:24.580 --> 02:17:26.400]   That's going to be the fashion.
[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:29.320]   And that's part of the reason why I'm the most influential
[02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:32.080]   person at fashion, in fashion,
[02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:35.520]   because I refuse to leave the principal's office.
[02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:38.080]   If the substitute teacher comes in,
[02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:40.600]   I'm going to say, you got a big butt.
[02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:41.440]   - Yeah.
[02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:43.920]   - And I'm going to get, and they're going to-
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:45.560]   - Right back to the principal's office.
[02:17:45.560 --> 02:17:47.460]   - And people are going to be like, yo.
[02:17:47.460 --> 02:17:49.600]   And that's what you keep on saying.
[02:17:49.600 --> 02:17:51.840]   Like, who can we talk to?
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:54.040]   'Cause no one can talk to me.
[02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:57.200]   No, I'm out of control, bro.
[02:17:57.200 --> 02:18:02.000]   It's just God, then me, and then fuck everybody.
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:02.820]   You know what I mean?
[02:18:02.820 --> 02:18:05.400]   That's how, that's really how I live my life.
[02:18:05.400 --> 02:18:06.600]   And I just want to say this one thing
[02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:07.440]   about the children thing.
[02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:09.920]   I wanted to, you know, put that point together,
[02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:10.760]   put that idea together.
[02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:11.920]   I don't like the word point.
[02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:14.840]   I'm really big on like words, words being powerful,
[02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:17.480]   says the person with the sleepy tweet.
[02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:18.320]   So-
[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:19.760]   - You're not afraid of little contradictions.
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:21.840]   - Yeah, I'm a human being, right?
[02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:23.640]   It's like some days I'm like,
[02:18:23.640 --> 02:18:25.560]   I could go 30 days and be celibate.
[02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:27.540]   You know, like really, like I'm a monk.
[02:18:27.540 --> 02:18:30.920]   I'm being like faithful to God.
[02:18:30.920 --> 02:18:33.180]   And then I'll go like working out, no carbs.
[02:18:33.180 --> 02:18:34.680]   Like my weight will fluctuate.
[02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:36.040]   And I'll have times I'm like,
[02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:38.720]   I don't feel like being told what to do.
[02:18:38.720 --> 02:18:40.600]   So I don't want to work out with a trainer.
[02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:42.800]   And I just want to drink this Hennessy.
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:45.520]   But I want to say this thing that I will text to Kim.
[02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:47.760]   Sometimes I'll say, you know,
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:54.120]   you may not understand what I'm doing right now,
[02:18:54.120 --> 02:18:56.200]   but you will.
[02:18:56.200 --> 02:18:58.360]   And that's what I would say to everyone.
[02:18:58.360 --> 02:19:00.940]   You may not understand what I'm doing.
[02:19:00.940 --> 02:19:04.720]   And this gives a little bit, maybe we're like 20% there,
[02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:05.880]   but there's still going to be people,
[02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:07.800]   we leave this interview and they'll be like,
[02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:09.600]   I still don't like the way he apologized.
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:13.760]   I still don't want to say what my involvement would have been
[02:19:13.760 --> 02:19:15.800]   to make him, lead him to that point.
[02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:17.680]   And we just want things to be how they are.
[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:19.160]   There's people in the world
[02:19:19.160 --> 02:19:21.480]   who want the world to stay as it is.
[02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:23.920]   And there's people who want to change the world.
[02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:25.920]   And that's happened throughout time.
[02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:29.760]   They say that with Da Vinci, halfway into a conversation,
[02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:33.520]   he could not suffer fools so much that he would walk away
[02:19:33.520 --> 02:19:35.620]   halfway into the conversation.
[02:19:35.620 --> 02:19:40.620]   And I said, well, that's why it's the Da Vinci code
[02:19:41.820 --> 02:19:43.280]   and not the Da Vinci world.
[02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:47.620]   And every time I go and piss off a group of people
[02:19:47.620 --> 02:19:50.820]   or do these things, on some end,
[02:19:50.820 --> 02:19:53.020]   it's like I could be turning my thing
[02:19:53.020 --> 02:19:55.320]   from a potential world vision to a code,
[02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:59.920]   or I could be opening up conversations with new friends
[02:19:59.920 --> 02:20:01.380]   that I may trust someday.
[02:20:01.380 --> 02:20:03.180]   - Yeah, that's beautiful.
[02:20:03.180 --> 02:20:04.020]   That's beautiful.
[02:20:04.020 --> 02:20:05.140]   (laughing)
[02:20:05.140 --> 02:20:07.420]   Because the change you will have on the world
[02:20:07.420 --> 02:20:08.900]   that you don't know for sure,
[02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:13.300]   but it'll happen across years, even decades.
[02:20:13.300 --> 02:20:15.220]   So you have to think in the future.
[02:20:15.220 --> 02:20:16.860]   Like you're working in the future.
[02:20:16.860 --> 02:20:18.740]   Your actions are working in the future.
[02:20:18.740 --> 02:20:20.820]   And a lot of people will judge this conversation
[02:20:20.820 --> 02:20:23.300]   and others you've done and so on in the present.
[02:20:23.300 --> 02:20:24.300]   And that doesn't matter.
[02:20:24.300 --> 02:20:26.620]   - You know why I apologize, why I say I'm sorry
[02:20:26.620 --> 02:20:28.880]   to the Jewish people that I hurt?
[02:20:28.880 --> 02:20:30.860]   It's not about, like I said,
[02:20:30.860 --> 02:20:35.860]   oh, I said, I'm not gonna hold this apology hostage, right?
[02:20:35.860 --> 02:20:38.480]   Obviously it's about God, but God is everything, right?
[02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:40.340]   So what's the point of having language
[02:20:40.340 --> 02:20:44.060]   and being, you can't engineer if you say God, God, God, right?
[02:20:44.060 --> 02:20:48.140]   It's like, it's God asks us to be judgmental
[02:20:48.140 --> 02:20:50.460]   so that you become, if you're a doctor, right?
[02:20:50.460 --> 02:20:53.420]   It's your judgment that saves grandma, right?
[02:20:53.420 --> 02:20:56.600]   And God puts that in this, like we have God inside us.
[02:20:56.600 --> 02:20:59.420]   We're a piece of God also, right?
[02:20:59.420 --> 02:21:01.800]   So I'm gonna go specific to a person.
[02:21:01.800 --> 02:21:08.140]   That story about Da Vinci alone is enough of a reason
[02:21:08.140 --> 02:21:11.600]   for me to give a sincere apology to the Jewish people
[02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:15.560]   because I do believe that there's a Da Vinci code
[02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:19.360]   inside of all of my misspellings and scribbles right here
[02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:24.300]   that God wants me to get to the world.
[02:21:24.300 --> 02:21:29.300]   And when I'm in my way, if God has set something on me,
[02:21:29.300 --> 02:21:31.900]   when I'm in my way, I'm in God's way.
[02:21:31.900 --> 02:21:33.480]   Now I can point at other people and say,
[02:21:33.480 --> 02:21:35.240]   hey, you guys are in God's way
[02:21:35.240 --> 02:21:36.920]   because you're not listening to me.
[02:21:36.920 --> 02:21:41.040]   But if I'm in my way, I'm not listening to God.
[02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:43.640]   And for me to be a philosopher and a leader
[02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:47.380]   or whatever other language, I have to listen to God.
[02:21:47.380 --> 02:21:51.500]   So before God, what I would do is start off as a samurai
[02:21:51.500 --> 02:21:55.300]   and say, I'm sorry for hurting you.
[02:21:55.300 --> 02:21:58.660]   As a Jewish person, I'm sorry for the way that made you feel
[02:21:58.660 --> 02:22:03.500]   and I'm sorry for the entire population of a race
[02:22:03.500 --> 02:22:05.240]   that I feel is actually my brother's
[02:22:05.240 --> 02:22:08.600]   'cause I classify and feel that I'm also connected
[02:22:08.600 --> 02:22:10.520]   with Christ in that way,
[02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:13.480]   that my people came from Africa in that way.
[02:22:13.480 --> 02:22:15.940]   And I can't say it's this exact teaching
[02:22:15.940 --> 02:22:17.280]   or that exact teaching,
[02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:19.840]   but I feel that there's an important,
[02:22:19.840 --> 02:22:22.800]   the sons of Abraham, however we wanna word it,
[02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:26.200]   for us to come together and bring our different talents
[02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:29.000]   together to serve God collectively.
[02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:34.000]   And he, as much of an alien as I am, he does not call me.
[02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:36.360]   He did not call for me to alienate.
[02:22:36.360 --> 02:22:38.780]   And that's what the problem has been,
[02:22:38.780 --> 02:22:41.720]   especially in politics and in America.
[02:22:41.720 --> 02:22:45.640]   He placed America as the TV, as the radio to the world.
[02:22:45.640 --> 02:22:47.060]   We invented rock and roll, right?
[02:22:47.060 --> 02:22:49.960]   We are the influencers of the rest of the planet.
[02:22:49.960 --> 02:22:53.060]   We're the youngest startup in history, right?
[02:22:53.060 --> 02:22:55.280]   We're the youngest country,
[02:22:55.280 --> 02:22:57.960]   we're the youngest superpower, right?
[02:22:57.960 --> 02:22:59.320]   So for me and my position,
[02:22:59.320 --> 02:23:02.200]   the fact that I can talk to Trump one day
[02:23:02.200 --> 02:23:04.640]   and be at a game with Kim Kardashian the next day
[02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:07.960]   and then be at Paris Fashion Week,
[02:23:07.960 --> 02:23:10.940]   they don't want me to be involved with language
[02:23:10.940 --> 02:23:14.760]   of decisive, divisive language,
[02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:18.240]   proving that I can be just as racist
[02:23:18.240 --> 02:23:20.400]   as a racist white person.
[02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:23.560]   Oh, I can be a racist black person also.
[02:23:23.560 --> 02:23:26.220]   That's not what God has called me to do.
[02:23:26.220 --> 02:23:28.600]   So how do I simplify and say,
[02:23:28.600 --> 02:23:33.600]   hey, to you as a visionary, as an engineer,
[02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:36.160]   as a person that's given me a platform,
[02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:39.600]   that as my brother, I wanna apologize to you
[02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:41.080]   for how that made you feel,
[02:23:41.080 --> 02:23:43.720]   and to the rest of the people
[02:23:43.720 --> 02:23:45.760]   that carry specifically that pain,
[02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:48.200]   not the pain that I talk about,
[02:23:48.200 --> 02:23:50.360]   that doesn't seem to be as much of a pain for people
[02:23:50.360 --> 02:23:53.360]   when I talk about the abortion clinics and stuff.
[02:23:53.360 --> 02:23:56.000]   That's, it's like, that's an argued pain
[02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:57.400]   even in my own community.
[02:23:57.400 --> 02:23:59.360]   Like not everyone thinks that's a pain,
[02:23:59.360 --> 02:24:01.160]   but for the Jewish community,
[02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:05.200]   it's collectively this was a pain.
[02:24:05.200 --> 02:24:10.200]   And I've gone so far just psychologically on this journey
[02:24:10.200 --> 02:24:13.320]   since that statement had happened,
[02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:17.040]   where I didn't want to like give up the candy in my pocket.
[02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:18.100]   I didn't want to say, hey,
[02:24:18.100 --> 02:24:20.440]   I stuck my hand in the candy jar.
[02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:22.460]   I wanted to defend my freedom of speech.
[02:24:22.460 --> 02:24:24.660]   I wanted this, but even with freedom of speech,
[02:24:24.660 --> 02:24:29.660]   pain is pain, causing people to hurt is not helping.
[02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:31.640]   Causing people to hurt is not helping.
[02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:36.640]   So that means I have to take a more sophisticated approach
[02:24:36.640 --> 02:24:40.400]   to engineering this problem.
[02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:42.680]   This problem is the opportunity.
[02:24:42.680 --> 02:24:45.880]   And yes, that what could,
[02:24:45.880 --> 02:24:48.180]   some people may deem as a mistake.
[02:24:48.180 --> 02:24:50.680]   Would it be more genuine if I called it a mistake?
[02:24:52.400 --> 02:24:56.980]   I think I would be hypocritical by calling it a mistake
[02:24:56.980 --> 02:24:59.460]   with the ending of that, the idea I'm going to say out loud.
[02:24:59.460 --> 02:25:02.520]   So I'm not, I don't try to be a hypocrite on purpose.
[02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:08.480]   So, but I will call it a mistake to add a genuine,
[02:25:08.480 --> 02:25:11.300]   to be genuine about the feeling.
[02:25:11.300 --> 02:25:13.680]   With that mistake,
[02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:19.480]   with me as a human being, not to justify,
[02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:23.560]   but I have to state that God makes no mistakes
[02:25:23.560 --> 02:25:25.480]   because if I hadn't made that mistake,
[02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:27.120]   I wouldn't be in front of you today.
[02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:32.120]   And that's not to justify this sleepy text.
[02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:37.000]   - But I can tell you're a man that has love in his heart.
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.760]   And I hear that, I hear it through the words,
[02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:41.400]   explicitly and implicitly.
[02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:44.020]   And I think if we're to engineer a better future,
[02:25:44.020 --> 02:25:46.460]   the way to do that is with love.
[02:25:46.460 --> 02:25:50.180]   So as one human to another, I love you, brother.
[02:25:50.180 --> 02:25:51.600]   Thank you for talking today.
[02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:52.440]   This is great.
[02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:55.520]   - I like you too.
[02:25:55.520 --> 02:25:56.480]   - Son of a bitch.
[02:25:56.480 --> 02:25:58.740]   (laughing)
[02:25:58.740 --> 02:26:02.880]   Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ye,
[02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:05.480]   formerly known as Kanye West.
[02:26:05.480 --> 02:26:06.720]   To support this podcast,

[02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:13.160]   And now let me leave you with some words from Ye himself.
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:16.880]   Nothing in life is promised except death.
[02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:20.760]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:26:20.760 --> 02:26:23.340]   (upbeat music)
[02:26:23.340 --> 02:26:25.920]   (upbeat music)
[02:26:25.920 --> 02:26:35.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
