[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300]   The plight of the modern knowledge worker is we don't
[00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.780]   have a good definition of productivity. So we think we do
[00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.540]   right? I mean, it's something like, yeah, I know what it means
[00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.440]   to be productive or not productive. But we don't
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.720]   actually have a great definition and knowledge work of what that
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.100]   means, because knowledge work is not well set up for the
[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.380]   classical definitions of what it means to be productive, right?
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.300]   So in a factory, I can measure Model T's produced per labor
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.820]   hour input, and it's a number, right? And then if you change
[00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.820]   something about how you build the Model T's, and that number
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.300]   goes up, you say this way is better, this is more productive,
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.660]   that came out of agriculture, bushels yielded per acre of land
[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.740]   if you planted your crops a different way, and that number
[00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.660]   went up, like, oh, this is a better way of doing it.
[00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.260]   Knowledge work emerges as a major sector in mid 20th
[00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.740]   century, right? The term is coined 1959. How do we define
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.060]   productivity here? Well, those did not exactly apply anymore,
[00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.860]   because individual knowledge workers weren't producing one
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.260]   thing, they were doing many things. And maybe what I'm doing
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.740]   is different than what you are doing. These are the projects I
[00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.380]   happen to have taken on, you've taken on these projects, the
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.100]   systems by which we were doing our work also are no longer
[00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.940]   transparent. So in knowledge work, how you organize yourself
[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.460]   or manage your work is personal, which is a big change, actually,
[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.940]   in the history of economic activity, but it's personal
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.220]   productivity. So there's nothing to even improve in an obvious
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.780]   way. So we couldn't use standard definitions of productivity. So
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.900]   what do we do instead? We said, let's use visible activity as a
[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.460]   proxy for doing useful effort, which is just a veneer of
[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.260]   productivity, the appearance of productivity, the pseudo
[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.980]   productivity. Exactly, right. So like, at least we'll do this. So
[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.940]   if I see you doing stuff, that's better than you not doing stuff.
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.940]   And if we need to be more productive, let's work longer
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.620]   hours, you know, come in early, stay late. That's what we had as
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.980]   our definition of productivity. Now, I'm a technocritic, right?
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.980]   I'm a computer scientist. So I'm always interested in how
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.820]   technology interacts with these social economic systems. My
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.540]   contention is this really went off the rails when we had the
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.900]   front office IT revolution. So now we have computers, and we
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.740]   have networks, and we have laptops, and then we get
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.980]   wireless internet. Now, suddenly, you can demonstrate
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.420]   visible activity at any point, wherever you are. The fine
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.740]   grainness of these demonstrations is much smaller,
[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.660]   right? It's now not just I see you in your office, it's I have
[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.820]   to actually be answering specific messages, and work can
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.940]   follow you wherever you go. Also, the low friction nature of
[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.300]   digital communications made potential work really skyrocket.
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.860]   So workload per worker really went up, because it was just
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.580]   much easier now for things to be put on your plate. If I can just
[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.260]   send you an email, like, hey, can you handle this? That's much
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.660]   lower friction, much less social capital costs and having to
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.140]   actually come to your office and ask you to do something. So
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.260]   workloads also spiraled. Pseudo productivity did not play well
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260]   in that environment. So if I could demonstrate busyness at
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.660]   any point in my life, and there was a never ending queue of
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.740]   work, this was going to create a crisis. Because now, every
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.220]   moment at the office or not at home, home office, now in the
[00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.940]   home office on the soccer field, wherever you are, you're
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.660]   constantly now in the psychological battle internally
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.940]   speaking between do I demonstrate more productivity or
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.940]   not, this is what I think started to burn people out. It's
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.220]   what began to create a burnout crisis and knowledge work that
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.780]   you really don't see pick up until the early 2000s. Right?
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.620]   If you look at time management books from the 1990s, look at
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.100]   you know, first things first by Stephen Covey, all optimism, all
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.420]   figure out your values, and you can carefully plan your day to
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.620]   actualize all of your best interests, like rah, rah, very
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.100]   positive. You get to 2004. David Allen's getting things done. And
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.700]   now it's how do we even find like some moments of Zen like
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.420]   peace among the onslaught? There's no everything is gone,
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.420]   except for how do we survive the onslaught? So by the 2000s,
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.220]   digital technology was cracking pseudo productivity. And so I
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.460]   think this is what began to rapidly burn out knowledge
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.580]   workers, that combination,
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.100]   and didn't necessarily translate into actual productivity or
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.980]   moving the ball forward on whatever the mission of the job
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.180]   or the corporation is,
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.820]   well, I think it made it more apparent because you began to
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.660]   get once you have these tools, these absurd situations like
[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.860]   early in the pandemic, for example, a lot of people found
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.340]   themselves in a situation that eight hours of zoom, right zoom
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.900]   after zoom after zoom after the entire day was spent talking
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.620]   about work with no time actually spent not actually doing any
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.260]   work, which is so absurd that it's like a like a Kafka play or
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.020]   something like this is some metaphor for the the nihilistic
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.100]   reality of life, but it was what people were actually doing. So
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.900]   it became hard to ignore. And that's why I think the pandemic
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.860]   was the tipping point. Finally, for a lot of people, a lot of
[00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.900]   knowledge workers, they got it got so absurd and overloaded so
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.740]   much time spent talking about work so little time actually
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.900]   doing work that people began looking in the mirror and
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.820]   saying, what am I even doing here?
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.460]   Yeah, the idea that this membrane that separates work
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.980]   from home was initially permeable seemed like a good
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.300]   thing until it became so permeable as to be non existent
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.900]   whatsoever, where there's no boundary or distinction or
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.340]   differentiation between when you're working and when you're
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.380]   not. And then you layer on top of that, this expectation of
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.980]   always being available, with the expectation that you are going
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.420]   to immediately respond to everything that's incoming. And
[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.860]   it's not just email, it's got its email, it's slack, it's DMs,
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.860]   it's LinkedIn, it's, you know, the number of inputs that people
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.980]   have and ways in which people can get in touch with you is
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.100]   overwhelming. So even yesterday, I came into the studio, I was
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.980]   like, I'm gonna get ready to talk to Cal. You know, I've been
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.460]   away for a while, I should probably check in on the, you
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.100]   know, inbox, checked email, checked, you know, checked my
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.340]   WhatsApp, responded to a whole bunch of texts. And by the time
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.500]   I was done with that, it starts over again, because there's a
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.660]   whole new tranche of replies to then get into. And then I looked
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.340]   up and it was, I got to the studio at, I don't know, 830 or
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.220]   something like that, it was three o'clock. It was like, I
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.540]   hadn't even begun to wrap my head around, like, what I wanted
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.580]   to talk to you about yet.
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.380]   Yeah, what did you create?
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.500]   Insanity. And then you spend your whole day in defense mode,
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.140]   you're not intentional about, you know, being on the offense,
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.100]   tackling the things that are most important. And then you
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.940]   leave feeling dispirited, and feeling like you didn't actually
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.180]   accomplish anything and questioning and maybe, you know,
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.180]   you and you're, are you? You're not really.
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.620]   Yeah, well, this was this is the idea of the book, right? Is why
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.340]   do we do that? Well, we don't have another workable definition
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.540]   of productivity. So for a lot of people, it's like, this is all I
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.060]   had. This is all my, my organization recognizes is
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.300]   activity, right? And this is the way you're active. In 2024, as
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.260]   you're on email, you're doing this, I don't know what else to
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.340]   if I'm not doing this, then how does anyone know I'm doing
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.660]   productive work. So the solution to all this is let's have better
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.780]   definitions of productivity. Let's have alternative ways of
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.340]   thinking about what it what it could mean to be productive,
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.540]   because I had written about, you know, I wrote a book about
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.780]   email, and how damaging it was, and how this culture was making
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.540]   everyone stupid, or it is a terrible idea. It's like turning
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.060]   the lights off in a car factory to save money on your electric
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.540]   bill. It's like you are, but people are putting the steering
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.460]   wheels, you know, on the roof, because they can't see anything.
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.620]   And that's what email was, to me, it's convenient, but it's
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.100]   destroying these companies. But why didn't people make changes,
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.260]   even if they recognize this is very damaging to people's
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.540]   psychological sustainability, we're not actually producing
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.460]   anything valuable. It's because they said, Well, what else do we
[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.980]   do? Like, how else do I? How else do I know if my, you know,
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.940]   employees are working? Like, what would productivity mean? If
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.300]   it's not accessibility? And I thought, well, we can answer
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:34.660]   that.
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.900]   So let's answer it. How do you let's begin the process of
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.580]   answering that.
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.780]   So slow productivity is much more based on producing stuff
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.740]   that's good. And it's much less based on activity. So it's
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.260]   results oriented more than it is activity focused. It has three
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:55.940]   big ideas. The first is to do fewer things, which terrifies a
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.700]   lot of people, but it shouldn't. The second is to work at a
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.140]   natural pace. So this idea which is possible in a world of
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.220]   pseudoproductivity, that you're going to just be full intensity,
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.580]   nine to five, week after week, month after month, year after
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.820]   year with no variation. Like you can you can pull that off if
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.460]   what you're doing is just lots of email. You can't pull that
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.020]   off if you're doing serious cognitive work. So we need more
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.820]   of a natural varied pace. And then finally obsess over
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.540]   quality. So counterbalance that or support that with an
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.020]   obsession over the quality of what you produce. I think that
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.220]   combination is engineered to be much more sustainable, it
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.100]   matches the human condition much better. So you can you can
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.180]   pursue that definition of productivity without by default
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.940]   burning out. And I think it's actually effective, it's going
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.020]   to produce a lot of valuable things and your, your company,
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.020]   your career, these things are going to do well.
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.620]   I want to get into each of the three. But I think before we do
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:52.100]   that, it should be pointed out that to engage with those three
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:58.260]   tenants requires at least some agency in your job, or a person
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.660]   at the top who understands this and is trying to create that
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.460]   culture beneath him or her.
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.380]   So I tried to design the ideas in this book that if you're a
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.180]   knowledge worker, even with no buy in, you can still act to
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.900]   some degree in all three principles. This was the lesson
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.460]   I learned with my last book, which was much more organized on
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.740]   what can organizations do, in this case, like the cure the
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.900]   email problem, turns out organizations just aren't willing
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.180]   to do it, or if they're willing to do it, it's too complicated,
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.940]   it's too hard. And so what I'm really focusing on here is how
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.700]   can we put these ideas into play, even if you have to do it
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.860]   without the direct consent or blessing of someone above you.
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.060]   So how does that work if your boss has a different
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:37.980]   expectation?
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.700]   So that's what we get into, like, okay, quick, get concrete.
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.940]   So alright, so early on principle number one, do fewer
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.580]   things, right? What that actually means is do fewer
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.460]   things at once. So my argument is, if you have fewer things on
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.940]   your plate at any one time, from a mental health perspective,
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.900]   it's way more sustainable, you get rid of that deranging effect
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.700]   of just I'm all I'm doing is talking about work. It also
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.380]   actually increases the rate at which things are finished.
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.620]   Because the issue with having too many things on your plate at
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.700]   the same time is that each of your commitments brings with it
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.820]   its own administrative overhead. So everything you've agreed to
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.140]   has its own little overhead tax, like emails, you have to send
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.980]   about it or meetings you have to go to. So if you have too many
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.940]   things on your plate at once, you say yes, too many times, you
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.820]   now have a huge pile of this overhead tax coming to every
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.460]   day. So more and more of your day is spent servicing the
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.420]   things in your list without actually working on it. This not
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.340]   only takes up direct time, it also fragments your day more and
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.380]   more. So your ability to actually make uninterrupted
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.660]   progress that also begins to degrade. So now the pace at
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.180]   which you're able to finish anything slows down. So yes, you
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.260]   said yes to more things. But the rate at which anything is
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.740]   getting done is actually slower. So if you can somehow
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.260]   bootstrap your way and have ideas about how to do this, but
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.660]   bootstrap your way, and then taking on fewer things at once,
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.500]   pretty soon you're gonna be rewarded for this. Because not
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.220]   only does it make your life better, but your boss or
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.300]   whoever, your clients will be like, "Hey, look at this. We're
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.540]   getting things done. This is great. Now you're a rainmaker
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.340]   over here." And so you can, if you can bootstrap that, it's
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.100]   actually gonna be pretty easy to keep going because you're gonna
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.140]   be better at what you do.
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:13.100]   What would be an example of how you would bootstrap that? You
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.460]   said you had some ideas about how would like in a very
[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.420]   concrete context.
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.220]   Yeah. So like, okay, here's the, this started as a thought
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.420]   experiment, actually, but people are trying it. So I'm now
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:25.020]   proposing this as an actual thing to do. Imagine you have a
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.460]   shared document at the top. All right, here's the projects I'm
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.020]   currently working on, like actively making progress and
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.500]   dividing line. Here's the queue of projects that I'm going to
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.580]   work on next in the order I'm going to work on them. So now
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.700]   someone comes to you and says, "Hey, like, I need you to work
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.340]   on, you know, the Johnson memo." And you say, "Great, just go to
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.860]   here's my shared work document, just, you know, throw it on
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.860]   there, make sure I point or anything I need to know, or if
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.340]   you want me to follow up with you, just let me know to do
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.380]   that." Now they have to confront the reality of your workload.
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.380]   And they say, "Oh, like Rich is working on these three things.
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.060]   There's seven other things in this queue. And a couple things
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.900]   are going to happen there. Either A, they're going to say,
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.020]   'Actually, you know what, never mind, because, you know,
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.500]   actually, you have a lot going on. It's not some vague sense of
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.020]   you saying I'm busy, I can see what you're doing, or their
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.420]   expectations will be reset. Okay, if I give this to you, it
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.540]   might be a month till I hear back because I can see what this
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.420]   whole queue is." And it allows people to understand you're only
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.460]   actively working on a few things at a time. And you can even tell
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.180]   them, "Feel free to keep checking in on here, you can
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.260]   watch your project move its way up the queue. And you'll see
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.980]   when it jumps into my active projects list, at which point
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.060]   like it would make sense to actually bother me about things."
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.420]   This was supposed to be a thought experiment, because it's
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.660]   a little bit contrived, right? People are trying it.
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:38.340]   They're doing it.
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:38.860]   They're doing it.
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.500]   But isn't the exception or reality check here, because the
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.100]   person who's calling you or emailing you and saying, "I want
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.860]   you to do this thing," is going to be higher up in the hierarchy
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.780]   of the organization. And they're going to say, they may look at
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.300]   that and they say, "Okay, but like, I need you to stop what
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.100]   you're doing and do my thing first. It takes priority."
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:58.460]   Yeah.
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.620]   Because they're answering to somebody else. And all they care
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.140]   about is making sure that the thing gets done so that they can
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.580]   report to the person above them.
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.940]   Yeah. So, in this thought experiment, you say, "Okay." You
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.580]   add it to the top, you bump something out, and you tell that
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.060]   person.
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.980]   You got to talk to the other person that I'm supposed to be
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.020]   doing this thing for?
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.260]   Yeah, yours got bumped out, but it's at the top of the list.
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.500]   It'll go back in. So, you know who actually does this very
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.540]   successfully? Software developers. So, they figured out
[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:27.420]   a long time ago, "Okay, it doesn't work well to have all
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.220]   these different features and stuff we need to add to a
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.980]   product just existing on various people's plates." Like, just
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.180]   like, "Hey, also add this feature, also add this feature,
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.180]   also add this feature."
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.500]   The idea of the stack.
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.140]   Yeah, that does not work. And so, what do software developers
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.380]   tend to do instead? These agile methodologies that all seem to
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.380]   share a similar workload distribution strategy, which is
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.860]   we will collect the stuff that needs to be done as a team
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:52.460]   centrally, not assigned to anyone yet, but not lost either.
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:56.460]   Here it is. Like, we have it as index cards on a bulletin board.
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.060]   These are all things that need to be done. And if someone comes
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.180]   up with something else that needs to be done, let's get it
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.700]   right up there so we won't forget it. Over here, we can have
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.460]   a column for each of our developers. We put what they're
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.380]   working on in their column. And as soon as they're done with it,
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.580]   we'll move that thing to done, and we can pull something new
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.580]   onto their plate. And then they'll work on that thing until
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.740]   it's done. So, it gives the people who are coming up with
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.980]   the idea. So, someone calls the development team from the
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.740]   marketing, whatever, department. "Hey, our clients really want
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.340]   this. Like, get this in our program." They can know their
[00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.740]   work they're requesting did not disappear. There it is. It's on
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.460]   the board. It's on the queue. They're going to make a
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.340]   decision every time someone frees up a slot. But it's pull
[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.900]   not push. I pull something new onto my plate when I'm ready,
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.860]   not you push everything onto my plate, and then I have to
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.660]   somehow deal with it. It works fantastically well for software
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.900]   development. I think we should explicitly be doing this in more
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.420]   knowledge work jobs. I'm talking literally index cards on a
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:54.060]   thing. Here's the one thing I'm working on. We're probably not
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.820]   going to get there anytime soon. But you can internally more or
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.540]   less simulate this by saying, "Here's what I'm working on." So,
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.940]   if you don't want to create that document, which is you got the
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.900]   right type of boss to get away from that, you can also do this
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.460]   more internally. So, you can say, "Okay, when someone asks me
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.860]   to do something, I find a time on my calendar to do it. I have
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.460]   to go and find and protect the time, right?" It's not only a
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.860]   time management tactic. You know you'll have time for it when the
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.620]   time comes. It's a reality check on your schedule. And you can
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:24.180]   earn a reputation pretty quickly as, "I'm very careful about my
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.460]   time." Like, "Okay, we know that about Callie. He's very careful
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:30.100]   about his time. We ask him to do something." Instead of giving
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.020]   the immediate yes or no, instead of saying yes or no in the room,
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:37.180]   you say, "Yeah, great. Let me go do... I keep very careful track
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.260]   of my time. Let me go find where the time would be for this. And
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.100]   I'll get back to you as soon as I do that and let you know when
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.140]   this might be able to fit." Then you go and you do that. You get
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.100]   back to them later. And you might be able to realistically
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.260]   say, "If I don't move something else, the next time I can find
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.980]   15 hours, it's going to be six weeks from now." You earn the
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:58.820]   right to do this if people trust that, "Yeah, he's organized by
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.940]   his time. He's not lying." And you have more leeway.
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.940]   The trust piece is important because there's probably people
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.340]   who are trying to dodge work or just trying to do the least
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.300]   amount that they're going to be required to. But I think that
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:17.820]   central portal of shared information through a document
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.740]   or whatever else gives people the ability to see everything as
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.860]   it actually is and also obviates a lot of asynchronous
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.980]   communication around it because you can just look at that and
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.220]   there's no need for emailing back and forth about schedules,
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:32.780]   etc.
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.900]   Yeah, I mean, the asynchronous communication is the killer. Not
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.340]   the idea of asynchronous communication, but volume of it.

[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.260]   one as well. Check it out.
