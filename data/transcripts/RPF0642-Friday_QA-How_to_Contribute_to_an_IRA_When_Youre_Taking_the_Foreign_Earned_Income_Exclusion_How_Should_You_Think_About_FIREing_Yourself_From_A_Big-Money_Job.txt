[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.940]   I think it's kind of a fun variety.
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.640]   Let's get right into the questions.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:06.120]   First question comes in from a listener who's asking me about how to contribute to an IRA, though he be an expat.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.660]   Listener writes in and says, "Hi, Joshua. I'm a long-time listener. I really enjoy your perspective,
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.500]   and it's been helpful in lifestyle choices and financial options.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.760]   Your episodes on expatriate life are of particular interest to me."
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.160]   Episodes 634 and 636.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.380]   "I'm an American expat, and I have been living abroad for over five years.
[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.740]   I have been using the foreign income exclusion, and it's great for me in general.
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.820]   However, one of the caveats is the inability to contribute to an IRA.
[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.660]   As I understand it, when utilizing the exclusion, you are unable to contribute to an IRA,
[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.560]   either a Roth or a traditional.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.200]   But with the foreign income tax credit, I believe you can contribute to an IRA.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.300]   Not sure if a Roth or traditional or both.
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.240]   So I've been unable to contribute since moving overseas.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.340]   Could you talk about this in an episode?
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.900]   Maybe on retirement investment options while abroad.
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.740]   Would life insurance be an additional option?
[00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.040]   Would setting up a USA-based LLC or some sort of entity be helpful?
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.640]   Would that be advantageous in some sort of way if you're self-employed?
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.260]   Thanks so much. Keep up the great and helpful work."
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.860]   So this is a great question, and let me answer it directly.
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.460]   I need to give just a...
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.860]   I'll try to keep it to a few minutes of background information
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.760]   to make sure that we are all on the same page.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.760]   This listener is a US citizen.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.060]   US citizens, though they move abroad, continue to be required by the United States of America
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.660]   to pay the United States of America income tax on their worldwide earnings,
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.560]   even if they do not live in the United States of America.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.960]   This is unlike any other nation in the world save Eritrea, which has the same system.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.960]   So it's unlike anyone else in the world, but it is the fact for US citizens.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.960]   So though this listener is living outside of the United States,
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.960]   he is still required to pay the United States income taxes on his worldwide income.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.660]   Now, the United States government offers three basic things
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.660]   that are useful for people who don't live in the United States.
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.460]   They are, number one, the foreign earned income exclusion,
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:14.860]   which allows you to exclude up to about $105,000 of your foreign earned income
[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.360]   from the federal income tax system.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.460]   That's called the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.560]   The second thing that is available is the foreign housing deduction
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.760]   and/or the foreign housing exclusion,
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.460]   which allows you sometimes to additionally deduct some of your housing expenses
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.660]   if you are outside of the United States.
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.560]   And then number three, you have what's called the foreign tax credit.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.860]   The foreign tax credit allows you to receive a credit against your US income taxes
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.660]   for income taxes that you have already paid to a foreign government.
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.260]   Now, the number one and number two, the foreign earned income exclusion
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.360]   and the foreign housing deduction or exclusion function together,
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.260]   whereas the foreign tax credit is a separate system.
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.460]   Now, when you use the foreign earned income exclusion and you qualify for it,
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.560]   what it does is it wipes out your income, basically.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.760]   The foreign earned income exclusion functions as a form of anti-income.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.460]   So if you earn $100,000, you can take the $100,000 exclusion
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.260]   and you will effectively have, for the purposes of your federal income tax return,
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.260]   no income because it is all excluded.
[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.660]   You thus have no income, thus you owe no taxes.
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.060]   This is a problem if you are trying to participate in something
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:43.260]   that requires you to have earned income, for example, to make an IRA contribution.
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.160]   In order for you to make an IRA contribution,
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:53.460]   you have to have earned income at least equal to the amount of your IRA contribution.
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.760]   And so the problem this listener is facing is their income is being wiped out
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.860]   by the foreign earned income exclusion, leaving them with no tax liability,
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.160]   but making it not possible for them to contribute to an IRA.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.560]   Now, is there a solution? Yes, there is a solution.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.060]   And I'm going to give you three solutions, one of which you have mentioned.
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.860]   Let's start with that one, which is your worst solution.
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:24.260]   What you are suggesting is that instead of claiming the foreign earned income exclusion,
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.160]   you simply claim a foreign tax credit.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.560]   Now, you are correct that if you claim a foreign tax credit, you will have income.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.160]   Let's say that you earn a hundred thousand dollars.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.960]   Let's say that you live in a country that is, I don't know where you live.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.560]   Let's just say you're paying an effective tax rate of 15% on your money.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.360]   So you've paid $15,000 of foreign taxes on your income to a foreign government,
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.760]   not in the United States. Well, if you are in that situation,
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:01.160]   then you can claim a credit, a tax credit for the $15,000 for the U.S. government.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.760]   Now, the way the foreign tax credit works, it doesn't actually save you any money.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.160]   All it means is you won't be double taxed.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.560]   So let me use an example. Let's say that you go to Canada, Canadian citizen.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.260]   Let's say that you're a dual citizen of Canada and the United States
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:24.160]   and you have moved from the United States to Canada and you're earning a hundred thousand dollars.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:30.760]   Assume for the sake of argument that your effective tax rate in the United States on a hundred thousand dollars would be 20%,
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:36.560]   but your effective tax rate in Canada on the same hundred thousand dollars is going to be 30%.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.860]   Well, you'll pay $30,000 of Canadian taxes
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.760]   and then you can take that as a credit against your U.S. taxes,
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.060]   but and you'll effectively wipe out your U.S. taxes, but you won't save any money.
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.560]   You're going to pay the money out to either Canada or the United States.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.860]   Now, let's say that instead of working in Canada, you instead were working in the Cayman Islands.
[00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.560]   So the Cayman Islands doesn't have an income tax.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:04.760]   They don't have any kind of income taxes imposed on people who live there, who work there.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.160]   So now you don't have any foreign taxes paid.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.560]   Well, now you can't take the foreign tax credit.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.560]   What that means though is you're going to pay $20,000 to the U.S.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.560]   government on your hundred thousand dollars of income,
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.360]   assuming that you didn't qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.660]   Remember, we're just talking about the foreign tax credit here.
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.460]   So the tax credit really doesn't save you any money.
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.360]   It just keeps you from double paying.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:30.260]   So if you pay taxes abroad, then you don't have to doubly pay those taxes in the U.S.
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.860]   You will pay it whatever the total highest tax bill is.
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.060]   If you're living and working in Canada, Canadian taxes are higher.
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.660]   You'll pay the higher amount of taxes to Canada.
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.560]   If you're living and working in the United States, in a place
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.460]   where the taxes are lower than the United States,
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.760]   you'll pay the lower taxes to the United States.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.460]   So the foreign tax credit can be useful if you're paying foreign taxes.
[00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.460]   If you get the credit, you might as well use it.
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.260]   But what I'd love to see most people do is use that for offsetting things
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.860]   like their capital gains taxes, etc., and use it if you have it.
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.060]   But don't try to get there this way.
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.560]   However, you are correct that even if you don't qualify
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.960]   for the foreign earned income exclusion,
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.960]   if you're paying foreign income taxes, you can still claim those foreign income taxes
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.760]   and you will still have earned income allowing you to contribute to an IRA.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.360]   But that's the expensive way. Don't do it that way.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.860]   Take the foreign earned income exclusion, which let's go to number way number two.
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:27.160]   The second way that you can contribute to an IRA is if you will simply make more money
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.560]   than you can wipe out with the foreign earned income exclusion. Simple example.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.060]   Let's say that you can earn a hundred and fifteen thousand dollars,
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.760]   but yet you can only wipe out a hundred and five thousand dollars
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.460]   with the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.860]   Now you have ten thousand dollars of earned income.
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.860]   And the way it works is you will pay and owe US taxes on that ten thousand dollars of income.
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.860]   It doesn't start at the bottom of the bracket.
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.460]   It'll rather it will start at the top of the bracket,
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.960]   but you will still be able to claim your deduction,
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.060]   your standard deduction or your itemized deduction.
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.660]   You will still be able to claim maybe a child tax credit or some of that
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.860]   if you have it against that ten thousand dollars,
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.160]   but you'll have ten thousand dollars of earned income,
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.460]   which you can then use for an IRA contribution.
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:13.460]   So that's another simple way is make your income higher so that you have more earned income.
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.660]   However, easy for me to say maybe harder for you to do.
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.060]   Maybe you're just enjoying making less money
[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.460]   and you don't want to make a hundred and thirty thousand dollars
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.760]   or whatever it is that you need.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:31.960]   So let's go to way number three and that is based upon how you claim your foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:38.060]   There are two tests that can be used to qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.960]   The first test is a strict days test.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:48.760]   It's a test that simply goes based upon how many days you spend outside of the United States.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.360]   If you will spend at least three hundred
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:58.160]   and thirty days out of a three hundred and sixty five day period outside of the United States in a foreign country,
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:06.260]   then you will qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion regardless of any other factor.
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.060]   That's the strict days test.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.660]   Now this is one example wherein it's a little bit easier for U.S.
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:17.560]   citizens to avoid the tax on their first hundred and five thousand dollars of income than it is for other citizens.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:21.160]   For example, you as a U.S. citizen can leave the United States
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.160]   and as long as you are outside of the United States for three hundred
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.660]   and thirty days out of the three hundred sixty five days.
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:30.460]   And by the way, there are a few little rules there about international waters not counting and things like that,
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.360]   but just keep it simple. Just just say you're outside of the United States
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.460]   for at least three hundred thirty out of a three hundred sixty five day period.
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:40.560]   Doesn't matter where you are. Doesn't matter if you pay taxes anywhere else in the world or not.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.360]   You can claim the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.160]   This allows you to live in, say, a tax haven
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:52.860]   or to do some of the things that we've discussed where you cannot pay any taxes to any other jurisdiction other than the United States.
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.960]   That would not be the same if you were, say, Canadian.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.260]   If you were Canadian and you left Canada and just spent a year bouncing around the world,
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:06.260]   you would still owe the country of Canada taxes because you're still considered to be a resident of Canada.
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.760]   In order for you to end your relationship with the Canadian taxing authorities,
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:16.560]   you have to become a resident somewhere else, pick up a residency and sever all your ties with Canada.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:22.460]   So for a hundred thousand dollars or less, the US system is probably a little easier to work with than the Canadian system.
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.160]   Now, my hope is, of course, we all get to more than a hundred thousand dollars,
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.960]   in which case I'd rather have the Canadian system.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:31.360]   But what what can we do? So that's the strict days test.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.260]   We'll come back to that in a moment because you have to use it for the trick that I'm going to tell you to work.
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:42.360]   Now, the other way that you claim the foreign earned income exclusion is with what's called the bonafide residence exception.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:48.360]   So this is where you actually live somewhere else and you have a series of factors that demonstrate that,
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.560]   yes, you actually live somewhere else.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:56.660]   If you can prove that you actually are a bonafide resident of another place, you actually live somewhere else.
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.960]   You're not just bouncing around the world. You actually live somewhere else.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.460]   You have a residency visa or you're a citizen of another country.
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:06.060]   You have stable house there. You work there. Your family's there, etc.
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.860]   You're a resident and you plan to be a resident there forever.
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:14.360]   Then you can qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion under the bonafide residency test.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.460]   And that will give you the ability, if you needed to or wanted to,
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:24.160]   to spend more physical days in the United States than the strict days test.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:29.760]   Generally, you could probably spend up to about four months in the United States.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.860]   You can't spend more than four months in the United States every year
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.360]   because that would cause you to fail the substantial presence test
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.660]   if you were spending more than 120 days in the US every year
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:44.860]   and thus automatically subject you to US taxation.
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:48.360]   But if you spent, you know, a couple, three, four months in the US each year,
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.960]   you could do that as long as you were a true bonafide resident abroad.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.960]   That won't work and allow you to contribute to an IRA
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.160]   if you're claiming the foreign earned income exclusion under that test
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.860]   because that test is an annual test.
[00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:06.860]   It only works on calendar years, which is why generally when people expatriate,
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:10.860]   the advice is claim using the strict days test first.
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.960]   And then if you're going to set up a residence, move into the bonafide residence exclusion.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.760]   But here's the cool thing with the strict days test.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:23.360]   Let's talk about how it works. It doesn't have to be January 1 to December 31.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.460]   So you don't have to be gone from the United States from January 1 to December 31
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.660]   in order to claim the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:38.960]   You simply have to qualify for it during any rolling 365 day period that you choose,
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:43.360]   which means that you could if you wanted to spend January,
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.960]   February, March, April, and May in the United States,
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:52.660]   you could leave the United States on June 1 and be gone until June 1 the following year
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.960]   and then return to the United States for July, August, September, October,
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.460]   November, December of the following year
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.060]   and still claim the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.860]   Now the way that would work is you claim that 12-month period,
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:10.160]   but then it is prorated to your 12-month tax year.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:15.060]   So if you under that fact pattern I just described from June to June,
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:18.060]   if you claim the exclusion during that period of time,
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:23.360]   you would say, listen, I would have 50% of my earnings that are subject to tax
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.860]   and I would have 50% that are able to claim the foreign earned income exclusion
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.860]   and the exclusion itself is prorated.
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:34.660]   So you would have access to say $52,500 of the exclusion.
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.960]   But the thing is you control that date.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:42.960]   Now let's assume for the case of simpler facts that you are outside of the United States all the time.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.160]   You haven't come back in five years.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.560]   You have zero days in the United States.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.660]   So that's automatically you're going to always qualify
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.860]   for the foreign earned income exclusion under the days test.
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:57.460]   Now what you've most likely been doing up till now is claiming your year
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:03.560]   to go from January 1 to December 31 just for simple convenience.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.260]   That's what you've been claiming.
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.760]   Here's what I would point out to you though.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.060]   You don't have to claim that.
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.560]   You don't have to claim that.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.860]   So here's what you can do to create earned income
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:20.960]   that will allow you to contribute to an IRA.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.160]   Claim a different time period.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:23.960]   Now it doesn't matter.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:29.760]   You're not representing to the IRS that you were in the United States for a different time period.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.260]   You're just saying I'm claiming a different time period.
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.360]   So let me give you an example.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.360]   Let's say that you earn $100,000 per year.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.660]   So we divide $100,000 by 365.
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:46.160]   Your daily wages in that situation are $274 if we go based upon seven days a week.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.660]   $274.
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:53.360]   Now you're trying to generate some money, some earned income to contribute to an IRA,
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.260]   but you also want to make sure that you qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.960]   Well, you don't come back to the United States,
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:02.160]   but 275 times say 30 days or January is 31, right?
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:08.060]   So let's do 274 times 31 is $8,494.
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:12.860]   So what you can simply do is when you fill out your tax return
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:16.060]   and when you fill out the form, what is it, 2555?
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:22.760]   Form 2555 for the foreign earned income exclusion on section, let me find it here,
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:31.260]   section, sorry, very unprofessional, very unprofessional.
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:35.060]   Where is it?
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:39.560]   Section part three, taxpayers qualifying under the physical presence test.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:45.160]   Line 16 of part three says the physical presence test is based on the 12-month period
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.460]   from this date through this date.
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:52.960]   So when you are filling out form 2555, you simply write on that paper,
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.160]   the physical presence test is based on the 12-month period from February 1,
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:02.360]   for example, 2018 through February 1, 2019.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:07.160]   Then you go on and you explain that you haven't traveled in the United States,
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.660]   you were physically present in a foreign country
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.260]   or countries for the entire 12-month period.
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:16.060]   But because you wrote on that line February 1 to February 1,
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:22.060]   you automatically still now have 31 days that are not subject to the foreign earned income exclusion,
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.860]   which means that your income is going to be prorated
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:32.560]   and you will pick up $8,494 of income from that 31-day period.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:38.760]   Thus, that $8,494 of income will flow through your tax return
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:44.060]   and it's available for you to make an IRA contribution.
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.160]   That's how you do it.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:52.660]   So if you want to create earned income, just claim a different set of dates on form 2555
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.160]   and you can do that every year.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.860]   You can do that February 1, 2018 to 2019.
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.060]   And then when you do the following year's tax return,
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:03.060]   you can claim February 1, 2019 to February 1, 2020.
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:07.660]   All that you're claiming is the days that you're going to subject to that physical presence test.
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:13.360]   And so you have now created 31 days that you're not going to claim the income for.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.560]   So that's up to you. Now, I would just say you're going to need to play with these numbers
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:22.360]   because this is very much one of those things where you'll jigger the numbers as you're doing your tax return.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.760]   You're not going to change your facts.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.660]   Although you could if you are very comfortable with this foreign earned income exclusion
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.360]   and if you're trying to spend time in the United States or whatever,
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:34.060]   you could just go ahead and spend the time there and change your dates every year.
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:35.960]   So we're not trying to jigger the facts.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.160]   Sorry, but we're just jiggering the numbers. The facts are what they are,
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.660]   but you're jiggering the numbers here to see what's going to help you the best.
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.860]   So I hope that helps you to be able to claim that
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:48.060]   so that you can make an IRA contribution if you want to.
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.460]   Comment for you on IRA contributions.
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:55.660]   I don't see any reason for you to participate in a traditional IRA under this particular plan.
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:20:01.460]   What's the point of deferring taxes to a later date when you can just go ahead
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:06.760]   and pay zero taxes if you're not already maximizing your foreign earned income exclusion amount?
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:10.060]   I can see why you would participate in a Roth IRA.
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:13.360]   I can see that as being useful.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:19.360]   But just you judge appropriately. Now with regard to your other questions,
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.460]   let me just hit those very quickly and not give you detailed answers,
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:26.260]   but just hit you with a couple of quick questions.
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.960]   First, talking about retirement investment options while abroad.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.960]   Of course, there are many options and just because you are abroad doesn't mean
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.360]   that you can't participate in retirement plans in the United States.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.060]   Now it can be a little complex to set it up.
[00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:43.560]   And again, this is where in some ways we could argue that the US system is an advantage versus a Canadian system.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.960]   If you were Canadian, you need to leave and you're not going to participate in things back in Canada.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:52.660]   But for the United States, since your only way to ultimately leave is to formally renounce citizenship,
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:57.260]   assuming you're not going to do that, you can still participate in everything in the United States.
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.660]   You can have your entire financial infrastructure in the United States
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.660]   because the only thing you're going to get by living abroad,
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:09.760]   other than perhaps lower cost of living or better lifestyle or personal happiness,
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.960]   the only financial benefit you're going to get is going to be foreign earned income exclusion,
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.460]   foreign housing deduction, and the foreign tax credit.
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.160]   And we'll talk in a moment about avoiding employment taxes.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.260]   But you can still participate in things in the United States.
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:29.260]   So depending on your family setup and depending on the family situation and all of that,
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.860]   you can still contribute to other retirement accounts.
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:34.660]   You just have to have that earned income.
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.060]   There's lots of stuff that you can do and to go beyond that,
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.060]   you would have to look at how you're actually running your business.
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.860]   Now, would life insurance be an additional option?
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:45.660]   Sure, it would be, but that's not going to matter whether where you are.
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:51.260]   You can have the same life insurance investment options in the United States versus outside the United States.
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:55.160]   The only thing wrinkle you will get into is when you go to take out a life insurance policy,
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.860]   you'll have to work with a company that wants to work with somebody
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:01.260]   who's not a physically present in the United States.
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.960]   But you can be a US citizen and you can work with an offshore life insurance,
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.060]   with a foreign life insurance company.
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:12.560]   You can do that. You just set up a trust and have the LLC on the life insurance policy.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:17.360]   You can do all kinds of stuff. You can have a captive insurance company if you want to.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.460]   You can do all the fancy, fun, sexy stuff that's in the world of life insurance planning.
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.160]   Or you can do everything in the United States, but that's immaterial.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.760]   It doesn't make any change based upon where you are in that situation.
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:33.560]   Now you ask, would setting up a USA-based LLC or some sort of entity be helpful?
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:38.160]   Most likely, yes, for the ease of doing your business.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.960]   But yet, depending on how you do this, more importantly,
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.260]   what you probably want to do is set up an offshore company.
[00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:49.060]   And you should be working and running your business, especially if it's a business.
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.460]   A little different if you are doing services.
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.860]   But if you're actually running an actual business,
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.660]   you definitely want to set up an offshore company
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.960]   and you want to structure it so that you are the employee of the offshore company.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:04.360]   Because that would allow you, and I'm gaining the idea that you're an entrepreneur of some kind
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:09.160]   or working for yourself in some way, because that allows you to avoid the employment taxes.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.960]   And those employment taxes are your heaviest hit on your first $100,000 of income.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:18.160]   So with taxes, remember that there are two systems and they work differently.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:23.760]   You have federal income taxes, which are progressive, where they start off with $0.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.260]   And then the more and more money you make, the more you go up the tax bracket.
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:32.560]   But I don't think that federal income taxes are that massive
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.860]   when compared at $100,000 of income or $50,000 of income,
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:41.260]   when compared to what they are at $500,000 of income or a million dollars of income.
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.360]   I mean, depending on your family situation, all that,
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:48.060]   you've got $100,000, you've got probably under $10,000 of federal income tax.
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.960]   Now, should we save the $10,000? Absolutely.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.060]   It goes a long way. We can supercharge your results.
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.960]   But it may be less, depending on your deductions, etc.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.860]   Probably $7,000, $8,000, it just depends on your situation.
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:04.260]   So that's very different than if you were earning a million dollars and paying,
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:09.860]   you know, some taxpayers might be paying in excess of 50% on the top half million,
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.160]   which is just utterly obscene.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:16.460]   So your income taxes at $100,000 are not the bigger deal.
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.860]   The bigger deal is your employment taxes,
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:24.060]   which is for self-employment, if you're paying both sides, $15,300 per year.
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:31.160]   That's really tough. But the employment tax wage scale tops out around $120,000.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.360]   Then it just drops down to a couple percent.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:38.260]   So below $120,000 is 15.3%, then it drops down to a couple percent.
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.560]   So that's your really bad ones.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:48.360]   Your big savings from being abroad will come from your getting a chance to work for an offshore company.
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.560]   Because if you continue to work for a US company,
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.860]   then you're going to continue to have to pay your US taxes.
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:59.160]   For example, let's say that you're working for, you know, Big Corp USA,
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.760]   but you happen to work remotely for Big Corp USA.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:02.960]   When I was out traveling around the United States,
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.860]   I met a bunch of people who were working remotely for Big Corp USA.
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:10.760]   So one guy's a technical service guy or whatever, you're an accountant, doesn't matter.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:16.360]   Well, if you just simply move from, say, Texas to Mexico, and you live in,
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:20.060]   that's bad, because Mexican, you might subject yourself to Mexican taxes.
[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:25.060]   Let's say you move from Florida to the Bahamas, and you make that move,
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.860]   you still have an internet connection, you can still work for Big Corp USA.
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:35.360]   You will still have, your employer will still save 7.6%, take 7.65% as the employer contribution,
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.960]   send that off, and then you'll have 7.65% of your pay deducted.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.860]   So you'll still be paying employment taxes in that situation,
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:45.960]   but you won't be paying federal income taxes on the first $105,000
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.060]   if you qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:53.360]   But, if you, so you can travel the world, you can still work for Big Corp USA.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.760]   Now that's exactly the same if you continue to work for, you know, your own LLC.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:02.360]   If I start Joshua's LLC, and I work for Joshua's LLC in the United States,
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:09.560]   then I'm going to still continue to pay my self-employment taxes, if that was what it was.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.060]   Or if I'm paying C Corp, or sorry, S Corp, if I've got an S Corp,
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:18.960]   and I still work for that S Corp, then I'm going to pay employment taxes on my income.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:24.160]   But if I will simply start an offshore company, and I work for the offshore company,
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:29.460]   and here you can do it where you have a US-based LLC that passes through to an offshore company,
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.760]   so you can run your business from the US LLC,
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.360]   but just simply the ownership is with the offshore company,
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.160]   and the US LLC is disregarded for tax purposes.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.360]   Now if you work for the offshore company,
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:44.560]   then you are no longer subject to employment taxes or self-employment taxes
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.660]   if you live outside the country.
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.760]   So now you can live in the Bahamas,
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:54.760]   and if you work for a foreign company, you don't have to pay the $15,300.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:27:02.660]   And so in my example that I did when I talked about saving a lot of money moving outside of the United States,
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:07.960]   that was how we got to $25,000 or maybe $30,000 of tax savings.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:12.460]   It was by combining federal income taxes and employment taxes.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:21.060]   So if you've got $100,000 income, instead of losing $25,000 to, again, employment taxes and federal income taxes,
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:24.760]   then you can keep the—and only getting $75,000 after tax,
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.860]   you can keep the full $100,000 if you will set it up with an offshore company.
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:34.060]   So absolutely, yes, a USA-based LLC can be helpful.
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:37.660]   It's probably easier for you to run things through that than through your foreign company,
[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:42.460]   but you need to have a foreign company at the top of the structure in order to save on those employment taxes.
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.860]   Now, of course, remember—I guess it's probably obvious—
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:49.460]   remember, you're not going to be getting Social Security credits if you're not paying Social Security taxes.
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.860]   So you need to think about that. Maybe a problem for you.
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:57.360]   It's certainly not a problem for me. I'm happy about it, but you should consider that
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:05.560]   because you won't have much of a Social Security—you won't have any Social Security credits,
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.160]   so thus your formula will be lower.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:11.560]   My opinion, take the $25,000 and run and invest that money like crazy.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.860]   I don't care whether you invest it in a retirement account or not.
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:19.360]   Invest it like crazy, and then you'll have millions, potentially,
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.260]   which instead of a measly couple thousand dollar check.
[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:26.160]   All right, next question. Whew, that took longer. Hope I didn't destroy you on a Friday.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.960]   Okay, that was technical question one. This is still a technical question, but less technical.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:34.460]   So if you got with me, less technical. Let's go.
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:37.360]   Listener writes in and says, "Joshua, here's something I've been pondering for a while,
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.460]   and I'd love to know your take on it. A lot of FIRE advice"—
[00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:44.960]   FIRE, of course, for the uninitiated financial independence, retire early movement—
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:51.160]   "A lot of FIRE advice is centered around 'your worst case scenario is everyone else's everyday scenario' premise,
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.960]   meaning you can always come back to a job, at least some job.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:01.560]   While this is correct for many, it is totally misleading for most high-income earners or career professionals.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:07.660]   In my particular case, walking out from a high-paying job means starting almost all over again
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:11.360]   if I want to get back into the industry. You jump off the ladder.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.460]   What framework would you use in a situation where making the wrong move
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:20.260]   has very significant financial cost and is truly life-altering?
[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:24.760]   For a lot of people, getting to FIRE, getting to financial independence, is an easy part.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:29.760]   Pulling the trigger is the real challenge, as it is irreversible."
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:36.260]   I think that's an excellent question, and I do think you are right to point out that there are problems,
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:42.860]   especially if you are just a job wage earner, a corporate person, etc.
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:49.960]   When you leave a job or a career, you will very quickly start to see your skills atrophy,
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:55.860]   your connections will start to grow cold, unless you are very diligent about maintaining those skills,
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:59.160]   maintaining those connections, maintaining that sense of connectedness.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:03.560]   And frankly, if you are going out to be financially independent, it will probably be hard for you to do that,
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:08.660]   because you probably won't care as much as you once did about going to all the industry things
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:14.260]   that you have been to for 15 years and you are just tired of the rubber chicken dinners and all that stuff.
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:17.760]   Since I left the financial business professionally, my skills have atrophied.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:23.460]   I am not as good with a spreadsheet as I once was. I am not as good with a financial calculator as I once was.
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:29.660]   I have lost many of my industry contacts. I am not as current on all the products in the industry.
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:33.460]   I used to be I could tell you about all the products because I read the prospectuses.
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.460]   All that stuff is gone. I don't do that anymore.
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:39.460]   And so my skills have grown cold, and the same that all of us.
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:45.160]   Now, I have built up other skills to compensate, and I think that that's what really most of us should do,
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:49.260]   is build up other skills to compensate, but your skills will grow cold,
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:56.060]   and you certainly won't be able to come back in at that same level that you once were.
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:31:03.460]   It is a significant factor. You won't be able to pick up where you left off immediately. You just won't.
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:07.760]   Now, I would point out, however, a few things here, and I'll give you my framework.
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:11.560]   First, some comments on is this really a problem.
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:15.560]   I don't think this is really a problem if you are truly financially independent.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:23.260]   I'm going to assume here for the sake of answering this question that we're defining that term using the 3% rule metric.
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:31.960]   The idea being that you have a large enough portfolio that you can live on, say, 3% of the net worth of the portfolio balance.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:36.160]   And I think here, we need to make sure that we're dealing with some serious numbers.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:41.160]   So we're not doing some kind of silly thing where I'm 22 years old, and I have $130,000 in the bank,
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:44.860]   and I'm going to consider myself five because I can live on $4,000 a year, and my life is never going to change.
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:48.960]   That's silly. But let's say you've got $2 million in the bank, and you're saying,
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:54.960]   "I could live on $60,000 as a safe withdrawal rate. I've got $2 million. I'm going to be doing well."
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.760]   So here's the first thing I want to point out.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:09.760]   If the 3% rule doesn't work, we are in uncharted territories, and something is seriously wrong.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:17.860]   In a scenario where the 3% rule is not sufficient, we're not just in some kind of weird, you know,
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:21.360]   "Hey, there was a temporary correction, a temporary bear market."
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:27.160]   We are in end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it territory. We're in civilizational change.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:35.260]   If the 3% rule doesn't work, you better have 24-hour security on your homestead.
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:37.660]   I mean, I think that's where we're at.
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:44.060]   The 3% rule is a very, very robust rule of thumb to use,
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:49.460]   and there is a lot riding on everything working as it has worked.
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:54.560]   So just imagine you're in a situation where the market—I'm assuming you're mostly in stock market,
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:58.860]   you're a wage earner, and you're mostly investing in stock market investments,
[00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:02.460]   paper investments, mainstream mutual funds, etc.
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:09.260]   If the 3% rule doesn't work, there's—again, we're in the end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it stuff.
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:14.460]   We're in massive civilizational unrest. We're in Great Depression, but worse.
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:17.360]   And I just want you to imagine what that would do in our economy,
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:22.560]   what that would do when you look at the disruption from common bear markets,
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.060]   and yet all the common bear markets are factored into the 3% rule.
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:31.260]   So I would say if the 3% rule doesn't work, there's no guarantee you would have been able to maintain your job at all,
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:35.160]   because many of us would very—be facing the loss of our jobs.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.660]   Now, you'd still be more employable if you were still working,
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:43.060]   but we've got problems across the society.
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:49.460]   If the 3% rule breaks, it's because things are very, very deeply broken.
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.960]   Now, is that possible? Of course it's possible.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:57.160]   Is it likely? I don't think it's likely, but I think it's possible.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.760]   And so I think you need to plan for that, and the best way I know how to do that
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.460]   is with good disaster planning. You think about what would happen
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:06.660]   if we were in an end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it scenario.
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:10.560]   What would happen if we were in 40% unemployment territory?
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.860]   And then you think, "How would I survive that?" And it doesn't cost much to be prepared for that.
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:19.060]   It just costs a lot of mental energy to kind of convince yourself that it's worth it.
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.660]   And you got to put on your catastrophist hat for a moment and say,
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:25.660]   "All right, I think we're going to collapse. What does collapse look like?"
[00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:28.960]   So I think it's certainly a possibility.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.760]   I would say an unlikely possibility, but a possibility.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.660]   I think it's worth preparing for.
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:38.060]   So recognize that if the 3% rule isn't working,
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:41.160]   there's no guarantee you would have been able to maintain your job at all.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.860]   That's important first.
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:47.760]   Second, I would point out that unlike wage earners,
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:53.060]   people who are living on an income portfolio actually do have a lot of warning.
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:56.960]   When there's a wage earner, so the vast majority of people in the United States
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:01.660]   have no money, save no money, work and spend, and it's paycheck to paycheck.
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:05.360]   That's the normal experience for the majority of the people.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.760]   If people have net worth, it's usually tied up in their house,
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:13.460]   and it's only a small percentage of the population that actually has savings and investments.
[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:15.760]   You're always going to have that. Seemingly in every society,
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.460]   you're going to have a Pareto distribution,
[00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:20.860]   where 20% of the people are going to have 80% of the money.
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:24.960]   But there is a distinct difference between living paycheck to paycheck,
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.860]   earning $10,000 a month, spending $10,000 a month,
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:31.060]   versus living on, say, $10,000 a month from,
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:35.260]   or for whatever the number is, $10,000 a month from your retirement portfolio.
[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:38.960]   Because if things start to turn south, you have warning.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.760]   If you're meeting with your financial advisor,
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.860]   or you're sitting down and crunching the numbers on a quarterly basis,
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:47.960]   you're starting to notice that your distribution rates are ticking up,
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:51.560]   and you have years of runway to look at.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.960]   Years of runway to look at.
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:36:00.160]   Now, I guess that's not true if you face something where your portfolio goes to zero,
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.960]   there's dollars, toilet paper,
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:06.360]   but I can't conceive of how those circumstances are possible.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.660]   So let's just knock all that stuff out of the way.
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:13.260]   I can't ever see how I could even design the chain of events that could cause that to happen,
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:14.960]   given the way things are today.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.660]   20 years from now, we'll see what happens.
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.660]   But we're not living in Zimbabwe world.
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:24.460]   So we're living in the United States of America, or in a much more stable place.
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.060]   So this is not going to happen.
[00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:30.060]   So if you start to overdraw your portfolio, you have time.
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:31.360]   There's warning.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.660]   And so now you can start to make changes.
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:37.760]   So you're much, much safer than even the average person is.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.460]   Now, here's the next thing I would point out.
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:45.760]   You don't have to pick up your pre-retirement earnings
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:49.460]   in order for you to be able to maintain your financial independence.
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:54.960]   So let's assume that prior to your early retirement, you're earning $200,000 a year.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.760]   If you're earning less, if you're earning $80,000 or $100,000,
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.560]   those jobs are all over the place.
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.660]   And so I think you can come back in.
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.960]   But if you're up $200,000, $300,000, $400,000, no, you're right.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:09.060]   You can't just jump into those without having the network.
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.960]   But let's say you were earning $200,000.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.160]   Now you need to go back to work.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:18.260]   No, you might not be able to go and get your $200,000 job back.
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.460]   But you don't need $200,000.
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:24.660]   You need $50,000.
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:27.360]   You see why? Because you're drawing from a portfolio.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.860]   You're not, you don't have to go to drawing from zero on a portfolio.
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:33.360]   You just need some money. You need $50,000.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.960]   And here's what's more. If you're actually early retired,
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:41.260]   if you're actually, you know, fi, then you make $200,000.
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:45.260]   You only need $50,000 to live on because you were saving a huge amount of your money before.
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.060]   So you don't actually need the job there anyway.
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:54.060]   You just need $50,000. You don't need $200,000. You need $50,000.
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:59.560]   Here's what's more. When you are actually financially independent,
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:05.260]   you have so much capital available to you
[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:09.360]   that you can make choices with what to do with that.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.860]   So you need more money?
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:15.060]   Well, you've got tons of money that you can spend on creating more income.
[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.760]   So maybe you pursue a different investment strategy.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:21.760]   So you say, well, I can't go get my $200,000 job yet back.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.960]   Yeah, maybe that's true, but you still got a million dollars.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.660]   Give me a break. Give me a million dollars.
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:31.060]   I can manufacture a $200,000 job in dozens of businesses.
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:35.160]   I may not be able to manufacture $200,000 of investment,
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.760]   of passive investment returns from a million dollar portfolio,
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:42.960]   but give me a million dollars and I can… come on.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.760]   If you're willing to work and you're willing to take a job, you can do it.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:50.360]   Now my nervousness would be if you're used to being a corporate employer,
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:54.160]   employee, and you don't know how to create a $200,000 job for yourself
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.060]   when starting with a million dollars of capital.
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.860]   So that might be something that might be hard for somebody
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:59.860]   who's only ever worked for other people.
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:04.460]   But you go to the average businessman who's earning a good income
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:08.560]   and say, could you create this income if you had a million dollars to start with?
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.260]   I could make five times that amount of money
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:15.960]   because most businessmen that start to make a $200,000 income started with nothing.
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:18.460]   Now you give them a million dollars to start with,
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.860]   you got options all over the place.
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:25.260]   Now notice I'm saying you create for yourself a $200,000 job.
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.860]   I didn't say, again, passive investment returns.
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:32.160]   But if you're willing to work, and by definition, that's what we're talking about.
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.660]   You're saying I was working, then I retired, but now I've got to go back.
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:38.260]   If you're willing to work, once you have capital,
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:43.260]   you can print money all over the place as long as you're willing to work in it.
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:47.660]   It might be harder to do with retirement, but you can do it with work.
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:50.460]   You start a McDonald's, you open a gas station,
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:53.260]   you buy an apartment building and manage it yourself.
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:57.060]   I mean, the ideas are endless. They're endless.
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.560]   But most people don't have that capital.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:02.960]   So when you have that capital, you've got huge options available to you.
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:07.760]   So those are kind of just some common sense answers to your question.
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:13.360]   Again, by review, if 3% doesn't work, frankly, there's no choice.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.160]   You wouldn't necessarily have been able to have a job in any place.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.260]   There's no job guarantee at all.
[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.660]   You will have lots of warning, or at least some warning,
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:23.560]   more than the average person is who loses their job.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:26.360]   And then all the other, you know, you won't need to pick up where you left off.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.560]   You don't need $200,000, you need $50,000 to get you through
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:31.160]   until the markets come back or until you figure out a new plan.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.560]   And when you have capital, you have choices,
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.160]   and you can just deploy that capital more efficiently.
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.960]   You might very well be totally happy putting your money in an index fund,
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.960]   spending a little bit of it while you're traveling the world,
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.760]   but when you start to run out of money, you come back and say,
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.160]   "How can I make more money?"
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:48.760]   Well, you can absolutely make more money than putting it in an index fund.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.160]   You're just going to have to put in more work.
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:52.860]   So maybe you take on a more active approach to your investing.
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:56.160]   Maybe you take on a more active approach to business management in some way.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:59.860]   But a more active approach will raise your rates of return
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.860]   if you're competent and don't screw it up.
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:04.560]   And then now you can fix your portfolio problem.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.360]   So I don't think it's a huge factor, a huge problem.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:11.060]   Here's what I do think is a major problem.
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:12.860]   I think you should have a career plan,
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:15.360]   or at least some guesses on a career plan,
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.360]   for after your early retirement.
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:21.860]   I really do. I think that it is bad to plan, to sit around and do nothing.
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:29.860]   And I think it's bad to plan to just engage in—
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.460]   I don't know what words to use.
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:33.860]   I don't want to use the word "hedonistic" things,
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:35.660]   but just playing all the time.
[00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.160]   Playing all the time is not a good way to live.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.860]   It's bad for the soul.
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:40.860]   It's bad for the character.
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:42.260]   It's bad for the soul.
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:45.460]   Now, I think if your play is more active,
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.360]   there are probably ways that you can do better.
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.460]   You know, the guy who says, "I'm going to retire,"
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.560]   and goes home and just watches TV all day,
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.960]   the dude gets cancer and he gets old and he dies,
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.960]   and it's bad, and he has no quality of life,
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:59.960]   and his friendship's atrophy, etc.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:02.860]   So that's bad, but we're not talking about that.
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.260]   But let's say you just say, "I'm just going to quit and play all the time."
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:06.560]   Well, why?
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:10.060]   It's not fun to go and play all the time.
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:12.760]   Play is valuable. Rest is valuable.
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.460]   But you also need work.
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:17.660]   And so why should you work and not make money?
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.160]   It's the thing that I don't get about the whole FIRE movement.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.460]   I understand it mentally,
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:24.260]   because when I've been in jobs that weren't well-suited for me,
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:25.960]   then I kind of felt stuck,
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.560]   and I was like, "Man, I can't wait to get off of this."
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.860]   But if that's you, take a sabbatical.
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.960]   Take three months, and about the end of three months,
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.260]   you're going to be done with it.
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:38.260]   At the end of a year, certainly, you don't want to sit on a beach anymore.
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:41.960]   And so I think the key thing is not to go from work,
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:44.360]   or from your big corporate job to nothing,
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.960]   or to play all the time,
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:49.860]   but to go from your big corporate job to your next job,
[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:50.860]   your next business,
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.860]   your next thing that you're going to dedicate yourself to.
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:56.160]   And most things, even if you go to something
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.560]   without the intention of making money,
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.360]   most things have income switches
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.560]   that can be turned on when they need to.
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.660]   And I think, you know,
[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:08.760]   I've never lived exclusively on earnings from my investment portfolio.
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.360]   I haven't done it.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:15.860]   But I don't see very many examples of anybody who has done it,
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:19.460]   and I don't see many examples of people who've done it and enjoyed it.
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:21.860]   I think there might be a few people who do it,
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:28.360]   and who do think that it's enjoyable.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:31.460]   But they're a very small percentage of people.
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:33.660]   I don't really understand it.
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:35.860]   If that's you, then I think you should know it.
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:40.460]   But the vast majority of people seem much better served to me by working,
[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:41.560]   especially men.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:42.460]   You need to work.
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.260]   If you're a man, you need to work,
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:48.460]   because one of your most valuable contributions to society is the work that you do.
[00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:49.660]   I don't care what that work is.
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:50.860]   I just care that you work.
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.460]   It's good for you to work.
[00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:53.560]   Then you work and you rest,
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:57.560]   and you're going to enjoy your expenses,
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:02.960]   your rest, your relaxation far more if you can do it out of income.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.060]   What I think the best thing to do is this.
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:07.260]   If you're going to pursue fire, great.
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:09.060]   Pursue fire.
[00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:11.060]   Build up a big stash of money.
[00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:12.760]   If you're going to quit, quit.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:13.860]   Take a sabbatical.
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:14.760]   Take a year.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:15.960]   Do it, whatever you want to do.
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:16.760]   Write a novel.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:18.860]   Read the great novels.
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:20.460]   Whatever it is.
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:21.260]   Go travel.
[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:24.860]   Do whatever for a year, or however long you think is right.
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:28.260]   But at the end of the year, you better have another thing to put your hand to.
[00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:31.260]   And now you may put your hand to it with a different attitude.
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:33.960]   You may not put 80 hours a week into the corporate grind.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:34.660]   Sure.
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:36.560]   You may do it a little bit more modestly.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.760]   You may work it into your life in a little bit better way.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.060]   But don't quit and do nothing.
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:44.760]   Stay working, and then just spend out of that income, and set yourself goals.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.860]   And then when you multiply your income throughout your lifetime,
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:50.760]   you don't get into this selfish perspective of just saying,
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.460]   "Well, I'm just going to keep all the money for me, and it's got to just last it for me."
[00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:56.960]   You maintain this sense of abundance, where you know there's so much money.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.660]   Now you can impact others.
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:01.660]   Now you can accomplish change in the world.
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:04.360]   Now you can put money to good use.
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.660]   And it's just a lot more fun.
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.960]   I don't ever want to be in a position where my income is going down.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:09.960]   That stinks.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:13.960]   You want your income to go up, and to have the confidence that it's going to go up more and more and more.
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:17.860]   And I don't see any reason why that can't be fun and rewarding,
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:20.760]   especially if you have time to do it right, etc.
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.060]   So those are my thoughts.
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:24.160]   I don't think it's a major problem.
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.760]   But I do think, for the reasons said,
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:32.060]   but I still don't think you should plan on that, for the reasons stated.
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:38.160]   I don't see really many examples of anybody who just does well by stopping and quitting.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:40.460]   So if you want to leave your corporate job, great.
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:44.060]   But you don't need $2 million to leave your corporate job.
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:47.060]   If you're earning $200, and you're living on $50,
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:51.160]   you don't have to have a million-dollar portfolio to go and do something else.
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:53.460]   You can leave the $200,000-a-year job,
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:57.660]   and go take a $50,000-a-year job that you think will give you a better lifestyle.
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:58.960]   So why wait till you're fired?
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:02.260]   That's basically, every time I go through fire, I come to this thing.
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:03.660]   Why wait?
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.860]   What's the point?
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:08.460]   If you accept anything that I said,
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:12.360]   that work is good for the soul, that work is meaningful,
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:15.060]   it's a meaningful part of your contribution in life,
[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:16.660]   it's important, it's valuable,
[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:21.560]   and you recognize that the problem is usually that someone's doing work that's not well-suited to them,
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:23.460]   where they don't feel competent or effective,
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:26.460]   or they're in a bad environment that's something where they're not appreciated,
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:29.160]   or they don't have opportunities for growth,
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:34.260]   and/or if their work life is just not healthy,
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:37.160]   100 hours a week, you know, massive pressure and stress.
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:39.460]   If you just realize that those things can be changed,
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:41.860]   you can find work that's well-suited for you,
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:46.760]   and you can move into work that is in a very comfortable work life,
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:48.960]   why not start there?
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.360]   You don't need a million dollars.
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.860]   10,000 bucks will do it. 100,000 bucks will do it.
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:54.460]   You're probably already there.
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:56.860]   Don't just dream about paradise.
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:58.960]   Live it with Fiji Airways.
