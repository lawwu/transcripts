Now let's say that instead of working in Canada, you instead were working in the Cayman Islands. So the Cayman Islands doesn't have an income tax. They don't have any kind of income taxes imposed on people who live there, who work there. So now you don't have any foreign taxes paid. Well, now you can't take the foreign tax credit. What that means, though, is you're going to pay $20,000 to the U.S. government on your $100,000 of income, assuming that you're going to pay $20,000 to the U.S. government on your $100,000 of income, assuming that you're

[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.740]   So the foreign tax credit can be useful if you're paying foreign taxes.
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.740]   If you get the credit, you might as well use it.
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:28.740]   But what I'd love to see most people do is use that for offsetting things like their capital gains taxes, etc.
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.440]   and use it if you have it, but don't try to get there this way.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:38.240]   However, you are correct that even if you don't qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion,
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.240]   if you're paying foreign income taxes, you can still claim those foreign income taxes,
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.960]   and you will still have earned income,

[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:42.160]   The way it works is you will pay and owe US taxes on that $10,000 of income. It doesn't start at the bottom of the bracket. It'll rather it will start at the top of the bracket, but you will still be able to claim your deduction, your standard deduction or your itemized deduction. You will still be able to claim maybe a child tax credit or some of that if you have it against that $10,000, but you'll have $10,000 of earned income, which you can then use for an IRA contribution. So that's another simple way is make your income higher so that you have more earned income.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:42.160]   So that's another simple way is make your income higher so that you have more earned income.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:42.160]   So that's another simple way is make your income higher so that you have more earned income.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:42.160]   So that's another simple way is make your income higher so that you have more earned income.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:53.220]   .
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:05.880]  , in the world. So I'm just going to give you a little bit of an example. So in order for you to end your relationship with the Canadian taxing authorities, you have to become a resident somewhere else, pick up a residency and sever all your ties with Canada. So for $100,000 or less, the US system is probably a little easier to work with than the Canadian system. Now, my hope is, of course, we all get to more than $100,000, in which case I'd rather have the Canadian system, but what can we do? So that's the strict days test. We'll come back to that in a moment, because you have to use it for the trick that I'm going to tell you to work.
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:14.480]  er
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:22.180]   think. It.
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:57.340]   because that test is an annual test. It only works on calendar years, which is why generally when people expatriate, the advice is claim using the strict days test first, and then if you're going to set up a residence, move into the bona fide residence exclusion. But here's the cool thing with the strict days test. Let's talk about how it works. It doesn't have to be January 1 to December 31. So you don't have to be gone from the United States from January 1 to December 31 in order to claim the strict days test.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:20.920]  I
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:35.240]  obedance.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:49.140]   Now what you've most likely been doing up till now is claiming your year to go from January 1 to December 31. Just for its simple convenience. That's what you've been claiming. Here's what I would point out to you, though. You don't have to claim that. You don't have to claim that. So here's what you can do to create earned income that will allow you to contribute to an IRA.
[00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:49.240]   You don't have to claim that. So here's what you can do to create earned income that will allow you to contribute to an IRA.

[00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:10.680]   But I don't think that federal income taxes are that massive when compared at $100,000 of income or $50,000 of income when compared to what they are at $500,000 of income or $1,000,000 of income.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:17.860]   I mean, depending on your family situation, all that, you've got $100,000, you've got probably under $10,000 of federal income tax.
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.200]   Now, should we save the $10,000?
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:20.880]   Absolutely.

[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:34.640]   you have so much capital available to you
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:38.520]   that you can make choices with what to do with that.
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.600]   So you need more money?
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:45.260]   Well, you've got tons of money that you can spend on creating more income.
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.340]   So maybe you pursue a different investment strategy.
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:51.060]   So you say, well, I can't go get my $200,000 job yet.
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:51.120]   So you can't go get your $200,000 job back.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:51.120]   So you can't go get your $200,000 job back.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:51.120]   So you can't go get your $200,000 job back.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:51.120]   So you say, well, I can't go get my $200,000 job yet.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:51.120]   So you say, well, I can't go get my $200,000 job yet.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:51.120]   So you say, well, I can't go get my $200,000 job yet.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:38:20.520]  , but you still got a million dollars.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.080]   Give me a break.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:21.140]   Give me a million dollars. I can manufacture a $200,000 job in dozens of businesses. I may not be able to manufacture $200,000 of passive investment returns from a million-dollar portfolio, but give me a million dollars and I can come on. If you're willing to work and you're willing to take a job, you can do it. Now my nervousness would be if you're used to being a corporate employee or employee,
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:51.160]   and you don't know how to create a $200,000 job for yourself when starting with a million dollars of capital.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:51.160]   I can't go get your $200,000 job back.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:51.160]   I can't go get your $200,000 job for yourself when starting with a million dollars of capital.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:51.160]   So that might be something that might be hard for somebody who's only ever worked for other people.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:51.160]   But you go to the average businessman who's earning a good income and say, could you create this income if you had a million dollars to start with?
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:51.160]   I could make five times that amount of money because most businessmen that start that make a $200,000 income started with nothing.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:51.160]   Now you give them a million dollars to start with it. You got options all over the place.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:51.160]   So you can't go get your $200,000 job for yourself when starting with a million dollars of capital.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:39:21.180]  ,
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:21.180]   You can't go get your $200,000 job if you had a million dollars to start with a million dollars of capital.
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:51.200]   You can't go get your $200,000 job if you had a million dollars to start with a million dollars of capital.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:51.200]   You can't go get your $200,000 job if you had a million dollars to start with a million dollars of capital.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:51.200]   You can't go get your $200,000 job if you had a million dollars to start with a million dollars of capital.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:51.200]   You can't go get your $200,000 job if you had a million dollars to start with a million dollars of capital.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:51.200]   You can't go get your $200,000 job if you had a million dollars to start with a million dollars of capital.

[00:39:51.200 --> 00:40:21.220]  ,
[00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:21.220]   You can't go get your $200,000 job if you had a million dollars to start with a million dollars of capital.
[00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:21.220]   You can't go get your $200,000 job if you had a million dollars to start with a million dollars of capital.

[00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:21.220]   You can't go get your $200,000 job if you had a million dollars to start with a million dollars of capital.
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:51.240]   I think you should have a career plan or at least some guesses on a career plan for after your early retirement.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:51.240]   I really do.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:51.240]   I think that it is bad to plan to sit around and do things that are not good for you.
