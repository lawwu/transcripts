[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   but I thought this would be a great time to beta test my more complete
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.120]   understanding of the deep life. So we'll call today's deep question.
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.200]   How do I rebuild my life into something deeper?
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:20.800]   I'm Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions,
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.760]   the show about living and working deeply in a distracted world.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.280]   So I'm here in my deep work HQ joined as always by my producer,
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.280]   Jesse. Jesse, I got some news.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.000]   There is now officially available on Amazon
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.840]   for pre-order is the new edition of the Time Block Planner.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.780]   Oh, nice.
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.680]   It's took a long time coming because of supply chain issues, et cetera.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.760]   Also we really spent a lot of time trying to get it right.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.520]   I'll have to bring it in, but we have a stack of what are called blanks.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.920]   So just to get the new material, right, the new binding, right.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.960]   They build these blank versions, right? There's no color. It's all white.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.720]   And we went through a lot of those that try to get it just right,
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.960]   but very happy with how it ended up. Spiral binding, right? Spiral bound.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.800]   So these are, I'll get into these details as it gets a little bit closer.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.000]   The official sell date when it's available to ship is August 15th.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.120]   But I can tell you briefly now the big difference is really high quality
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.480]   spiral binding, double wire, big, big loop spiral bindings.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.800]   You can open this thing, lie it completely flat.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.920]   I also re-engineered the interior pages.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.600]   There are no longer individual time block double page spreads for the weekend days
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.400]   because I don't recommend that you time block your weekends
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.080]   to that level of detail.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.640]   So instead, we have these new things I call weekend pages
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.400]   where you have a space on one page.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.440]   These are two facing pages.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.720]   You have space on one page for building a rougher granularity plan
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.000]   and still doing metric tracking on the weekend
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.760]   and another page for your weekly planning.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.760]   This saves space.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.760]   So now we can get an extra month worth of planning pages
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.400]   into a single time block planner.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.200]   It'll now carry you through an entire four month semester, which to me,
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.760]   because that's my that's the unit in which I break up my year
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.640]   was very important.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.280]   So I'm telling you about it now early
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.440]   because you might consider wanting to preorder a copy of the planner.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.920]   The only reason why I'm bringing this up is that supply chain issues.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.360]   So depending on how things go, we may be in a circumstance
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.840]   where we sell out the initial printing of the new planners,
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.920]   and then it might take a little bit before that supply chain catches up
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.720]   and we have the steady flow going.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.240]   So if you're looking for this on Amazon,
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.400]   the original time block planner is still up there.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.800]   You can differentiate that page from the page for the new planner
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.720]   because it says second edition in parentheses in the title.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.960]   We don't even have the graphic yet.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.440]   You'll see the graphic is the same for both.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.680]   So look for that second new version or second edition at the top.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.840]   So if you're interested in making sure you get your copy on August 15th,
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.440]   you might want to preorder it.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.120]   My editor wanted me to note that there if there are
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.320]   time block planner 1.0 fans out there,
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.760]   you also might want to consider stocking up now while they're still available.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.920]   That page will be up there on Amazon until we sell out
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.840]   of the printing of the old version, and then it'll disappear.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.160]   So once that stock is gone, that's gone.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.040]   So if you're a diehard original version aficionado,
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.560]   you might want to stock up now.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.120]   And if you want to make sure you get your second version
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.960]   as soon as it's available in August, you might want to consider preordering now.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.680]   As we get closer, we'll talk about it in more detail.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.880]   Well, maybe I'll do another primer and time block planning
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.680]   and we'll show you the new planner.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.280]   I think I'm going to see it in July is when I get my first hands
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.760]   on a fully formed one.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.400]   So stay tuned.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.320]   But I just wanted to drop one of the drop that note.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.680]   Yeah, that'll be good for new listeners to that don't are familiar with it.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.160]   We could be a good chance to go through time blocking the nuances,
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.440]   show off the new show off the new planner and such.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.920]   All right. So what do we want to talk about today?
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.800]   Well, Jesse, here's let me give you the thought process
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.560]   that leads us to today's topic.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.480]   So I'm just finishing up the manuscript.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.000]   The final changes, the very final changes on the manuscript for my new book
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.560]   on slow productivity, which will come out next year.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.560]   And so we're about to it's called manuscript submission.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.000]   But it's where you actually officially the publisher hands it off
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.120]   to the the team that works on things like copy editing. Right.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.200]   So you're done writing and now you're into polishing. So
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.360]   I have begun to think a little bit about the topic of the next book,
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.280]   which is going to be about the deep life.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.600]   I sold both of those together.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.040]   And almost immediately, once I started thinking
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.000]   just in recent weeks about the idea of the deep life,
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.240]   it became apparent to me that the the process we talk about here
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.760]   on this show, the taking of the deep life buckets.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.760]   And focusing on those buckets one by one is incomplete.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.080]   Now, when I think about the deep life from giving one on one advice to someone,
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.280]   there's other aspects to the cultivation of depth that goes beyond there.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.840]   In some sense, by the time you get to the point where you're looking at
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.760]   individual aspects of your life and trying to do a potentially radical overhaul,
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.280]   that's pretty far along in the process of trying to cultivate a life more of depth.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.120]   There's a whole psychological self-identification process piece
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.760]   that goes to this.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.440]   We call it a pre process where you set yourself up,
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.920]   you set up your life on a foundation in which you can make those types of changes.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.280]   So I've been trying to brainstorm a systematic way
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.200]   of describing the broader goal of cultivating the deep life,
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.600]   a more complete system where you can go from I'm overwhelmed, I'm stressed out.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.240]   I'm anxious. I feel as if my life is just mired in a sort of superficial shallowness.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.320]   The fuller process of how you get from there.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.160]   To a deeper life, one that seems remarkable, one that seems impactful.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.320]   I want to stretch that out a little bit more.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:12.680]   So what I have here is the first version of an elaborated deep life process.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.760]   I want to go through it today in the show
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.400]   and then solicit your feedback as my listeners send me some notes.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.120]   You can send them straight to author@calnewport.com
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.080]   or interesting@calnewport.com.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.680]   I'm interested in your thoughts on this.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.320]   This is still early stages, but I thought this would be a great time
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.480]   to beta test my more complete understanding of the deep life.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.480]   So we'll call today's deep question.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.320]   How do I rebuild my life into something deeper?
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.240]   All right, so I'm going to load up on the screen here my notes, I'm going to draw.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.000]   So caveat emptor, Cal Newport's going to try drawing.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.040]   This never ends up being that beautiful.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.600]   Be ready for it.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.320]   If you're listening and you want to watch what I'm drawing on the screen.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.640]   This is episode 252.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.480]   So go to YouTube.com/CalNewportMedia and look for episode 252
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.720]   or go to the deep life.com and look for episode 252.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.520]   I'll also do my best to narrate what I'm drawing for those who are just listening.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.520]   All right. So what you'll see on the screen here
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.160]   is what I call the deep life stack.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.880]   Right now I have it empty.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.360]   We're going to fill in the details as we go along.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.400]   The stack has four different levels to it.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.480]   I'll highlight those.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.680]   We got level one, two, three, four.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.560]   And the way I'm conceptualizing the deep life stack is sequential.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.320]   You start with developing the bottom layer of the stack.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.040]   Then you move up to the second layer, then the third, then the fourth.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.560]   And then we're going to iterate and we'll get into that soon.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.360]   All right. So what happens on the first layer of the deep life stack?
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.880]   This is the first big change or breakthrough
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.720]   I would say I've had when thinking about the deep life more recently.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.720]   What I'm going to put at this bottom layer.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.720]   It's going to be discipline.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.760]   That's going to mean two things.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.160]   But let me let me say what my goal is here.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.840]   I'm realizing when it comes to cultivating a different type of life,
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.680]   any type of transformation, you have to first change your self
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.960]   identification to be the type of person who is able
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.880]   to persist with things that are difficult
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.920]   in the moment in pursuit of a greater good down the line.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.800]   And I think it's very easy for people like me who give advice for a living
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.200]   and who've been doing this for a long time to take for granted
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.480]   that that's what we do already.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.680]   But this is actually for most people, maybe the most critical step
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.440]   is transitioning from someone who says, look, this is not me.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.440]   I don't have discipline.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.720]   I'm not really able to pursue goals unless I feel really excited
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.760]   about it in the moment.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.640]   How do we shift that self identity?
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.800]   And it's longtime listeners of the show, no, I really do see discipline
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.600]   as an identity.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.400]   It is not something you do.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.440]   It is an identity.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.720]   You see yourself as someone who is disciplined or you don't.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.840]   That requires some cultivation.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.360]   So at the very bottom of the deep life stack, and this is why I've highlighted
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.400]   this, you would get started by putting some elements into your life.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.840]   That required discipline to accomplish, and it it doesn't really matter
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.400]   when we're first beginning here.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.720]   What these are, you just want to push them to be past what's trivial.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.000]   But still south of intractable.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.520]   So where you're starting from might depend where how ambitious
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.600]   these initial bits of discipline are.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.720]   So this is where you might say, look, I'm going to train for a 5K.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.760]   I am going to read five books a month.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.240]   You're trying to find something that's going to require some discipline.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.600]   I'm going to overhaul my nutrition.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.960]   I'm going to do something new.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.400]   I'm going to do this workout routine, try to hit a streak on Peloton,
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.520]   whatever it is, you're calibrating it to where you are.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.400]   And I don't really care at first.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.320]   The content of these things you're pursuing with discipline.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.800]   This is identity formation.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.800]   And that's where we get started.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.200]   You take a couple of things in your life.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.480]   You say, how can I make progress on this every day?
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.360]   And if it's too hard, you find something easier
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.840]   until you can move up to something harder.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.520]   But you're establishing discipline.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.720]   The second piece here.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.640]   Is you're going to establish your route for everything we're about to do.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.880]   A directory, a folder, a drawer in a desk, where it's going to be the one place
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.880]   where you keep track of everything that you've committed to do in your life,
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.640]   your rules, your systems, your goals.
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.240]   So you're going to initialize this route to your ultimate life
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.520]   planning processes with these initial discipline projects.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.600]   So at the beginning, you could just have a folder on your desktop.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.760]   You could have a drawer where you're just writing down.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.720]   Here's my disciplines.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.000]   I'm working on these two things.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.360]   Here's what I do every day towards them.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.880]   This is going to grow as we move to the deep life stack.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.960]   But you're establishing here in the discipline step.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.680]   Here's where I keep track of what I commit to.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.480]   And you're starting to practice having commitments
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.720]   that are about long term value, not what you want to do in the short term.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.880]   So already, we're a little bit different
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.480]   than standard thinking about lifestyle designs,
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.520]   because we're not starting with the decisions.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.760]   We're not starting with the let's quit my job.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.240]   I want to move to the country.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.960]   We're recognizing that there is some effacement that has to happen first.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.960]   There's some preparation that has to happen first.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.920]   We don't want to jump into the decisions to develop the self first.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.920]   So that's the first layer of the stack.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.480]   All right. So once that's going, I have a couple of things and I've impressed myself.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.280]   I'm doing these. I didn't think I could.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.640]   I am capable of discipline and I have a centralized place now
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.480]   to keep track of what I'm doing.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.600]   We move on to the next layer.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.880]   I'll write this in here.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.800]   We'll call this values.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.720]   All right. So yet we're not yet the choosing to quit your job.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.800]   We're not yet the moving values is where you are going to establish.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.600]   What it is that is important to you.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.960]   What are the truths that exist rooted outside of just your own preferences
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.960]   around which you were going to structure your life?
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.360]   This is committing to what is important to you.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.400]   There's three pieces to figuring out what your values are going to be.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.760]   I'll write them all three down, then we'll talk about it.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:20.200]   Code rituals. Routines.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.720]   So code is actually figuring out this is my code that I live by.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.080]   I strive to do this. I will never do this.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.280]   I have integrity. I am honest.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.040]   I will prioritize the protection of others, whatever it is.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.000]   This is where you make that clear.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.280]   I have a code by which I live and all of my decisions are going to come back
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.360]   and make sure that they satisfy this code.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:50.040]   All my big decisions, all my short term actions will live by this code.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.880]   The code should be something that forces you on occasion to do things
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.880]   that are hard or scary in the moment to move away
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.480]   what might be in your best interest.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.120]   But you have a code written down.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:05.920]   Then you have rituals recorded, some sort of rituals that you commit to
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:12.120]   that help just reinforce in your life what it is that you value and take seriously.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.240]   Finally, you're going to have routines, things you do on a regular basis
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:21.000]   that ensure that you are supporting these values that are encoded in your code,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.480]   that make sure that you are pursuing them,
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.840]   reflecting the things you value in your everyday life.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.120]   Now, of course, the most obvious pre-packaged answer
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.680]   to these three things would be a traditional religion.
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.600]   So if you are already religious, that's going to make it very easy
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.560]   for you to figure out code or rituals and routines for if you're religious.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.600]   The ritual is going to involve, for example, let's say you're Muslim.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:49.320]   It might involve daily prayer ritual as a way of reinforcing
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.960]   or reminding yourself of your relationship to God.
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.320]   Routines might involve things that your religion asks you to do,
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.200]   such as some sort of charitable giving on a regular basis
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.200]   to go out and serve others in the community.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.280]   But you don't have to have a religion to fill in code, rituals and routines.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.080]   You can do so on your own.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.480]   The thing I want to emphasize here is don't worry so much about getting this
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.880]   exactly right, because when we're done with this stack,
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.560]   we're going to add one final piece, which is iterate.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.440]   So you come to the stack where you are in your life right now,
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.560]   and you can expect that might change and evolve as time goes on.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.960]   Now, everything you're going to figure out here for values.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.160]   Gets recorded in that system you set up during the first
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.000]   the first level of the stack during discipline,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.560]   that's why I'm drawing an arrow back down there, that's where you record.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.840]   Here's my code, the things I value, things I don't,
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.680]   how I plan to live my life, that's where you record your rituals.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.160]   You know, I meditate every morning, I read a book of philosophy,
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:53.840]   one book per month, I observe Shabbat as a time to reflect whatever it is.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.000]   That's where your the routines go in.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.120]   I volunteer every month.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.560]   I whatever whatever it is actually going to be.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.640]   And I go to services, whatever it is.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.360]   This is all written down and you have a central place for it
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.280]   because you set that up in discipline.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.960]   These two things, these first two layers of the stack, discipline and values.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.600]   This now becomes our safety net foundation.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.560]   Before we go up, the things that are going to follow
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.960]   are going to be a little bit more complicated and ambitious.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.480]   But if everything else falls apart in your life,
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.320]   your professional system goes apart, there's health or sickness issues.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.520]   Your life takes a turn.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.400]   There's some sort of disaster.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.360]   The two levels that will always be there for you to fall down on
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.600]   will be discipline plus value.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.920]   So this is very important.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.800]   The idea that I can do things that are hard
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.280]   when it's in my long term interest or the interest of my values,
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.000]   even if I don't want to, I'm capable of doing this and I know what I'm all about.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.120]   What is my code?
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.280]   And I'm able to build my life around it.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.600]   That is your insurance for disaster.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.880]   That is your insurance against everything else going wrong.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.040]   If everything else we're about to talk about unravels,
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.000]   you will be able to fall back on that.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.160]   And that's going to give you a soft landing
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.160]   and it's going to give you a foundation in which you will eventually be able to rebuild.
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.240]   All right, so now we're going to head towards a layer
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.040]   where we're getting a little bit more into the traditional design,
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:19.920]   life design type waters, and that's going to be what I call calm.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:29.520]   So the goal with calm is to gain control over your life.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:34.840]   And to leverage that control to give yourself breathing room.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:39.720]   So it's the calm level of the stack where you are actually going to start
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.680]   thinking about organizational and productivity systems.
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:46.240]   How do I keep track of the different obligations in my professional life
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.960]   and my personal life?
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.440]   How do I plan? How do I manage my time?
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.440]   This is all about I have control.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.120]   I'm not just stumbling reactively through life.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.480]   I have some control of what's going on.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.640]   Now, once you have control, I'm organizing things.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.600]   I can I could build out smart plans.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:08.280]   I can now see much more clearly the relationship between my implicit workload,
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.880]   my tacit obligations and my schedule.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.960]   Now you have a really good sense of is this reasonable or not,
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.440]   or how much can I actually have on my plate before I begin to get stressed out?
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.280]   And you can leverage this control to start doing some minimalism,
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.640]   start taking some things off of your plate to simplify aspects of your commitments
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.240]   in your personal life, in your family life, in your professional life.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.520]   The goal here is I have control of my time.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.760]   I pruned my schedule to the degree that I have some flexibility in breathing room.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:42.080]   And I am now ready to start thinking about some bigger picture changes.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.880]   Because if we get to the final stack, which is where you do the fun stuff.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.280]   We move to the farm.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.920]   If you get to that final stack and your life is chaotic
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.320]   and you're overwhelmed and you're busy and exhausted and fatigued,
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.760]   there's not going to be room for you to do what you need to do.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.000]   There's not going to be room for you to reflect.
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.480]   There's not going to be room for you to pursue the disciplines and values
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.080]   that lay under it.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.400]   And there's not going to be room to actually make the big changes.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.400]   If you don't control your life, you also are not going to be able to
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.720]   build up the career capital.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.040]   You'll probably need to execute some of these ideas.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.600]   The more you're killing it at work
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.520]   because you control your time and your obligations
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.320]   and you can give things the time they need,
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.360]   the more options you're going to have to transform that work.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.480]   This is true in a lot of different elements as well.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.480]   And so this is, again, something you don't
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.680]   you don't always see in the discussion of lifestyle design,
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.960]   but I think it's it's foundational. I'm throwing it in there.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.600]   Calm. I'm under control.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.560]   These three things, if you're starting from scratch,
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.520]   might take a while, by the way.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.200]   This might be the work of six months to a year to build the first three layers.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.360]   But once you have, you get to the final stack,
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.920]   you're the final layer of the stack.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.840]   Which I call plan.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.640]   And this finally.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.600]   Is where we get back to more familiar territory.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.400]   This is where we get back towards the deep life buckets territory.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.680]   This is where you divide your life into the major areas that are important to you
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.280]   and start to think through,
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.720]   what does my life look like in each of these areas?
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.800]   What changes do I want to make?
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.240]   And you don't have to overhaul everything at the same time,
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.960]   but maybe you look at community
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.240]   through your relationship with your family and friends,
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.040]   those who are important to you and say, OK.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.400]   Let's start overhauling this.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.440]   What do I want this aspect of my life to look like?
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.360]   Where does it fall short?
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:33.360]   What type of changes would I need to make to better fulfill my values here?
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.320]   And this is where you might make the bigger change.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.000]   You move to be closer to family.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.680]   You commit the community organizations.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.640]   Maybe craft, of course, would be a big one here.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.600]   Your job. OK, let me really think about my job.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.600]   What's going on here? Is it overwhelming me?
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.280]   Is it compatible with the other things I care about?
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.680]   Maybe I want to hatch a plan to transform this job
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.280]   into something that's going to better support my vision for my life.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.680]   All of this happens here.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.840]   The buckets, lifestyle, career planning, all of this is squeezed
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:03.240]   into the top layer out of four in the deep life stack.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.760]   And this really is the big innovation between the way we used to talk about it
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.080]   and the way we had talked about it,
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.400]   the way we're talking about it now.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:17.120]   If discipline, values and calm is foundational, and if we ignore that,
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:22.760]   whatever we do up in plan is going to be haphazard and be very likely to fizzle.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.640]   We try to make some big change, but we don't have anything else nailed down.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.840]   We're building this big change, this new conceptual structure
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.000]   for our life on top of sand.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.200]   That foundation is not strong enough.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.880]   I'm going to add a couple more arrows here, because again,
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:40.120]   throughout each of these stacks, where do your decisions go?
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:44.760]   Back into that central repository you set up during the discipline level.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:48.560]   These are my organizational systems for calm.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.960]   This is what I'm working on right now, working on my craft bucket.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.840]   And here's my vision.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.320]   So in that discipline step, that all got set up.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.000]   Now, the number of disciplines, the things that you are pursuing regularly
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.680]   that you're committed to, that also increases as you move up the stack.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.400]   Values adds rituals and routines to your list of disciplines.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.960]   Calm adds organizational systems to your list of disciplines.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:13.360]   Plan might add bucket specific keystone habits to your list of disciplines.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.440]   So this everything down there grows the description of your systems,
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.480]   the descriptions of your discipline commitments that all grows as you
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.120]   as you move up the stack.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.600]   So I have these arrows pointing back down.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:28.160]   And then finally, once you're once you've made it through the whole stack,
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.480]   you draw one last arrow here.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.360]   You are going to iterate,
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.840]   which means you return back.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.440]   Towards the bottom.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:42.080]   And refactor focusing on what needs the most work,
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.800]   so you you've made it through the whole stack.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.960]   Enjoy that for a while.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.200]   Then you're going to iterate back down again.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.480]   OK, let's go back down the discipline.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.480]   How is this going?
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:54.120]   Is my if I cleaned up my description of my systems and my disciplines
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.680]   or the stuff hanging around here, I don't do anymore.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.520]   Let me clean that up.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.600]   Make sure the way I'm tracking this goes well.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.840]   Am I committing discipline to the things I said I am?
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.280]   If I'm not, do I have too many things in here?
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.840]   Do I need to clean that up? OK, we're good.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.040]   Let's move up the values.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.800]   Am I liking my current code?
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.400]   The rituals I have in place to help reinforce the code routines
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.760]   I have to put that code into action in the world.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.200]   Am I ready to tweak that?
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:18.240]   Do I want to make a major change in my maybe at first earlier in my life?
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.800]   These were self-imposed and in middle age with a family.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.480]   They're going to be more tied to a formal theology.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.240]   So you're going back and checking that out.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.840]   You're going up the calm.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.440]   How are my systems going for organization?
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.560]   Oh, maybe they're going well.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.400]   What about my load?
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.040]   You know, I feel overloaded. Great.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.560]   So as I revisit that stack, I'm going to make some more cuts.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.520]   On the things that I'm committed to or pursuing,
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.920]   and you can make up the plan, you might say,
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.000]   I'm going to look at another bucket more carefully.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.720]   I looked at craft last time, but I really want to now think about
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.520]   celebration, sort of quality in my life.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.840]   That's iteration.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.520]   You go back to the whole stack, check in at each layer,
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.280]   spending time on the layers that need time before moving on to the next.
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.560]   You probably want to do this once a year.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.240]   I recommend using your birthday as the anchor for this.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.680]   Different years, you're going to stop and spend more time
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.320]   on different layers than others.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.120]   Sometimes everything might be rock and rolling.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.440]   So you're just tweaking on your way up and it takes you a couple of weeks.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.600]   No problem.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.040]   Sometimes you're going to lose the next six months of your years
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.920]   of really reflectively rethinking your life.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.280]   But the structures, the way you think about that,
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.600]   it structures the way you go through trying to refactor or tighten up
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.920]   what's actually going on in your day to day existence.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.280]   So that's what I'm thinking about now.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.040]   This is my generalization of what used to just be the deep life
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.600]   buckets, the deep life stack.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.360]   It's equal parts psychology
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:39.720]   as it is practical habit, as it is visionary planning.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:44.640]   All of those things are now mixed together in a more structured way.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.720]   This also reflects more carefully or closely, I should say,
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.040]   what I actually do in my own life, the way I think these things through,
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.040]   the way I order these things.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.680]   So I'm interested in your thoughts.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.640]   Are we improving or are we overcomplicated?
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:02.000]   I still have time to think about this, so feel free to send it through.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.920]   I don't know, Jesse, am I adding too much complication or are we getting to some
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:09.880]   some levels we actually needed for thinking about this topic?
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.960]   I think it goes in hand with what you've talked about before
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.400]   in terms of stacks and discipline and metric tracking.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.960]   So like the metric tracking on the time block planner would be in that.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.680]   Yeah, it becomes a level, becomes a discipline.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.680]   Right. The time block planner is something you might introduce as calm.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:33.440]   The metric planning is installed in the discipline stack.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.240]   Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.680]   I think one of the things I was underestimating.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.960]   So in addition to just the psychological preparation,
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.680]   was I take for granted structure and organization in my life.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.560]   And it's something we hear from listeners a lot is if you are not
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:55.000]   organized and structured in how you manage just even the minutia of your life,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.280]   it's actually really difficult to do anything big.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.280]   Yeah, it feels impossible.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.800]   Or if you try it, it's not going to go well because you're just throwing
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.080]   a big change in an already chaotic situation.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.920]   Yeah, you've had that in place for a really long time.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.000]   Yeah. And that's why I take it for granted.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.120]   Yeah. But I think for a lot of people, I was thinking,
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.160]   I'm going to write a book about the deep life.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.680]   I can't jump into let's overhaul your job
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.800]   when there's someone who has never actually had any sort of
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.160]   coherent organizational system to any part of their life.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.280]   It's impossible until you feel that you control your life in a breathing room.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.520]   It's very difficult to imagine making a big change.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.440]   And, you know, we're going to see that
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.200]   the questions I chose for today's episode are all deep life related.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.880]   There are issues and questions about people, you know, pursuing the deep life.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.360]   And we're going to see some of that in the questions.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.680]   There's at least one I have in mind where someone is.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.880]   They're coming to what you would think about as the plan level of the stack
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.480]   with the other levels not in place.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.960]   And it just feels impossible to them.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.120]   Yeah. I mean, a lot of it has come down to your time management system.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.600]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.240]   How do you keep track of your time?
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.480]   Then how do you manage your obligations
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.760]   and how do you then prune those obligations?
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.200]   Right. It's very difficult to keep breathing room in your life
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.280]   if you can't control the stuff that's taking away the air.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.640]   If you don't control it, you're just grabbing.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:17.000]   It's very hard to get at things or organize things or move things out of the way.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.040]   It's very paradoxical because people say, I don't want to be so
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.720]   I don't have time to do all these systems and be so rigid.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.320]   And then my whole life will be planning.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.760]   But it's exactly the people that.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:33.640]   Make a structure for the stuff in your life that have the flexibility.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.760]   Yeah. That have the breathing room that are, you know, have their feet up
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.440]   by the lake and are reading this, this misnomer that somehow
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.280]   have an organization will mean your time is more filled.
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:46.320]   It's actually the key to actually gain back time,
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.920]   the fine time affluence, the take some flexibility.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.080]   It's your boy, Jaco. Discipline equals freedom.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:55.120]   Yeah. Well, that's that term is definitely motivating
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.160]   or an inspiration here. Discipline at the base.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.680]   Provides the freedom to do other things.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.200]   Does read five books. Yeah.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.240]   And that was the other breakthrough.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.440]   I'm thinking because I found this working with people
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.280]   just finding that one or two things, that's the place to start.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.760]   I'm doing this thing I'm working on every day.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.720]   It's hard. It's optional.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.680]   I don't want to do it in the moment. Long term.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.840]   I did it. I succeeded.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.120]   That psychological switch.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.080]   That's so important to everything else.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:24.800]   So so I'm working on it, but it's one idea for how I might structure my
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.040]   my deep life book.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.560]   So we do have some questions exactly about the deep life.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.960]   Before we get there, I want to briefly mention
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.680]   one of the sponsors that makes this show possible.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:40.360]   That is our friends at Element LMNT, one of the original sponsors of the show.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:45.360]   And they are back as a sponsor, in part because I never stopped using this product.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.640]   And so I lamented what happened to Element.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.400]   I really like Element.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.080]   So I'm glad they're back and we can have them as a sponsor
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.320]   once again for the show.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.320]   So Element is a tasty electrolyte drink mix
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.560]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.880]   So that means it has that the levels of salt you really do need.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.080]   If you are sweating hard, you're working out, you're exercising
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.520]   as part of your discipline layer of the deep life stack.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.600]   And so you want a to replenish this, but you don't want to grab a sugary
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.800]   sports drink is where you use element.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.240]   You get the salt.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.480]   You don't get all of the sugar.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:26.400]   So you get 100 milligrams of sodium and 200 milligrams of potassium,
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.400]   60 milligrams of magnesium with no sugar, no color, no artificial ingredients,
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.160]   no gluten, no fillers, no BS.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.880]   I love the flavor.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:38.040]   I'm a big watermelon fan, but all the flavors are really good.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.800]   This allows you to get your electrolyte needs,
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:44.080]   even if you're keto or low carb or paleo or just in general,
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.480]   don't want a bunch of sugar.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.840]   So, look, I live in D.C.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.080]   It's humid here. I work out in my garage.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:57.200]   That is not a comfortable space, especially in the summers.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.560]   And I also go for long walks.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.840]   And when I get going and I get sweaty, my body craves salt.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.840]   It's always element I put in my water bottle.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.160]   So I am happy to endorse them.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.480]   I think it is the right replacement drink.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.840]   So right now, Element is offering a free sample pack with any purchase.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.760]   That's eight single serving packets free with any element order.
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:20.840]   This is a great way to try all the flavors or shell element with a salty friend.

[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.440]   So go to D.R.I.N.K. L.M.N.T.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.400]   Dot com slash deep.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.560]   And keep in mind, you can try it totally risk free if you don't like it.
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.880]   Share it with a salty friend and they will give you your money back.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.800]   No questions asked. You have nothing to lose.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.880]   Also want to talk about our good friends at Hinson Shaving,
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:54.080]   the razor I use to get my famously close shave.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.640]   So here's the deal with Hinson Shaving.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:00.080]   You buy from them this very nice precision milled.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.160]   I assume it's aluminum aluminum razor.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.840]   Hinson's is a company that is known for doing precision
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.480]   manufacturing for the aerospace industry, so they can they can design
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:14.480]   and mill these razors with incredible tolerances.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.280]   This is the key to getting a good shave.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:21.920]   You put a standard 10 cent safety blade in a Hinson's razor
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:26.560]   and only 0.0013 inch of the blade protrudes past the edge.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:31.320]   This gives you a close, clean shave without the diving board effect
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.400]   where the blade moves up and down the diving board effect
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.760]   that creates the next that creates the burn.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:39.120]   When it's such a little amount of the blade sticking past,
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.160]   you get a very good shave.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.120]   No clogs, no nicks.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:48.880]   And what I like about this is you're using a better made product
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.400]   to save money over time.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.880]   So you pay up front to get this beautifully milled razor,
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:56.080]   but you can use it with a standard 10 cent blade.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.440]   So what does that mean?
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.160]   It doesn't take long.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.920]   To amortize the cost of this razor, it does not take long.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:06.720]   We're now you're just spending a couple quarters per month
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.080]   on the cheap blades to put into this beautiful razor.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.960]   It does not take long before this is much cheaper to maintain
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.200]   than one of the disposable razors you get from the drugstore.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.760]   Then one of the subscriptions that you get.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.880]   So you get a beautiful, manufactured, really good tool
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.400]   that in the end is going to also be cheaper to use.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.360]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions and yes to a razor
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.080]   that will last you a lifetime.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.840]   Visit HensonShaving.com/Cal to pick the razor.
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:36.920]   And if you use the code CAL at checkout, you'll get two years
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.560]   worth of blades for free.

[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.040]   and the cost of the blades will be free.

[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.960]   H-E-N-S-O-N-S-H-A-V-I-N-G.com/Cal
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:55.200]   and use that code CAL at checkout.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:00.000]   All right, Jesse, let's do some deep life related questions.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.200]   Who do we have first today?
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.840]   All right. First question's from Mark, a 38 year old sales director.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.760]   I spend many hours a week taking care of my kids, cooking, cleaning,
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.560]   gardening, doing chores, fixing up my house and so on.
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.600]   Between this and my work, I have little to no free time.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.960]   The same applies to my wife.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.160]   When we do have free time, we are generally tired.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.600]   The idea that we could each find energy and time to consistently
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:26.920]   take long walks, work out or read for hours seems fantastical.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:30.720]   Do we need to be able to afford to outsource mundane tasks
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.880]   to cultivate a deep, deep life?
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:36.880]   Well, Mark, we could we could reword this question to say,
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:41.160]   you know, is it possible for a family with
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:44.600]   and he gave a little more details about his work, but, you know, a family with.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.880]   Lower, upper middle class jobs to take walks or exercise or read.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:54.000]   I don't think that's a fantastical goal.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.320]   I think there's a lot of families in similar professional situations
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:04.280]   where people still take walks, still exercise and still read.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.880]   I think that is definitely possible.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.680]   But what I also recognize that right now in your life, it doesn't.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.240]   I think that's important.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.640]   And this is where I think.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.640]   The fuller deep life stack we introduced earlier.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:20.480]   Is much more helpful than the way we used to talk about the deep life
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.680]   where we would just focus on the final changes, because what's happening here
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:27.680]   and I'm very empathetic to this, I I've been in this situation before.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.920]   Many are listeners in the same situation
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.080]   where your time just feels completely out of your control.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:37.040]   And it puts you in a defensive mood, it puts you in a mood
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.680]   where you're just sort of down on the prospects for doing anything
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.600]   with any control, we're exhausted all the time, we're working all the time.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.240]   When are things going to happen?
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:49.080]   How can I possibly think about carefully overhauling other parts of my life?
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.680]   So let's go back to the deep life stack.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.720]   What I'm going to what I'm going to suggest here is actually work
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:53.920]   in the deep life stack.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.680]   You know, this might seem like I'm giving you more work is going to help.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.880]   So I'm going to think about the stack.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:33:59.960]   I have it here in front of me.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.080]   Jesse, let's load this back up on the screen.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.760]   OK, all right. Let's think this through.
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.400]   All right, Mark. So what would this mean for you?
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.920]   Well, one discipline.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.560]   Well, the key thing here is really going to be here's my place, my drawer,
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.280]   my folder, we're going to keep track of everything we're about to do.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.640]   That doesn't take time.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.520]   This is a here's a folder. Here's here's a desk drawer. That's fine.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:21.080]   And we're going to throw something into our life here.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.960]   Not super time consuming, but kind of hard.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.480]   And we're going to maybe you're going to have to stretch a little bit.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.800]   OK, I can do this during my lunch hour every day or before I go to work.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.080]   It's going to be maybe a fitness thing or something else, but just something,
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.920]   something that is optional but meaningful to you.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.880]   That you're just going to commit to whatever it takes,
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.240]   I'm going to find time to do this.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:44.480]   I think that's worth doing because we're going to start changing that mindset.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:48.280]   And once that succeeds, you're going to say, OK, at least it's possible.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.080]   I am the type of person.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:52.240]   It's possible that I can find time to make something happen.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.320]   That's important to me, even though my life is busy.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.240]   Then we get up the values.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.240]   You're clarifying what's important to you and your wife.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.200]   And you should do this together.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.880]   And we'll talk more about that in a later question.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.960]   What's our code? What's my what are the rituals?
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:03.600]   What are the routines?
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.640]   Keep the rituals and routines very simple right now
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.680]   because you're feeling overwhelmed, but they can still be in there.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.640]   There can still be that moment of prayer every day.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:15.040]   If you're religious, there can still be that
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.920]   meditative moment, the gratitude journaling routines.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.760]   There can still be something you do, even if it's just look at Saturday morning.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:28.160]   You there's a one hour volunteer thing or a charitable thing you just have set up.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.800]   I give money to this cause, not a lot of money, but I do it.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.200]   And every month we do it.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:36.160]   And it's not very time consuming, but it's concrete and it's driven by your code.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:36.960]   And you get that in place.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.600]   We're not adding a lot of things in your schedule yet.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.720]   Now you're ready for the thing I think is going to help you most,
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:42.720]   which is the calm.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.840]   Layer of the stack.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:49.600]   So now buoyed by your discipline.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.520]   So the idea that you can make changes and have control over things,
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:55.880]   even when it's difficult, buoyed by your values that are really pushing you
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.400]   towards what matters and what's not.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:00.160]   So you have a compass that gives you a very strong north reading.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.200]   You can start to put in place some organizational system.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.200]   What's on our plate? How do we manage our time?
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.880]   What is this load?
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:10.480]   And then more crucially, where should we start pruning or simplifying?
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.720]   Driven by your values, driven by your discipline, you piece by piece,
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.600]   try to take what sounds like a whirlwind in your life right now
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.040]   and make it into a much more orderly flow.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:24.560]   We do this on these days, not this.
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.240]   We finish here. We do this in advance.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:29.720]   We get all the paperwork for the kids done in a, you know, over lunch on Thursday.
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:33.200]   You would be surprised, Mark, when you're when you're driven
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:37.320]   by a sense of self-efficacy, when you're driven by values,
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.640]   you trust by how much control and breathing room
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:44.400]   even a standard busy middle class or upper middle class life can seem.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.160]   How much room you can find, how much breathing room you can find.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.960]   And I don't want you to go right to this.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.400]   I mean, I want you to follow the stack.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:55.120]   I think there's a the discipline stack is key because you have to have the sense of
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:58.240]   I'm able to do things that are hard and I have a place I keep track of them
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.240]   and I follow what I write down.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.200]   You need the value stack because it's hard to prune.
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:06.200]   It's hard to take things back when you don't have the the bigger values driving you.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.200]   But once this column is in place, then and only then do I think you're ready
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.520]   to think about the planning step.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.240]   And I think by the time you get to the planning step,
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.880]   you're now going to have the control and breathing room necessary
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.120]   to make the changes that right now seem impossible.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.360]   And they might not be major.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.440]   But it might be some sort of routine, you're walking, you're exercising,
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.760]   you're reading more, I think that's going to be completely on the table.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.640]   More importantly, you're also now well set up if you discover
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:32.000]   what's really holding us back here is maybe the nature of our jobs,
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.080]   maybe the demands of this jobs.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:37.960]   Maybe that's making things impossible to really overhaul
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.640]   the other areas of my life the way I want.
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.000]   Or maybe it's to have these jobs. We have to live here.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:42.920]   The schools here aren't good.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.760]   So our kids have to go over to this private school.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.240]   The private school means we have to work more.
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.800]   And the private school is really difficult to get to.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.000]   And we're driving back and forth.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.960]   And that's what's stopping us from overhauling these other parts of our life.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.440]   Oh, this is all really clear now.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.960]   And we're driven by our values and our sense of self-efficacy
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.560]   and our control over what's going on.
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:00.520]   So we really can understand what's causing our time famine,
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.440]   what's causing our issues with our schedule.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:06.200]   With all of this in place, you might get clarity that you wouldn't have right now.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:09.480]   We should move and take a different job.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.880]   Oh, we need to leave the city.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.360]   Let's go here.
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.880]   They could go to this public school.
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.960]   They could walk to the middle school.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.960]   And the cost of living here is cheaper.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:21.520]   And actually, I could go down the halftime and do my old my old job remote
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.640]   while my wife still did full time.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.440]   But now we have a lot more.
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.760]   Now there's someone here after school.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.800]   Oh, my God, all the pieces fit in the place
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:30.760]   and I can overhaul these other parts of my life and everything is deeper.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.680]   But you can't get to that type of clarity without the other pieces first.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:37.120]   So I feel your pain, Mark.
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.040]   I also think that you you can.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:44.560]   Find more depth and by control and intention and satisfaction with your life,
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.920]   you can find it and you should.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:49.280]   And I think work to full stack.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:52.480]   My apologies for presenting this earlier in past episodes
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.720]   as just start overhauling, you know, your fitness routine,
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.680]   work the whole stack and have confidence.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:01.440]   More intentional, satisfying, meaningful life is absolutely available to you
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.080]   and in your situation, this is not something that's unovercome.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:07.000]   You're not a refugee in a war torn nation.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.400]   You're not scrambling for jobs just to try to keep the heat on.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.520]   You actually have.
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.480]   A foundation, more leverage than you think,
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:18.440]   but it's also much harder than we often let on to take advantage of that leverage.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.440]   So hopefully the stack there is going to help.
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.920]   By the way, send me a note.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.000]   If you start making some changes, I want to hear what's going on.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.600]   You can send the note right over to interesting account, Newport dot com.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:32.000]   Keep me posted in terms of the mundane tasks like outsourcing those.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.240]   I mean, that's all going to happen in calm.
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:40.560]   Yeah, but I think his point is he's frustrated that I have no time.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:45.120]   So I can't imagine anyone reading or exercising or doing anything else
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.880]   unless I suppose there's just someone I hired to do all these things.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.160]   And my point is most people don't outsource all that stuff.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:54.560]   And yet many, many people who don't have I don't even know
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.880]   who you outsource most of the stuff to.
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:59.600]   They still exercise and walk.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.040]   We have more.
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:06.640]   It could feel as if your obligations are leaving no time right now,
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.480]   and it could be the case that without having to majorly change
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:12.800]   a material situation, you could feel three times better
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.600]   by just how you control and track the situation and keep track of things
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.560]   with some strategic pruning, et cetera.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:21.640]   So I don't think I mean, maybe in the calm step, though, they'll realize.
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:22.800]   Because again, having.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:27.160]   Having this precision understanding of where your time goes
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.520]   and how different things interact with each other
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.240]   allows you so precisely to see where the pain points are.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:34.920]   So if there is going to be a little bit of outsourcing that happens,
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:38.040]   the calm layers, what's going to give you that precision to say,
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.120]   you know, the thing that's screwing this all up
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.800]   is driving back and forth to this school across town.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.840]   Well, the thing that's making the schedule impossible
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.280]   is this terrible giant yard we have with all these beds.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.640]   And we're always out there.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.720]   And, you know, if we stop doing this and use that money for a yard crew,
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.440]   everything else becomes possible.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.720]   Or that's where you say we need to move.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:56.640]   We have to get a different job.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:01.000]   It's again, an interesting point that doesn't come up as much
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.280]   in lifestyle design is organizing yourself.
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:08.040]   Tracking your time, being intentional about the deployment of time,
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:11.520]   getting that sophisticated awareness of your time
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.000]   is often critical for actually making decisions
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.560]   about what you want to change in your life.
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.280]   People really don't realize when you're chaotic,
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.880]   they don't really realize what actually is causing the trouble.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.000]   And they might flail in different directions or think I have to have a nanny
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.880]   in a full time, whatever, to ever get anything done.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:28.040]   And they don't realize, no, the problem is actually the commute.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.720]   The problem is actually you live in the wrong house.
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.440]   Why do you have two acres?
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:34.960]   And, you know, whatever it is, you don't live near your parents.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.960]   You're always having to drive over there.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.920]   We don't always know the problem until we actually get a good awareness
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.080]   of how our time is actually being spent. Mm hmm.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:46.560]   I mean, that's one of my insights is a book on the deep life
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.040]   actually has to talk a lot about time management,
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.720]   which for me was a bit of a breakthrough to think about.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.080]   All right, let's keep rolling. What do we have next, Jesse?
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:57.400]   All right. Next question is from Mike, a 67 year old retiree.
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.800]   One thing I regret has been my focus on my personal development
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.480]   without involving my spouse in retirement.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:06.080]   We have enough to live extremely well, but lack any ability
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.160]   to create a shared vision for our future.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:12.240]   Any thoughts on how to co-create a deep life with your partner?
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.600]   Mike, I think it's really important.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.720]   I'm glad you brought this up.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:19.080]   If you're married or in a committed relationship.
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:22.240]   You need to work the deep life stack with your partner.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:25.840]   It really makes.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:28.680]   Not only makes a difference, it's what enables, in my opinion,
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.240]   a sustainable deep life, because what is the alternative here,
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.160]   which is very common,
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:36.000]   especially in these sort of dual income,
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:40.560]   close in city suburb type places where Jesse and I live.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.880]   It's very common to see an approach that says
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.920]   we're essentially business partners with kids.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:52.600]   And we each need to work our own individual visions about a career,
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:55.200]   but also other things like physical health and
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.640]   because we shouldn't have to compromise.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.200]   So I have my own vision of what I want to have with my wife.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.000]   You have your own vision.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.680]   We have to get together to make sure that, you know,
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.760]   we're doing the kid thing right.
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:05.920]   That doesn't work.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:10.360]   And the reason why that doesn't work is that your individual visions
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:13.800]   for a deep life are going to clash with each other.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.520]   They're almost certainly going to be incompatible with each other.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.920]   And now you're an antagonistic relationship with your partner.
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.680]   Actually, you are getting in the way of mine.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.200]   And then you get into these weird sort of one for you, one for me type
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:26.440]   interleaving swap relationships.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.040]   Well, you can do this with your job for a year
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.320]   and then you have to pull back and I'll do this for my job for a year.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.600]   Or you got to spend three hours in the gym.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.600]   So I need to get three hours this week in the gym, too.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.560]   It's it's business partners that are trying to negotiate
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.760]   some sort of equitable access to resources.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:43.440]   And that clashing visions of a deep life do not add up.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.160]   Do not add up to a coherent whole.
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.960]   If you marry someone, for example.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:50.680]   You are.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:54.120]   In some sense, giving up the option of
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:57.160]   I'm just going to focus on me and make my life as good as possible.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:00.680]   What you're focused to is trying to build a dual life,
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.280]   a family life that's as good as possible.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.800]   So you have to work to stack together.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.400]   The discipline together, we all keep we've done our things,
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:10.120]   we keep track of our things here, the values together.
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:12.000]   What are our shared values?
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.960]   What's the code we live by and are going to manage our life by?
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.240]   What rituals and routines do we have to put in there?
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.440]   The calm together?
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.680]   How do we organize our lives as a couple?
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.360]   How do we make decisions together about what's working and not working?
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.240]   And then you go through the planning stages together.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.080]   It's not to say that there's not going to be
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.080]   individualized things that come out of it.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:32.760]   When you're looking at Constitution, I might end up doing something different
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.920]   with fitness than my wife, but we thought about this together.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.840]   And it feels scary in the moment, especially if you'll see
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.280]   you got married a little bit later in life.
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.960]   Like I don't want to give things up.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:43.080]   I don't want to sacrifice.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:48.480]   But if you're together with someone, I really do think a deep life
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.040]   that is designed together is so much more fulfilling
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:54.000]   than trying to do it yourself.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.720]   Trying to stay separate.
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:45:00.280]   It turns out just trying to optimize whatever career respect on my own
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:04.000]   and see my partner as an obstacle is not going to make you happier in the end.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.520]   They're trying to figure out a lifestyle that can keep into it
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.920]   values if I want to do high impact work, put my training into practice,
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:14.160]   but also keeps other values in play and everyone's on the same page.
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.760]   It's really going to be more satisfying in the end.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:20.120]   I'm a big believer in that, you know, especially if you're married,
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:22.760]   business partner with kids doesn't work.
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.200]   It doesn't work out very well.
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:29.200]   All right, Jesse, what do we got next?
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:34.080]   All right, next question is from Sadie, a 37 year old writer.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.680]   Do you think there is a genetic component to be able to consistently follow your methods?
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:41.440]   My partner organizes life similar to you.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:45.840]   His parents are successful academics who, like him, are very organized and productive.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:49.000]   My parents are the least organized people in existence.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.520]   I'm currently struggling to complete a book revision.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:57.360]   I get bored easily and my penchant for procrastination still borders on self-destructive.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:01.200]   Why does it feel like this is so much harder for me than it is for other people?
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:05.320]   When it comes to organized
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:10.640]   organization, deeper living, these type of life related disciplines,
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:14.560]   you know, I've come to believe it's most useful to think about this
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:18.080]   as a practiced ability.
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:22.440]   So what I mean about this, let's say, for example, you are used to
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:27.280]   the cognitive difficulty of certain types of organizational activities.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.840]   The subsuming of the appeal in the moment
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:34.520]   towards the longer term accomplishment of a system or a plan.
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:37.200]   And let's say you've done this throughout much of your life.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.920]   So you have a lot of reward.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:41.080]   I've seen this work. I know long term.
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:42.360]   This makes me feel better.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:46.040]   So I'm much, much easier, much more easily in the moment able to say,
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:48.840]   put that phone back down.
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:50.880]   I block this to work on this. I'm going to work on this.
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:54.840]   That is a practiced capability.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.520]   That's something you get better with as you train your mind
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:59.560]   to get used to a particular sensation.
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:03.120]   And as you add more reward stimuli so your brain gets used to.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.680]   No, there's something good coming from sticking to the schedule.
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:06.800]   I'm going to feel better at the end of the day.
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.520]   I've been doing this for a while.
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.840]   That's a practiced ability.
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:13.520]   So if you weren't raised with this.
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.040]   You're missing a lot of practice right out of the bat, right out of the gate,
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:16.960]   you're missing a lot of practice.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:19.080]   If you weren't raised with this, if you're raised with parents
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:24.120]   that were more haphazard and were more disorganized, you got no practice.
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:28.200]   And let's say you go on the college for, yeah, I'm going to I'll cram at night
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.040]   and kind of make it work.
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.720]   And that can often work. You're still getting no practice.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:34.120]   And then you find yourself out there in the in the real world.
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:35.200]   You're the entry level job.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.880]   You've moved up to a medium level job.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:41.720]   And now you look over to your partner who is from a completely different situation.
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:45.320]   You say, my God, I must not be an organized person because why are they so organized?
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:47.720]   But what if they had the exact opposite situation?
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:50.360]   Their parents were very organized from a young age.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:53.800]   They were exposed to structuring and organizing your time.
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.920]   Subsuming instinctual distraction, the moment towards the longer term
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:01.520]   goal of figuring the schedule, they were seen models of that be successful.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:03.360]   They were doing it from a young age.
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:06.080]   They've been building up a rich bank of experience
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.720]   where this leads to long term reward.
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.640]   When they're now 28, this comes very easily,
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.120]   much in the way that if you grew up with athletic parents
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:17.880]   and were on long walks and running involved in sports your whole life,
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:20.240]   running a 5K comes very easily.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.640]   Not because you were wired to be a runner,
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.520]   but because you spent your whole life working on that.
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:28.360]   So I think that's both good news and bad news, Sadie.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.800]   It's good news because it means,
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:33.280]   no, you're not wired to be disorganized and that's just your fate.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:38.680]   The bad news is if we're going to return to our analogy here with running,
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:42.040]   if you're out of shape, it takes a while to get a good 5K time.
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:45.480]   You're going to have to exercise and train.
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:46.800]   You might have to overhaul your fitness.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:48.960]   It could take a little while. It's not going to come overnight.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:52.600]   This is why you've probably had this experience of I read a Cal Newport book
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.000]   and it made sense.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.560]   And you saw your partner use those ideas.
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:00.400]   But then you tried them and it didn't work.
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:03.000]   And you're like, oh, this is frustrating.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.520]   I mean, again, that's similar to I've never run a day in my life
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:08.520]   and I watched Chariots of Fire.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.880]   I said, man, I want to do that.
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.280]   Let's go run a mile. Let's go run a four minute mile.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.120]   It's not going to go well the next day.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:15.600]   Right. You probably got a year or two of training
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:18.240]   before you're happy about what you're doing with your mile time.
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:19.360]   So that's sort of the bad news.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:23.680]   But my my recommendation, I guess, would be let's start training.
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:27.360]   And let's do so in a way where you're easy on yourself.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:31.240]   Organizational activities will not feel natural if you haven't trained.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:34.200]   It will and you won't do very well at first,
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:37.400]   and you have to start simple and build up from there.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:40.920]   A couple simple disciplines like we talked about the deep life stack,
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:43.800]   a couple basic disciplines that you get used to,
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:47.280]   and then you make a slightly more complicated addition to your system
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:52.000]   than another more slightly complicated addition to your system.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.240]   So let me get specific here.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:56.440]   Back in the day where I did a lot more writing,
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:59.920]   especially at Cal Newport dot com about specifically organization,
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:03.280]   I was often somewhat dismissive
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:08.520]   of an organizational strategy called MIT Most Important Task.
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:11.400]   And this was a very simple organizational strategy
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:14.200]   where the first thing you did every day was write down the one.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:17.000]   And in some variations, the three most important things
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.040]   you wanted to get done that day.
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:20.120]   And you would do them first.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:24.560]   I did that thing first, and I was derisive about this
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:28.000]   because I was a time management snob.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.760]   Right. I am the time management.
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.960]   What you know, Mozart was the piano.
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:34.080]   He was raised from a young age practicing all the time.
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:35.320]   I was raised from a young age.
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:38.040]   I was reading time management books when I was young.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:41.400]   I knew this genre inside and out.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:44.480]   I was still a college student, sold my first book talking about these ideas.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.040]   I mean, I'm a time management nerd.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.120]   So to me, I look at that like this is so simple.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:49.520]   Like, what do you mean most important?
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:51.040]   You do one thing. No, no, no, no.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.680]   Look, you got to you got a time block.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:54.040]   You got to have good capture.
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:56.560]   But what I didn't realize at the time.
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:59.720]   Is it was as if, you know, I had been a track runner
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:03.120]   all throughout high school and I get to college and I'm scoffing at people
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:06.080]   that say, OK, you want to get in shape, let's start by going on a good,
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:07.280]   long walk every day.
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.320]   What do you mean a good, long walk?
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:11.520]   No, no, you got you got to be doing 800 meter intervals.
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:15.800]   Right. So you can get your your leg, whatever the fast twitch muscles going.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.240]   And then you have to marry that with the seven K days.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:21.000]   And but that's because I've been training for a long time.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.920]   And this is what the most important task.
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:25.800]   Method, this was the gap it filled.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:27.320]   You're just getting started.
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:28.760]   So here's one thing you can do.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:31.920]   I write down the most important thing every day in the morning and I do it.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.360]   Then I open my inbox.
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:37.360]   This is not the system five years from now, you'll still be using,
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.600]   but for the first week, what's this going to do?
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:42.480]   I have a little bit of structure.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.480]   I do it. I get a little bit of reward.
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:49.000]   Now you're starting to build some circuitry that says, OK,
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.080]   do this little bit of structuring.
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:52.000]   It's not, you know, it's more easy to look at my email.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.200]   I did this hour every morning.
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:56.160]   It feels good. I'm actually making more progress on things.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:59.600]   I feel a sense of the cognitive burden of doing this type of things
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.040]   a little bit less.
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:03.640]   I have reward and a sense of self-efficacy.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:07.640]   You know, OK, if I do this, these type of things, I get more done.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:11.800]   Then you can start layering up the system to be a little bit more complicated.
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:13.520]   Say, OK, you know, I'm feeling really disorganized.
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.240]   The next thing I'm going to do is just a full capture.
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:16.760]   System, why don't I just start
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:19.240]   putting everything in the Trello columns and Trello boards
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:20.640]   and just have them in there?
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.600]   And all I want to commit to is at the end of every day,
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.920]   making sure nothing's in my head.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:27.400]   I don't even have to do anything with these things yet.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:31.240]   Let's just get them into a Google Doc or a Trello board or workflow
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.040]   or whatever you're using.
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.960]   That's your second step.
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:37.800]   So now in this thought experiment, you've been doing most important things,
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:40.200]   the most important thing every morning first for a few months,
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:42.680]   and now you're just getting everything written down.
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.680]   You're not even doing anything with the things you're written down.
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:47.240]   You're still being haphazard about it, but nothing's being kept in your head.
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.280]   You have that discipline going.
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:50.200]   You do that. And now we're six months in.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:54.320]   Again, you've built a stronger circuit, you have more reward,
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:57.680]   you're feeling better, you're feeling more self-efficacy going on now.
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:00.920]   Now you might start some rudimentary time blocking.
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:03.680]   Time block my day, but very loosely.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.720]   And I know that my estimates are going to be bad.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:07.680]   And so I'm not going to hold myself too much to it.
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:11.080]   But let me get used to seeing where the free time is
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:14.080]   and maybe assigning some work to some of that free time.
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:16.280]   And maybe now I'm going to start taking things from these task lists
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:20.160]   and assigning them to some tax blocks within my time block schedule.
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.880]   And, you know, you work with this and you get better with it.
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:23.920]   Now you have that in your life.
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:28.320]   Now, once you have that in your life, you can start adding in some weekly planning.
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.400]   I'm going to start thinking about my week now.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.080]   And now let me add some strategic planning.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.320]   And a year in.
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:38.560]   You're like, oh, the seven minute mile my partner ran, it's not so impressive anymore.
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:40.680]   I can do this sort of thing now.
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.440]   Now, that exact sequence, who cares?
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.440]   That doesn't have to be the exact sequence of things you do,
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:48.120]   but that's the right progression of magnitudes,
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.920]   the complexities of trying to add some organization into your life.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:55.120]   So, Sadie, you're not wired to be organized or not, but you might.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:59.160]   You can't you can't assume by default you're an organizational shape.
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:01.640]   It does take some work.
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:04.160]   Now, are there genetics in here somewhere? I don't know.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:07.800]   I mean, I think epigenetics is probably more interesting than genetics.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:11.440]   And the idea is there's like a particular gene that just directly expresses itself
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:13.360]   and pinch it towards organization.
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:15.040]   That's probably too simple.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:20.480]   It probably has some sort of genetic component combined with your early exposures
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:23.640]   could have some impact in how your brain develops, maybe.
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:27.000]   But for most of these complex psychological traits
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.240]   that aren't talking about just fundamental skills,
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:32.960]   that type of early development, epigenetic development
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:37.560]   tends to express itself more in extremes that like that could become malformed
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:40.160]   and you could be sort of obsessively hyper organized
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:43.880]   or it could be malformed in a maybe like an attention to disorder way
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:47.880]   that requires a more careful structuring of how you deal with
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.720]   how you deal with obligation.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.200]   So you could have these some again, that the genetics,
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:55.880]   the epigenetics tend to show up in extreme cases.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:57.720]   And most people are not extreme cases.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:59.280]   And when you're in the middle,
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:01.400]   you're not trying to be the most organized person in the world
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:05.600]   or not fighting a sort of a really notable deficit in certain types of skills.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:07.400]   Then it doesn't really matter.
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:08.440]   What matters is training.
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:09.520]   What matters is practice.
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:10.840]   And that's where most people actually fall.
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:16.120]   Training to be organized, I used to I really was dismissive of MIT
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:18.960]   because I not like school, but most important task, I was like,
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:21.520]   this is so simplistic. Yeah, as a snob.
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:26.840]   It's got to be the nerdiest type of snob is a time management snob.
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:29.280]   Well, when you're right, when you're in book writing mode,
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:32.120]   that's pretty much what you fall, right? Yeah.
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:36.800]   But, you know, also full capture, multi scale planning, you know,
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:40.200]   that day was informed by that time block plan,
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.880]   informed by a weekly plan for my strategic plan,
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.280]   and I have full capture and shut down routines built around it.
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:48.960]   So most important thing always seems so simple to me.
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:51.680]   I had rudimentary time block planning in my second book
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:54.200]   in how to become a straight A student.
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.560]   I was recommending that college students do.
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:58.600]   That was the original me talking about it.
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.840]   You need to do something like time block planning.
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:02.880]   Don't just say what's due and what do I want to do next?
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:07.120]   So how much more writing do you do outside of book writing?
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:10.480]   Like when you're just writing articles and stuff,
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:12.480]   articles take a lot of time.
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:15.080]   Yeah. So if I'm not working on a book like a New Yorker piece,
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:17.760]   it's a lot of it's a lot of work.
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.160]   I write academic papers, a lot of work.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.560]   I don't know. I spend a lot of time writing.
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:23.920]   So it's pretty much always has a place in your calendar.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:27.240]   Yeah. I mean, there's there's periods where I'm taking a break.
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:30.440]   But yeah, these days, if I'm not book writing,
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.720]   I'm New Yorker writing or academic writing.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.200]   So like last last year on this time when you were writing your book.
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:39.520]   Yeah. And every day you're writing or I guess six days a week. Yeah.
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:43.040]   This year is like the same
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:45.880]   allocation of time on your calendar.
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:49.200]   Yeah. Yeah, I've been writing most days.
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:51.680]   Yeah, I've been writing most days.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:53.720]   I'll be interesting to see what my summer plan is going to be like
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:55.280]   since I'm teaching this summer.
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:57.120]   You're probably more inspired up there.
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:59.200]   I might be. I think New Hampshire is going to be.
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:01.080]   You'd be in the woods.
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:02.000]   Be surrounded by mountains.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.520]   So Dartmouth, you can see mountains all around, which is kind of cool.
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:07.760]   So which I appreciate up there.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:09.000]   I think it'll be good.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   I think there's some good spaces because we're living on campus.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   There's some good spaces on campus.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.720]   I'm thinking a particular the tower room in Baker Library.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:17.760]   I'll send you a picture, Jesse.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.640]   But it's like what you would imagine.
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:21.320]   You should send it out to the audience.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:24.480]   It's what you would imagine a collegiate studying environment should be.
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:28.680]   It's this wood paneled old library room where you sit in this
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:31.080]   multi-hundred year old building and look out these old
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:35.120]   windows over the green and armchairs.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.880]   They're like musty.
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:40.680]   They have these armchairs with these wooden boards, basically.
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:44.000]   So you put the board across the arms and then it's a desk.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   That's cool.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.480]   Yeah. So I want to write there.
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.880]   That's my plan.
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:49.160]   Though maybe.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:50.520]   Are you going to eat in the cafeteria?
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:51.520]   I want to.
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.040]   Do you get a meal pass?
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:55.040]   I'll get, I'll, I want my kids to have one.
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:55.720]   Oh, that'd be awesome.
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:56.040]   Right.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:58.120]   They could just bike down to the cafeteria and like.
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:58.840]   They're going to love it.
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:00.840]   I think so. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:02.120]   Yeah. That's going to be fun. I'm looking forward to that.
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:03.800]   Well, and by the way, if you're wondering what I'm talking about,
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:06.920]   we'll get more into this next week because, yeah, the show is going to relocate
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:09.080]   to New Hampshire for a couple of months this summer.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:11.120]   It won't affect your experience as the listener.
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:13.080]   I can record from anywhere.
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:15.800]   Jesse, we'll we might not be in the same room, but we'll still make it work.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:18.480]   But you'll you'll be hearing a lot about sort of,
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:21.400]   I guess we'll call it Deep Work HQ North.
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:24.120]   It's what we'll call it where I'm working this where I'm working this summer.
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:27.920]   And if you by the way, if you're at Dartmouth College,
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:30.400]   this summer, if you're a sophomore, sign up for my class about writing
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:32.960]   for technology, we do have space.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.920]   All right. Let's go. Let's do one more question.
[00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:36.200]   I sounds great.
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:40.080]   Question from Matt, a 35 year old professor.
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:43.320]   Your discussion of the deep life reminds me of a book I came across
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:46.720]   about designing your life by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans.
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:50.200]   I wonder if you might comment a bit on this book and its approaches.
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:52.960]   How compliments your emerging deep life approach.
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:56.440]   Well, that book, which I do believe is called Designing Your Life.
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:57.680]   I think that's right.
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:01.640]   By Bill Burnett and Dave Evans, that came out similar.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:04.600]   The same year as Deep Work was very successful.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:09.720]   So it and Deep Work have both been very successful books from that year.
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:12.880]   Burnett's the executive director of the Stanford Design School.
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:15.160]   And Evans, I think, is a professor there.
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:18.840]   So they wrote this book based off of a course they taught at the design school
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:24.000]   about using design principles of the type they would teach at the design school,
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.720]   but applying them to your life.
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:29.000]   How to more systematically design your life.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.480]   And, you know, this look, the timing for this book was good.
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:35.360]   A few years earlier, I had published So Good They Can't Ignore You, where I was.
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:39.280]   Laying some of the first cracks in the foundation of the dominant
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:42.720]   career philosophy of the first part of the 2000s,
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:44.360]   which was the passion philosophy.
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:49.080]   So so most of our career vision was built around through self-reflection,
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:51.760]   discovering your true passion and then having the courage
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:53.400]   to match your job to that passion.
[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:56.360]   So it was all about building the courage to match your job to a passion
[00:59:56.360 --> 01:00:00.400]   was the dominant career advice that was failing as the millennials
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:03.160]   who were raised with this were first leaving college
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:07.880]   and the financial crisis hit and we realized it's more complicated
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.440]   than just I'm meant to be a sports marketer.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:15.280]   I can tell from self-reflection if I do that, I'm going to be happy there on out.
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:15.760]   So this was.
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:20.000]   Part of this revolution and thinking about careers more systematically.
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:25.800]   So they design problem to solve, not a sole alignment type problem.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:31.000]   So that idea, of course, aligns well with the way I often talk about careers.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   And I'm sure that book has been influential to me, even in implicit ways.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.360]   So it shares a similar notion of intentionality and design
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:43.280]   in terms of differences.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:47.680]   Well, first of all, I would say that book is more traditional
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:52.280]   in that it's starting with decisions, not the person.
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:56.560]   Right. So the deep life stack is you're overhauling yourself
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.120]   before you overhaul your life.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:01.040]   And this book, I think, Design Your Life gets more towards let's just start.
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.080]   How do we systematically make decisions?
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:07.200]   Which to me, I think, comes a little bit later in the process.
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:12.320]   I also think it's more career focused, probably in the deep life philosophy.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:15.200]   Career is a big part of it.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:20.920]   It's one of the tools you have to reach your ideal vision of a life.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.640]   But there's other tools that matter just as much.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.960]   And so I would say the deep life philosophy is much broader
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:31.320]   where this philosophy, a lot of this really is about figuring out the right job,
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.600]   experimenting with different jobs, gathering data.
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.760]   So it's it's, I guess, a little bit more bloodless in that sense.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:39.080]   There's more of a sense of, you know.
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:43.280]   In the deep life philosophy, there's more of a, I don't know,
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:46.240]   philosophical core of trying to build a life of meaning,
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.560]   satisfaction of value and discipline and connection,
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:51.120]   where a career is just one of the knobs that's in there that you turn.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.880]   Now, for a lot of people, it's a major knob.
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.240]   And it's one of the determining most important determining factors
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.200]   of the quality of your life.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:01.360]   So it's, you know, not wrong to underscore that like they do.
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.600]   But if I'm if I'm going to point out differences, I would say that.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.480]   All that being said, I would say, read the book.
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.120]   If you like my conversation in the deep life, if you like Soga,
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.200]   they can't ignore you if you like deep work.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.960]   I think design in your life is a good.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:17.440]   Augment to that type of thinking, you will probably like that as well
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.320]   if you like the type of things that we do here.
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:25.120]   All right, speaking about what we do here, I want to get soon.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:29.120]   To our final segment, something interesting, where I talk about something
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:32.760]   interesting that you have sent me to my interesting account, Newport.com address.
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:36.280]   First, however, I want to mention another one of our sponsors.
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:40.880]   That is our friends at 80,000 hours.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.920]   This is a nonprofit that aims to help people find careers.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:47.680]   That helps solve the world's most pressing problems, right?
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:50.320]   So we just talked about Bill Burnett and Dave Evans's book.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:53.240]   80,000 hours actually is a great compliment to that
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:57.280]   because they help people get past just saying, what is my passion?
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.920]   And instead have them ask the question, what is something useful?
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:05.160]   I can do with the time I spend working.
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:08.760]   Most career advice is pretty cookie cutter.
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:13.120]   It doesn't take into account up to date evidence, a more quantitative
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:16.640]   or systematic way of thinking about what exact impact is the job
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.960]   choices you have going to make.
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:21.360]   That is where 80,000 hours enters the pictures.
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:24.360]   It'll help you find a career that's fulfilling,
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.400]   but also helps you make a big difference.
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:27.960]   So where does that name come from?
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.280]   Well, 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, 40 years.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:32.680]   Multiply those together, you get 80,000 hours.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:35.760]   That's the amount of time you have to try to make a difference in the world.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.320]   The team at 80,000 hours have done over 10 years of research
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:43.360]   alongside academics at Oxford University, all focused on the question
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.560]   of how do you build a career that is both fulfilling
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.400]   and does the maximum amount of good?
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:52.760]   Turns out what they've discovered might not be exactly what you think.
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:56.680]   So if you care about what the evidence actually says about having a fulfilling
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:00.200]   and impactful career, if you want real advice that goes beyond aphorisms
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:04.640]   and empty cliches like follow your passion, then 80,000 hours can help.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.200]   Oh, and because they're a nonprofit.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.640]   Everything you provide is free forever.
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:13.000]   Their only aim is to help solve global problems
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.160]   by helping people find impactful careers.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:23.160]   So I'm going to recommend that you go to 80,000 hours dot org slash deep.
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:24.920]   That's 80,000.
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:30.240]   The numbers, the digits followed by the word hours dot org slash deep
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.880]   to find out more.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.200]   They have their articles there.
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.400]   They have their newsletter there.
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:35.480]   They have their job board there.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:39.720]   They have their podcast, their imminent thinkers thinking about the same problems.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:42.160]   I've known these guys for a long time.
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.960]   When I was writing So Good, They Can't Ignore You.
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.680]   We had a lot of conversations because we really were on the same page.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:50.280]   So if you want to figure out how to be useful with your work and not just.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:55.560]   Wander or seek ambition or follow cliches, check out 80,000 hours
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:58.000]   dot org slash deep.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.080]   I also want to talk about our good friends at Zok Doc.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.800]   Zok Doc is the only free application
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:10.800]   that lets you find and book doctors who are patient reviewed.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:13.280]   Take your insurance and are available when you need them
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:16.120]   to treat almost every condition under the sun.
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:21.520]   I have multiple doctors who have either discovered through Zok Doc
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:25.760]   or they use the Zok Doc software to keep track of my patient records
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:28.480]   in a way that allows me to check in in advance and get reminders.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.120]   I am a big Zok Doc fan.
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:33.280]   It's one of these apps that just makes sense.
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:36.000]   Let's just say you need a particular type of doctor.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:36.840]   You need a dentist.
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:39.480]   You need to do primary care physician because your other one left.
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:41.080]   You never had one in the first place.
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.200]   How do you go about finding them?
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.320]   This is actually a big question, especially for newly minted adults.
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:49.560]   Most people just ask people or Google it.
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:53.800]   And you're sort of just rolling the dice here or you're setting yourself up
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.600]   for the frustration of calling five doctors in a row to find out
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:59.440]   they don't have any openings for new patients.
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:02.320]   Zok Doc solves all this problem.
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:04.640]   You say I need a doctor in this area that takes this insurance
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.600]   is taking new patients go.
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.280]   Oh, here's three.
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.480]   Well, what do people think about them?
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.160]   Here's the reviews.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.600]   Great. Here's the one I want. Click it.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:13.560]   Oh, I can book it right here.
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:18.120]   Zok Doc dot com to get the app that you need
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:20.920]   to help organize the medical care in your life.
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:25.400]   So go to Zok Doc dot com slash deep and download the Zok Doc app for free.
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:30.240]   Then find a book, a top rated doctor today, many within only 24 hours.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:34.120]   That's a ZOC, DOC dot com slash deep.
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:37.120]   The Zok Doc dot com slash deep.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:40.560]   All right, Jesse, let's do something interesting.
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:44.920]   This is the segment where I go into my interesting at Cal Newport dot com
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:46.040]   email address.
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:48.920]   I look for interesting things that you have sent in and I pick one
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:51.720]   to talk about on the show.
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.200]   I'm going to load up.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.240]   Oops, Gmail, you know, load up a website now to bring up on the screen.
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.800]   Let's see here. OK, so here's the thing I want to talk about today.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.840]   I wanted to return.
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:07.040]   To something we mentioned, we previewed in an early something interesting segment,
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.000]   so there's an earlier segment where I talked about
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.360]   Apple was going to release this new augmented reality
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:17.920]   virtual reality set called the Vision Pro, and I had some thoughts
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:19.680]   about why that's more important than you might think.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.280]   Well, they've done it now.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.320]   They have the official announcement.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:24.480]   The product is available.
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:26.360]   We have our first looks at it.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:29.560]   A bunch of you sent this to me, so I want to just revisit this question
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.680]   because I have a big claim here I want to make.
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:36.160]   What Apple is doing here.
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:39.440]   Is just as important as a lot of the big investments
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.760]   companies are making right now in A.I.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:44.320]   Apple is lagging in that battle.
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:47.360]   And I don't think that's actually a bad decision.
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.720]   Their emphasis on A.R. over A.I.
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:53.200]   is not necessarily a mistake, and so let's just look at this together
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.040]   and I'll try to justify why I think that's the case.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.320]   Again, if you're listening, you can watch it.
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:01.800]   YouTube dot com slash Cal Newport Media Episode two fifty two.
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:05.080]   All right, Jesse, I have on the screen here a picture of the Vision Pro.
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:08.200]   We see someone wearing these.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.760]   We say like ski goggles.
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.040]   Yeah, like, yeah, more or less.
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:13.040]   OK, so this is the Vision Pro.
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.440]   There's a cable out the back that goes down to a battery pack
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:18.760]   that you have to keep in your pocket.
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:22.560]   Right off the bat, let me say this.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.800]   What you're seeing here is not going to become ubiquitous.
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.280]   You're not going to see a lot of people wearing the Vision Pro.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:32.040]   Critically, what you see in this picture is eyes, right?
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:34.080]   So you're imagining these are like goggles.
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:35.360]   They're opaque.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:39.680]   What you are seeing there is actually a screen on the front of opaque goggles
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:43.000]   that is showing you an image of the person's eyes.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.880]   So these are actually virtual reality goggles.
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:48.440]   They actually have no pass through.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:51.280]   And yet if we look at this demo and I have it up here on the screen,
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:54.400]   we see a gentleman putting on the goggles.
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:56.600]   He's looking at his room.
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:01.720]   Right. And then we see elements like a menu pop up right in front of him.
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.920]   So what's actually happening here is called pass through augmented reality.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:09.160]   There's a high definition camera pointing out from the front of these goggles.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:12.000]   So what he is seeing when he looks through here
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.920]   is actually a video of what's in front of his eyes.
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.760]   So you're seeing a video of the world around you.
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:21.840]   Why is this? Why would they do this?
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:26.000]   Because it allows them from a technical standpoint
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.560]   to do much cooler things in terms of adding digital elements to their world.
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.720]   So if we look at the video I have up on the screen now,
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:38.440]   you see someone scrolling a website and they have it as a giant screen
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:40.520]   just floating in front of them in the space.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:45.160]   When you're adding that into a video of the world around you,
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:48.440]   just from a computer science perspective, it is much, much easier.
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:53.560]   The standard AR technology has you looking through glass
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.640]   and actually seeing the world in front of you.
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:00.840]   And inside this glass and standard AR, there's something called a wave guide.
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:04.160]   It's essentially a transparent piece of plastic that you're looking through.
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:09.960]   And these wave guides allow them to in classic AR to actually put an image,
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.920]   make an image appear in this wave guide.
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:15.400]   So you're seeing that image in the real world that you're actually seeing.
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:18.800]   So it's mixing the photons from the screen in with the real photons
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:20.000]   from the world around you.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.800]   This is how Magic Leap works, for example.
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.560]   It's how the Microsoft HoloLens works, for example.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:28.320]   That's ultimately the way AR needs to work.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:32.120]   But it's very hard because those wave guides are hard to make work.
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.800]   And one of the big issues you have is that they're small.
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.200]   As you have a limited field of vision.
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:39.120]   So if you're looking through a Magic Leap,
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.600]   you might be able to see your whole world.
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:43.160]   But there's actually only a smaller box inside of the world
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.680]   where they can add digital elements.
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:47.840]   And so as you turn your head, for example, the screen clips off.
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.000]   The screen can't be that big.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.560]   If I'm instead just taking a video of the world around me,
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.640]   I can fill the entire video with something.
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.640]   Right. So technologically, that makes it much easier.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:01.600]   So what Apple is doing here is saying, why don't we master the experience
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:07.200]   and then we'll figure out later how to make technology more mass usable.
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:11.640]   And so they're they're perfecting this fantastic experience
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:13.760]   where I don't need screens.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:16.480]   I don't need a laptop. I don't need a TV. I don't need a phone.
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:18.880]   I can just make a screen wherever I am and use it.
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:21.080]   They're perfecting that experience now with this.
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:24.520]   More adaptable, but clunkier technology.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:27.520]   Then once they have the experience mastered,
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:30.320]   hopefully the technology will catch up to get them where they need to get
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.720]   the end game here that is going to make this ubiquitous
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:36.760]   is this pair of ski goggles you see in this video on the screen right now
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:41.000]   gets replaced with a pair of glasses, standard looking glasses
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.080]   with a really good wave guy technology.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.520]   And you're getting the same experience.
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:47.480]   But these elements are being added to the real world.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:50.200]   They're not in a virtual reality screen.
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:53.160]   And that's going to be the tipping point, I believe, in which we're going to see
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:56.800]   the dramatic reduction in the need to manufacture individual consumer
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:00.080]   facing screens because I have a nice pair of glasses on
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:02.320]   and I can make a screen anywhere I want.
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:04.640]   Why would I mount the screen on my wall
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:07.040]   when I could make a screen appear on any wall that I want?
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:10.320]   So this is what Apple is doing, and I think it's smart
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:13.840]   because essentially what Magic Leap discovered after wasting,
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:17.680]   not wasting, but spending tens of billions of dollars
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:20.760]   is that the wave guide is hard.
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:23.480]   And so they couldn't deliver the experience they wanted
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:24.840]   because the technology was harder.
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.000]   So Apple's coming the other way.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.360]   Let's get the experience right, and then we'll figure out how to make
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.960]   the delivery of that experience more and more palatable.
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:33.600]   I think that's the right way to do it.
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:38.160]   I think Apple is smart to invest in that as opposed to going all in on A.I.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.520]   And I think they're smart for two reasons.
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:43.880]   One, it's going to be a massive economic space.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:48.040]   If your one device can deliver basically every screen someone owns,
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:51.520]   that is going to be a massively ubiquitous device,
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:53.560]   probably one with a very high profit margin.
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:56.520]   And two, investing very heavily in A.I.
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:59.040]   right now is risky, right?
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.640]   Because Open A.I.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:04.160]   with the support of Microsoft, Google, on the other hand,
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:07.840]   they're spending huge money to try to build these new models.
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.480]   It's a very expensive game.
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.680]   They're scrambling to try to figure out how to make enough revenue
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.840]   just to even pay for these server costs.
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:17.120]   Meanwhile, you have these second tier large language models that are free.
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.120]   They're academic models.
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:23.720]   It's the Lama model that Meta released for free back in February.
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:26.680]   They're not as big as GPT-4.
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:30.240]   We might be talking about 20 billion parameters instead of a trillion
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.240]   parameters, but they're free and they do really well.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.560]   And they're only going to get better.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:38.040]   So it's going to be this incredibly competitive space for A.I.
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:40.600]   because software doesn't cost money once you have it.
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:42.880]   These things are expensive to train, but not expensive to run.
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:46.400]   It'd be very hard to dominate that space.
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:50.640]   Having an A.R. device that's beautifully designed and perfected
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:54.480]   over 10 years of R&D, where you've worked with the experience
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:56.920]   starting with the Vision Pro, and now you have these nice Ray-Bans
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:58.120]   where I have all my screens on it.
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.560]   That's a market you can dominate.
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:02.360]   That's a market where you can do
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:05.640]   $500 billion of sale every year and put Samsung out of business.
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:08.600]   So I think Apple is smart to say, let's not put all of our resources
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:12.080]   in doing a GPT clone, because large language model
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.440]   A.I. support is going to be cheap and ubiquitous and cut rate competitive.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.720]   And everyone's going to be cutting and slicing each other's throats.
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:20.600]   This is the other big thing that's coming is the end of screen.
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:23.920]   So anyways, now that I've seen the announcement, Jesse, I think Apple,
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:26.240]   I think what they're doing is smart.
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:28.240]   I would say ignore the snark right now.
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.520]   There's less snark out there like I don't want to wear these things.
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:32.560]   Well, you're not supposed to wear these things.
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:35.920]   Apple's seen where the puck is going and decided we have to start
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:38.840]   experience engineering now, even before the technology catches up.
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:41.440]   So I'm still bullish on what they're doing.
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:44.800]   I'm still bullish on us getting to a future with minimum screens.
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:47.800]   I'm not saying moralistically whether that's good or bad.
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:49.840]   I'm just saying this is where I think we're going. Mm hmm.
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:53.680]   What if we get a free pair of those from them?
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.840]   Probably not. Just call Tim.
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.720]   Hey, Tim, it's Cal.
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:59.400]   It's C, C-Dog.
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.760]   Hey, Timmy C. I call him TC.
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:04.040]   I don't know. This is kind of a colloquial thing,
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:06.400]   but I haven't actually ever spoken to him.
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:09.800]   But I think if I did, it would be understood that I could just be like,
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:11.880]   hey, TC, C-Dog,
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:15.440]   hey, why don't you sling me a pair of those vis pros?
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:17.840]   All right, man, you keep that.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:18.920]   You keep that real.
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:21.320]   He probably makes like 75 million a year, don't you think?
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:23.320]   Yeah. So you can afford to send me one.
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:25.960]   I think they're four thousand dollars. Oh, really?
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:28.440]   Yeah, because they're for developers right now.
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.640]   OK. Yeah, they're just trying to master the experience.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:34.520]   They're not meant for everyone to use them.
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:36.760]   I would like to try it, though.
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.720]   A lot of people say he's like one of the best CEOs.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.640]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:43.080]   I heard he's really good with like supply chain stuff, which is
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.680]   critical for what they do.
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.520]   I mean, just keeping the lights on is hard.
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:49.360]   A company that produces things that are so precise.
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:51.200]   You must like the work.
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:52.480]   Yeah, those guys like for a long time.
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:54.280]   Those guys like to work.
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:55.280]   It's also power.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:57.800]   You know, it's nice to be in charge of everything.
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.000]   Yeah. And I don't begrudge them.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.720]   All right. So look, if you work for Apple.
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:06.200]   Write us a note and let us know how we can get a free pair of the Vision Pro.
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:07.840]   I will wear them on this show.
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.800]   Then you'll give them a time block planner.
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:11.720]   I like an edition. This is the trade.
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:14.040]   A second edition time block planner.
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:18.480]   USRP, $30 for a pair of Vision Pro goggles.
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:21.040]   But I will wear those goggles on the show.
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:23.840]   OK, and this is this is expensive advertising, right?
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:28.480]   I mean, honestly, the cost of an ad slot on the show is probably not that different
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:31.080]   than the cost of a pair of goggles.
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:33.360]   So I think this is really good organic advertising.
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:36.040]   So Apple ball is in your court.
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:40.360]   I think the people want to see Cal Newport wearing Vision Pro goggles,
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:44.640]   just repeatedly knocking into the microphone and talking
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:47.160]   to the wrong camera angle for an episode.
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:50.800]   You can make that happen if you send me a pair of goggles.
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.280]   All right, just which probably wrap this up.
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:53.440]   Thank you, everyone, for listening.
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:55.480]   We'll be back next week for another episode.
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.760]   Actually, it'll probably be our last episode.
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:02.480]   Standard studio episode before we go to the Deep Work HQ North,
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.440]   and we're going to have a different backdrop for a couple of months.
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:08.360]   So there's our last before the summer change is our last episode
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:10.120]   in the studio before we return again in September.
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:12.320]   So definitely tune in for that.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:14.920]   And until next time, as always, stay deep.
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:19.880]   [MUSIC]
