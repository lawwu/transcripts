[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.840]   (fireworks exploding)
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.320]   - Today is July 4th,
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.960]   Independence Day here in the United States,
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.640]   and it sounds a lot like that outside right now.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.760]   And Matt, a podcast listener, writes in to ask this,
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.760]   "Pastor John, obviously as Christians,
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.820]   "we are to live as strangers, exiles, aliens,
[00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.860]   "and pilgrims on this earth.
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.620]   "Is there an appropriate place in the Christian life
[00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.320]   "for patriotism?"
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.840]   - Yes, there is.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.600]   And it's right, we are pilgrims.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.960]   We're called exiles, we're refugees,
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.320]   we're sojourners, 1 Peter 2.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.560]   Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles,
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.140]   abstain from the passions that wage war
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.080]   against your flesh, or Philippians 3,
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.960]   our citizenship is in heaven,
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.460]   so the question is framed rightly.
[00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.920]   We are citizens of heaven.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.920]   We are sojourners and pilgrims on the earth.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.580]   And that's owing to the fact that this world is fallen,
[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.440]   not the fact that it's created.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.160]   We're gonna spend eternity in a created world,
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.720]   but Satan won't be the god of that world anymore.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.900]   That's what makes us feel so alien here,
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.480]   is that the god of this world is Satan.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.800]   He holds such extensive sway,
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.400]   the world is permeated with sin.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.280]   It makes us feel like we're not at home,
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.440]   we're just aching that we be done with sin
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.560]   and be in the presence of holiness.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.040]   So when I say we're aliens and exiles
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.480]   and sojourners and pilgrims,
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.800]   I don't mean that the earth is a place we despise,
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.680]   I mean that the structures we find ourselves in
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.440]   are so permeated with sin, we want something new.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.440]   However, God means for us to be enmeshed in this world.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.960]   We are not of the world, but we are in the world
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.520]   and we're supposed to be in it.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.560]   We're in a city and we're in a state
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.520]   and we're in a country and we're in a continent.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.520]   And if I ask, now what is patriotism in this enmeshment?
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.320]   My answer is that patriotism is a special love
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.160]   for fatherland, could be a city,
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.580]   might love your city in a special way,
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.040]   a state, a country, a tribe, an ethnicity.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.960]   And that love is different from the general love
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.280]   that Christians have for everybody or for the whole earth.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.760]   And the reason I think that's true,
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.280]   that there is and it's good that there is
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.840]   special affections for our homeland
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.160]   is that the Bible seems to point in that direction
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.440]   in several ways.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.060]   Here's an example.
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.420]   Paul in Galatians 6 said, "As you have opportunity,
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.120]   "do good to everyone, especially to those
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.220]   "who are of the household of faith."
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.580]   It's as though there's this specialness
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.460]   about those that are close to you
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.560]   and there's a kind of affection for them that is different.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.980]   Or 1 Timothy 5, verse eight,
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.380]   "If anyone does not provide for his relatives
[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.180]   "and especially for the members of his household,
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.420]   "he's denied the faith."
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.460]   So it seems like it's right not just to have this
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.900]   general love spread over the whole world
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.300]   and everybody has exactly the same affections from us,
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.180]   but rather there's an especially.
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.140]   And we know that Paul in Romans 9 said that
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.300]   if he could, he'd be accursed and cut off from Christ
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.100]   for the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen,
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.160]   according to the flesh.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.340]   So there's something about this fleshness,
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.260]   this being bound together in a family way
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.220]   or a cultural way with a group that makes us love them
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.380]   with an unusual kind of affection.
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.360]   And as I was thinking about it,
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.580]   Lewis, C.S. Lewis gave me some help
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.540]   because Lewis wrote this book, "The Four Loves,"
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.540]   and philos, friendship, and eros, sex,
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.640]   and agape, the love of God.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.720]   And the one that I think is relevant here is storge.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.680]   Storge is affection.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.440]   It's what you feel for a pair of slippers
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.160]   that your wife thinks you should have thrown away
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.120]   a long time ago, but they fit just right.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.920]   Or an old raggedy doll that a kid wants to keep
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.340]   even though it's just no good for anything except that kid.
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.320]   Or a sweater with holes in it that you've worn to read
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.400]   and study in for years.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.680]   Or an old tree where you carved your initials
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.280]   as a young couple and you just love to go back to that tree.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.780]   You love to watch that tree.
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.400]   That tree means more than other trees.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.440]   Or the lagoon where Noelle and I were engaged
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.160]   has a special place.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.160]   So there's a kind of affection for a tree and for a city
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.980]   and for a fatherland, a language, a culture.
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:20.820]   Why?
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.180]   Because it fits you.
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.100]   When you leave it, get on a plane, go to another country,
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.380]   there can be excitement and challenge and stimulation.
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.300]   You may even find those other cultures superior
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.720]   in some ways to your own.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.720]   But when you come home, it fits like the slippers fit.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.220]   It's just full of good associations like that tree
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.220]   where you carved your initials.
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.180]   So it seems to me that this is good
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.400]   and the goodness is implied in those especialties
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.240]   in the Bible.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.500]   God created us to be in skin and in languages
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.100]   and in cultures.
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.280]   He doesn't mean for us to despise our skin
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.120]   and our languages and our cultures,
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.940]   but to be at home in them and to feel good about them.
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.720]   And when I think of other passages
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.540]   that point in the direction of patriotism,
[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.540]   Romans 13 surely implies some kind of patronism
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.160]   because Romans 13, when it says submit to those in authority
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.000]   implies that a government, a country, a state
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.640]   has the right to use the sword to maintain order
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.880]   and to defend itself against aggression.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.640]   And if it does, that means God is saying
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.160]   it has a right to be.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.660]   And if it has a right to be and to preserve what it is,
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.960]   then the people who live there give approval to that.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.400]   They say, we like that, we're glad that we are
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.280]   and that we are culturally the way we are.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.600]   And they can say that without putting down other cultures.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.520]   You don't have to be negative about England
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.320]   because you're pro-America in the sense of loving
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.640]   some of the distinctives that God has made in this place.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.240]   So I think I would probably wrap it up by saying
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.720]   whatever form your patriotism takes,
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.720]   let it be with a deep sense that we are more closely bound
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.120]   to brothers in Christ in other countries and other cultures
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.400]   than we are to our closest unbelieving compatriot
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.640]   in the fatherland.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.880]   God is our King and no man,
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.240]   his kingdom is our final allegiance.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:46.240]   But under that banner, it is right to be thankful
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.120]   that God gave us our land freely,
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.320]   thankful that people paid a high price to preserve it
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.320]   and thankful that we have these slippers
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.980]   that feel so comfortable.
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.520]   - Thank you for that Independence Day reminder, Pastor John.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.240]   And thank you for listening to this podcast.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.860]   You can follow our daily podcast with a free app

[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.680]   And during this extended holiday weekend,
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.180]   it may be a good time for you to stop in
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.840]   and visit us online at desiringgod.org.

[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.860]   and all intended to help explain
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.560]   why God is most glorified in us
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.640]   when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.500]   Well, speaking of the British,
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.660]   next week we will welcome a guest to the podcast,
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.040]   Michael Reeves, who is a theologian in the UK.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.240]   Mike is also a historian and we'll ask him
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.400]   what we can learn from the Puritans and from John Calvin.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.780]   I'll ask him how the tradition of praying to Mary
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.160]   developed in the Roman Catholic tradition.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.720]   And we'll talk about precious topics
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.680]   like union with Christ and joy in Christ.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.760]   That's all next week.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.800]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.360]   Enjoy your Independence Day.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.120]   And for you listeners in the States,
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.800]   enjoy your extended weekend.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.380]   (upbeat music)
