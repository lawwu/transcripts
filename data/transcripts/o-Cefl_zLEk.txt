[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.720]   to YouTube just to make sure we're live because I don't trust myself still. You'd be surprised
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.360]   I always always mess up in like one way or another.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.120]   It's human. It's okay.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.040]   Awesome. I can hear an echo we're live. Hey, everybody. Thanks. Thanks for joining us.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.720]   If you're watching the live stream, you missed something awesome. Because Kaggle Grandmaster
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:36.000]   and Radha Altiano who's been putting out amazing kernels every month, the frequency keeps changing,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.160]   but she's been doing amazing stuff. And I've always been curious with I've had the chance
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.360]   to interview her a few times. And I've been curious, how does she go about doing this
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.600]   process. So I gave her a challenge of teaching us how she does it. That's what we'll get
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.760]   to learn today. And we'll be working on the hidden gems competition by another Grandmaster
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.680]   heads or tails, who also writes amazing kernels. So with that, I'll drop and Radha's Twitter
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.680]   in the chat if any case, if in case anyone wants to follow her and you can of course
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.720]   connect with her on Kaggle as well. She's currently a data scientist at Indawa but she
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.840]   does a lot of community stuff. So you can probably also catch her at a Weights and Biases
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.920]   live stream or she's always always on Twitter sharing her stuff. So definitely check that
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.880]   out. And Radha please share your recipes with us and please tell us how you go about creating
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.360]   all of this awesome stuff today.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.760]   Thank you so much for having me again. People are going to get very bored but thank you
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:47.020]   so much. I hope this will be at least interesting. It is for me usually. So I'm gonna just go
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.720]   ahead and share my screen and we are gonna
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.880]   we got this in the YouTube chat. So everyone's really excited. Someone sent me how the data
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.160]   scientist version of Emma Watson.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:06.600]   Thank you so much. Okay, so let's not keep people waiting. So I'm going to share my screen.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.120]   Okay, so Sanyam, you can talk to me through this process just because I don't want to
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.400]   hear my voice. Only my voice all over. So you can ask questions or what the hell are
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.840]   you doing there and stuff like that. Okay, so full disclosure, I know about the competition
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.600]   that Martin has put out. I am one of the judges, but I haven't like besides the fact that I
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.640]   have read this page, and I have looked at this data set just in this format, like in
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.640]   the Kaggle view. And I also went ahead, of course, and uploaded some kernels. I haven't
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:57.720]   done anything. So cross my heart and hope to die. This is new notebook and we are gonna
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:07.240]   like we are gonna get started. Okay, so do you Sanyam, maybe you can do you want to also
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.920]   know stuff like color schemes and everything? Yes, just gonna Oh, yes.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.200]   Everything and for some context for the audience, I had requested and rather that we maybe do
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   a live stream and on on an unseen data set that I'll just reveal to her when we go live.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.440]   But since the awesome competition is live, I asked her to join this one. And that's that's
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.640]   what she means. It's she hasn't worked on worked on this data set, which of course,
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.560]   she just thinks once you once you've taken a look.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.720]   Yeah, yeah. So this is kind of the rough process I'm going to go through. It's going to get
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.080]   it's going to be messy. It's it's never very, very clean. But you're gonna see it's it's
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:57.240]   gonna hopefully it's gonna come up. Okay, so what I'm gonna do here is first name this
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:07.040]   notebook and let's see. I've never done live coding. So we'll see how this goes hidden
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.440]   gems. And then I usually this is actually what I do. I leave this one because I haven't
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.360]   looked at the data. So I have no idea what I'm gonna do. Here I usually go about and
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:27.160]   say center, I usually like to center my images, I realized that it's much cleaner and cleaner
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.880]   and easier to follow if you're in the center. And then I would say in the source equals
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.840]   and then here I'm going to put some sort of cover usually the time going to do I'm going
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.840]   to show you how I'm doing my covers in a second. And then I'm going to put again, let's say
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:56.760]   this thing and see h1 h1 in here is going to be the title. And I'm going to say like
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.080]   again, hidden gems. And I have no idea still what I'm doing. So I'm going to leave it like
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:13.560]   this. Now, what I usually do is I copy myself, because I'm doing such a great job. Sometimes,
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.760]   this is my topic. In case anyone wonders, this is this is my life. This is this is what
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.520]   makes me happy. Okay, so I'm usually going to go to my profile and take whatever notebook
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:33.040]   I have completed last. So in this case, it's going to be the H&M competition. It's usually
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:40.080]   the latest because in within the latest I've done the most like for sure I've done something
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.440]   more than I've done in the second to last notebook. And this is the process. And I'm
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:54.880]   going to just take here and copy everything in the first. Here are the libraries. Let
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:06.040]   me go and say so libraries. I usually use this around the same libraries or at least
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:14.560]   like the basics. So I have OS, garbage, 1 DB. I'm going to leave everything. I'm going
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:24.840]   to take this one out. We're not working with images. We're not working with images. I'm
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.480]   working. And here is Seaborn and some stuff from my Plotlib. I'm going to show you in
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:35.040]   a second from where it's coming from there. Display HTML. I don't think I need this one.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:45.200]   Okay. So I'm going to just erase this one. And then I have the warnings. Usually here
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:54.360]   is my own configuration for weights and biases. I can say here hidden. Although I don't know
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:02.960]   if I'm going to use weights and biases in this one or at least in like right now. Here
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:09.800]   I usually like to use a color whenever I'm printing stuff because it pops a bit better
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:16.360]   in the eye. And here is usually my color scheme. So now I'm going to run this. Sanyam, do you
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.560]   want me to change this color scheme? So this is from HTML. Should I go through that process?
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:27.560]   >> I have zero artistry sense as you very well know. So I leave it to you.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:36.920]   >> Okay. So for me this is fun. And this is how I start. So let's see. I'm going to go
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:46.200]   here. And usually I go to color. And also let's see. We are doing hidden gems. So gems
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:56.240]   color scheme. What we can find. I'm thinking something very bright and maybe like something
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:12.000]   like this. So a little bit of a rainbow here. I wouldn't do a pinky. So let's do this one.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:25.680]   So something like this. Let's see if we can find Google will think I'm going shopping.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:40.000]   So let's see if I can save my image. Let's see. Save. And then I'm going to take color
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:09:00.560]   picker from image. Image color picker. And use your image. Where did I? Here. Yeah. So
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:09.880]   let's I don't know. Let's have one. I'm going to take this one just because I like it. So
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:21.760]   I'm going to erase these. I usually go about and put more than at least six I would say.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:45.200]   So at least six colors. So actually I like this one better. And then let's do six so
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:57.680]   we don't bore everybody to death. Okay. I'm going to do so I did a D3. I'm going to do
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:17.400]   some pink. And then let's see. Let's take this. Okay. So they look very so see this
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:23.600]   is where it's kind of like it's a back and forth process. So I would actually maybe keep
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:30.200]   this one here for the moment and have these colors as well. And depending on the graph,
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.200]   for example, if there are three bars, I would use something like this or something like
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:42.160]   this. Because these colors would look a little bit better or kind of diagonal than just having
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:56.440]   one pretty random. Okay. So I'm going to let's see. 96. Okay. So I did everything. And now
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:04.120]   what I'm going to actually also do is I will come here and get all my helper functions.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:09.280]   Precisely this one. Show value on bars. I'm using this almost all the time like in all
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:27.400]   my notebooks. So I'm going to take this one and put it here as well. And say here. Cool.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:45.760]   Let's see if I can also. Yeah. So let's get this one. Okay. So the first thing will be
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:57.360]   to kind of understand the data. So meaning the data set that Martin has put here. So
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:06.760]   I'm just going to say data frame equals pd.read CSV. And I'm going to read data frame. So
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:13.880]   let's explore it a little bit. So we have the volume. Well, first of all, just to do
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:23.160]   a sanity check. So we already know. And here is also where I would come in here and put
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:30.440]   I don't know, for example, helpful notes. Because whenever I go back, I can also if
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:36.000]   anybody reads my notebook, they don't really need to go through and understand the what
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.400]   I'm printing or what I'm plotting. They can also read the helpful notes and be like, oh,
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:52.920]   okay. This is the overall big idea. So what we already know is we had 100 episodes from
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:13:04.120]   Martin. And in each episode, he put three notebooks that were like hidden gems. Right?
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:10.240]   So we know that this is why we have 300. So 100 episodes multiplied by three notebooks,
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:20.560]   we get 300 observations. And then we'll have the date where they were published. The link
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:29.840]   form I would guess this one is where he put the like within the Taggle discussions. Yeah.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:40.560]   So we have like these beautiful notebooks. So hello, here and then the comments and everything.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:47.560]   So this is like the link, the actual link, sorry. And then we have the title link because
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:57.400]   he also posts on Twitter. And then the link to the notebook, the author, title, the review,
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:05.520]   Twitter name, which is like I guess the name displayed on the Kaggle profile. Author Twitter.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:13.600]   Okay. There are some not applicable there. LinkedIn notes. So I already know the shape.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:24.960]   And this is where I would go print. And then I would say the dataset has size of and then
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:41.200]   say they have that shape. And here comes color.start plus and then plus color.end I think. And
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:48.480]   they print like in whatever color you want, really. I chose this greenish I was thinking
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:15:03.440]   of them are like kind of color. So it has this shape. Now let's see. So not all authors
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:11.200]   have a Twitter account or a LinkedIn account. And there are some notes that oh, most of
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:18.360]   the notes are not in A. What did he write in these notes? Okay. So let's find out. So
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:47.600]   IDF data frame notes. That is an A. Oh. I didn't do the wrong poll. Oops. That's not
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:58.520]   a good one. Let's see. Notes. Okay. So this week's episode is a special edition to celebrate
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:08.520]   the amazing milestone. Okay. So he kind of pointed out a few special times within I guess
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:13.100]   the length of time he has been posting and some special editions. Like it's this one.
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:22.520]   So we have like the 20th episode here. Amazing milestone. 5 million signups and so on. Okay.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:36.440]   So I don't think this is going to go really into the EDA part. Good. So I don't know.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:43.980]   What should we do? So here usually comes the like the actual questions. So we can first
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:52.860]   of all look at so just by looking at this data set, I am actually curious to see first
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:17:05.260]   of all if we have author Kaggle. So if the Kaggle authors are unique. And it seems they
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:16.940]   are not. Let's say set index. So there are 231 rows. Meaning that we have a few authors
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:23.660]   that were mentioned more than one time. >> The database is awesome. He had won the
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:39.300]   chai competition. >> Cool. The database. Let's spy on everybody.
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:55.940]   I am guessing actually we can look at so who okay. So let's see. We have DF. If I'm going
[00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:06.260]   to start speaking Romanian, I apologize. Okay. So let's see one notebook. So we're going
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:25.020]   to select notebook. Let's see this one. Oh, what? Why? This is weird. Why is this happening?
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:47.020]   >> Yeah, that's the first link is the chai competition. >> But why?
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:52.100]   >> They know I'm live here and I'm kind of nervous. And they were like, oh, let's make
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:59.620]   fun of her. Good. So no, let's go to the so making perfect chai and other tales. Let's
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:07.020]   see this one. Because I'm actually curious about this one. Oh, and they still this is
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:13.980]   weird. I would guess that every time they get mentioned within a hidden gems, they would
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:22.100]   kind of arrive or at least get to gold medal. But I guess it's not the case. This is actually
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:30.000]   a pretty good question to be asked. Okay. So I'm going to do some shameless promotion
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.740]   for you, Sonny. I'm here. >> You remember it.
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:41.240]   >> Well, I kind of I already clicked on it. So YouTube homepage to see video. So what's
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.660]   this about? >> He, we hosted the competition, if you
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:51.860]   remember, and he analyzed the podcast's data set. So he went ahead and even created those
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:57.740]   awesome visualizations you saw above. He's like, design those and did feature engineering
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:04.980]   really fancy stuff. And if you scroll to the bottom, he created a report as well. So like
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:12.760]   the executive report. >> Oh, my God, it's a lot of work here. I
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:23.920]   love the insights. Like, I love it. Oh, wow. Oh, and he used Plotly. Plotly is amazing,
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:31.600]   but I find it very, it's very difficult for me to wrap my mind. I was actually well, we're
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:45.760]   going to might be doing some cool word clouds as well. Okay. So the report is at the end.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:56.440]   >> I think, yeah. If I remember correctly. >> I don't know. I can. Oh, I guess.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:07.720]   >> And it's on Canva. Oh, my God. Like I should mention this notebook too. Like it's actually
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.600]   amazing. >> Yeah.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:19.480]   >> So if you don't use Canva, you should use Canva. I'm using Canva for almost everything,
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:27.440]   especially my schemas and the like the covers and everything. Canva is amazing and it's
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:34.440]   free. And you can use whatever you find on the internet. And like I would highly, highly
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:39.760]   recommend it. This is amazing. I'm going to actually leave it here because I want to take
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:49.400]   a little bit of time to properly read it. Okay. So the database. I'm wondering if he
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:56.960]   has thought of like the beast from how is he called from YouTube? I haven't watched
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.200]   one. Mr. Beast. Yeah, exactly. >> He's the database.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:12.840]   >> Yeah. Like it's Rob Mueller with the medallion stallion. Okay. So we lost our track. Good.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:18.160]   So actually, we've noticed that there are a few people that are actually mentioned more
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:26.080]   than once. And we can do a pretty cool graph with this information as well. And I would
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:39.880]   guess, I don't know, let's see. Top 15. Top 30. Oh, wow. So there are resetting links.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:53.240]   So I'm going to do something like this. I'm going to say this is how should we call this?
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:23:04.200]   Author. So I'm naming a new data frame and I'm saying something like this. Author count.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:13.640]   So I'm planning to do two things. So first of all, I want to print everybody. So actually,
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:30.360]   I'm going to do that columns. I'm going to do author Kaggle. And then count. Sorry if
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:40.000]   I'm clumsy. I've never done this. I'm sorry. And then I'm going to say if count is greater
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:50.760]   than 1. So there are quite a few people. Oh, I'm here, too. It's so cool. So and what I'm
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:58.960]   going to do is I'm going to say author Kaggle. But values. So first I want to print everybody.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:11.400]   And I'm going to say this. No, I'm actually I'm going to leave it like this. And I'm going
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:40.800]   to say print all Kagglers that were mentioned more than once. Cool. I'm going to also
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:52.600]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'm going to do like let's see top. This is going to
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:25:18.760]   be the very easy way. Like this. It's cheating. But yeah. So I've printed everybody here in
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:26.680]   order. So they're going to be showing like for example, if you wanted to check who has
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:34.960]   been oh, it's Karnika here. Oh, okay. Sorry. And now I'm going to do the actual plot. Now
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:45.880]   the plotting part the basics are usually the same. Like there's no really a very like sophisticated
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:52.160]   way for example to do a bar plot. However, I'm trying in every notebook to add if I'm
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:58.840]   interested within the idea part which here I am. To kind of add something interesting.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:07.480]   Like I did in the birds competition when I added birds. I also like I'm usually playing
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:13.240]   with the color scheme if it's like ocean about ocean water dolphins I'm going to use blues
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:22.520]   and stuff like that. Here I might put gems on different like bars. I will see. But first
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:31.040]   of all let's and I'm actually going to go ahead and see. So here I have a bar which
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:41.320]   is already done. And I'm just going to take everything from here. And I don't put it here.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:45.800]   I usually put it a little bit below because I'm not going to use everything. It depends
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:54.880]   on how it's going to look. Now the size of the plot I usually leave it like as is. 25
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:04.400]   to be kind of the maximum length of width of the notebook. And then I usually no, let's
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:16.080]   go and put the bar first to see how the data looks. So I'm going to use author count. Then
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:23.960]   I'm how do you want to do. Would you like to see the bars. I usually like to see them
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:30.520]   on the left like to go like. Yeah exactly. Should we should we do that too. Don't do
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:35.840]   that because I forget the parameter and then I go to find it and then I feel stupid because
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:44.520]   the axis in word or like the plot disappears. Let's do that. I don't think you'll face that
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:50.920]   issue. I don't think so. I will see. OK so I don't have. Well I have an axe. So this
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:57.840]   is this is my axe. And for the palette I'm going to leave. Colors is not defined. Of
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:05.520]   course colors is not defined. I have my colors. How actually I'm not going to I'm not going
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:14.240]   to use this because it's going to be more than. I don't know how many. OK so they are
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:26.560]   going to be quite quite a lot. Oh. One second because I didn't do. So here is everybody
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:35.760]   but I want only the people that are have more than one. Mention. So I'm going to say here
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:48.920]   author equals author count to two. And I'm going to say like this. And then here I'm
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:29:04.720]   just going to put author of author. Let's see. Yeah. OK. Now. OK so this is like the
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:12.720]   very basic plot how it gets out from from Seaborn. Now I will. Make it a little bit
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:23.120]   longer. Let's see 15. Just to have a little bit of space. OK so something like this for
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:30.120]   us to be able to to properly see everything. And now I'm just going to take step by step
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:44.920]   and I'm going to plot. So first of all the title. And let's see. Calculators. Add more
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:30:00.360]   than one mention. Size 22. Weight bold. So I usually I usually play with this. But the
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:06.280]   way that you leave it bold because I feel like it's it looks cooler. You can also change
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:11.600]   the color for example. But it's quite tricky to change the color to the actual title because
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:18.760]   then you need to be very careful. So that you don't have a lot of a bunch of colors
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:24.600]   thrown at you when you look at the actual plot. Because I've tried I really tried to
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:31.680]   making a peacock out of my charts. Yeah it doesn't look great. Like you don't understand
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:38.400]   anything. So keep it like try to make it if you want colorful but just keep it simple
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:46.240]   so people can actually understand whatever you're trying to show here. So we I'm going
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:56.360]   to make one. Let's see. OK. Clickers. I've had more than one mention. Oh OK. And now
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:04.880]   here I'm showing an image which we're not going to do here. This one and actually these.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:12.840]   OK. Are very very important and I usually use them too. So show values on bars. I usually
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:21.240]   so this is I think it's horizontal. So let's see. Show the actual values. I don't know
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:36.960]   why they are so far off. So horizontally. Yeah. Let's see. We play with this a little
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:43.160]   bit. I don't know why this is. This is so weird. This never happens to me. It's a it's
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:55.080]   a great time. Good. So I'm gonna I'm gonna figure this out. So PLT. So the label Y label
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:03.400]   it's a regular name. I'm gonna switch this one and then X label. I actually don't want
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:11.680]   any X label because you already know from the from the title what this is all about.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:20.200]   And then the X ticks. I don't need them anymore because I am showing the values on bars here.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:28.560]   And then the Y ticks. Yeah let's make it a little bit bigger and see how this is going
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:38.920]   to show. Oh and also like you need to put what's this called in English. Like a dot
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:51.000]   in a comma. Semi colon. Yeah. So that's all the messy stuff won't show. I'm also going
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:59.640]   to print because I need a little bit of space between what I'm printing and the plot. And
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:08.200]   this is starting to come together. The last thing I will do as a copy is I'm gonna do
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:16.480]   this. So this is very very clean like as you've noticed all the lines have. Let's take a look
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:23.000]   at this one again. All the lines like the border of the plot have disappeared. And in
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:31.040]   my opinion this is a game changer because you don't have to. It's a bonus information
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:39.040]   that you don't really need in this particular moment. Good. So now we are going to go to
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:56.880]   the good stuff. So let's see. PlotLib color. And let's choose something because Seaborn
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:05.120]   has the same names for the color schemes as Matplotlib does. So you can you can take a
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:12.880]   look at both. I don't usually like the ones from Seaborn and this is why I'm coming here.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:19.880]   So gems. I'm thinking maybe plasma. We can go with plasma. But I would also go with something
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:30.080]   like this because you want to have this color much more I would think preeminent than this
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:41.800]   one to show kind of a decrease. So I really like this one. So or this one. Let's see how
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:35:05.100]   we feel. Bar plot. So I think oh, palette. Okay. And I'm going to put an R here which
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:13.800]   means I need to reverse. So the light color comes in here and then the very intense color
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:26.560]   comes here. I'm glad you found something interesting today. I'm really bad at all of this. Everything
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:33.740]   is new to me. >> Okay. So what I don't like here is this
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:39.540]   is too red in my opinion and we don't we aren't showing something which is faulty. We actually
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:44.780]   are showing something that's very, very good being mentioned more than once by Martin is
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:50.980]   amazing. So I'm thinking to move towards maybe a bluish or purplish color. I don't like this
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:36:03.120]   red one. So I would go ahead I'm using this one and let's see RDPU. So it's reversed.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:14.940]   RDPU and also R. This one looks a little bit better. Or maybe yeah, I think this one is
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:26.600]   going to go. I'm going to leave this one. Yeah. So something like this. Now, you can
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:36.600]   leave this graph as is and it looks good, right? It looks it kind of gives the information
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:47.500]   that you already want. However, one second. I kind of want to increase this size. However,
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:54.500]   we can go a little bit further, I would say. Because we have some information here. First
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:37:05.600]   of all, Jonathan, it's like a champion. So I would emphasize the fact that he has nine
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:14.420]   mentions and then the next guy comes it's only at five. So it's four mentions between
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:20.660]   them, which is quite a big deal, like a big difference between these two. So I would mention
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:29.980]   here that Jonathan kind of how is the it's an expression in English. Kicks the ball out
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:35.580]   of the park. Yeah, yeah. Knock the ball out of the park, I think. Something like that.
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:44.060]   Yeah. I would emphasize I've been in for three weeks. That's why I know all the phrases.
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:51.300]   Even I wouldn't otherwise. Sorry. You know all the slang and you can teach us. No, that's
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:38:12.380]   amazing. So what I'm thinking is maybe we could do two things, I guess. We can put a
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:21.260]   vertical line here that would be dashed to show the difference between everybody else
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:30.860]   and Jonathan. And then we could also, I guess, add an arrow here. Kind of going like this
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:39.980]   and say Jonathan has the most mentions out of all. And maybe also add a diamond or something.
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:47.700]   So do you like Sanyam, do you want me to do that? Or should we go further and try to because
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:56.340]   we have so much time and I'm trying to be do you want me to go to link maybe the meta
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:02.420]   and see what we can do there? Or do you want me to perfect this graph? What do you think?
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:06.980]   I'll ask the audience. We have like 23 people. So like I look at the first three replies
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:15.460]   from people because I'm fascinated to check on both of them. I'll wait for one reply.
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:21.780]   You're too kind. There's also 30 second delay. So between the time you speak and then they
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:26.260]   hear and then they write back, it takes like one minute. It took me a really long time
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:31.300]   to figure this out. And I'd be like, this is just bots watching the video. No one is
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:42.300]   watching. Why is anybody talking to me?
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:45.300]   So the first reply says continue.
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:53.180]   Continue. Okay. I was actually I was really sure you're gonna say something else. So good.
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:40:04.220]   Continue. Good. So what I said the first thing is right like put vertical line. Yeah. Vertical
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:11.220]   line on there. I'm actually thinking to work on this notebook during the weekend. So you're
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:14.180]   gonna see most probably everything.
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:16.180]   A lot changes.
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:22.180]   And additional stuff that maybe I don't get to do here.
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:28.700]   Just start your own channel so that you don't have to come on my stupid shows to show us.
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:34.580]   Don't say don't say don't say that. I watched Rob doing something.
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:37.780]   Rob is on another level.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:44.700]   He has like a background and he lights and I'm oh, I'm scared.
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:50.620]   I have graphic cards. Just not here. Just not at the Wix Embassy office.
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:59.460]   I'm gonna go where everybody goes. I don't I've used this but I don't I don't try to
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:08.020]   remember. So this is why I usually Google everything. So only one line may be specified.
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:13.820]   So how I'm looking at something like this. I would like something like this. Not too
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:26.340]   much points. Looks weird. I don't like this one. So which is two three four. So the fourth
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:45.580]   would be this one I think. No, this one. Full height. No, it's this one. Let's see what
[00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:46.580]   will happen.
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:52.420]   Many times I'm like tired and I realize I'm just copying the like messy code from the
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:42:04.620]   question and I forgot to scroll. Why do I even code in Python? I don't need.
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:10.980]   I have no idea why they are. It looks complicated and I don't understand why.
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:31.540]   I guess you can do something like you specify I think you specify here the dashes. No, let's
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:39.620]   do something like this. So I'm gonna do something very, very simple. So X is gonna be around
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:56.180]   6, let's say. And then Y mean is gonna be at 0 and then Y max is gonna be at one second.
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:43:10.340]   And 45. So let's put 44. Color is gonna be black at first and I don't want any labels.
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:21.380]   I'm gonna delete this. Let's see. Oh, okay. So we have done something. We are going somewhere.
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:28.260]   This is why I like data visualization. I instantly know if I'm messing things up. I think I like
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:34.380]   it here because I want to do also the arrow and add the text here. And I'm gonna put the
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:47.860]   style. It should be something like this. Let's see. Okay. Good. And line width. I want to
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:44:03.460]   be let's say 3. Okay. And now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go back to my gems and choose
[00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:28.340]   something what goes with purple. I would go let's see what this will do. I'm trying not
[00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:38.740]   to make everything pink. This is what I'm actively trying. So let's leave it orangeish.
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:47.620]   And then so we've created the break within the plot. And then what I'm gonna do is I
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:45:11.260]   think it's plt.text. And let's see. X, Y, S. So X, Y, S. X is going to be around 6.7.5.
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:23.500]   And then Y is going to be around let's see 25. And then S I guess is the text. I need
[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:51.340]   to yeah. The string. I'm gonna say I bet he's sneezing like crazy now. Because we are mentioning
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:46:07.260]   him like did you get it? And I'm gonna what's his profile? I'm trying to see if I can author
[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:15.460]   LinkedIn. He doesn't have Twitter. Oh, I don't have the link to his profile. Well, I guess
[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:25.300]   we can also do some spying like with Jonathan. He's from California. Palo Alto. So sunny.
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:36.580]   I'll meet him after the live stream. Oh, really? Oh, do you think? Oh, okay. Oh, I fooled me.
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:44.820]   Do you think he would be upset if I would take his profile from here and put it within
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:52.980]   my my chart? Do you think because it would be awesome to have his like, that's an awesome
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:47:01.540]   idea. Yeah. This just came to me. It wasn't planned. But instead of saying Jonathan is
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:13.060]   well, I'm actually thinking to to take I thought you embed an iframe. Oh, no, I'm gonna put
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:21.180]   in the plot. Like, oh, no, no, no. So bigger challenge for you. Maybe for another live
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:29.900]   stream. How? How? But I don't know how. What you're saying? Like, to embed the web page
[00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:48.460]   is what I mean. I've seen someone do it on Kaggle. This embed web page. I've never done
[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:56.500]   this. This is interesting. Oh, it's quite you can try this. Okay, let's see. But this
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:04.500]   is in the markdown. Yeah. So inside the plot will be really hard. No, it's not hard. I
[00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:17.780]   can show you I can I we can make both both ways. Let's see. Hello. Nothing happened with
[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:31.980]   height. So I don't think source that work. I remember this thing if you want to copy
[00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:41.780]   from there, I put it in the stream your chart. So if you go to where, where are here? Oh,
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:54.900]   hello. Hello. Go to the sixth section of this. The sixth section. Yeah. What? Why did you?
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:49:08.220]   Okay, good. Like this. I'm so sorry, I should have closed teams work. But if you scroll
[00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:18.020]   a bit down, you'll see they had embedded. It's not scrolling. Let's see. One second.
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:23.620]   Yep, that's that's the thing I was pointing out. I think this was an interactive table
[00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:38.220]   that they had embedded something like that. Yeah. Yeah. This is amazing. This is amazing.
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:44.860]   Oh, okay. So this is what you were referring to something like this inside the plot is
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:55.020]   what I mean. Inside. I don't know if inside the plot is going to work like this. What
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:50:05.260]   I was thinking is just put his image here, append it to the to the actual plot and then
[00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:13.820]   feel the arrow. So first of all, what I'm going to do is I'm going to save this picture,
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:25.740]   I might need to create a data set for this, but I'm going to say like, Jonathan. Then
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:39.140]   I'm going to come here and add upload. And I'm going to put Jonathan. And then I'm going
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:52.300]   to say hidden gems. And then create. And then I'm going to go to one of my notebooks. I
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:51:00.460]   don't know if in this one I have Oh, I have I have Whoa, good. Very good. Insert image.
[00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:15.500]   So it was a function that I was using that I'm going to find in a second. I'm going to
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:28.100]   take this picture. Zoom. XY box is going to be so here I put 92 and 11. Here I'm going
[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:49.260]   to put 7.5 and 25. Let's see what this gives us. And on the axe. And all I have to do now
[00:51:49.260 --> 00:52:03.580]   is go to here and find the actual insert image. Hopefully I have all the libraries in here.
[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:15.620]   And I'm going to put them here. So what I would need is the path to the image. How big
[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:27.660]   should be the image? The parameters and the axe where we want it. Let's see. Oh, okay.
[00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:39.980]   What I will do is I will make it a little bit smaller. 36. And I would want it to maybe
[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:53.020]   a little bit lower. And then let's see eight. Am I gonna cut the image? No.
[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:56.900]   It just zooms out of the graph.
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:57.900]   What?
[00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:03.140]   It felt like it zoomed out of the graph.
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:20.380]   No. I put it a little bit to the right. And then I want it as big as possible, though.
[00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:31.220]   Okay. And I would put let's see. Okay. Let's leave it like this for the moment. And then
[00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:44.380]   the last thing I want to do is I want to create an arrow which might be very annoying because
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:57.140]   sometimes it doesn't work. But I will try. And I think I know where I have used something
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:59.660]   like that.
[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:02.700]   You dropped one rank. What happened? Who passed you?
[00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:14.380]   Now? Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm on six. It will take me a little bit of time to get to five.
[00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:17.700]   Number one, when?
[00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:21.620]   Chris needs to take a break. A very long break.
[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:29.260]   I met him. He didn't sound like he'll take a break.
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:32.860]   And I need to step up my game.
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:39.460]   So something like this I'm thinking. And I'm going to look how did I oh, the arrow. So
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:57.700]   I have here the style. I'm gonna print everything. So this is the vertical line. This is the
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:05.540]   plot. And here I'm gonna draw the arrow. And here is the image and everything.
[00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:15.300]   So the arrow. The style is simple. We're gonna play with it a little bit later. Arrow style
[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:27.420]   is gonna be the style. Color let's put my colors and leave zero for the moment. Arrow
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:38.900]   patches. So I don't know if I have patches imported. I have. Very good. Fancy arrow patch.
[00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:52.780]   And now I'm gonna need to look how did I do this. So X is going to be okay. This part.
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:56:01.220]   And it's 18. Oh, it's X and Y and then X and Y again. And then the radius is how arched
[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:05.900]   we want it to be. I hope I'm not saying stuff wrong.
[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:18.620]   So let's see. We want the tail to be here. So this is gonna be around 7.56789. So around
[00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:33.280]   8. Let's see. And the Y, where did I put this one at 28? Let's put 25. And then this one
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:43.980]   I want it to be at around 8.5. Because I want it to be going in that direction. Maybe 8.7.
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:53.820]   And then this one is going to be 2. Because we want the Y to be 0. It's 1, 2, 3 and so
[00:56:53.820 --> 00:57:09.380]   on. Let's see what this will do. Oh, good. I'm surprised. Okay. I will move the top of
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:14.580]   the arrow a little bit to the right. >> Should change the color to I think is a
[00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:24.460]   master to the Kaggle. >> Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So
[00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:54.420]   one second. 9.2. And then I want 1.8. Now too far. 9. Okay. So something like this.
[00:57:54.420 --> 00:58:00.500]   And then notebooks. Do you think this color is okay? Does it match?
[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:03.380]   >> I think so. >> Okay.
[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:16.340]   >> You can copy that. >> Where's my up color? I think it's a little
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:23.620]   bit too reddish. But I'm not gonna let's not go there. Because we're gonna stay 15 more
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:28.260]   minutes for it to find the perfect orange. Oh, God.
[00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:33.380]   >> This is also sorry. Do you have stuff to add? Because I wanted to point out to be respectful
[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:38.860]   of your time. We're at the end of the marked live stream.
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:50.420]   >> If you want, we can like I'm good. We can go 15, 20 minutes or whatever you want. I'm
[00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:57.060]   gonna also add a text. It's a little bit too weird to leave it like this. But say something
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:10.300]   like full name. I don't know. He hasn't been active in a long time. And we are talking
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:28.820]   about him. We can talk him only thing. Jonathan has the most is the most mentioned.
[00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:42.860]   >> Is Martin's favorite calculator? >> Is Martin's favorite hidden gem. And then
[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:57.780]   let's put a gem on it. Good. And we need an X and a Y. X I want it to be so I think I'm
[00:59:57.780 --> 01:00:07.220]   gonna put the text here. So, again, I'm gonna match the image. And see where this goes.
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:18.380]   7.8. And then the Y is gonna be let's see 30. And then the S is our string. No. So,
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:24.660]   we'll need to move it so the text is here. And kind of move the entire graph. So, we
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:38.300]   need to take it a little bit to the left. A little bit to the left. And lower. Okay.
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:53.500]   More to the left. Oh, God. 6. I'm so sorry. But this is the process.
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:01:02.580]   >> This is what you want to learn. >> Yeah. So, I'm going lower. Which is not
[01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:11.100]   okay. I need to go like this. Oh, we are getting there. We are getting there.
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:16.660]   >> Why is it not showing up? >> I don't know. And it's annoying. It's very
[01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:26.980]   annoying. I'm gonna actually I think I'm gonna keep it. Because it's a probability when we
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:35.780]   are >> In there. Like just a normal star.
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:38.380]   >> Like this? >> Yeah.
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:51.100]   >> Oh, no. No, no, no. I'm gonna leave that because I think when I'm gonna commit the
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:59.940]   notebook, it might show. If not, I'm gonna erase it. So, the last thing I want to do,
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:07.780]   I wanted to move 6.4, let's say. To move it a little bit to the left. Now it's okay. And
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:26.580]   33. Or 32.5. Okay. And I want also maybe to put the same color. And I forgot. Okay. So,
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:45.900]   color. And then size. This is 18. I don't like it. Do you like it? Should I leave it
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:52.460]   like this? I don't like it. >> I think it's okay. I have zero artistic
[01:02:52.460 --> 01:03:00.420]   sense. >> Okay. And okay. So, what I usually do. So,
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:07.940]   we've done the libraries, helpful functions, understanding data. We've seen this. And then
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:14.940]   now we've done this plot. So, the thing is this is this is what makes this stuff very
[01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:22.820]   interesting in my opinion is that there are only a few more lines of code from the average
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:28.820]   plot to something that looks very fancy and it looks like wow, you've been working on
[01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:34.260]   it a little bit more. But it's actually it's extremely simple. And once you get the hang
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:39.180]   of it, you can create charts like this all the time.
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:46.140]   >> Not me. Other people. >> If you like it. Some people don't like
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:53.020]   this stuff at all. >> I like it. I just can't do it.
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:04:02.700]   >> So, let's see. Data frame. We can also we can try to find one more one more insight.
[01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:13.500]   I'm thinking to link to the meta kicker and maybe look at also because we've looked yeah,
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:19.660]   we've looked at yeah, go ahead. >> I had two ideas that I just realized. Does
[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:25.500]   Martin give them more followers? Or does Martin give them more words? Because you can see
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:33.020]   user follows as well, right? I'm not sure if it's like historically shown.
[01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:36.300]   >> It's okay. >> So it's like when they follow them. So
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:40.940]   like if Martin shares your work, do you become popular on Kaggle?
[01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:45.260]   >> Okay. >> Or do you get gold medal? That's another
[01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:52.460]   one or different direction. How many versions do these hidden gem authors create? Is there
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:57.100]   any correlation? Does everyone have 10 versions, 20 versions, something like that?
[01:04:57.100 --> 01:05:06.700]   >> Okay. So these are all multiple great ideas. I can so does Martin
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:16.060]   >> Give you make you famous. >> How famous?
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:24.300]   >> You are on Kaggle. >> You are. Just you are. Let's keep it like
[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:38.140]   that. Does do the notebooks have multiple more versions than on average, let's say more versions
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:49.180]   than the average notebook on Kaggle. And you said something, you said something, gold medals.
[01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:59.260]   >> Yep. Does Martin make you a grandmaster? >> Does Martin, yeah, it's a good way to put it,
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:11.820]   make, does Martin make you a grandmaster? Increases the amount, really, but the quality,
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:24.220]   let's say, of your medals. Should we pay Martin for his work? So these are all great questions.
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:30.860]   Which one do you want to tackle now? Because these are going in multiple directions,
[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:36.060]   and this is why I'm asking, because I would say let's do one more, not all of them,
[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:48.380]   because we are going to stay here until a long time. Sanyam? I don't hear you.
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:56.460]   >> Sorry, I muted myself and I didn't realize that. I'm not in my office, I don't have my fancy
[01:06:56.460 --> 01:07:03.020]   button set up that I can press. I was asking the audience to say what they want.
[01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:11.340]   >> We are waiting. I'm going to sip 30 seconds my chai.
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:17.420]   >> What chai are you having? >> It's ginger and orange,
[01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:23.580]   I think. Yeah, ginger and orange, something. >> That's a different combination.
[01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:30.460]   >> I love ginger. I love ginger. So this is why I like it.
[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:37.340]   >> Sounds like an ensemble. >> We don't have true tea,
[01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:45.180]   I think, in Romania, but we call it chai. >> I have not had chai for three weeks now.
[01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:49.740]   >> I'm sick. >> Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not going to brag.
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:58.460]   >> Again, for the audience, we're waiting on you to decide which question should we answer,
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:06.060]   and we're just having fun in the meantime. >> I'm going to at least start.
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:17.980]   What we know is that we have so we have the date. So the moment where
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:26.540]   it has been like it has been posted on the hidden gems. So what we would need is
[01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:31.980]   >> We can do the first one. No one has replied. >> No one has replied? They are getting bored.
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:44.300]   How famous you are. So user followers. I have an ID, a user ID, a following count, and a creation.
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:48.860]   What's this? >> Sorry, I will run and grab my charger.
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:52.860]   I'm not used to WNB office. I have chargers in all my rooms.
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:09:09.900]   >> Okay. Go ahead. I'm going to do stuff here.
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:38.900]   [ Silence ]
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:10:05.400]   [ Noise ]
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:15.400]   [ Silence ]

[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.400]   >> I'm back, sorry.
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:06.400]   >> You're good.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:12.400]   >> The thing is -- oh, but this is very weird.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:15.400]   No, no, it's okay.
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.400]   Okay.
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:20.400]   [ Silence ]
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:30.400]   So, what I've done here is I've read the user mapping and the followers, and now I'm trying to figure out --
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:42.400]   [ Silence ]
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.400]   Okay.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.400]   One second.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:51.400]   I'm trying to think and also -- oh, okay.
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:59.400]   So, the thing is I don't think the followers -- so, here is the creation date.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:10.400]   I don't know what creation date is this, although I think that creation of the account maybe, and then the following.
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:17.400]   But I don't have the following on days for each user.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.400]   >> Okay.
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:23.400]   Can we check if that is the creation date?
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:27.400]   Like, let's just go to one ID and see if the year matches.
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.400]   >> Yeah, let's merge everything.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.400]   PD.merge.
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:37.400]   I'm going to merge followers with user.
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.400]   Followers, yeah, with users.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.400]   On ID.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:48.400]   Let's see followers.shape.
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.400]   Do we have -- okay.
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.400]   On ID.
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.400]   User.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:58.400]   Let's see.
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:03.400]   [ Silence ]
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:08.400]   91680.
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:15.400]   So, there are some IDs that don't have --
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:19.400]   [ Silence ]
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:23.400]   There are some IDs that don't have followers.
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.400]   So, the thing is that we can look at them.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.400]   916865.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:35.400]   [ Silence ]
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:41.400]   I guess -- oh, they don't have, like, anything.
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:46.400]   But we can look at -- yeah, we can look at -- so, we have Rebecca.
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:53.400]   She has 67,000 followers.
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:56.400]   Am I reading this right?
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.400]   >> How is this possible?
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.400]   >> How is this possible?
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.400]   Let's look at Rebecca.
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.400]   >> Who is this person?
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:07.400]   >> Who is this person we want to meet her?
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:10.400]   >> Who is this Kaggle influencer?
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.400]   >> Rebecca.
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.400]   Oh, no.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.400]   I think it's -- no.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.400]   Rebecca8.

[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.400]   So, what's that, then?
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.400]   >> It's a bug.
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.400]   [ Silence ]
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:34.400]   >> So, creation date is 8 -- so, 2018.
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:38.400]   Joined nine years ago?
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.400]   No.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:45.400]   So, register date is 2013.
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.400]   Creation date has no notice.
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:51.400]   [ Silence ]
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:56.400]   >> Isn't -- did we merge -- we merged followers, right?
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.400]   >> Yeah.
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:12.400]   So, I took the user -- should have been users, but whatever -- which is the unique ID, user name, display, register date, and performance tier, which I guess it's --
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:18.400]   the level, grandmaster, master, and so on.
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:22.400]   And I merged it with followers.
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:26.400]   Followers being the ID.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:34.400]   And then the user ID is -- oh, I think it's this one with this one.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:37.400]   [ Silence ]
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.400]   Ah, this is so weird.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:41.400]   Okay, okay, okay.
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:47.400]   So, I need to merge ID from user with user ID from followers, right?
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.400]   I didn't do that.
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:58.400]   So, left on -- ooh.
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:05.400]   Left on followers and followers is user ID.
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:10.400]   But it's still, like, what's this?
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.400]   What's this?
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:15.400]   [ Silence ]
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:17.400]   Okay.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.400]   And right on --
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:23.400]   [ Silence ]
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:27.400]   And just the simple ID, I think.
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:32.400]   Because the user, it's a simple ID.
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:36.400]   9168, okay.
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:38.400]   Anthony.
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.400]   Hello, Anthony.
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:43.400]   Anthony joined in 2010.
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:53.400]   Oh, and he has the following -- in 2017, '18, '19, 2020.
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:58.400]   >> Should we look at Meta Kaggle to see what that column means?
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.400]   >> That what?
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.400]   >> Meta Kaggle.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:06.400]   I think it might have a description if you go to the dataset page.
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:08.400]   >> Yeah.
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.400]   Let's look.
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.400]   [ Sighs ]
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:18.400]   So, we should have user followers.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.400]   Anything --
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:24.400]   [ Silence ]
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.400]   >> No?
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:28.400]   >> No, I don't see it.
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:32.400]   >> The dataset has a low ranking because they don't have column descriptors.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:35.400]   They get that warning every time they go to this page.
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:40.400]   Anyone who's created this dataset would know you get a usability number.
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:45.400]   And if you don't have column descriptors for every single column, you get that complaint.
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:47.400]   >> Yeah.
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:50.400]   So, let's --
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.400]   [ Sighs ]
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:54.400]   This is annoying.
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:57.400]   But Anthony -- okay, let's check Anthony.
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:17:59.400]   >> Thank you.
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.400]   >> Oh, hello.

[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.400]   Okay.
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:08.400]   At least let's see how many followers.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:12.400]   946, which is none of these numbers.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:18.400]   [ Laughter ]
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:20.400]   Well --
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.400]   [ Silence ]
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:25.400]   >> That's another mystery of itself.
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:27.400]   >> That's another mystery.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:28.400]   Let's -- I don't know.
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:30.400]   Let's --
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.400]   What were the other questions?
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:34.400]   So, does Martin make you on Growmaster?
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:38.400]   Do the notebooks have more versions than the average notebook on Giga?
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.400]   Let's do this one because it looks much simpler.
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:43.400]   >> We can also end here if you want.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:46.400]   >> However you want.
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:49.400]   I don't want to make this very long.
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:51.400]   >> No, it's totally up to you.
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.400]   I just want to be respectful of your time.
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.400]   >> So, should we go further or should we not?
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.400]   How do you feel, everybody?
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:02.400]   >> People keep watching.
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:05.400]   >> In the background.
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:07.400]   Okay.
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:09.400]   So, let's try with this one.
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:13.400]   And if this one doesn't work, well, it was fake.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.400]   So, let's see.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:18.400]   I'm going to erase these things.
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:22.400]   So, what we'll need is the notebook.
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:25.400]   We have the link to the notebook.
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:30.400]   And what we'll need is the number of versions before and after.
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:40.400]   So, competition datasets, kernel version, kernel sources, kernel versions.
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:42.400]   Let's see.
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:44.400]   Author.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:47.400]   So, we have the ID.
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:51.400]   Author, creation, version, title.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:53.400]   He, he, he.
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:56.400]   This is so fun to browse through this.
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:58.400]   Version number.
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:00.400]   134.
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:02.400]   Okay.
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.400]   Exchange.
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.400]   Yeah, okay.
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:09.400]   But how do we -- let's see this.
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:11.400]   So, we have --
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:13.400]   We have --
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:27.400]   We have kernel versions.
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:31.400]   And then we have --
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:37.400]   Kernels.
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:41.400]   And I'm going to just copy kernels.
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:48.400]   Okay.
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:52.400]   I think I have --
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:59.400]   But, no, the kernels should have, like, a unique account -- a unique ID.
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:04.400]   It shouldn't be based on the user as well, right?
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:08.400]   We don't know because we don't have the description.
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:12.400]   Come on.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:25.400]   We have the kernel ID.
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:31.400]   And --
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:36.400]   Medal, medal award date.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:39.400]   So, this is -- these are kernels.
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:42.400]   And then versions.
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:46.400]   I'm trying to see -- so, these are the versions.
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:51.400]   And I'm trying to link the ID and see if I can find the link --
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:56.400]   to the notebook, right?
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:02.400]   Because we don't have -- in our data frame, we have only the link to the notebook.
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:04.400]   Okay.
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:11.400]   Kernel tags, languages.
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:30.400]   Let's see.
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:33.400]   I have ID, current kernel version ID.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:37.400]   For parent, forum.
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:50.400]   But this is not a link.
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:56.400]   Is it a link, though?
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:07.400]   If I put -- so, I have this --
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:17.400]   No, I don't think it's a link.
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:37.320]   Do you happen to know if within any of these kernels is a link or how can I link to?
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:41.320]   I'm not sure.
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:42.320]   This is very annoying.
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:57.600]   I'm very sure it's possible because one of the people that already got a prize within
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:00.360]   this competition, I can't remember.
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:01.360]   Leonie?
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:07.800]   Yeah, I can't remember where is the data set actually.
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:33.280]   She for sure I'm very sorry for that.
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:43.880]   I remember when I joined Kaggle that I was so astonished by heads or tails.
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:45.080]   It was incredible.
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:55.440]   He was one of my first, very first mentors onto this path of exploratory data analysis.
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:08.560]   Yeah, so Leonie already I think she already did some sort of.
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:11.640]   Oh my God.
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:15.400]   Do you see this?
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:19.480]   Data set no longer available.
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:22.480]   I am very.
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:27.280]   Yeah, should I message her?
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:30.640]   Because how did she?
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:31.640]   She has a LinkedIn.
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:33.480]   I'm gonna I'm gonna message her.
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:39.640]   Not now, but I'm gonna message her because I have no idea how she I've browsed through
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:43.920]   her notebook and I'm very sure.
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:56.000]   The day she joined the data with the Martins data set.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.400]   Yeah, so I think we're gonna need to put a stop.
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:01.400]   I'm so sorry.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.400]   I really wanted to.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:12.200]   I don't want you to find out.
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:16.120]   That's that's what's going on.
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:17.120]   OK.
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:25.800]   Yeah, so let's put a halt and I'm gonna look into it and by Saturday, Sunday, I guess I
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:32.360]   will post or I guess I can also.
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:35.360]   Do a commit and share whatever I worked on.
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:37.480]   Now as well.
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:38.480]   Yeah.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:40.720]   Then I'm gonna.
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:41.720]   Save.
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:48.040]   And I make it public for anyone that.
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:50.400]   Wants to look at this.
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:51.960]   I'm gonna also make an image.
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:56.080]   Oh, so one last thing, because I didn't I didn't have the time.
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:05.240]   So I use Canva for all all all my covers you're gonna find here covers covers as all this.
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:08.380]   I think two years.
[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:15.880]   Sometimes I'm making a combination and they are very it depends what inspires me really.
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:18.560]   Or sometimes I'm just making.
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:23.560]   See I I was thinking something like this, but then I moved something like this.
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:25.960]   So it's it's a bunch of stuff.
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:29.840]   Or sometimes I make something very simple just because I like this picture and I use
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:30.840]   this one.
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:36.080]   Yeah, so usually here what I would do is I would.
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:43.720]   Look for example, gems and I would inspire myself, maybe do something like this on the
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:53.720]   entire cover and lower the transparency and text here or I would.
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:28:00.680]   Do something a little bit more like simple and then I would put gems all over depending
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:06.960]   on I don't like this one, but depending on what I find and what I also find on Google.
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:10.380]   So this one is actually pretty nice too.
[01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:15.560]   So it's a very iterative process until I find something and I look at it and it looks good
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:21.640]   and this is when I just save it.
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:30.800]   So if you want to get get get a play with it, it's Canva is amazing.
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:34.920]   And this is where I usually make my my covers.
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:35.920]   Yeah, thanks.
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:36.920]   Thanks for sharing that.
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:37.920]   Did you commit the notebook?
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:46.920]   I'd like to share that link with everyone.
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:49.480]   Yes, I did.
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:52.760]   I'm going to give you the link in the chat.
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:57.920]   Oh, I have the link.
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:01.600]   Let me highlight that.
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:03.400]   This might be hard for people to find.
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:08.320]   So I'll just highlight your Kaggle profile link.
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:13.480]   Go there, find the latest notebook, sort by latest and that's how you can find the notebook.
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:20.200]   Unless Andrada over the weekend publishes another notebook, which she may or may not.
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:26.680]   If Leonie wants to share her secrets with me, I would be grateful.
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:32.160]   I'll also quickly mention your Twitter where Andrada is really active.
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:34.240]   She's active on LinkedIn as well.
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:37.440]   Just look up her first name that will take you to her profile.
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.840]   She's very well known on the platform.
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:41.960]   You don't need to type her full name, I think.
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:44.440]   Any other things you want to mention?
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:45.760]   I don't.
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:46.840]   I don't think so.
[01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:56.000]   I just looked at the notebook from Martin and his data set is also hidden or isn't available
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.000]   anymore.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.040]   So I think it's a bug or something.
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:03.600]   So maybe I can ask Martin too how he has linked everything.
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:09.120]   If Leonie doesn't want to share, but I'm sure she will be happy to.
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:11.120]   Leonie is awesome.
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:12.120]   Awesome.
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:15.080]   Thank you so much Andrada again for doing another live stream.
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:19.040]   One day I'll start saying no because you'll be so troubled with my request.
[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:23.120]   Then I'll keep asking because the audience enjoys learning from you so much.
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:25.520]   So thanks again for your time.
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:26.520]   Okay.
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:27.800]   Thank you so much for having me.
[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:28.800]   Thank you so much.
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:32.880]   And thanks, thanks everyone for watching live or watching the recap.
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:35.840]   If you're watching the recap, I feel sad for you, but thanks for watching.
