[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   All right, our next question here comes from Freddie.
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.200]   Freddie says,
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.040]   is the following understanding of deep work durations
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.900]   correct?
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.640]   All right, then he goes on to elaborate.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.980]   When deep work is geared towards deliberate practice,
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.640]   something like learning how to program,
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.520]   only four hours can be sustained per day
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.360]   since deliberate practice is inherently not fun
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.520]   when you're stretching your abilities.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.300]   However, when deep work is geared towards work
[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.880]   that can generate a flow state,
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.080]   something like writing computer programs,
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.640]   it can be extended to eight hours or maybe even 10.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.920]   So Freddie, that's more or less correct.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.760]   So that four hour limit that I mentioned in my book,
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.760]   Deep Work, really came from a study of deliberate practice.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.640]   It was actually an Anders Ericsson paper
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.480]   studying violin players.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.920]   I've also seen anecdotally this four hour limit
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.460]   confirmed by other, in particular, professional musicians.
[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.940]   So practicing a musical instrument
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.980]   at the professional level is a very intense act
[00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.140]   of deliberate practice.
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.240]   You're not just playing things,
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.660]   you know you're stretching your ability,
[00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.860]   you're trying to perfect.
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.820]   And the standard schedule that Anders found,
[00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.860]   and I've heard other people talk about as well,
[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.820]   is two hours break two hours, adds up to four hours.
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.060]   So that's correct.
[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.260]   Other type of deep work, yes, you can do much longer.
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.520]   So remember for something to be counted as deep work,
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.800]   it needs two attributes.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.480]   It has to be cognitively demanding, so it can't be trivial.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.100]   And it has to be done without distraction,
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.680]   so no context shifting.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.200]   You're giving your full attention to the effort,
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.360]   you're not also checking email,
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.560]   you're not also checking your phone.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.020]   That covers a lot of activities,
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.200]   include a lot of activities though,
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.720]   that though not super simple,
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.040]   because it has to be cognitively demanding,
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.880]   are things you could do all day long.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.840]   Right, a lot of deep work is not nearly as intense
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.660]   as a professional musician trying to push their skill
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.740]   to the next level.
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.820]   So yes, most deep work you could do
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.020]   much longer than four hours.
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.180]   Even deliberate practice,
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.500]   most people are gonna do longer than four hours
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.140]   'cause they don't do it nearly as intensely
[00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.220]   as professional musicians.
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.100]   I think most people are just not familiar
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.380]   about how cognitively intense real practice actually is.
[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.940]   In my book, "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.620]   I try to capture this with an anecdote
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.980]   where I went and spent time
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.660]   with a professional guitar player.
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.500]   And I wrote about what it looks like
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.700]   to watch a professional guitar player practice.
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.560]   In this case, the player, Jordan,
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.960]   Jordan Tice is his name.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.120]   Actually, he played at my wedding.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.920]   Jordan was practicing with such intensity
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.520]   that he would forget to breathe.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.000]   And then he would have a ragged gasp
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.120]   as he sucked in air, his body forcing to suck in air.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.120]   That's what it looks like when you're deliberate practicing
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.400]   at your full extent.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.960]   That you can't do more than four hours,
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.520]   but most people aren't anywhere near that level of intensity.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.300]   So typically what I tell people is,
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.860]   don't fret too much about these limits for deep work,
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.000]   numbers or thresholds, you're fine.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.320]   Just make sure you're doing deep work on a regular basis.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.640]   Don't be distracted, focus on the hard things,
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.640]   do that regularly and good things will come.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.800]   (upbeat music)
