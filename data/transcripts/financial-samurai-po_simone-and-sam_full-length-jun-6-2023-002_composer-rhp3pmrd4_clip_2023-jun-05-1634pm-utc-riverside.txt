[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.240]   It's Sam from the Financial Samurai Podcast and I have a special guest with me, Simone
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.240]   Stolzoff.
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.240]   Say hello.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.240]   Hi, Sam.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.240]   Nice to be here.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.800]   So, Simone is based in San Francisco and he recently wrote a book called The Good Enough
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.000]   Job with Portfolio Penguin Random House.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.440]   So, he's a fellow author and the subtitle is called Reclaiming Life from Work.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.800]   I love this topic because as you all might know, I left my day job in banking in 2012,
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.920]   my wife left her day job in finance in 2015 and we haven't gone back.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.200]   And so, every year that goes by, it's kind of like us looking from the outside in wondering
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.640]   what's going on with work and purpose and life and all that.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.880]   So, I'm here to have Simone tell me why he started writing this book, why he wrote this
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.560]   book and what he discovered on his journey.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.560]   Yeah.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.200]   So, first, thanks for having me on, Sam.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.120]   I've been a long-time listener, so it's a pleasure to be here.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.960]   There's sort of two ways into the book for me.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.360]   The first is I'm a journalist by training and for as long as I've been a journalist,
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.300]   my beat has been work, the workplace, how different companies operate, also the labor
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.400]   market at a broader scale.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.240]   And I was observing how central work had become to so many American, in particular, identities,
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.360]   senses of meaning and purpose in life.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.000]   And then the second is personal.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   So about four years ago, I ended up leaving the newsroom to take a job at this design
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.280]   agency called IDEO.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.360]   And in that sort of transition between being a journalist to being a designer, it didn't
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.320]   feel like I was choosing between two jobs as much as it felt like I was choosing between
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.520]   two versions of me.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.400]   And so I started wondering, so how did my identity become so entwined with my career?
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.720]   And I knew that it wasn't just me.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.180]   So in my research in the past few years, it's really exploring this question of how do we
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.360]   conflate who we are with what we do and why is this phenomenon particularly prevalent
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.720]   here in the US?
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.400]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.800]   So I didn't realize this until you pointed out because I'm wearing a hat from San Francisco
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.280]   University High School, which is a private school here in San Francisco.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.560]   And you attended this private school.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.040]   And the reason why I wear this hat is because I was a coach for three years from 2017 almost
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.680]   to 2020 when the pandemic hit.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.180]   And so going to SF University High School, you then went to Penn, an Ivy League school,
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.120]   and you studied creative writing.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.880]   And how long were you working after Penn until you went to Stanford for your master's in
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.880]   journalism?
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.240]   Yeah, I had about six years or so.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.280]   I guess I was like 27 when I went back to school to rebrand myself as a journalist.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.840]   And so I was really playing Goldilocks with careers in my 20s.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.280]   I moved right back to San Francisco.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.800]   In college, I studied creative writing and poetry, but also economics.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.560]   And so there was this tension between sort of the pursuit of art and the pursuit of commerce
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.560]   in my life.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.440]   I came back and I worked in advertising for a few years.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.760]   I worked in tech for a few years.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.240]   All the while trying to find a dream job, kind of a perfect job that encapsulates all
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.520]   of my interests.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.920]   And then I went back to grad school to square my hips towards journalism.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.600]   And so as a writer myself, I've written in the past how being a professional writer is
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.440]   very difficult.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.080]   To actually do it as a full-time job, it's not easy.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.440]   I think most people, just kind of like maybe actors, they have being an actor or writer
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.200]   as a part-time job and then they have a day job doing something else.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.720]   So as an attendee of some of these schools, which are all very expensive, how did you
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.240]   kind of reconcile the commerce part of it where you wanted to graduate and make money
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.760]   and also do what you wanted to do?
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.160]   How does one reconcile that?
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.920]   Because I'm a parent myself and I'm thinking to myself, "Wow, is college really going to
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.560]   cost $750,000 in 15 years for my daughter if she goes to a private school and gets zero
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.560]   scholarships?"
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.800]   Yeah, it's like one of the central tensions in my own life is how do I think about the
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:23.440]   security and stability that a stable, well-paying job might provide me with my own desire to
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.400]   pursue art or pursue things that feel more in line with the creative side of me.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.960]   Fast forward, there's a great irony in that leaving journalism, leaving the newsroom is
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.640]   actually the best thing that happened to my writing career.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.360]   It allowed me to write the book.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.440]   It allowed me to have a job that didn't expend all of my editorial energy and time.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.920]   But going back to college, especially at a place like Penn that's very pre-professional,
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.160]   a lot of my peers were in Wharton, in the business school.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.160]   They were very much on a track that provided a lot of legibility into what is the step,
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.720]   what is the next step, working at places like Goldman, like yourself, or maybe the big consulting
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.160]   firms.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:15.120]   It was hard to try and pursue something that was maybe more risky or less known in terms
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.760]   of what the outcome would be.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.680]   I think that's actually a big disservice for places that are really pre-professional like
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.640]   Penn is that there were a lot of dreams deferred.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.560]   Even for me, as a poetry student, I ended up trying to find the business application
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.960]   of poetry, which was copywriting.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.240]   And my friends that were urban studies or even theater kids ended up going to work for
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.640]   McKinsey or BCG because there was not real comfort with uncertainty.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.360]   I think we see that a lot, especially among young people.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.560]   Not to say that this is something that we should blame them for, especially coming out
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.560]   of a place like a private institution where you might have to assume a lot of student
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.880]   debt in order to graduate.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.080]   It makes sense to try and find lucrative, stable job opportunities on the other end.
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.480]   Thankfully, my parents helped out with college.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:11.000]   I paid for a portion of it myself but didn't graduate with any debt or loans.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.040]   That's probably what allowed me to have a little bit more of a meandering career.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.040]   Right.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.280]   That's the one thing.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.640]   I'm sure you remember your college application essays about creative writing, poetry, just
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.240]   the creatives, humanities, and stuff like that.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:34.000]   It seems like about 60% of the graduates from Penn go on to tech, consulting, finance.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.520]   I always wonder what happened to the idealism of youth because it seemed like it was crushed
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.240]   by the necessity of making money after college.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.440]   I like your story because you ended up pursuing what you wanted to do since high school at
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.920]   least, poetry and writing.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.400]   You did go to IDEO.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.520]   Is that a tech company or a design company?
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.720]   It's a design agency.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.040]   Its specialty is this thing called design thinking.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:09.840]   Essentially, it's a creative consultancy that helps create brands, helps create new products.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:16.000]   It really made a name for itself in the early days with designing the first Apple mouse.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.880]   It's a product design shop based in Silicon Valley.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.800]   Now, it's a global consultancy.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.120]   There's nine offices around the world.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.400]   It's fun, but it's also corporate.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.920]   It's a job where you're doing project-based work for clients.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.320]   I really enjoyed it there.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:40.120]   I think a lot of times people will look at the title of my book, The Good Enough Job,
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:47.400]   and think it's this slacker manifesto or this way for people to askew the traditional paths
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:53.400]   in favor of something that is more creative or aligned with your values.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.560]   I think there's actually a lot of value in working for a bigger company, especially early
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.840]   in your career where you can learn skills and get mentorship.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.160]   Some people do what they love for work.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.400]   Like me in this situation, I did what I had to do for work so that I could pursue the
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.960]   book on the side.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:17.440]   How did you decide to become a freelance writer and quit or leave your corporate job?
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.440]   Also, how did the book deal come about?
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.800]   Yeah, I mean, they go hand in hand.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.720]   I started writing the book in 2019 before the pandemic.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.240]   I was still working full-time.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.960]   I ended up working at IDEO through 2022, so I finished the manuscript while I still had
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.960]   a full-time job.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.720]   There's a certain tension there where I'm writing this book about the culture of overwork
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.680]   in America, and I did the lion's share of it while also working a job.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.760]   I took a book leave during my time at IDEO for four months to just focus on the book.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:56.080]   And then it wasn't until, I guess, the fall of last year, the fall of 2022, when I decided
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:02.600]   that, "Okay, I think I've amassed enough career capital and skills that I can work for myself,
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.840]   and I'll give this solopreneurship thing a try."
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.520]   But to be clear, I am a writer.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.160]   I write freelance articles.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.640]   I have been working on this book and hope to write another one, but I also have other
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:23.480]   gigs in my portfolio career that are more about economic stability.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:28.360]   And so even when I left my job in the fall, I took on a four-month consulting project
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.760]   that was a few days a week.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:38.160]   And I think in some ways I like that balance of having a set of different things that all
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.960]   mount up to my income, and it allows me to pursue different interests and balance some
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:49.400]   of the inherent risk in being a full-time writer with some of the economic stability
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.520]   of more paid corporate work.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.520]   Right.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:10:00.600]   It is one of those greatest challenges, leaving that corporate day job behind, the 401(k),
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.480]   the healthcare benefits.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.880]   Are you a freelancer now?
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.120]   Yeah, I'm a freelancer.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.080]   I recently started my own LLC.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:17.880]   And I think I'm cautious to give prescriptive advice about this is a path that everyone
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.880]   should pursue.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.600]   I think it's definitely not.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.640]   There's a lot of uncertainty and risk associated with it.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:30.880]   One of the things that I found is that even after leaving the grind of corporate work,
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.440]   I was often my own worst manager.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:39.600]   When you don't have necessarily the infrastructure around you to be able to separate work from
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:45.680]   life, it can be hard to not let work seep into all of the unoccupied space in your days.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.240]   And so especially in the first few weeks and months of working for myself, I had to be
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:56.240]   even more conscious about the time that I was on and off the clock.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:02.200]   I think there's this sort of dream that's painted about autonomy and a lack of Slack
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:09.000]   notifications or meetings that will enable freelancer independent workers to be able
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.080]   to just go on jogs at 11am and dance through the fields.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:19.920]   But in actuality, it can be that much more difficult when you're only rising and falling
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.480]   with your own professional accomplishments and you're solely responsible for all of
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.480]   your wins.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.040]   It's pretty scary.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.160]   There's nobody to blame or to award but yourself.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:37.280]   One of the ideas that I've come across or that I've proposed is that the FIRE movement
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.880]   in terms of financial independence retire early is becoming more obsolete.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.300]   I helped kickstart the movement back in 2009 when I was talking about trying to escape
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.360]   my corporate banking job and then I finally left my job in 2012.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:53.640]   But this year, I decided it seems like it's getting a little bit more obsolete because
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.480]   of so much more work flexibility.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:02.640]   I play pickleball nearby where you live and during the middle of the day from 10.30am
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:09.560]   to 1.30pm all the time and I see a lot of young folks ages 25, 35, 40 playing pickleball
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.120]   for like an hour and a half, two hours.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.680]   And I'm thinking to myself, "Man, if I had a day job that enabled me or allowed me to
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:20.120]   play pickleball for an hour and a half, two hours, take a nap and then just get my stuff
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:27.080]   done when I needed to, I don't think I would have wanted to have retired early at age 34
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.200]   to do my own thing."
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:34.260]   What are your thoughts about the evolution of work now post-pandemic since there seems
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.160]   to be so much more flexibility for knowledge workers at least?
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.200]   I think the pendulum swings both ways.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:48.720]   I think in the early aughts in 2010s, we were in this moment of work centricity and hustle
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.680]   culture and girl bossing.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:57.040]   I think the FIRE movement really provided an alternative vision for what work could
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:02.840]   be more of a means to an end as opposed to an end in and of itself.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:08.200]   And now I think we have movements like Quiet Quitting that I know you've talked about on
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:13.560]   the show in the past and the cultural cachet that comes with being anti-work or anti-capitalist.
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:20.960]   But I think a lot of people are learning that the nihilist work sucks point of view is not
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.960]   necessarily a recipe for fulfillment either.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:32.240]   Even someone like you who has had the opportunity to retire many years ago, there's still labor
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.520]   in your days through your writing and your podcast.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.920]   I think people want to find ways in which they can contribute to the world.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:47.880]   I think the great promise of remote and hybrid work is that workers can have a lot more control
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.720]   over how they get their work done.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:56.080]   I think that's one thing that gives me a lot of excitement and optimism about the future
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:01.280]   is that instead of using these proxy metrics like how much time you spend in an office
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:07.960]   chair as an indication of the type of work that you're doing, we're actually in a place
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:13.160]   where we can hopefully let the work speak for itself and managers are hopefully instilling
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.160]   more trust in their employees to get the work done when they want.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:22.840]   I think that's sort of the utopian vision of this future of work where people are able
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:29.120]   to design their days around when they have the energy to do work and they can get their
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.640]   work done on their own schedule.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:36.920]   But I think the risk of this is that if we pair this ability to work at any hour with
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:42.160]   this sort of capitalist understanding that if you're not somehow getting ahead, you're
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:48.760]   falling behind, it can drive people to overwork and be almost as dangerous as a manager that's
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.040]   making their employees work 60 to 70-hour weeks.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:58.640]   Yeah, it's quite a balance and it does seem like more and more companies are encouraging
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.960]   or demanding employees come back to work after the bear market in 2022.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.920]   Seems like I think Facebook met a just set after laying off another thousands and thousands
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:13.800]   of people, mandatory three days in the office from soon on.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.580]   But it always seems soon on.
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:20.480]   And here in San Francisco, it just seems like nobody really wants to go back to work because
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.920]   they're having such a good time or a better time with the flexibility, especially if you
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.480]   have children or if you have other things you want to do on the side.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:35.880]   Can you share some of stories of people you've encountered where people have been struggling
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:40.240]   with the idea of going back to work or actually leaving to be a freelancer?
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:45.760]   Yeah, I'll share one of the stories that I write about in the book because it rhymes
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.800]   with a lot of the stuff that you talk about both in your writing and on the show, which
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.920]   is a story of a Wall Street banker that I profiled.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.080]   His name is Kay He.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.040]   Some of the listeners might be familiar with him.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.320]   He has his own sort of community of people rethinking their relationship to work.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:07.600]   But in many ways, Kay represented the paradigm of sort of the American dream.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:13.320]   He was a Cambodian-American immigrant growing up, lower middle class in New York City.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:19.720]   He spent his high school years really working hard to try and get into a top college.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:25.160]   He was the valedictorian of his class, went to Yale for college, and then in college was
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.800]   trying to figure out, "Okay, what are the most lucrative potential job paths for me?
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.400]   I could be an engineer.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.400]   I could be a doctor.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.400]   I could be a lawyer.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.040]   I could go into finance."
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:41.120]   He chose the latter, went to work on Wall Street, rose his way up the ranks at BlackRock,
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:46.360]   became one of the youngest managing directors in BlackRock's history, was making seven
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.800]   figures before he turned 30 years old.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:55.720]   But it came to a head in his mid-30s when he realized that he was climbing a ladder
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.920]   that he didn't actually want to be on.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:03.080]   He looked up at the people above him at the org chart and asked himself, "Do I want their
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.080]   life?"
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.880]   And the answer was no.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:12.400]   And so he ended up leaving and going, it's in many ways the most cliche story of the
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.400]   book.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.400]   He goes to move to California.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.880]   He starts surfing every day.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.680]   He starts working for himself.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:23.720]   But I think the wisdom in his story is that on one end of the spectrum, you get people
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.440]   that are just listening to what the market values.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.640]   They're just trying to make career decisions based on what pays the most or what's the
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.680]   most prestigious or what might give them the highest status.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:41.440]   On the other end of the spectrum, you get people who are just making decisions based
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:46.200]   on what they themselves value without regarding what the market values.
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:51.160]   And that might drive people to say, take on a lot of student debt to pursue a graduate
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:56.720]   degree that might not lead to stable job prospects on the other end or to go all in to pursue
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:01.700]   art but become so preoccupied with how you're going to pay rent that you can't actually
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.720]   focus on the art that you want to create.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:08.520]   And so I think the upshot is that we have to take these things in consideration.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:13.400]   On one hand, what the market values, on the other hand, what we value and try and find
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:20.440]   work at their intersection because there are dangers to indexing too far on either extreme.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.040]   I agree.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.000]   And so in that story, I know K.E.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.320]   before, he has actually profiled Financial Samurai in the past and I definitely should
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:32.840]   get him on the podcast because I do have a question for him and that is about his path
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.220]   and his decision to actually hire people.
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.080]   One of the things I decided in 2012 was to hire nobody for Financial Samurai because
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.920]   I didn't want to manage anybody.
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:47.140]   I wanted the most simple, streamlined business, if you would call it, as possible so I could
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.440]   be free to do what I want.
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.400]   I work with my wife but that's fine.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.880]   And I do like his story a lot and definitely I should get him on the podcast.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:01.720]   But I do question his desire and he's living what he wants but I want to know why he decided
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:06.360]   to hire so many people and start the 401k process and all that he mentioned because
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.680]   that's a lot of work unto itself.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:17.240]   I'm wondering for you, Simone, why don't more people, once they get to a certain level of
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:23.120]   financial stability, let's say it's after 10 years, 15 years, maybe 20 years of working,
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.880]   if you're saving as a normal person, well, the average American is only saving like 5%
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.120]   to 7% but let's say you're above average and you're saving a little bit more and you're
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:36.760]   investing, why don't more Americans and more people in the world, workers, try to jump
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:44.360]   off that thing that they're doing that isn't giving them any joy to do something they want
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.360]   to do?
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.920]   Why don't more people take risks?
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.400]   I mean, I think there's a few reasons.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:55.720]   One is that in our country, I think part of the reason why work is so fraught is because
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.320]   the consequences of losing work are so dire.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:02.760]   It's not just your paycheck but it's often your health insurance, it's if you're an immigrant,
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.120]   your ability to stay in this country.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:10.720]   And so there isn't a very robust social safety net to catch you if something falls through.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:16.680]   The second is that there's this level of moving the goalposts.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:21.640]   We have this heat in the stick adaptation that gets us comfortable with these new lifestyle
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:26.920]   changes that we make in our lives and then we put ourselves into situations where we
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:31.200]   have to earn a certain level of money and there isn't much slack built into our financial
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.240]   systems.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:38.760]   There's this Harvard study that I'm sure you've referenced before about interviewing millionaires
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:43.720]   and they interviewed people that had $1 million in the bank and $2 million in the bank and
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:47.440]   $5 million in the bank and $10 million in the bank.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.920]   And they asked people, "How happy are you on a scale of one to 10?"
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:56.320]   People gave their answers and then they asked, "What would it take for you to get to 10
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.560]   out of 10?"
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:02.640]   And all people that they interviewed, no matter how much money they made, said that, "I would
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.920]   be happy once I have twice as much as I have now."
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.720]   And so there's this sort of keeping up with the Joneses element and this measuring stick
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.760]   that we hold ourselves to.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:19.280]   It's hard to understand what your level of enough is because the default here in the
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.280]   US is that more is better.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:28.680]   Yeah, I've been trying to solve that problem for a while on Financial Samurai and we can
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.600]   use 25 times expenses.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:36.240]   I use 10 to 20 times your income as your net worth target to feel like enough.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:40.520]   So let's say you make $100,000 and once you get 10 times that or a million, you start
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.120]   feeling, "Okay, I got some financial independence.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.120]   I got some momentum."
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:48.080]   And then once you get to 20 times or greater, you're set.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:54.160]   I feel strongly that you can do whatever you want and take those risks that you want.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.320]   But it is different for everybody.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.480]   And I do want to challenge people to think about how much is enough by going backwards,
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.040]   doing the calculations.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:06.680]   It's true, once you get there, you might experience, "Ah, the one more year syndrome to keep on
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.320]   working another year," or you might want a little bit more or you might want to have
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.280]   kids or something.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:20.400]   As a young, early 30s man in San Francisco, how do you view what is enough for you?
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:26.360]   Because this is one of the most expensive cities in America, if not the world, and you're
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:30.600]   on this journey of freelance and you eat what you kill.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.440]   It's a great feeling, the correlation with effort and reward.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:39.840]   How do you forecast or model out your future living in this expensive city?
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:46.960]   Yeah, I think it's definitely something that I'm considering on a daily, if not weekly,
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.200]   basis.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.600]   One of the things that I like about the framework of the book, the title is "The Good Enough
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.120]   Job."
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.360]   The idea with "good enough" is that it's subjective.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:01.920]   So for some people, a good enough job might be a job that earns a certain wage, or for
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:06.720]   others it might be a job that has a certain title or is in a certain industry.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.480]   And for someone else, it might be a job that gets off at a certain hour so that you can
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.300]   pick up your kids from elementary school each day.
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:19.440]   So for me, I think about the life I want to live as sort of the North Star.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:25.120]   And all my family and my partner's family are both here in the Bay Area, and so there
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:31.600]   is a certain level of financial responsibility that we have to earn a living in order to
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.600]   stay here.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:39.480]   And it wouldn't be responsible for us to, say, both quit our jobs and just travel full-time
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:44.800]   for multiple years if we also have these other goals, like starting a family and saving for
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.000]   college.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.880]   And so I don't have it in a science as much as an art, which is the art is that I want
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:56.560]   to start with my vision of a life well-lived and then think about what type of work or
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:01.080]   what type of income I need in order to support that vision.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:06.560]   And so even though that I'm taking a risk to a certain extent in working for myself
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:11.920]   and pursuing writing, I want to make sure that this is an ongoing conversation that
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.440]   me and my partner have.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:21.080]   And thankfully, she has a W-2 job, and we can sort of think about how we can rely on
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.120]   each other at different points in our life.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:27.560]   But even though I've written this book about right-sizing works placed in our life, I'm
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:32.440]   also not above the idea that I might return to the corporate world at some point.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.080]   I really believe in sort of the seasonality of work.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:41.380]   And right now, I'm in a season where I'm partnered with no kids.
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:44.160]   We have a pretty stable rent situation.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:51.880]   And so I don't need to necessarily optimize for the most income that I can make on a yearly
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:52.880]   basis.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.880]   But who knows?
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:58.160]   Maybe if we have some kids, it might change the calculation.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:04.000]   And I hope that the listeners take away that none of this advice is prescriptive.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.120]   It's different strokes for different folks.
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:11.440]   And especially even in my own life, I imagine that in different phases, I'll have a different
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.200]   calculus for what I need.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:18.720]   Yeah, it's hard to know what you don't know.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.600]   Can you go through an exercise now?
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:25.600]   Do you see a scenario where you can see your blind spot?
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.400]   By definition, it's hard to see your blind spot.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:35.240]   I'm 45, so I can kind of imagine your future a little bit because I left around 34 and
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.440]   then I'm a writer and I have this podcast.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:43.200]   Do you foresee a scenario that you cannot see is my question?
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:50.120]   I mean, I feel insecure about the choices that I've made in my career to a certain extent,
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:55.640]   especially when I'm comparing myself to a lot of my peers.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:02.160]   Most of my friends in college and even in high school have pursued very tracked, stable
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.160]   professions.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:09.560]   Even if it's not finance, it's something like medicine or law or have worked in tech for
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.880]   a number of years.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:17.720]   And the thing I try and remind myself is that I can't compare my insides to other people's
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:18.720]   outsides.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:26.080]   Although other people might have from the outside this sort of shiny veneer of economic
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:31.880]   stability and a lack of stress because of it, that's not necessarily my game.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.200]   That's their game.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:41.040]   And so I think one of the things that I wonder about is paying out of pocket for health care
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:49.880]   each month and is trying to write books, which if you calculate the hourly wage of writing
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:53.480]   a book, you're making basically pennies on the hour.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.540]   Are these things responsible?
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.540]   Not just for me.
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:03.800]   Obviously, I can center my own hedonistic desires and my love for writing, but I'm moving
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.220]   into a place in my life where it's not just about me.
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:14.320]   It's about me and my partner and my family and my ability to care for my parents.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:20.440]   And so I think my biggest blind spot, if you could call it that, is wondering whether I'm
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.000]   doing enough to plan for my future.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.300]   And I think for most people, that creates a lot of risk aversion where they say, "Well,
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:31.840]   because I don't know what the future holds, I might as well stay in this job that I hate
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.920]   for a long time."
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.080]   But there's actually something that Kay told me that I think has really stuck with me,
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:43.040]   which is it's actually riskier for his kids to be interacting with him in a job that he
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:48.480]   hates where it brings down his mood, where it makes his daily experience miserable, than
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:52.040]   to take the risk of trying to pursue something that's more value aligned.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.360]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:58.040]   I think a lot of people, something like 70% of people are disengaged from their jobs.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:02.480]   So if you're disengaged or you hate your job, you bring that mood back to your home and
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:07.200]   that could be like a virus that spreads to your loved ones who are innocent and that
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.960]   would be no good.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:12.920]   So I guess for you, there's two things here.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.840]   One is the good enough job where you want to, it's a subjective term where you want
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:21.160]   to do what you want, balance the commercial and your desires.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:25.520]   And at the same time, there's a comparison because we can't help but compare, but then
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.120]   unfortunately it makes us a little bit miserable sometimes because there's always someone better,
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.460]   more successful, richer, more famous, better looking, whatever.
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.720]   How do you reconcile that?
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:39.960]   What is a good enough job for you on your new journey and what would be the ideal situation
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.960]   for you in five years in terms of your writing career?
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:49.320]   Yeah, I think my own aspirations have changed a lot over the course of writing the book.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:54.080]   I came into it thinking that, "Okay, maybe I'll take some time, I'll write this book
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:29:00.000]   and then my aspirations are still to say rise up the corporate ranks or manage a team or
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.320]   be in the C-suite, what have you."
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.720]   And now I have a different North Star, which is that at least in the professional realm,
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.720]   I loved the process of writing books.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:13.240]   And so if I think about the pie chart of how I spend my professional life, I hope to spend
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:19.840]   a larger and larger proportion of my time on long form editorial or writing projects.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:26.600]   But in the interim, I hope that I can balance some of that with a few other things like
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:34.160]   teaching or consulting or paid writing that might help balance some of the uncertainty
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:38.000]   and instability of pursuing a path of being an author.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.720]   And so I think like many people that listen, I'm not just one note, both professionally
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.600]   and outside of my professional life.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:52.640]   Of course, I love writing, but I also love thinking about politics and I like collaborating
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:58.760]   with others on creative ideas and I love teaching and sharing what I know.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:03.400]   And so one of the things that I've enjoyed about pursuing this path thus far is that
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.240]   it allows me to have varied days.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:12.080]   Maybe in the mornings I spend a few hours working on my next book and then I do a few
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:18.440]   calls or podcast interviews like this and in the afternoon maybe teach a class and maybe
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.160]   tomorrow looks completely different from today.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:28.360]   But what I'm trying to hold on to is an awareness of how energized I feel throughout
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:34.200]   the day and hopefully in five years, I'm still doing things that allow me to be the
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.880]   person that I want to be.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:40.520]   That's sort of what I see as the goal of having a good enough job.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:44.160]   It's to have a job that supports the life that you want to lead.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.160]   Sure.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:52.400]   For those interested in reading The Good Enough Job, why should they read the book and what
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.280]   do you think they'll get out of the book after finishing it?
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:03.560]   So I came into the book with maybe a little bit more of a hot take about the dangers of
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:11.040]   work-centricity and how our culture in the US has become obsessed with work.
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:16.560]   The thing that I have enjoyed about the process is that my hot take tempered into something
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.880]   a little bit more mild.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:22.660]   I think there's this inclination, especially when we're thinking about careers and work,
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:26.520]   to either lionize or villainize our jobs.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.200]   There's people that say, "Do great work.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.520]   That's your impact in the world.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.960]   If you don't do what you love, you can never do great work.
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.680]   If you haven't found a dream job, keep searching," on one side.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:40.640]   Then there's the anti-work people that say, "Work sucks.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.840]   We have to burn it all down.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.160]   It's a necessary evil.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:48.960]   We deserve to get paid UBI from the government and to be able to do whatever we want with
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:49.960]   our time."
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.520]   I think the truth is not on either extreme.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.040]   It's something in the middle.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.760]   That's the core question of the book.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:02.080]   It's how do you pursue meaningful work without letting what you do for work subsume who you
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.080]   are?
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:08.280]   I think that's the best case that I can make for any potential readers.
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.200]   It's a book that is a mirror.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:15.800]   Hopefully through the stories of the different people that I profile, you'll see aspects
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:21.880]   of yourself and it'll force you to try and consider what relationship you want to have
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:27.240]   to your job, how work fits into your vision of a life well-lived.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.000]   It's very individual.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.880]   I think it happens on a person-to-person basis, but rarely do we have the opportunity to really
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:39.020]   reflect on where we are and where we want to go.
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:43.240]   In your book writing journey and your interview journey finding people, did you ever encounter
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:50.000]   anybody who actually had a lot of money, was financially independent, and then argued,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.760]   "Work sucks.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:55.560]   You should do what you want, be free, and do what you want."
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:59.800]   The irony of that story is kind of like maybe Warren Buffet saying, "We should all pay
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.960]   more taxes," yet he doesn't pay more taxes himself.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:08.320]   I'm trying to get that side of the story where people are that extreme.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.920]   Did you ever encounter anybody like that?
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.000]   I think it showed up in a few different ways.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.480]   There's a guy that I profiled recently in an article for The Atlantic that was an advertising
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:25.840]   executive and he rose up the ranks in advertising and was making well over six figures.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:31.960]   Then he decided to do something pretty drastic, which is leave the world of advertising that
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:37.880]   he had come up in and set a cap for the number of hours he works each week.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:43.640]   Instead of trading his expertise for more money as is customary in the US, he decided
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:49.200]   to trade his expertise and the career capital that he had amassed for more time.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.320]   He runs this thing called The Experiment where there's three precepts.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:55.120]   He only works 10 to 15 hours a week.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:34:00.160]   He only works on work that he finds personally meaningful.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:07.560]   He only works for companies that feel aligned with the type of change he wants to see in
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:08.560]   the world.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:16.800]   It provides such a counter narrative to how we're taught to think about work, which is
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.640]   the more you can make, the more you should make.
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:25.600]   Here's someone that said, "Okay, this is my level of enough."
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:30.440]   Then there's a lot of people, because of the nature of the book, I chose to focus on stories
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.480]   of people that had made some big change in their life.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:40.680]   I think there are a lot of people that work corporate jobs that maybe they don't enjoy,
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:48.200]   but they understand how their job allows them to pay for their material existence, support
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:53.400]   the people around them, and are willing to swallow the bitter pill of a job that isn't
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:58.960]   necessarily aligned with personal fulfillment each and every day because they can attach
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.120]   it to this wider mission.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:07.000]   I think that the course take would be, "Okay, we should all quit our jobs and try and find
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.920]   something that's more aligned with our values."
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:13.280]   In actuality, I don't think there's anything wrong with corporate work or well-paid work
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:19.560]   or work that is not necessarily fulfilling in every single moment, as long as you recognize
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:24.040]   that that's a conscious choice that you're making, as opposed to some default script
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:25.040]   that you've inherited.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.640]   Mad Fientist Yeah, it's tough.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:31.960]   I think about the movie The Matrix, plugging in, plugging out a lot.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:37.800]   It's very correlated to early retirement and doing what you want.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:42.120]   Sitting on the other side from employee to now potential employer, I've hired freelance
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.120]   writers before.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:47.200]   No, not writers, but people who help with my tech stuff.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:52.280]   It's an interesting viewpoint because the reason why we hire employees is so that they
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:57.400]   provide better value, more value, and we pay them less than the value that they can create.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.240]   Otherwise, we're not going to hire them.
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.080]   That's just capitalism.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:05.800]   I do want to understand more from other people.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:10.000]   When they listen to this podcast or read Financial Samurai, they're like, "Well, you've done
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   it.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.320]   You've got passive investment income.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:16.560]   Of course, you can say, 'Yeah, go play pickleball all day,' but that's not really relevant for
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:17.560]   me."
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:27.380]   I guess in conclusion, what are your thoughts on how people can be more methodical in choosing
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:31.880]   the life that they desire while balancing everything?
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:36.640]   Is there a time frame for you specifically where you're like, "Okay, this freelance thing,
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.080]   this writer thing isn't going to work out.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.240]   I'm going to go back to work"?
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:44.840]   Do you have any kind of framework to help people think about this balance a little bit
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:45.840]   more strategically?
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:52.800]   I think when we think about work-life balance, we often think about how we spend our time
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.800]   and our energy.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:59.760]   Rightfully so, that is one version of how work shows up in our lives.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:04.740]   One of the cases that I make in the book is about the value of diversifying our identities
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:05.740]   as well.
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:11.320]   Much as an investor benefits from diversifying the sources of their investments, we too benefit
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:16.960]   from having diverse sources of meaning and identity in our lives.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:22.240]   The idea of deprioritizing work is not very actionable.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:26.620]   Sometimes you think, "Okay, I can try and care less about my job, but what does that
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.400]   exactly mean?"
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:33.800]   The thing that I often try and instill in people is that on the other side of prioritizing
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:37.820]   work is prioritizing life.
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:44.000]   They aren't necessarily oppositional, but by taking an active role and investing in
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.080]   those other identities that exist within you, maybe it's pickleballer, but also it can be
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:53.080]   father or friend or citizen or neighbor.
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:59.860]   We can have a more diverse portfolio of our identity, which the research shows makes us
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.520]   more resilient in the face of adversity.
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:07.960]   This makes sense if you're attaching your identity to your job and it's a bad day at
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:11.920]   work, or your boss says something disparaging that can spill over into all other facets
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:12.920]   of your life.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.360]   But it can also create better workers.
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:20.360]   It can make people more innovative or creative when they have other interests or passions
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:25.120]   that are feeding their ability to think about problems in the office.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:29.080]   Perhaps most importantly, and the one that I really harp on in the book, is that it makes
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.240]   us more well-rounded people.
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:38.400]   It allows us to contribute to the world in ways that don't just lead to financial returns
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:42.200]   or creating economic value for your employer.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:48.200]   I think that's the thing that I really hope people take away, is that a work-centric existence
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:52.120]   doesn't just take our best time, it takes our best energy as well.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:57.440]   In order to cultivate other sources of meaning in your life, in order to really find other
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:03.720]   identities that exist within you, you need to invest in them with your energy.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:09.280]   Similar to a plant, it needs watering and time in order to grow.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.960]   That's how you gain a more diverse identity portfolio.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.660]   It's by making bets.
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:17.760]   It's by investing with your attention.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.240]   I love that.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.240]   Diversifying your identity.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.240]   I totally see that.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:25.720]   Imagine, folks, if you were all in on your career and you got laid off one day.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.400]   It would be devastating.
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:31.480]   But if you diversified your identity and said, "I am a worker.
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.480]   I'm a parent.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.480]   I'm a writer.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.080]   I'm an athlete.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.560]   I'm religious.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.280]   I'm faithful."
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:45.000]   That does help soften the blows and it creates much more variety in life and much more interest
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.400]   and excitement because we can only live one life.
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:51.800]   But if we can diversify our identities outside of work, that would be awesome.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:52.960]   So I totally agree with that.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.080]   Thank you for that perspective.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.280]   So Simone, it's been great talking to you.
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.640]   Thanks so much for your time.
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:02.160]   Where can listeners find your book and what's next for you?
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.320]   Yeah, thanks so much, Sam.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.120]   The best place to go is thegoodenoughjob.com.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:13.200]   That's where you can learn more about the book as well as find me on social media.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.240]   In terms of what's next, I'm not sure.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.000]   I think that's kind of how I like it.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.520]   I'm trying to get comfortable with that ambiguity.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:24.400]   I've started to think a little bit about a second book about the concept of doubt and
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.560]   how doubt shows up in our life.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:32.160]   But for now, I'm just going to take some time to rest and recover from the book tour and
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.800]   then we'll see what comes next.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:34.800]   All right.
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.480]   Well, take care and maybe I'll see you around the neighborhoods of San Francisco.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.480]   Sounds good.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:39.480]   Bye-bye.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:40.480]   That's good.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:40.780]   Bye-bye.
