My question would be, do you ever consider or advise stockpiling money and say a Roth IRA and waiting for a major market downturn to deploy that money? Or would, would your advice be just to deploy it every month when I put that, put the funds in the account?

[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:05.220]   R.A.s have a number of other things that make them really really useful they just mentioned you can take out your contributions income tax free so if you need the money back out you can get it out which is useful and there's no penalty tax on those taking the contributions out one of the other big benefits of R.A.s is they don't have any required minimum distributions so unlike traditional I.R.A.s which require you to start taking money out at the age of seventy and a half or even twenty and a half is a good thing to do.

So if you hire your children in your business, you want to make sure that you keep good books and records about their activities. You don't turn around and pay them $100 an hour for stuffing envelopes. You pay them a reasonable wage that you would have to pay anybody for.
