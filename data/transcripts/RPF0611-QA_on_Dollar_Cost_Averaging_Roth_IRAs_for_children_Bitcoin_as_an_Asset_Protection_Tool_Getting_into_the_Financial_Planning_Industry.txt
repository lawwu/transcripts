[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.740]   -Hi, Josh. Thanks for having me.
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.640]   Hey, my question is, as I'm currently actively investing
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.140]   in my 401(k)
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.720]   and have recently started doing some Roth IRAs,
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.460]   my question would be, do you ever consider
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.060]   or advise stockpiling money in, say, a Roth IRA
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.860]   and waiting for a major market downturn to deploy that money,
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.440]   or would your advice be just to deploy it every month
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.340]   when I put the funds in the account?
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.380]   -Would having cash reserves benefit you,
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.320]   or do you have other cash reserves?
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.120]   -So, I do have a six-month emergency fund.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.460]   -Okay. -It's not in any
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.060]   retirement account.
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.560]   -So, the statistically correct answer -- How old are you?
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.900]   -I'm 25. -Okay.
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.800]   So, the academically correct answer is this --
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.100]   you shouldn't try to time the market.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.200]   That's what all of the experts say.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.780]   That is what all of the research says,
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.980]   and I have no compelling arguments to go against that.
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.440]   So, the academically correct answer that I should give you
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.240]   is you should just put the money in each month as you earn it.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.260]   And so, that's the best course of action for you.
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.820]   And let me explain the reasons for it.
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.260]   Especially given your age, the chances of your ability --
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.620]   the chances of your being able to successfully predict
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.760]   what happens in the coming months,
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.300]   in the coming years, unless you're actively involved
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.900]   in the business of investing, are very low.
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.200]   Most people don't know.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.700]   They aren't going to be able to judge what's happening.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.100]   And so, you just dollar-cost average the money in.
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.180]   Each month, you invest a set amount,
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.740]   and when the markets are high, then you buy fewer shares.
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.220]   When the markets are low, you buy more shares.
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.620]   It basically works that way.
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.880]   So, in general, when you're in the accumulation phase,
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.880]   you should just simply invest each month on an ongoing basis.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.020]   Now, I want to give two caveats to that.
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.620]   One of the great benefits of a Roth IRA, and for clarity --
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.500]   so, that certainly applies to your 401(k) --
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.800]   because it's too hard with a 401(k)
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.060]   to change those amounts each month.
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.200]   And so, with your 401(k),
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.200]   you should just put the money in regularly every month.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.840]   And the only exception to that plan
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.700]   would be if you are choosing to front-load your 401(k)
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.820]   with your contributions early in the year
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.080]   to max it out early in the year.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.940]   But let's skip that for now.
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.760]   So, with a Roth IRA, however, I think there are two caveats.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.620]   One, one of the benefits of the Roth IRA
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.020]   is that you can take the money out,
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.660]   the contributions out, and use them for other things.
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.400]   And so, if you don't have a lot of other money,
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.140]   you don't have a lot of other investments,
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.540]   you don't have other forms of cash,
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.240]   savings, emergency fund, things like that,
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.100]   then I think the Roth IRA is a really nice place
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.540]   for some of those funds.
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.580]   Because if you put in your contribution each year,
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.080]   your $5,000, and you just keep it there,
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.720]   not invest it in a stock market fund,
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.520]   then if you needed to use the money for something,
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.620]   some kind of opportunity,
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.780]   young people often do things like buy houses
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.460]   or move to get a better job,
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.820]   or some kind of emergency,
[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.520]   you lost a job, you needed money,
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.100]   anything that you might need emergency funds for,
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.000]   then a Roth IRA is a really nice place
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.840]   to take that money out,
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.340]   as long as you're only taking your contributions out.
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.440]   And so, if you were going to use it in that way,
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.680]   then you wouldn't want it all to be invested.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.440]   And so, I think that that's not a bad use of the money.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.380]   And the second thing is,
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.320]   I think that when we're young,
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.520]   there are chances for there to be substantial market declines
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.820]   within a reasonable future.
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.020]   Now, you will have to look at a market to say,
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.860]   "Well, where are we?
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.700]   Are we overvalued?
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.700]   Are we undervalued?"
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.760]   But there's a good chance,
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.440]   in our investing lifetimes, being young,
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.740]   that there will be major corrections,
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.340]   major recession, major changes.
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.440]   And it'd be really nice to have a big stockpile of cash
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.180]   to be able to take advantage of that
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.140]   when there's blood in the streets.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.020]   So, if any of that applies to you,
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.980]   then I think you could make an argument
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.820]   for keeping the money on the sideline in a Roth IRA.
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.260]   So, two answers.
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.220]   One, academically,
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.740]   you're supposed to just dollar-cost average the money in,
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.180]   because all the data shows that you and I are stupid
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.020]   and aren't able to predict reliably
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.420]   when the market will correct and by how much it corrects.
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.300]   But I think there's a little bit of an adjustment
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.300]   that can be useful
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.620]   with regard to our own practical personal finances.
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.900]   - Perfect, thanks so much.
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:23.980]   I really appreciate your time.
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:24.820]   - My pleasure.
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.060]   At the moment, that seems to be the only call on the line.
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.100]   The next call that was lined up dropped off.
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.460]   So, I'm gonna answer a couple of questions
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.860]   that have come into my email inbox.
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.580]   Tim writes in, says, "Joshua, I enjoy your podcasts
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.020]   and your credit card debt lectures are helping me
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.200]   on my personal path to financial freedom.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.740]   I would like your opinion on setting up custodial Roth IRAs
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.220]   for our children.
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.540]   Maybe we start a modeling company
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.660]   just to contribute to them.
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.740]   I'm not sure that I would want my child to have a job
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.580]   so early in life.
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.420]   Just throwing ideas at you.
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.700]   Thank you for all that you do and keep up the good work."
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.140]   Regards, Tim.
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.820]   Well, Tim, I think that Roth IRAs for children
[00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.740]   are a wonderful idea.
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.840]   So, let me set a little bit of background information
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.980]   for those who are new to the concept.
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.080]   If a child has an earned income,
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.080]   that child is eligible to establish a Roth IRA.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.960]   Now, generally, Roth IRAs are some of the most
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.040]   well-loved retirement accounts
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.440]   because when you pay the income tax now,
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.440]   you can let the money grow into the long-term for retirement
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.600]   and not pay income tax when the money is distributed.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.600]   And so, if somebody invests $10,000 into a Roth IRA today
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.960]   and then the money grows to be $100,000,
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.600]   they can take out the $100,000 income tax-free
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.400]   when they choose to end retirement.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.360]   Roth IRAs have a number of other things
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.720]   that make them really, really useful.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.720]   As I just mentioned,
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.080]   you can take out your contributions, income tax-free.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.600]   So, if you need the money back out,
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.640]   you can get it out, which is useful,
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.880]   and there's no penalty tax
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.920]   on those taking the contributions out.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.520]   One of the other big benefits of Roth IRAs
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.240]   is they don't have any required minimum distributions.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.640]   So, unlike traditional IRAs,
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.400]   which require you to start taking money out
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.680]   at the age of 70 and a half,
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.240]   a Roth IRA can be left alone until death.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.960]   And then, even on death, under current tax law,
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.920]   that Roth IRA could be rolled over
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.000]   to the beneficiary of the account
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.960]   under what's called a stretch IRA,
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.320]   and the distributions can be stretched out
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.800]   over another lifetime,
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.640]   possibly your child or your grandchild's grandchildren.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.240]   And so, we could get a tremendous tax savings here
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.000]   with the use of a Roth IRA.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.080]   The downside to Roth IRAs for most adults
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.200]   is you pay the income tax currently,
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.800]   and that's why we have to do an analysis
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.040]   between contributing to a Roth IRA
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.320]   or contributing to a traditional IRA.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.240]   And it's my own opinion that most people
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.440]   will have a hard time having a higher income in retirement
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.840]   than they do while working.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.920]   So, in general, most people who are working,
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.820]   unless they're earning a small amount,
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.160]   most people should move in the direction
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.240]   of a traditional 401(k) contribution
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.800]   or perhaps a traditional IRA contribution
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.240]   rather than a Roth IRA.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.200]   Of course, we need to be careful
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.000]   with the flexibility of the Roth IRA.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.480]   That distinction is mostly important
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.480]   for the difference between contributing
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.120]   to a traditional 401(k) or a Roth 401(k).
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.640]   However, for a child, generally,
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.280]   children aren't going to be earning enough money
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.720]   where they're going to owe any income tax on the money.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.000]   It's not unusual for a child
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.840]   to be able to earn several thousand dollars per year,
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.920]   and at that rate,
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.040]   they're not going to be paying any income tax.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.040]   Now, even that problem is solved.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.640]   And the benefits of this type of account
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.800]   are really, really incredible.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   Let's do a little math for scenario.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.460]   Let's say that your child puts $5,000 this year
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.060]   into a Roth IRA, and they're five years old.
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.120]   Well, fast forward,
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.880]   let's give it a time horizon of, say, 80 years.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.240]   So, an 80-year time horizon.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.760]   Let's say that they invest the money aggressively,
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.900]   and net of fees, 'cause there's no taxes here,
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.760]   net of fees, let's say they earn 8% on the money.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.820]   And they start with,
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.320]   well, let's start them with $5,000 today,
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.100]   and no further contributions to the account.
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.520]   Well, in 80 years,
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.520]   that $5,000 contribution could be worth $2,359,000
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:17.120]   under those assumptions.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.840]   80 years invested at 8% is $2.3 million.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.000]   And that $2.3 million, under current tax law,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.680]   would be received income tax-free.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.080]   Now, here's what's cool about it.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.800]   Let's say that your child never spent that money themselves,
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.120]   and they just left the money in the Roth IRA,
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.720]   and pretend you had an additional 80 years
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.080]   for that initial $5,000 contribution.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.360]   So, let's change our timeframe now to 160 years.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:49.000]   And theoretically, you could be talking about $1.1 billion
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.720]   with that simple $5,000 contribution
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.620]   if those assumptions continued.
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.960]   Now, there are a bunch of really big assumptions
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.780]   in that number.
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.800]   First of all, the investment rate of return.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.160]   Number two would be that tax codes stay the same.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.120]   It's hard to imagine that tax law will stay the same
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.400]   for such an extended period of time.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.440]   There's a good bet that by that time,
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.400]   the US American empire will have dissolved,
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.680]   and there'd be something entirely new.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.560]   That'd be my guess, but who knows?
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.520]   You never know about these things.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.720]   So, the concept is there,
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.360]   and it's a really powerful concept
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.120]   for those who can take advantage of it.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.800]   Well, how does a child make a Roth IRA contribution?
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.800]   The child has to have wages.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.620]   They have to have earned income
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.780]   because your ability to contribute to a Roth IRA
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.220]   is based on your earned income.
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.040]   That means they can't be the beneficiary
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.260]   of an account that's paying them money.
[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.780]   They can't be the beneficiary of a trust
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:41.900]   that's paying them money.
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.380]   They have to have earned income,
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.420]   and then that income has to be reported on a tax return.
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:51.420]   So, what most parents will do
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.080]   is they will gift their child an amount equivalent
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.180]   to their earned income.
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.120]   So, let's say a child can put together an income
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.420]   of three or four or $5,000 in a year.
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.420]   In 2019, the Roth IRA contribution limits
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.500]   are gonna go up to 6,000 bucks
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.620]   for anyone under 50 and a half.
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.220]   So, at 6,000 bucks, let's say they earn $6,000.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:18.600]   Well, if you as a parent can give your child $6,000,
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.900]   then you can do two things.
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.860]   They earn the $6,000, and you give them $6,000.
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.780]   Now, they have $12,000.
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:28.980]   They contribute $6,000 into their Roth IRA,
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.660]   and that allows them to have that account start to grow,
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.740]   start to build, and it is going to be available
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:35.860]   for them in the future,
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.580]   and then they spend the other $6,000
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.420]   to do whatever has been agreed upon between you and them.
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.300]   It's one of the more powerful solutions.
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.140]   And even as we've talked about asset protection,
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.360]   that account is protected from the claims of their creditors
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.940]   under their local state law.
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.060]   Some states better than others, but that's useful.
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.420]   It's flexible, and it has great tax benefits.
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.620]   So now the problem is this.
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.400]   How do you get the five or $6,000 into the account?
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.620]   You gotta have the child earn wages.
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.280]   And here's where the trouble is,
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.340]   because how do you actually get wages
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.000]   for a one-year-old child?
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.660]   What can a one-year-old child actually do
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.100]   that could earn them wages?
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.980]   And that's where Tim mentions modeling.
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.540]   It's probably one of the very few things
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.360]   that you could imagine a one-year-old doing
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.220]   and getting wages for is modeling.
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.340]   So I don't know exactly how to do this for a one-year-old.
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.260]   Let's talk about modeling.
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.460]   Is modeling legitimate?
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:33.300]   I think so.
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.460]   Of course, there are models everywhere,
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:35.980]   child models everywhere.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.180]   But remember, you're gonna have to actually
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:39.360]   have the child earn money.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.340]   So it's not enough just to set up a modeling company.
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.620]   They have to actually get income from the modeling company,
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.340]   which means actually selling modeling contracts
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:51.260]   or signing business in some way.
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.660]   So you have to actually get income
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.500]   into the modeling company.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.300]   And here at Radical Personal Finance,
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.580]   we try to stay away from the shady stuff,
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.540]   try to stay away from the backhanded deals
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.740]   where you go to a friend and offer them money
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:05.980]   to hire your child as a model.
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.500]   There's no need for that.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.060]   And so modeling is about the only thing
[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.220]   that a one-year-old could conceivably do,
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.140]   at least that I have come up with.
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:17.020]   But still, you have to actually legitimately come up
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.140]   with clients for that child.
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.340]   Now, I'm not aware of this area ever actually being
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.660]   driven very hard by the IRS.
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.660]   So it's probably a little bit looser than some other areas.
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.760]   The biggest concern by the IRS usually involves
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.400]   those who have their own business hiring their children.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.100]   And usually the concern is not the child's
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.740]   Roth IRA contribution, usually the concern
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.880]   is the deduction on behalf of the business.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.460]   So if you hire your children in your business,
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.500]   you wanna make sure that you keep good books and records
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.780]   about their activities.
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.700]   You don't turn around and pay them $100 an hour
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.100]   for stuffing envelopes.
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.980]   You pay them a reasonable wage
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.520]   that you would have to pay anybody for stuffing envelopes,
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.620]   and then you keep records on the number of hours
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:00.500]   that your child works.
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.260]   You have them fill out and submit a time card,
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.860]   and you keep good books and records
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:06.100]   if you want that deduction to stand
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.500]   under the scrutiny of an audit.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:11.060]   But even so, I'm not aware of any IRS scrutiny
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.860]   of these Roth IRA contributions,
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.940]   but it's still worth in your best interest to do it right.
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:20.780]   So in summary, these plans are a wonderful solution
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.300]   for transferring money from a high taxpayer
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.660]   to a low taxpayer, and setting something up
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.420]   that's really, really good for children.
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.620]   I think all parents and grandparents
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.220]   should think about what can be done.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:37.420]   And I think that Roth IRAs should be considered
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:40.640]   by anybody who has earned income.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.540]   And you should look around within your family
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.740]   and your friends, and you should consider what can be done.
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.540]   How can we use an earned income
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.300]   and make sure that Roth IRA contributions are made?
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.620]   If, for example, if you have a family member that you trust,
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:56.260]   let's say that you have a parent or a grandparent yourself,
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.320]   and you can't, and let's speak to Tim.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.160]   Tim, here's an idea.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.940]   So pause for a moment.
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.040]   First, if you can figure out how to pay money
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.860]   to your children, do it.
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.540]   And then that helps them to have the earned income.
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.300]   And I think that's a really good idea.
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.420]   If you're self-employed, hire your children.
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.420]   Help your children to get businesses, get jobs.
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.620]   And I think it's also,
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.020]   I don't think a one-year-old necessarily
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.860]   needs to be put on the factory line,
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.780]   but I think it's really important for a seven-year-old,
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.020]   an eight-year-old, a nine-year-old,
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.700]   and a 10-year-old to earn income.
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:26.980]   And so even if that means
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.220]   you start a little side business yourself,
[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.440]   and you take on some clients mowing lawns,
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.260]   and they start to work with you,
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.140]   doing the raking or trimming the hedges
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.300]   or whatever those things are so they can earn money,
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.380]   that's really important for them to learn how to work
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.060]   and also to create that earned income.
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.940]   Now, let's deal with a harder problem.
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.360]   Let's say you can't contribute that money
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.020]   to your child's Roth IRA.
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.100]   Here's something that's good.
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.460]   It's not as great, it's not the best, but it's still good.
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:52.780]   Look around in your family tree
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.780]   for a family member with earned income
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.420]   where that earned income is not currently being used
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.860]   for making Roth IRA contributions.
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.740]   So let's say that you have a grandparent,
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.260]   that the child has a grandparent, you have a parent.
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.440]   And this can work out really beautifully sometimes,
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.100]   even in the phase of life that a grandparent might be.
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.220]   It's not unusual for a 50-year-old
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.380]   or a 60-year-old to be a grandparent.
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:20.180]   And if that grandparent can establish their own Roth IRA,
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.680]   but then have it earmarked for the child,
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.940]   with the child as a beneficiary,
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.820]   then now that grandparent can get, say,
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:32.680]   potentially 30, 40, maybe 50 years of investing done
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.880]   in that account, and then the child
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.460]   can be the beneficiary of it.
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.020]   So if you're looking to fund an account
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.980]   for your brand new baby, you're not gonna be able
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.780]   to come up with earned income to be able to do it then.
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.040]   So until you can get earned income,
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.500]   you gotta go for another plan.
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.460]   So my suggestion is go to your parents,
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.100]   and if you trust your parents,
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.260]   make a deal with your parents.
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.260]   Say, "Listen, Dad, Mom, you're over the age of 50,
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:58.260]   "so therefore I can give you 2019 $7,000."
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.660]   And just make your parents a $7,000 gift.
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.860]   Remember, that's a non-taxable gift.
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.460]   There's no tax consequences there.
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.660]   Anybody can give anybody else $7,000
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.740]   without any records being created.
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.140]   Give your parents a $7,000 gift,
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:19.140]   and then have your parents open a Roth IRA for themselves,
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.740]   and then have them designate one of the children
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:26.540]   or as the beneficiary of the account.
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:31.280]   Now, this will give you a good start on the tax benefits,
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:35.840]   because you'll have tax-free contributions and buildup
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.520]   until the date of your parents' death.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.800]   And then at that point in time,
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.760]   the Roth IRA can be turned into a stretch IRA,
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.480]   and those distributions can be made
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.420]   over the expected lifespan of the child.
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.200]   That's really, really good.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.000]   The only risk here is that you don't have any control
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.280]   of the assets.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.240]   So in this case, you still have your parents
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.440]   will have control of the account.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.360]   So if you don't trust your dad or your mom,
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.840]   remember, they could just,
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.240]   when you give them the $7,000 gift,
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.920]   they could drain the Roth IRA
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:11.840]   and go and spend the money on themselves.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.480]   But as long as you have a trustworthy relationship there,
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.880]   then things will be good.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.080]   And then you have to think also about
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.000]   how are those accounts protected
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.320]   from the claims of your parents' creditors,
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.000]   and that's where everything we've been talking about
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.560]   with an asset protection case here would be important.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.600]   So you'd wanna understand,
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.360]   let's say that your parents go bankrupt,
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.880]   or let's say that your parents die and have a lot of debt.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.360]   How will those assets be treated by the creditors?
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.840]   In general, because that Roth IRA
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.680]   has the beneficiary designation,
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.200]   it will be able to pass simply to the parent's beneficiary,
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.720]   and in most states, it will have some form
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.840]   of asset protection on the account.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.120]   So I think this is a fairly safe approach.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.820]   Not perfect, not bulletproof, you have to trust your parents,
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.560]   but most parents, most grandparents
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.440]   are not gonna raid their kids' Roth IRA accounts.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.840]   So this is very useful.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.880]   And always remember that,
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.400]   when you have to fund one of these accounts,
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.720]   you may not be able to contribute.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.040]   For example, your income might exceed the Roth IRA limits,
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.200]   but your parents might be able to contribute,
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.640]   as long as they have earned income,
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.680]   or an uncle might be able to contribute,
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.720]   or a family member, et cetera.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.200]   So whenever you're trying to get money into an account,
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.760]   a Roth IRA account, an educational savings account,
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.800]   a 529 account, just look around the family tree
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:26.000]   and see where it might be able to be done.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.840]   529 accounts are another obvious example.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.160]   There are many wealthy parents
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.880]   who can just simply give the contributions
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.880]   to their own parents, and then their own parents
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.200]   will establish the 529 account
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.600]   for the benefits of the children.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:42.080]   100% legal, perfectly reasonable, simple and easy to do,
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.320]   and with the exceptions of the risks that I pointed out,
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.760]   I think that goes a long way towards solving your problem,
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.360]   and doesn't leave you sitting in front of an IRS auditor
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.480]   trying to defend the idea
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.840]   that your one-year-old deserves $100 an hour
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.760]   for stuffing envelopes.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.620]   That's fine at six, that's not at one.
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.280]   So hopefully that'll get you through the first few years
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.400]   until your child can have their own earned income.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.240]   And remember also,
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.680]   those ideas are not exclusive one to another.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.940]   You can gift your child an amount of money
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.360]   equal to their earned income
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.000]   so that they can make Roth IRA contributions,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.540]   and then you can also gift your parents an amount of money
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.680]   equal to the Roth IRA contribution limits
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.560]   so that your parents can contribute to a Roth IRA
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.020]   for the benefit of their children.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.000]   Now, I don't think the tax law is gonna stay the same
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.880]   as this, but think of if, this is the concept,
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.080]   meaning I think the tax laws will change at some point,
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.080]   and you won't be able to do this into perpetuity.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.800]   But if each grandparent invested for 40 years,
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.880]   and then when they died,
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.160]   they left that account to their grandchild,
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.880]   there's a lot of tax-free growth and buildup
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.720]   that can happen in those accounts.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.200]   Now, finally, you could take that,
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.840]   and you could go even beyond, open up a checkbook LLC,
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.080]   have coordinated investing among their IRA accounts.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.440]   Those of you who are in that world and kind of sophisticated
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.680]   you could search into that, but that's enough.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.440]   Even if you just put it in stocks, it should work out well.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.560]   Next question comes in from Brett, Brett writes in and says,
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.200]   "Joshua, I recently discovered your podcast,
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.620]   "and I've really been enjoying your latest series
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.160]   "on asset protection.
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.160]   "As part of your deep dive,
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.120]   "would you mind looking into the role Bitcoin could play
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.960]   "in regards to asset protection?
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.280]   "After listening to your podcast,
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.980]   "I thought that a perfectly logical option
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.780]   "would be to liquidate all non-exempt attachable assets,
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.780]   "source Bitcoin from an OTC desk,
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:21.920]   "and self-custody in a hardware wallet.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.780]   "There's a learning curve and some technical challenges,
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:25.400]   "but I'm wondering what the legal ramifications
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.400]   "of taking an action like that might be.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.240]   "The benefits appear hard to ignore.
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.080]   "Something to think about.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.080]   "Thanks for a great podcast, Brett."
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.400]   I thought this was a really interesting question.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.320]   Now at the core of the question,
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.800]   it's simply a matter of secrecy.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.280]   The question is, can I use tools
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.200]   such as the modern cryptocurrency tools,
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:49.860]   can I use those tools to generate secrecy around my actions?
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.800]   Now if you were to go back a few decades,
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.740]   you would find that secrecy was much easier to find
[00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.540]   in your banking affairs.
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:59.860]   You had the whole idea and concept
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.260]   of a numbered bank account, a numbered Swiss bank account.
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.900]   You know, this idea, and it was real,
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.620]   that somehow maybe a Swiss banker
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:08.760]   might show up at your house
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.420]   and you hand over a briefcase full of cash,
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.000]   and then they go and put that in your account,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.740]   and there's no way to trace the money.
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.580]   Unfortunately in the modern era,
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:22.520]   bank secrecy seems virtually impossible to find.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.920]   There've been a number of really problematic issues,
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.140]   and I'm particularly bitter about this,
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.320]   which you hear in the tone of voice,
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.080]   but the first major wrecking ball
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.560]   that happened to bank secrecy was the Patriot Act.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.680]   In the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.600]   against the United States,
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.840]   the United States government passed
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.680]   the so-called Patriot Act.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.480]   And I consider this one of the worst things
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.380]   I ever in my life supported.
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.900]   I was a fool in those days,
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.420]   and I kind of had this idea, rah, rah, patriot, blah, blah,
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.380]   blah, and I didn't know what was in it,
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.380]   and I didn't listen to anybody
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.100]   who talked about how awful it was.
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.500]   And today I'm just so embarrassed of that
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.580]   because Patriot Act is one of the worst pieces
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.540]   of legislation that has ever been passed
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.940]   in the United States of America.
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.820]   Because basically what it did was it caused
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.620]   the US government to enroll or enlist
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:16.440]   or to hire without pay the entire financial industry
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.660]   to be unpaid spies for the US government.
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.260]   So when I became a financial advisor,
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.980]   I was trained on the know your customer laws
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.020]   and all of the anti-money laundering laws, et cetera.
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.420]   And so basically the US government, again,
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.260]   recruited anybody in the financial industry
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:34.180]   and forces everyone who is in the financial industry
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.900]   to work as unpaid spies for the US government.
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:41.820]   It got worse in 2010 with the Foreign Account
[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.220]   Tax Compliance Act that was passed, FATCA,
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.760]   where now not only did the US government require
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.720]   all the banks and financial institutions
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.300]   and insurance companies in the United States
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.480]   to be their unpaid spies,
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.180]   but now the US government forces all global bankers
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.960]   who wish to do extensive business within the United States
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.120]   to be their unpaid spies.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.100]   And so all bankers are required around the world
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.560]   to find out somebody's country of origin,
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.740]   where they're from, and if that person is a US citizen,
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.480]   then those bankers are required to send
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.180]   to the US government all of the information
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:18.540]   about the accounts that are held by that US citizen,
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.880]   and then all of the transactions
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.520]   and the information in those accounts.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.720]   And this was one of the problems
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.960]   where it became very difficult
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.300]   to open an offshore bank account,
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.640]   because many banks, rightly so, said,
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.240]   "Listen, the cost of complying with this law
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.500]   "is utterly ridiculous.
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.680]   "We're not gonna do your dirty work for you without pay."
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.460]   And they just simply stopped accepting US citizens
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:38.440]   as their customers.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.000]   Many US citizens lost their accounts,
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.040]   or basically had their accounts closed,
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.180]   and the bank said, "Come get your money.
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.280]   "We're done with you."
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.840]   And it became much harder for US citizens around the world
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.820]   to open their bank accounts, open bank accounts.
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:55.400]   Now, I find that entire thing unfortunate,
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.320]   but the problem is there is, as best I can determine,
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:02.240]   zero public support for changing any of those laws.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.700]   All a US elected representative has to do
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.760]   is wave the flag of terrorism or safety
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.320]   and/or money laundering, or we gotta fight the drug war,
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.200]   and people will give up every bit of their civil liberties
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.920]   and just happily trade it all in for some esoteric idea
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.560]   that somehow we're besting the drug war.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.280]   It's absurd, but that's the world we live in,
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.480]   so bitter rant over.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.440]   Now, in the modern world, what do you do?
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.320]   It's very tough, if not impossible,
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:32.320]   to open a purely, actually secret foreign bank account,
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.360]   but yet the world of cryptocurrency
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.800]   does offer some really intriguing opportunities here,
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.360]   and that's what Brett's talking about.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:45.360]   And in essence, he's profiled a way to purchase Bitcoin
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:50.880]   with an anonymity, and then simply you can hold it
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.880]   in a physical hardware wallet
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.120]   that is designed simply to hold the Bitcoin.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.040]   And so the idea is you're not doing business
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.480]   within the banking system.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.180]   As long as you can make that transfer
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:01.920]   into the cryptocurrency system
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.000]   in an anonymous and private way,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.560]   then now you have all your assets held secretly.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.400]   That's the basis of his idea.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.420]   So let's talk about that.
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:15.040]   Is secrecy valuable?
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.800]   Absolutely, yes.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.600]   As I've discussed, secrecy is a very useful primary defense
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.840]   in asset protection planning.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.200]   In bringing privacy and secrecy
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.720]   around your financial affairs will protect you massively
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:34.000]   from the claims of your creditors.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.720]   It really will, because it will help you to be,
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.760]   no one will know your wealth.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.200]   It helps you to be a smaller target.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.580]   So is secrecy valuable?
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.160]   Is secrecy legal?
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.280]   Yes, as long as you don't falsify information,
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.600]   and that's where Bitcoin
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.960]   or other cryptocurrency transactions could be helpful,
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.440]   because the idea or concept behind Bitcoin
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.480]   is you can verify the transaction externally,
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.120]   so you don't have to prove who you are
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.420]   to a certain institution.
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:06.000]   It is possible to buy Bitcoin anonymously, secretly.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.400]   And have you broken any laws?
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:11.640]   No, there's no laws broken by doing that secretly.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.620]   So the legal answer to Brett's question here,
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.840]   when he says, "I'm wondering what the legal ramifications
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.980]   "of taking an action like that might be,"
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:23.340]   there are no legal ramifications for taking that action.
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:28.060]   There are some significant potential risks,
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.340]   such as Bitcoin price collapsing,
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:34.000]   or such as Bitcoin becoming technologically outdated,
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.080]   what's the word that means?
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.280]   Obsolete, technologically obsolete.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.160]   Bitcoin in many ways is technologically obsolete
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.240]   compared to some of the newer cryptocurrencies
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.560]   that have been developed to solve specific problems.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.740]   Who knows how this market will shake out?
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.840]   That's a hard question to answer,
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.560]   and I don't wanna get down that sidetrack,
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.940]   but there's no legal problem for doing what you've done.
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:59.480]   You can put your assets into anything,
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.300]   just like you can take all of your assets out of the bank,
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.600]   you can go and buy lottery tickets with them.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.720]   It's perfectly legal to do, lot of risk there.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.600]   Now, where does the legal problem come in?
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:15.600]   Well, first, of course, if you don't pay taxes
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.680]   on your Bitcoin transactions,
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.360]   now you have a significant potential problem.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.880]   And this is where it's really a problem
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.320]   if you are a US citizen.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.680]   It probably wouldn't be such a big problem
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.480]   if you were a citizen of Iceland,
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.840]   or if you're a citizen of Sweden.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.640]   Iceland, or if you're a citizen of Kenya.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:40.120]   Iceland and Sweden and Kenya don't spend billions of dollars
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.560]   maintaining a global police presence.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.240]   Iceland and Sweden and Kenya, to my knowledge,
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.320]   don't read every email in the world,
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.880]   don't record every cell phone call that's made in the world,
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.560]   don't read every text message in the world.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.160]   They're not the world's bullies
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.320]   'cause they're not the world's superpower.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.520]   And so Iceland and Kenya and Sweden,
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.680]   their taxing authorities wouldn't necessarily have access
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.600]   to all that information.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.400]   The US government does.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.840]   And so you play a very dangerous game
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.160]   when you start to deal in that world and not report taxes.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.800]   Now, I don't think that the NSA
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:18.640]   actively sends information over to the IRS necessarily.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.360]   I haven't seen evidence of that.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.000]   But I would not be at all surprised
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.600]   to read in the newspaper next week that that did happen,
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.240]   that that does happen.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.960]   So you're dealing with a very dangerous game
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.760]   if you go up against the US government.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.600]   And that's not a game that I would want to play.
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.520]   I try to play nice with bullies and follow their rules
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:37.680]   unless I think I can defeat them.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.520]   And since there's no chance
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.800]   of my defeating the US government,
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.080]   I'm gonna play by their rules.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.920]   They are the world's police force.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.040]   So you gotta think of that.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.760]   The second problem you face is
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.960]   you don't have any legal protection in a court of law
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.600]   with what you have decided.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.320]   And for all of its faults and for all of the problems,
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.640]   the US court system does work somewhat predictably.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.960]   And the laws that are erected,
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.720]   as long as you're operating within those laws,
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.080]   they're fairly stout.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:11.840]   And so you don't want to run the risk of perjuring yourself
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.240]   by denying the existence of all of your assets
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.720]   in your hardware wallet.
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:18.320]   Now, that secrecy will help you to stay out of court.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.320]   But if you're ever in court,
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.160]   if that secrecy is ever pierced,
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.920]   and you're ever in court, and if you lose a lawsuit,
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.440]   well, now, under penalty of perjury,
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.000]   you are required to undergo a debtor's examination.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.320]   You're required to answer all of the information
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.960]   asked about you and about your financial affairs
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.720]   so that your creditor can know where to go
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.800]   and look for the information.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.240]   And so at that point in time,
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:47.440]   if you do what you've done here,
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.800]   and if you lie about it,
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:52.880]   there's a good chance that you'll go to prison.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.720]   Now, you say, well, if they prove it, yes.
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.840]   But to do that without any history,
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.920]   without any train of affairs,
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.640]   would either have to be, number one,
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.480]   very swift, done with very small assets.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.880]   You can't put $10 million without stretching it out
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.920]   into multiple transactions, et cetera.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.160]   And it would have to be perfect,
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:15.120]   absolutely perfect with covering your technological tracks.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.240]   It's not a risk that I would take.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.360]   No, maybe you would.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.080]   It's not a risk that I would take.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:25.080]   And more importantly, it's not necessary, in my opinion.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.960]   All of the tools and strategies
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:31.080]   that I have been talking about are entirely legal.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:34.240]   And as long as you do things in advance,
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.960]   the court will respect, under the proper law,
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:42.080]   the court will respect the constraints of those,
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.200]   their actions will be constrained
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.760]   by the legal process that you followed.
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:51.680]   And so your solution would be cheaper,
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.840]   but it's not nearly as good as an offshore trust.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.920]   Properly documented, properly put in place.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:01.280]   Because an offshore trust, a good offshore trust,
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.040]   built well, gives you the ability to fully
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.280]   and truthfully answer that debtors examination
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.800]   and avoid going to jail.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.360]   Which is one of my number one goals in life,
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.600]   is avoid going to jail.
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:16.800]   And secondarily, it will stand up to the courts.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:22.720]   So you have to make your decisions as you see fit.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.520]   And I think your plan is entirely appropriate
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.400]   for a good way for you to hold your crypto,
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.760]   if that's what you wanna do.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.280]   It's just as appropriate as the average person
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.800]   taking out cash and keeping cash out of the bank.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.880]   It's just as appropriate as the average person
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.080]   going out and buying gold coins.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.800]   You can buy gold coins anonymously
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.320]   and you can bury them in a coffee can
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.880]   in somebody's backyard.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:46.240]   And it gives you tremendous safety and tremendous privacy.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:50.600]   But just always be careful that you don't transgress
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.800]   against that law and potentially perjure yourself.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.200]   Because especially if you were a high profile person,
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.720]   it's not a game that I would wanna play.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:03.120]   It just doesn't make sense to me to take those legal risks.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.120]   I think you're better served, leave the United States,
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.400]   go get another citizenship or announce your US citizenship.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.160]   That gets you out from underneath
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.200]   the thumb of the US government.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.960]   Choose a country that's not gonna chase you
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:17.600]   around the world and spy on all your emails.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.480]   Choose a better country and then go ahead
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.400]   and you'll enjoy certain benefits there.
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.400]   So your mileage may vary, but I hope that's helpful
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.040]   in terms of thinking about the problem
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:29.520]   and considering some different ways to solve it.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.680]   Let's do one more today.
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.080]   Christina writes in with some questions
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.040]   about becoming a certified financial planner.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.880]   She writes this and says this.
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:37.720]   I've been thinking over the last year or so
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.360]   that I wanna move into the world of finance
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.640]   and I pretty much decided that I wanna be
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.440]   a certified financial planner.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.920]   But I'm not sure exactly how to make the transition.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.480]   I currently work in data analysis doing marketing
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.000]   and our company is very small.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.560]   Three people plus a couple of developers.
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.600]   So it'd be kind of terrible if I just up and quit.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:53.720]   But I've been helping a few friends
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.560]   with their finances all year and it's really fun.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.000]   And I know I'd rather be doing that all day.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.520]   So I guess I have a few questions if you don't mind.
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.720]   Can I get started as a financial planner officially
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.440]   without the certification and how would I go about that?
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.960]   Is it possible or probable that I could find work part time?
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.320]   Should I just do the courses first
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.960]   while I transition out of my current job
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.200]   or wait till I start working in the industry?
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:15.440]   I do have a bachelor's degree
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.040]   so I just need a certified financial planner
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.440]   specific courses.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.240]   If I wanna move abroad for two years
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.280]   in the next three years, does it even make sense
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:23.120]   to start now?
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.840]   Thanks so much, love your show, Christina.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.440]   Christina, thank you for the nice words.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:32.440]   To begin, yes, you can work as a financial planner
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.440]   without being a certified financial planner.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.960]   I am currently talking about financial planning.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:44.480]   I am a financial planner, but I no longer hold
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.680]   the certified financial planner designation.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.600]   I just quit paying them their dues.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.480]   I got it, it was useful for me at a time.
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.440]   I quit paying them their dues.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.760]   I didn't wanna deal with them anymore.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.600]   And so I dropped, I'm no longer a CFP certificate.
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.520]   Now, the certified financial planner board
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:01.080]   is obsessive about protecting their trademark.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.280]   They would really, really love to own everything
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.520]   having to do with the words financial planner.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.120]   I'm not gonna give 'em that.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.720]   I'll give 'em certified financial planner.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.720]   It's not on my business card.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.520]   I don't use it anywhere, et cetera.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.120]   I'm gonna respect their trademark on that term.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.320]   But they can't own the words financial planner.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.080]   And a financial planner is simply somebody
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.480]   who helps people plan their finances.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.880]   That's what it is.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.480]   That's what a financial planner does.
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.360]   They help somebody plan their finances.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.040]   And when I'm sitting here helping you plan your finances,
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.360]   I am engaging in financial planning.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:35.480]   But I'm no longer a CFP certificate.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.440]   Those are the words that they would like me to say.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.920]   And again, I'm happy to work with them.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.520]   CFP organization does a great job.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:43.600]   I have no problem whatsoever with what they're doing.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:47.960]   But don't think that you have to be a CFP certificate
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:51.120]   in order to be a financial planner.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.440]   You can be a financial planner and never in your life
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:58.800]   become a CFP certificate.
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:04.680]   So don't let a credential or a designation keep you
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:08.280]   from pursuing the type of career that you would like to do.
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.440]   There are many people who engage
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.360]   in financial planning activities.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:16.880]   We've been talking about asset protection planning.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:20.840]   If you were a lawyer doing asset protection planning,
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:24.240]   you're engaging in a form of financial planning.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.120]   If you're an accountant helping people
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.440]   prepare their tax returns
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.240]   and giving them advice on their taxes,
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.840]   you're engaging in a form of financial planning.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:35.360]   If you sell life insurance and you are helping people
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.880]   to buy life insurance policies,
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.360]   you're engaging in a form of financial planning.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.800]   If you sell mortgages,
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.840]   you're engaging in a form of financial planning.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.360]   Now, those things are not usually the type
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:49.840]   of personal finance, comprehensive financial planning
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.800]   that covers insurance and investment planning,
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.720]   a little bit of state planning and tax planning.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.560]   Well, that's the market
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.600]   that the CFP certification goes after.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.640]   But don't connect these words automatically.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.040]   You can do financial planning
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.320]   without becoming a CFP certificate.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:09.000]   Now, on that basis, the answer should be clear.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.520]   Yes, you can get started as a financial planner officially
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.760]   without certification.
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:16.760]   Many financial advisors,
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.800]   and here again, my same little rant about financial advisor,
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.160]   most people engage in financial advice,
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.600]   but that is a term that usually goes behind a license,
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.720]   a government license.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:28.000]   Many financial advisors give financial advice
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:28.960]   and do financial planning
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.280]   without ever becoming CFP certificates.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.320]   And so you could go that route.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:36.800]   If you wished to become a financial advisor,
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.360]   you could go and do so.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.240]   You can sign up with a brokerage firm,
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:44.040]   you can sit for your Series 6 or Series 7 exam.
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:47.160]   You could go and become a registered investment advisor.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:50.640]   You sit for your Series 65 exam and open your own firm.
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.280]   You could do that and never become a CFP certificate.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:57.000]   So the problem here is not figuring out
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.720]   how to become a CFP certificate.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:04.120]   The problem is figuring out what model of financial advice
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:08.480]   or financial planning would you like to engage in.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.580]   That's the challenge.
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.940]   So you could write a blog.
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:16.140]   You could help people plan their finances.
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:18.380]   You could create a podcast.
[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:20.060]   You could create a YouTube channel.
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:21.260]   You could write books
[00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:23.540]   and help people to plan their finances.
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:27.580]   That route wouldn't involve any kind of insurance licenses.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.980]   It doesn't involve any kind of investment licenses,
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:32.260]   just you giving out personal financial information.
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.500]   You could be the next Gene Chotsky.
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.980]   You could also move in a direction
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.260]   where you sold some kind of financial product.
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.860]   And that's usually the most profitable way
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:43.340]   to be a financial advisor,
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.820]   selling some version of a financial product.
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:47.740]   You could sell insurance policies.
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:50.100]   You could sell investment products.
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:52.060]   And you could sell those investment products
[00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:53.420]   with commissions.
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:55.600]   You could sell them and charge fees
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.220]   on the management of assets.
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:00.180]   Those are normal paths in the financial advice industry.
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:02.700]   And those are more profitable ways
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.140]   for people to give financial advice
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:07.920]   and yet be able to make a living and build a business.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:10.320]   Now, if you don't wanna sell financial products,
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.940]   and if you want to do pure financial planning,
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:13.900]   then in that case,
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:17.900]   you are going to be looking at a fee-for-service model
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.020]   where you're going to be delivering
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:21.880]   some form of hourly advice.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.780]   You're gonna charge people $200 an hour
[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:28.460]   or $4,000 for a package financial plan.
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.420]   And in that situation, it's in my opinion,
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.780]   the hardest business model in the business.
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:34.300]   But if that's the route you wanna go,
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.500]   then in that case, you will be well served
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.700]   by becoming a CFP certificate,
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.660]   but you don't necessarily have to wait to be one.
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.780]   You've gotta become appropriately licensed,
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.320]   but you don't necessarily have to wait to be one.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.900]   Frankly, from what you're describing,
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.820]   I would probably look in the world of accounting.
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:53.500]   Because if you became some form of accountant
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:56.800]   or tax preparer, you could use that as a foundation
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.620]   to allow you to work part-time.
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:40:59.460]   That's a big challenge.
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:01.220]   It's how can you, you said, can you work part-time?
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:02.680]   Yeah, you could do tax prep.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:05.540]   Become an enrolled agent and do tax prep for people.
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:08.100]   And then with that foundation of clients,
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.260]   then you can start to add on
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:12.460]   those other comprehensive financial planning services.
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:14.740]   Can you do it going abroad?
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.380]   Yes, depends on what you mean by go abroad.
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:19.580]   If you're gonna move to France
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:21.420]   and live in France for the next two years,
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:24.340]   you certainly can just simply work a stable business.
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:26.100]   If you're gonna go and spend the next two years
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:28.500]   backpacking around Europe and Africa,
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.780]   then it's gonna be challenging for you to run a business
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.780]   while you're constantly moving.
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:35.300]   Now, you can always along the way educate yourself.
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.300]   You can build a plan.
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:37.860]   If you're actually going abroad,
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:39.540]   what I would focus on is trying to build up
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:42.100]   a marketing plan, a marketing arm.
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:43.180]   If you analyze the problem
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:44.340]   with a financial planning business,
[00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:47.740]   you usually have the problem of marketing.
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:50.420]   And if you can solve the problem of marketing
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:53.220]   by having people seeking you out for advice,
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.580]   then you can figure out what business model
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:58.640]   works best on the backside.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.340]   Regardless of what path you choose,
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.220]   you'll need to first solve the problem
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:05.100]   of what's your business model,
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.900]   and then you can figure out when and how and where
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.460]   to become a CFP certificate
[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:13.140]   or to become a chartered financial consultant
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:15.540]   or to become a certified public accountant
[00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:19.940]   or any of the bazillion financial industry credentials
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:22.140]   that you wish to pursue.
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:24.820]   CFP board won't pay you a dime
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:27.140]   because you get their credential.
[00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:28.780]   In fact, they'll charge you several hundred dollars
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:31.780]   every year if you wanna keep their credential.
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:35.140]   So don't think that having the CFP credential
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:36.420]   is gonna make you money.
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:37.260]   It's not.
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:39.220]   It might make you more hireable
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.780]   when you go to apply for a financial planning job,
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:43.900]   and it could be worth pursuing for that.
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:48.040]   It might make you more likely to be hired by your clients
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:51.100]   because you've demonstrated your ability
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:53.020]   to gain a broad swath of knowledge
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:54.360]   and to help them solve their problems.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.580]   They might appreciate your dedication
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:58.320]   to formal credentialization,
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.240]   but the CFP board will not pay you any money.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.520]   So solve your business model problem first
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.580]   and then figure out the CFP model.
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:07.300]   Beyond that, I would simply refer you,
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:08.360]   if you're interested in the business,
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:13.020]   go and read Michael Kitz's work, kitzes.com.
[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:14.860]   Friend of mine is probably, I think,
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:17.020]   the most, one of the more popular financial advisor blogs,
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:19.260]   if not the most popular financial advisor blogs,
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.380]   and he is unbelievably prolific.
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:22.820]   So in reading his archives,
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:24.420]   you will find plenty of discussions
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.660]   of business models, et cetera.
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:29.340]   Check out he and my friend Alan Moore
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.520]   built a platform called XY Planning Network
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:35.160]   that is specifically trying to change
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.040]   many of the business models
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:37.280]   and allow people to start
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.640]   independent financial planning businesses
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.640]   on their own fee-based businesses.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:43.880]   They walk you through
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:47.200]   the appropriate licensure requirements.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.360]   They'll help you write your Form ADV
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.400]   and all of the requirements.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.680]   I just say this, it's not easy,
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.680]   and you probably will need some experience.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.440]   I think there are financial advisors
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.840]   who start with nothing and start with their own firm.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.280]   I wouldn't have been smart enough
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.400]   or competent enough to do that.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.600]   I think you need some experience.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.740]   What I'd recommend is just change from your job now
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.880]   and go get a job in the financial industry.
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.400]   And then once you've had a job
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.440]   or a couple of jobs in the financial industry,
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.680]   you'll have a better idea
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:14.860]   of the direction that you want to go.
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:17.000]   And you could do it with traveling.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.360]   And there are a couple of people
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.840]   that I was friendly with XY Planning Network
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.520]   that do travel quite a bit.
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.240]   So it certainly can be done,
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.560]   and it's increasingly easy to do,
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.680]   but it's not an easy business.
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:29.520]   It's a tough one.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.400]   So hopefully that points you in the right direction,
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.280]   and thank you for writing in.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.160]   Let's see another of the questions
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.000]   that I will take.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:35.920]   Close with today's show.
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:38.840]   Let me just simply ask you for one favor.
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.520]   If you don't mind, I would love it
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.740]   if you would leave a review for my show
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:45.120]   in whatever platform you enjoy using.
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:46.840]   If you listen on iTunes,
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:48.800]   leave a review in the Apple Podcasts app.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.440]   If you listen on Stitcher, leave a review there.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.320]   If you listen to Google Podcasts,
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.600]   just whatever platform you're currently listening to me on.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.640]   If you wouldn't mind leaving a quick review,
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.080]   I would be so grateful for that.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:01.160]   I haven't really focused much on reviews recently,
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.200]   but I would really love to increase the numbers
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:06.000]   because that helps more people to find the show
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.280]   when they leave a quick review.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.360]   And just a word, many times people choose
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:11.560]   not to leave a review for a podcast
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.000]   because it takes effort.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.320]   If you feel like you gotta sit down
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.380]   and write a paragraph of honest analysis,
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:18.920]   well, here are all the things that Joshua does well,
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.600]   and here's all of his annoying little quirks, et cetera.
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:24.000]   That's great if you have the time to do that,
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.780]   but even just one sentence is really useful
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.420]   because at this point in the stage,
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:31.020]   the life cycle of Radical Personal Finance,
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:34.780]   the most important number is just the number of reviews.
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.980]   Five stars is awesome.
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:39.300]   I hope that the show is five stars for you,
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:43.140]   but when somebody's looking to subscribe to a podcast,
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.060]   usually they just simply look to see,
[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:46.180]   oh, the number of reviews,
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:47.460]   and that helps my show to look like
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.380]   it's fairly well-established, which it is.
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:51.320]   So if you wouldn't mind today as we go,
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.220]   just at some point today, grab your phone,
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:55.140]   your mobile device, whatever you use,
[00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:57.500]   and just on whatever app platform
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.900]   you're listening to me on, just leave a quick review.
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:03.860]   Five stars would be lovely, and a one-sentence review.
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:05.380]   That would really be helpful to me
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:07.540]   in growing and marketing my show.
[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:09.400]   Thank you for listening, and remember,
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.660]   if you'd like to call in for a Q&A,

[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:14.740]   Call in with that phone number,
[00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:17.100]   which I'll repeat it again for you here,
[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:22.100]   561-440-7362, 561-440-7362 at noon Eastern time
[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:25.820]   tomorrow, Tuesday, December 18th,
