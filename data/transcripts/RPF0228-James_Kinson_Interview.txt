[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.040]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we talk cars with the cash
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.000]   car convert himself, Mr.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.840]   James Kinson.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:41.380]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.040]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.940]   Thank you so much for being with me today.
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.480]   Today, we're going to talk about cars, specifically how to make a good decision
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.940]   about cars. I brought on Mr.
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.300]   James Kinson, who hosts a very popular podcast all about that specific subject,
[00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.700]   how to buy them used and pay cash for them.
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.180]   And today we're going to argue a little bit about whether you should or not.
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:15.340]   All right. I believe in truth in advertising, so I guess I shouldn't quite say
[00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.740]   argue, but we do have a little bit of a discussion on the on the topic.
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.400]   James and I come from slightly different points of view.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.700]   And although we agree in the majors, I think you'll enjoy this conversation.
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.800]   I was able to record this at the recent podcast movement conference in Fort Worth,
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.600]   Texas. So you'll hear a little bit of the background noise of the interview where
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.700]   we were doing the interview in a busy, busy hall during the middle of a
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.740]   conference. But James is a real great guy.
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.540]   You're going to hear his story right at the beginning of it.
[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.600]   He is recently converted to buying cash cars.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.900]   He wasn't always that way, but he's recently been converted to that way of
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.540]   thinking. And you'll hear that come out in this podcast.
[00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.780]   But he's an expert on buying cars.
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.280]   Having owned over 20 vehicles over the last 40 years,
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.900]   he's learned a few tricks in his own trades and he's built a podcast helping
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.480]   others to avoid the big mistakes. Here we go.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.440]   So James, welcome to Radical Personal Finance. I appreciate you being here.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.300]   Thank you for having me. I'm pleased to be here.
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.480]   I have been looking forward to having the cash car guy on the show,
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.440]   the cash car convert. We have a lot of mutual friends.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.280]   I know you're doing some cool stuff with your podcast and growing.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.640]   Let's kick it off with your story with regard to money.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.340]   How did you become the cash car guy?
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.680]   Yeah. So to me it's kind of an interesting story because I grew up never really
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.480]   knowing how to handle money.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.980]   My dad was one of these guys who would quit a job when he got mad.
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.980]   He never really worried about it and he always bought new cars or new things
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.720]   whenever he had more money. So it was always,
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.180]   he was always upgrading lifestyle with more income.
[00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.820]   And so I was raised really poor.
[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.760]   And then as I started in my work life,
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.860]   I just kind of assumed some of the same things that he told me.
[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.420]   Like you're always going to have debt,
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.260]   you're always going to have a car payment, all those kinds of things.
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.060]   So my wife and I, we make a good income,
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.100]   but I found myself about $70,000 in credit card debt and other ancillary debt.
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:27.860]   We had about $500 a month in car payments and I even had a loan against my 401k
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.740]   at one point. So really some dumb stuff.
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.700]   Was it just overspending or was there some, you had been disabled,
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.140]   some specific cause?
[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.020]   Just sloppy, just really sloppy,
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.220]   not paying attention and just allowing things to get out of control.
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.180]   And so so we, so, so I, I tripped over Dave Ramsey's book,
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.180]   Total Money Makeover. So I read that and and I, I told my wife, I'm like, listen,
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.860]   you got to read this. I think this is going to, you know, this, this,
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.900]   this makes sense to me. And so she agreed to do it. And,
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.900]   and so from there I really started consuming all of his content,
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.980]   read all of his books, listen to his radio show every, every chance I got.
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.540]   And so finally,
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.660]   so finally I get to a position where I hear him all the time say,
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.180]   sell the car and buy a beater. And, and even said at one point, this,
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.940]   sometimes I think this is the sell the car show. And,
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.220]   and I realized that I've, I've only bought one new car in my life.
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.940]   And I've spent most of my life driving used cars. And so I, so I said, you know,
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.660]   I really know how to buy used cars.
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.100]   Maybe I could find a way to help people with this because Dave's not telling him.
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.700]   And I know that if you buy the wrong car, it's more of a curse than a blessing.
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.580]   So, so, so that was kind of the Genesis of it. And,
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.780]   and along the way my wife and I got out of debt. We got our cards paid off.
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.980]   We bought a couple of other cash cars and and now we've got, you know,
[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.420]   like an eight month emergency fund where we've been fully funding our 401ks and
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.140]   stuff for a long, long time. So that was the one thing we did do right.
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.540]   Is we did do that. Yeah.
[00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.460]   Awesome. So now,
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.260]   so you've, so what was, it's interesting to me about,
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.940]   you've kind of taken on this as far as I'm concerned,
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.780]   like this tiny niche about paying cash for cars and you've expanded it into all
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.380]   this helpful content. How do you talk about cars that much?
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.860]   Well, you know, it's kind of funny. I, if you, as, as people listen to my show,
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.980]   they're always surprised that there's so much more going on there than just
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.180]   talking about cash cars.
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.340]   I did do a number of episodes where I'm talking people through how I buy cars
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.660]   and how I would recommend they do it.
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.420]   But then I also knew it was about more than that,
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.260]   that why do I want to drive a cash car? Why do I want to not drive a new car?
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.460]   And so I gave them some background about that.
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.740]   But then I also talked to a lot of entrepreneurs and about how they weren't,
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.220]   they would not have been able to start their business had they not been debt
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.420]   free. And so I've had a lot of people on, a lot of business people,
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.580]   a lot of entrepreneurs telling me their stories about that.
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.220]   And so that's something else I'm weaving into the show.
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.660]   Yeah, I'm one of those entrepreneurs. If I, you know, if I had a high lifestyle,
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.260]   um, when I left financial planning and I launched radical personal finance,
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.940]   it's a, it's a jump in the dark financially wise. It's not a, you know,
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.580]   if I were any other business,
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.340]   I would have a careful business plan with projections and whatnot.
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.340]   But this kind of business, there's no way to do that.
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.660]   So the only way that you can do that is if you're good with your expenses.
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.900]   And there have been so many people who are stuck in exactly that situation and
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.540]   they're not able to make a switch to a business.
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.580]   Businesses as a rule generally don't make much money in the beginning.
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.780]   And the reason you hear about the big stories that did is because they're so
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.620]   rare. They almost never happen.
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.660]   So ignore the rare unicorn and just focus on what you probably can control.
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.500]   And one of the things is not to put too much pressure in the first couple of
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.820]   years out of a business to take too much out. And if you've got a high lifestyle,
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.740]   you got a car payments, you got a bunch of debt, it, it sinks you.
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.060]   It does. And I think as I have talked to people and listen to people,
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.180]   so many people out there, they're, they're in debt to their lifestyle.
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.860]   They use credit cards, they buy cars with debt.
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.260]   They may even buy a house they can't really afford.
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.060]   And they wind up in these situations where they're,
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.060]   they're just so deep in debt, you know, they,
[00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.380]   they may be miserable in their job, but they have no options, no choices.
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.060]   And so to me, all of the, the,
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.340]   the debt freedom is about giving you exactly that freedom,
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.500]   the choice to do what you want to do. If you want to keep doing the job,
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.860]   you're doing great. You know, if you want to retire and play golf, great. But,
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.460]   but if you're, if you're not intentional with your spending,
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.780]   then that's going to be a problem.
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.740]   And I don't really care if somebody buys a new car or not,
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.460]   as long as they know that they're trading their future for today.
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.700]   Right. It's just opportunity costs. And if you ask me the question,
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.780]   you'd be happy. What kind of car do you drive? I'll tell you my,
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.460]   my cash cars stories. I drive a Ford F one 50. Okay.
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.540]   What year? 2006. It's like you're, you gotta establish your reputation.
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.100]   You know, Ford F one 50 can be,
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.220]   it might be a 2015 Ford Raptor.
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:12.540]   I was, I had the experience recently. I bought a couple of months ago for a long
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.860]   time. My wife and I've had one car and that was,
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.340]   I can't stand owning cars. I can't stand the work associated with them.
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.940]   I can't stand sitting in the tire place on Saturday morning,
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.460]   wasting a Saturday morning, having somebody replace my tires.
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.620]   If I, as soon as possible, I will be one of those people who, well,
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.180]   I'll probably keep an old car around just in case,
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.260]   but I'll be one of those people as soon as we get to self-driving cars
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.700]   distributed through an Uber app. Like I'll use that instead of
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.660]   the, the,
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.180]   the practical side of me will probably keep the cars around for emergencies.
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.020]   But but I'm,
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.860]   I just can't stand owning cars because of the work associated with them.
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.340]   So for a long time, my wife and I had one car, but then we were,
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.620]   we came across another, we came across a,
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:03.700]   I came across a deal on a 1998 Toyota Corolla and it was owned by a little old
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:08.500]   lady and it was in rough shape visually,
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.740]   but it was in good shape mechanically. And I worked out kind of the value and,
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:17.940]   and I was able to get it for $500 out of my pocket and I took on some of the
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.100]   work associated with it.
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.740]   So I've been driving this car for a couple of months now.
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:28.740]   And the other day I had breakfast with somebody and as we were going out to the
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.420]   parking lot, I was watching,
[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.140]   he was getting in his car and I'd been giving him some advice and giving him
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.500]   some ideas. And I was getting into my car and I had to ask,
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.740]   I was asking myself the question,
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.780]   here I am getting into my 1998 gold little old lady Toyota Corolla.
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.340]   I was like, do I feel ashamed about this?
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:51.020]   Because it's a, it's an important factor. You know,
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.060]   there's a level at which if you watch how people handle these decisions
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.380]   emotionally, usually the emotions have much more to do than the finances.
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.700]   The reason people buy new cars,
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.420]   my opinion is more often the fact that their old junkie clunker broke and they
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.780]   just get so frustrated.
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.300]   They say I can trot down to the Kia dealership and I can get a loan on a Kia
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.500]   Rio and $189 a month.
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.940]   I cannot have to deal with my car breaking down all the time. And who knows,
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.980]   that might be a good decision. You know, you,
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.600]   that might be something for $189 you can get transportation.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.540]   If you can effectively leverage that transportation,
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.780]   that might be useful for you,
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:26.140]   but it's probably not because probably you're broke in debt,
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:30.400]   have no assets growing and now you just bought a $15,000 car that in three or
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.060]   four years is going to be worth four.
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.820]   And so you're just destroying your ability to grow wealth.
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.400]   And as I've watched this, so back to my Toyota, I was getting it.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.080]   I was thinking, do I, do I feel like unconscious?
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.140]   There's still a tiny twinge of that. But the reason as far as like, well,
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.100]   maybe I should have a fancier car. You know, Harry,
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.560]   I'm Mr. Fancy Pants financial planner talking about radical personal finance and
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:51.960]   whatnot.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.900]   But what I immediately thought of is the reason that I have the car and the
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:00.900]   reason that I have the car is I can't stand losing money unless I just got so
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.740]   much coming in. Okay, that's fine. But I'm not there yet.
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:09.100]   And I would rather own five rental houses and a $500 car than a $50,000 car and
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.100]   no rental houses.
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:18.020]   And I see this often happens in the way that people frame decisions is they don't
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.660]   frame decisions in terms of, of accurate decision.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.740]   If you were going to give somebody the framing of,
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.340]   you can either drive a nice car or and have a nice life,
[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.940]   or you can drive a junkie car that breaks down all the time. Well,
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.140]   what idiot would choose the junkie car that breaks down? Right.
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:38.820]   But if you can frame it as you can either drive the nice car and have a life
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.860]   filled with stress and be broke for the rest of your life,
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.860]   but have a really nice car or you can drive the junkie looking car and have a
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.100]   lot of money and have a really peaceful life,
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:52.100]   then a lot more people are willing to choose that.
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.700]   And it's all about the framing of the decision.
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.420]   Well there it is that,
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.220]   and I'll tell you another thing that I think about it because I do think people
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.460]   wrap their egos in their vehicles, right? I mean,
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:05.420]   that's how when they have commercials for their vehicles,
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:09.780]   the new car dealers don't really spend that much time talking about the
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.820]   vehicles. They show all these sexy photographs, right? Great lifestyle,
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.180]   tough truck, whatever it is. So,
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:20.500]   so there's definitely a factor there, but, but you know,
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.780]   between the two options that you put, I'd say there's a C, right?
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.940]   There's a B and there's C.
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.740]   I can help people buy cars that they're not ashamed to drive.
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.260]   Now they wouldn't be 500 I'm going to say between three and $5,000 I can find
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:33.740]   you a good,
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:37.780]   reliable car that you're likely not ashamed to drive.
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.620]   And, and, and even at that, even if you are, I say,
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:45.740]   do that and then take the money that you would have been making in car payments
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.620]   or were making a car payments and pay those to yourself first to build up kind
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.220]   of a car emergency fund. And then secondly,
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.980]   to buy your next cash car until you get to a point where you're happy.
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:01.860]   And my opinion is most people between 10 and $15,000,
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:05.700]   there's a point where you're going to find a car that's good enough for you.
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.820]   You know, unless you just really have an ego.
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:14.820]   Because we're talking about need versus want here, right?
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.620]   And, but even at 10 to 15,000,
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.060]   there's a certain amount of want because you can definitely get by with
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:23.340]   something less, but there's, there's just so many great deals out there.
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:28.620]   And I think that the challenge is that people have been raised with this idea
[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.220]   that they're always going to have car payments. Therefore,
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.340]   why not drive the nicest car I can. And that's why I think, um,
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.740]   getting into a bit of another area here,
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.780]   but that's why I think leasing is so popular because people say, what,
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.340]   well, wait a minute. You mean I can pay,
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.460]   make the same payment and I can drive a nicer car. I mean,
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.660]   I can drive a Mercedes or something and pay the same payment I was going to make
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.140]   on a Toyota. Wow. I'm all in, right?
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.780]   Give me that for three years for the rest of my life. And, uh,
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:59.620]   and I think that's kind of insidious, but, um, but I think that's,
[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.100]   um, to me, I think there is that third,
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.340]   third option where you can drive a decent car.
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.340]   You can upgrade it to the point where you're happy with it.
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.500]   And then you can take those payments you were making.
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.300]   And then instead of investing them in a car,
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:15.340]   start investing them in yourself, uh, in your, your retirement,
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.220]   in your children's education.
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.860]   And I view car payments as investing in somebody else's future.
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.860]   You're investing in the bankers, the auto manufacturer,
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.260]   you're investing in the dealerships future,
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.980]   and you're not investing in your own future.
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:33.340]   You're driving a nice car for a little while, but, but you're, you're, you know,
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.780]   you're trading your future for that. And so I tell people, Hey,
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:41.540]   take that car payment you're making and pay it to yourself. And over, you know,
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:45.220]   40 years, the average car payment in America right now is $484 a month.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.660]   So, and most people have two cars.
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.340]   So there's probably a used car in there for maybe another 300.
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.700]   And so you take something like, you know,
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.220]   but five to $700 and you multiply that over 40 years at 8% interest,
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.500]   you get over a million and a half. Well, just the,
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:03.500]   just the four 84 is more than a million and a half dollars over 40 years.
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.660]   Huge. Yeah. Why do,
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.980]   why do you think we put so much of our ego,
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.260]   why we gain so much of our self worth specifically from cars?
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.540]   Yeah, that, that is a bit tricky.
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:19.820]   I think a lot of it has to do with the way Madison Avenue advertises and it
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.980]   works, right? So you've got, you know,
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.540]   the smartest advertising people in the world trying to convince you that you
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.380]   need to have that new car, that it's going to make you more popular, sexy.
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.420]   The women are going to want you, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.500]   Right. I also think if you,
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.740]   if I look at the people that get the most destroyed by it,
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:43.260]   and I'm one to say you spend your money, how you want to spend it.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.660]   And just consider the choices. And if you decide, I mean,
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:50.300]   there's some people who really are love cars, but I think in my mind,
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.380]   you can pick those people out and that's just what they choose to spend money on.
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:54.260]   That's fine.
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:59.740]   But there's a large portion of the population which seems to be in that
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.340]   regular cycle. It's not so much that they love the car,
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.580]   it's just that they do it. And I think sad,
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:09.340]   a lot of people just haven't found a place of ego in something else.
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:15.340]   We always are drawn a couple of months ago on some of my listeners sent me a
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.460]   story about this major league baseball pitcher who just signed a couple of
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.660]   million dollar contractors living in his, his Volkswagen van.
[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:25.020]   It's quite popular online. We're amazed by people like that.
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.100]   When I look at them though,
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:31.380]   the key in those stories is that people are confident enough in something else
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.620]   that they don't need to try to project an image of something that they wish they
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.740]   could. So if you're confident in your career,
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.940]   if you're confident in who you are and where you are,
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.580]   if you're confident in the love of your family,
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:47.340]   the appreciation of your boss, the love of your clients and customers,
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.140]   who cares about the car there?
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.700]   You just get into a utilitarian perspective of what's a reasonable way for me
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.020]   to get down the road in a way that is accustomed to what my needs are.
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.620]   Right, exactly. And, and, and you're right.
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.740]   Most people don't think that way. And, and, and again,
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:07.300]   I think it's just the way people were raised. We don't, um, you know,
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.940]   it's just so normal. I mean, having a car payment,
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:14.540]   nobody thinks that's a bad thing. Right. Right. And, and so, um, you know,
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.980]   people are all over student loan debt right now.
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:21.860]   And I know it's a huge problem for real, but did you know that in 2014, uh,
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:26.460]   there were more dollars attributed to auto loans than there were to student loan
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.780]   debt in 2014? I didn't know that. Yeah. Most people don't, right.
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.180]   And you never hear it, but car payments are normal. It's not an, it's,
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.340]   it's not a bad thing. Right. And, um, and so it's,
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:40.420]   it's not stigmatized in our society. So people blindly go around.
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.980]   When I look at the average numbers,
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.980]   the average household earns about $46,000 a year. Uh,
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.060]   the average new car is $33,000 and, and, and,
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.580]   and those numbers don't close.
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:57.580]   The average wage has fallen about 6% since 2008 cars have gone up
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.540]   about 12% since 2008. Interesting. Right.
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:04.260]   So now what we're doing is we're getting into six and seven year car loans more
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.100]   as the norm.
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.980]   So about 30% of cars are leased and about another 30% are extended length
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.500]   loans. Wow. So,
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.780]   so to continue to sell these new cars to people and to keep the payments under
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:15.620]   control,
[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:19.300]   more and more people are getting upside down in car loans with these longer term
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.900]   loans. And on top of that, they're leasing.
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.060]   So they wind up at the end of a lease with nothing,
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.460]   which is better than coming in upside down on a car loan after three years and
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.300]   trying to trade it.
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.860]   What advice would you have as far as the actual car buying process?
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.820]   So for me, um, again,
[00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:38.500]   because I have this used car skill that I've learned, um,
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.700]   and I'm trying to help people, uh, with this Dave Ramsey thing, right?
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.660]   Where he says buy a beater. I'm trying to help people buy a better beater.
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.220]   So I have an opinion all the way up,
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.660]   but let me start at the $5,000 and below car for that one.
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:54.220]   What I recommend is you buy from a, uh, an individual, you, um,
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:59.340]   you look for a one owner car, possibly two with records.
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:04.100]   And, and then you go out and you, uh, meet the,
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:09.260]   the individual who actually did the, uh, who owns the car and you want to go to
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.780]   their home and you want to see what their yard looks like.
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:15.220]   Is it neat and trimmed or the bushes trimmed? Is the house clean and painted?
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.940]   Or is it a wreck? Because I don't care how good the car looks now,
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:22.380]   30 days ago, it looked like this house, right? People are consistent, right?
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.780]   They tell you who they are and when they do, you should listen.
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:29.460]   Right? So, so a lot of my car buying at that level is where I'm really trying to
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:33.060]   move the needle. And, and I tell people how to inspect cars.
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.260]   And I also tell them, take it to a mechanic and have it checked. Right?
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:40.180]   Because that's like a hundred dollars and it's like cheap insurance for, for,
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:44.820]   because if you buy a three to $5,000 car and then you have a $3,000 in a
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.620]   transmission problem and you're already doing this because you're in debt up to
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:52.580]   your eyeballs. So, so that's the below 5,000 between five and 10,
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.620]   I say still your individual is your best bet,
[00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:00.140]   but you can find good cars at dealerships. And then above that,
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:03.220]   I think you can, you can go to a dealership and find a decent vehicle for sure.
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:08.740]   The one thing that I say that it's a little different is that I say buy from a
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:13.100]   new car dealership that sells used cars.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.020]   And my rationale for that is,
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:20.020]   is that they get more trades and they have a big reputation tied to a major
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:25.900]   brand. And so they can wholesale a car that's a problem for them.
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:31.180]   So why would they keep a car that's not a good car on their lot and sell it to
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:33.500]   you and maybe have some problem where you're going to, you know,
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:37.540]   they're going to show up on the nightly news, one of these gotcha, you know,
[00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.220]   expose. So, so it's just, again,
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:44.980]   it's just about making little tweaks to try to move the needle a little more in
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:49.060]   line with the person that's buying it. Because I was listening to one of your
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.860]   episodes on car buying and you were talking about how it's in the information
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.940]   is asymmetric, right? The person selling has all the information.
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.020]   While I'm trying to even that out a little bit by saying,
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:02.780]   get a car that's got records on it, right? You can do your car facts work.
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.100]   Then you look at the records that the person has.
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.140]   And I'll tell you something else. It's almost like poker. You're,
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:13.180]   you're buying based on the person as much as the car people you can tell when
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:14.660]   you call them,
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:18.580]   they have a pride of ownership and they just can't wait to tell you all the
[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.300]   things they did to this car and how, how, how well maintained it was.
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.860]   And oftentimes you find that they bought another of those exact same model.
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:31.140]   So, so those are the kinds of things I do to try to tilt in favor of people.
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:36.740]   And obviously, again, I don't care if people buy new or used as long as they pay
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:40.860]   cash. Although I do agree with Dave Ramsey and Dr. Thomas Stanley,
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.260]   that unless you're a millionaire, you can't afford a new,
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.500]   a new car because the depreciation just kills you.
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:47.060]   What if you have to buy quick?
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:51.140]   Cause this in my mind is the major problem of the used car market.
[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:56.180]   So my $500 car, you cannot find those deals on a regular basis.
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.540]   Generally a car in the thousand, a couple thousand range. I mean,
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.740]   usually it's a piece of junk that you don't want to drive. Right?
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:05.020]   Those deals are not available. That's purely a timing thing.
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:10.220]   That was why I bought it because I have looked for, for at least 10 years.
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.380]   I've had my eyes open for a four cylinder manual,
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.500]   tiny little car that was cheap, that was in good condition with manual windows.
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.860]   You can't find them.
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:22.020]   And that's the problem often is that people can be in crisis in a crisis
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:26.140]   situation. And the process you just, you just described takes time.
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.780]   It takes effort, it takes work and it takes money.
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.180]   How do you do it when you're in a hurry?
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:34.340]   Yeah, I, I don't know that there's a great answer when you're in a hurry.
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.740]   Although I will tell you, and again,
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:41.900]   when you talk about finding a really good car below, you know, $2,000,
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.700]   I think that does require a lot more work, right?
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:48.020]   But I would challenge that between that three and $5,000 range,
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:51.660]   it's not that difficult to find good cars. Now it's a lot more money,
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.180]   obviously. But, uh, you know,
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.860]   for somebody who's just in debt up to their eyeballs and they're just really
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.260]   struggling, um, you know, I, I think it's going,
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.940]   they're going to have to do some things to, to pull that cash together. And,
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:06.020]   and again, I would advise them, um, uh,
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:10.500]   to take their time and buy the right vehicle so that they don't get themselves
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.940]   in even more trouble than there are in. Right. So, you know,
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:18.500]   making a quick decision on it, um, it can work. Uh, but,
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.940]   um, but, but I'm trying to,
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.140]   I guess I'm trying to cover a couple of things for people, right?
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.980]   I'm trying to get them in a car that they're not necessarily ashamed to drive so
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:31.260]   that they will do the right thing longer and not have a car breakdown. I,
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.820]   I'm with you. If, if a car, um, doesn't look good, but it runs good,
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.940]   I can still live with that. Um,
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:41.100]   I went through a car situation where I went through a divorce years ago and it
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.020]   was very, very painful.
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:47.020]   I had a Lexus LS 400 at the time that as the divorce drug out and progressed,
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:50.580]   I couldn't afford, and it was killing me and I couldn't sell it because it was
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.020]   part of the joint community property.
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:56.380]   And so when I sold that car as soon as I could, um,
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:00.820]   a friend of mine knew somebody who had a Saab 9,000, 900,
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:06.020]   and it was at that time about 12 years old, but it was in great shape.
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:09.300]   Um, both inside and out and mechanically.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:13.300]   And I got it for $2,000 and like you say, that was just kind of,
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.540]   I knew a friend of a friend. It was a good, I was kind of lucky about that.
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.980]   But I will tell you, once I made that switch,
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:23.460]   having had the pain of those car payments and I went to that vehicle,
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.940]   I just felt so much smarter driving it. Right. So you,
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.060]   I did have a little ego issue, right? I'm driving.
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:33.100]   I went from a Lexus to this Saab and,
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:38.100]   but I just felt like I was looking at all the other cars and I knew there were so
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:41.700]   many people out there driving nice vehicles because they can't afford it. Right.
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.780]   And I've read all the Thomas Stanley books. So I,
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.820]   and by that time I had already read millionaire next door.
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:50.820]   So I knew that even though I see people driving Mercedes and Lexus and so forth,
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:55.660]   I know most of them, uh, they're not saving any money that they look wealthy,
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.180]   right? That's the income affluent as Thomas Stanley would put it.
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:03.020]   And that those people, uh, they're not really, um,
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.340]   they're not really rich. They're in debt up to their eyeballs. They're, you know,
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.540]   if they lost their job for a month, they would probably be in deep,
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:13.620]   deep trouble. And, and, uh, so, but it's just kind of funny.
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:17.300]   I learned that lesson and then of course I immediately forgot it when I sold the
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:21.260]   Saab two and a half years later, I went right back to a car payment. Yeah,
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.580]   exactly.
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:30.020]   I don't know what it is about human nature, but you're not the only one.
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.940]   No, lots of, and again,
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:37.420]   I just think society accepts a car payment as being normal.
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:41.420]   Nobody's sounding warning bells, not many. I mean, you can find articles about,
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.060]   uh, about the, um,
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:46.740]   the bubble that's being created by the car loans and subprime borrowing,
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.100]   but you know,
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:51.900]   it's not going to have nearly the impact that the housing crisis did.
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.700]   And so most people aren't even writing about it. Yeah.
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:58.780]   I have been seeing some articles about it as far as subprime car loans being a
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:03.420]   new, a new area of debt. And it's definitely,
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:09.860]   it's a, it's a beast because once you get into it and when you've,
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:13.100]   I don't know if you do any, do you do any personal financial coaching?
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:13.940]   Like for individuals? Okay.
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:17.820]   I've been in a few of those situations working with somebody and when you're
[00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:20.980]   trying to unwind a series of bad decisions,
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:24.100]   cause I think in general,
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:29.220]   many times you always have to, I'm, if you've listened to my show,
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:34.220]   I'm always very hedgy because I could tell you stories of a person specifically
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.020]   who,
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:40.220]   she looked great all the time and drove a big fancy Mercedes.
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:44.060]   And when I did financial planning, she was broke, broke, broke, broke, broke.
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:47.940]   And the only thing she had like was the, was the Mercedes.
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:51.900]   But then on the other hand, where I live, it's an extremely affluent area.
[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:55.340]   And so you can't assume, Oh, there's someone driving the Mercedes.
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:55.940]   For all you know,
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:00.180]   the person made a couple of million bucks last year and an $80,000 Mercedes is
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:00.580]   whatever.
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:05.500]   They go buy a new one every year and it makes no difference to their financial
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.140]   life because the numbers are so extreme.
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.100]   So I always try to be careful to them and to talk about that.
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:14.620]   But talking about someone who's a median income, maybe two median income.
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:18.620]   So, so family, two $45,000 incomes in the household,
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:23.180]   $80,000 ish so double median income of household.
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:24.820]   When you get into that world,
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:29.020]   what happens is you're not rich enough to where you can just take care of cars
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:29.860]   and it's no big deal.
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:33.300]   And you're probably not setting enough aside to where you're going to be so
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:33.700]   rich.
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:37.700]   And so that's where the car payments are really devastating because it's
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.660]   primarily the fact that you're,
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.180]   you're buying a lot of car that's depreciating in value.
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.100]   And I think of it like this,
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:51.140]   take the ratio of the amount of money you're putting in a Roth IRA and take the
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.900]   ratio of the amount of money that you are spending on a car.
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.540]   So if you buy a $40,000 car and then,
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.100]   so let's see if I can do this math in my head,
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:04.100]   $40,000 at 15% depreciation would be 1500 times four would be $6,000 depreciation
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.800]   in the first year.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:11.220]   So you buy a $40,000 car and you suffer $6,000 depreciation in the first year.
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:15.140]   Meanwhile, you're over here very excitedly putting $5,000 in the Roth IRA,
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.700]   but you just wiped out the $5,000 with the car.
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.900]   And people don't think about that as a perspective.
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:25.180]   Everyone is very, I mean, I'm feeling good about myself putting $5,000,
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:26.900]   but over here about a $40,000 car.
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.460]   So in the median income space,
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:33.700]   it's primarily about the lost potential wealth and it's less about the financial
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.260]   emergencies. And my observation experience,
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:41.100]   the emergencies come in divorce and business bankruptcies and dual layoffs.
[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.300]   Most, many families are not,
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:46.180]   are not so crazy that they just got loads of debt.
[00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:49.780]   But when you drop down a little bit and you drop to maybe one median income
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:54.260]   household or you drop down to just a little bit lower in the income space,
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.940]   what happens is it starts to pile up.
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:59.700]   And so you buy a Kia Rio and then you drive that for four years and then you
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.460]   trade that in, but you trade it in and you got a little bit more payment.
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.980]   You go into the next one, next one, next one.
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:08.860]   And then you've got a situation where you've got a $30,000 car and $42,000 of
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.420]   payments. And now you're trying to say, I got to get out of car debt. Well,
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:16.060]   how am I going to do that? I got to come up with $12,000 out of pocket.
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.940]   I got to sell the car in the private market. I got a range of a,
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:23.620]   a transaction in which the title and have the title. I got to sell it.
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.300]   And I got to come up with $12,000 of cash for now.
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:30.140]   I've got to get an unsecured loan plus, or I got to save 12,000,
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.580]   which is unlikely. Plus now I got to get caught up.
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.980]   I got to come up with money to go and buy a cash car.
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:38.580]   And that's where it's just devastating to try to help somebody unwind it.
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.340]   It is, it is. And that's, yeah, I, I,
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.500]   I'm hoping I can catch people before they get to that point or,
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:48.620]   or even the more affluent people just to make better decisions. Uh,
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:53.820]   because there's so much pressure when you make a lot of money to live a fancier
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:57.780]   lifestyle, you live in a, a, a neighborhood where it's more than norm.
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:01.340]   Like you were talking about where the, where the Mercedes are. And, and, uh,
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:05.140]   you know, although I do find it interesting that about 50% of the Mercedes are
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:09.460]   leased. So people really, you know, they're not paying cash for them with their,
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.620]   with their millions in most cases.
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.620]   I would, I would lease a Mercedes if I were a millionaire though,
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:19.220]   even though it's financially not from the convenience perspective. I, I can,
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.940]   that's the situation in which I would lease. Um,
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.820]   just from the pure convenience perspective of it. Yeah.
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:29.860]   It's definitely more expensive, but it's, but when your time is,
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.900]   is in other places, like I, if I were,
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:35.860]   if I were driving a standard car like that, I mean,
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.940]   if I were driving a standard car like a Mercedes, just a sedan,
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:44.020]   these kinds of things. Right. And if I was extremely wealthy, I would lease,
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:46.580]   um, simply because of the convenience factor,
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:49.980]   assuming I had enough investments in other places. Sure. Sure. Um, so, but,
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:53.060]   but that's not that's, that's after becoming wealthy.
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:55.300]   And the problem is when you're the kind of person who makes decisions that make
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:59.220]   you get wealthy, then you're less likely to say, I'm going to do a decision.
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.380]   Exactly. And what I'm,
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:05.460]   what I find more than not is that people want to look wealthy before they are
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:08.340]   wealthy and therefore they never become wealthy. Exactly.
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:11.940]   So it becomes this horrible thing. And, and again, I mean,
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:14.900]   I learned all the wrong lessons and lived it that way for a long time.
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.580]   My wife and I make a really nice income,
[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:20.100]   but we were just some really stupid stuff with our money. We weren't being,
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:24.020]   you know, we played tennis tournaments all over Texas and that was costing about
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:25.940]   700 bucks a month. And, you know,
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:28.780]   we were doing on top of everything else that we had going and we have some
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:32.100]   rental property and we hit some hard times on our rental properties and, you know,
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.620]   cause we were working and traveling so much,
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.420]   we weren't paying attention to those. So that got us in some trouble. So,
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:40.140]   you know, we had all these things pile up and, you know, like I said,
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:43.780]   we just look up and we've got all this debt. And so I, you know,
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:47.420]   I'm trying to, you know, talk to people who, who aren't wealthy,
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.860]   but they make a good income and they, you know, I mean, I,
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.340]   I want to help everybody,
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:57.220]   but I think I have the most potential to help people who have an income and,
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.660]   and can just make better decisions.
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.500]   If they can just get their ego in check and say you know, I don't, you know,
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.900]   I guess it's, you know, Thomas Stanley used to put it this way.
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:09.220]   You've got the income affluent guys who drive a Mercedes,
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.460]   but they tend to drive the lower end Mercedes. Right.
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:14.860]   And then you've got people who are really wealthy, the, uh,
[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:18.580]   the balance sheet affluent and they don't just own one Mercedes,
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:23.020]   they own five and they're all paid for and they're all, uh, you know,
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:26.180]   the highest end models of various sorts, or maybe they have five cars,
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.060]   ones of Mercedes, ones of Ferrari, ones of whatever.
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:32.980]   So the people who are trying to look wealthy can't really do the job anyway.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:37.620]   They buy one of a low end and that doesn't really represent what the wealthy
[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:40.660]   are really doing. Uh, and, and, and then of course, you know,
[00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:43.540]   a lot of the wealthy people, um, uh, tend to drive in the,
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:47.860]   in the last book Thomas Stanley wrote about it. Um, in the last year, uh,
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:52.700]   a Ford F one 50 and a Toyota Camry were the two most popular vehicles purchased
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.340]   by millionaires. Now these are, you know, a deck of millionaires, right?
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.900]   So they're not the billionaire Donald Trump type glittering rich. Yes,
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.860]   that's right. That's the term he used. Exactly.
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:05.820]   And that's an important distinction. And I should clarify my leasing comment.
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:09.780]   Um, I'm assuming in that case, glittering rich. Yeah.
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:13.300]   If I were glittering rich, the point is most of us,
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:18.260]   maybe there are a few people, most I'll pick on, um, our mutual,
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:22.340]   uh, uh, mentor, Dave Ramsey. Okay. Um,
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:27.940]   we've all, we've probably all seen the pictures of his house, right? Okay. Um,
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.980]   the man lives in a mansion and it's beautiful.
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:33.060]   And I think if that's what he wants to do, great. Yeah. Um,
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:36.940]   but I'm not impressed by the fact that he drives a used car.
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:37.980]   If he still does, I don't know.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:42.380]   Or the fact that he owns a car and doesn't lease it because the AC bill for his
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:46.380]   house is way bigger than the depreciation on the leased car. Yeah.
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:49.180]   And that's the point I'm making not to be mad at Dave. He can do what he wants,
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:51.060]   but it's a matter of scale.
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:54.940]   And so the reality is most of us are going to have some things in our life that
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:59.100]   are not the most efficient and there's a lifestyle considerations. Um, you know,
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.900]   I don't know if you stayed at this hotel, but at the Omni,
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:06.980]   but there's probably a motel six 30 miles away that we could stay at. Yes.
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:10.740]   And we could stay there for $30 a night instead of whatever the cost is here.
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:14.180]   Right. So just because, so what happens,
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:18.260]   what I object against in the finance space is that people often have the idea
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.180]   that you should always spend the least amount of money.
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:21.740]   Well I'm not staying at the hotel.
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:24.340]   I found an Airbnb that was close enough so I could save some money,
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:28.140]   but it's not the motel six because I'm not in the stage where I still need to be
[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:31.220]   at the motel six. Right. And so the things about buying and leasing,
[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:34.740]   once you are already wealthy, then you can make the decision,
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:37.100]   but you can't do as Dave would say,
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:41.420]   you can't do poor people's stuff and expect to be poor people. Excuse me,
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.300]   expect to be rich people. You're just going to keep poor.
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:47.060]   And cars are one thing that keeps many people poor.
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:51.020]   And so once you become the kind of person who recognizes that,
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:54.260]   then the importance of the car just kind of diminishes for most people.
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.740]   So once they're rich, it's like, well,
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:58.980]   I don't care whether I drive a Toyota Camry or not and I'll just go buy a
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:02.260]   Toyota Camry and every seven or eight years I'll go ahead and just buy a new
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:03.300]   one. It's not a big deal.
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.700]   Yeah. There was a billionaire on, uh,
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:10.020]   on Fox news the other day that I was watching and he, or Fox,
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:13.580]   excuse me, Fox business. And he was talking about the fact that, uh,
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:17.100]   that his car, he's got three cars,
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:21.700]   two of them were really old and one of them he finally got enough that it had a
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:24.020]   Bluetooth capability in it. And that's his fancy.
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:28.220]   It was like a 2008 or something. And this guy's worth 3.9 billion. And,
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:32.300]   and the, and you know, even I am looking at that saying, why,
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.780]   why wouldn't you buy something that's new and drive it? It's just not,
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:39.980]   it's just not a priority for him. Right. And, uh, I mean, and I am a car guy.
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.220]   I mean, I like cars a lot.
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:44.700]   I've owned a lot of sports cars when I was younger and stuff. And, uh,
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.300]   and I've learned a lot of lessons along the way around that stuff. Um,
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:53.020]   and so it's, it's, I'll be honest, it's really easy for me. Um, you know,
[00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:57.020]   being in my late fifties to say, um, you should drive a, a,
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:01.020]   a lesser car and be smart about it and stuff when I'm not out there trying to
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:04.100]   find a girlfriend, you know, I'm not out there, uh, you know,
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:07.380]   trying to meet people and I'm not starting my career where I may need to impress
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:12.380]   people. Um, you know, that sort of thing. Um, and, and, and, and again,
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:15.780]   even at my age, uh, with all the things I've learned through my life,
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:18.780]   I still feel that twinge of ego every now and then,
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.340]   or the desire to have something that's nicer.
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:24.340]   And my wife and I could go out and pay cash for, um, you know,
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:27.780]   some very, very nice vehicles, but we don't want to do that.
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:31.180]   That's not what we're choosing to do. And, and, and that's, I, I,
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:34.780]   I want to educate people that they have the choice that, uh,
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:38.020]   car payments are socially acceptable in the, in our society.
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:41.820]   And I think they should get a lot more focused because I think it destroys the
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:46.700]   wealth of these, you know, median to middle to high income people.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.540]   Um, you know, the lower end people, I mean, when we were really,
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:52.980]   really poor, we couldn't afford, uh, we couldn't get a loan. You know,
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:57.380]   I bought my first car for cash cause I didn't have any credit. But these days,
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.500]   um, and you were talking about the median income.
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.060]   So the average household income is about 46,000.
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:06.220]   The median income for an individual in the United States is $27,000.
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:09.860]   So it's a very low number. And so you think about that,
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.900]   half the people in the country make less than that.
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:16.140]   Go out here and see what kind of cars you see driving the streets.
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.380]   And, uh, you will see a,
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:22.620]   what appears to be a lot more than half of them driving new or newer vehicles.
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:26.620]   And that's the thing that's got me concerned. Um, and again,
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.220]   I wouldn't have come to any of this if, if,
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:31.980]   if Dave hadn't been telling people sell the car and buy a beater. Um,
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:35.700]   because I, I wouldn't have thought of it this way, but once it hit me,
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.220]   I was like, okay, the, these car payments are killing these people.
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:42.780]   He's telling them just go buy a beater. And I'm like, if they buy the wrong one,
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:46.340]   it's right. It's, it's again, I'll, I think I said it earlier, but you know,
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.140]   it's more of a curse than a blessing. Right.
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:52.060]   And I wanted to try to help people make decisions that would bless them.
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.900]   But you know, there's still lots of unanswered questions.
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:58.740]   You still have to take a second job or whatever to save the money to get it.
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:00.460]   You have to suffer a little bit for that.
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:04.340]   Maybe you do have to start at a $500 car and work your way up to,
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:07.540]   to a two or three or $5,000 car. Um,
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:12.940]   but I got to tell you if you're $70,000 in debt and 50,000 of it is two cars,
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.980]   you can put a real dent in that,
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:20.140]   in your situation by going to a cash car.
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:23.220]   And that's the other thing I think it helps move the needle for people. Uh,
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:26.620]   when it, when we were $70,000 in debt, that was really unsecured debt.
[00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:28.620]   Our car payments were on top of that. Right.
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:30.980]   So here's a topic.
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:34.820]   Don't feel any need to agree with me because I'm interviewing you. Uh,
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:39.860]   but this is something I've struggled with and it connects to the three to $6,000
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:45.380]   car level and it also connects to leasing. And here's the, here's the scenario.
[00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:49.580]   I've tracked, I've kept records on my cars.
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:53.060]   Um, total cars. Here's all the cars I bought in my life.
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:56.020]   First car I bought was a 1993 Honda Accord,
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:00.420]   a 993,000 miles when I bought it, $2,000 purchase price,
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:05.140]   sold it with 315,000 miles on it. And, uh,
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:09.500]   $1,100. Uh, that car cost me, I amortized out all of the costs.
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:13.420]   That car cost me total, not including fuel or insurance,
[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:15.020]   but just simply the cost of ownership.
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:18.700]   That car cost me somewhere around $250 a month.
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:21.820]   By the time I accounted for all the repairs, um,
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.260]   I bought a 2006 Ford expedition.
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.340]   I can't remember what I paid for it or what I sold it for.
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:30.220]   That one was a pretty decent deal as far as no major repairs,
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:34.260]   but it was a butt kicker on the depreciation. Um, it had already,
[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:38.540]   I think it was 12. I bought it for, sold it for 7,500 and I put 50,
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:42.100]   60,000 miles on it, something like that. Uh, so I lost a bunch there,
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:46.500]   bought a Hyundai Entourage minivan, five grand, uh, paid for that.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:50.140]   And then I bought my $500 car. Um, so I'm, I,
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.780]   that's where I'm at this stage of my wealth building journey.
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.860]   I'm not willing to waste money on more expensive cars,
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:40:00.500]   but I try to keep records and try to figure out, am I making good decisions?
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:04.220]   Now, most people don't keep records on cars and that's where it's so difficult
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:07.460]   to get good data because you get into this marketplace and it's okay.
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:12.260]   Like my Honda Accord, when I replaced the timing belt, that's $900 repair,
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:13.740]   but that's gotta be done every a hundred thousand miles.
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.540]   That's not the car breaking down. That's just normal maintenance.
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:16.380]   Yes, exactly.
[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:21.300]   The question I've had and I did this analysis for a friend of mine who his car
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:25.740]   was like a 2000 and six, um,
[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.460]   Accord something like that.
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:32.900]   Almost it was the perfect car that probably you would suggest or like this
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:36.140]   perfect good enough car, five, $6,000.
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:40.820]   And we were going over his repair bills and he's someone, he takes care of cars.
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:44.460]   He's not extravagant, but just repair bills. And I averaged out the depreciate.
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:48.380]   I pretended we sold it and I averaged the depreciation and the repair bills and
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:52.180]   it came to $360 a month, something like that.
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:55.660]   And I'm sitting there looking at that and I'm saying, this is, this is what,
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.860]   this is the car that I would suggest to somebody.
[00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:01.620]   This is that perfect good Honda Accord quality brand name,
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:02.660]   not going to break whatnot.
[00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:06.340]   I'm looking at this list of repairs and I'm thinking like, this is nuts.
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.940]   So back to leasing, I looked at it, I said,
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:12.700]   here are the financial ramifications I'm ignoring.
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:18.300]   This car has cost my friend 360 something dollars a month,
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.140]   about that number.
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:23.340]   And he's driving this 10 year old Honda Accord.
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:27.660]   He could go and lease and there are some sweet lease deals out there,
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.100]   especially if you can get them on a deal.
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:32.980]   And this is where I, why I don't like the always buy, always lease rule.
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:36.420]   A few years ago, the Chevy Volt, the Nissan Leaf, some of these, I mean,
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:39.540]   the carmakers, when they got to move a car, they dumped the lease cost.
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:42.980]   And if you can get some incentives and whatnot, you can really do well there.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:45.780]   But I'm looking at it and saying, just, he just trots down. I mean,
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:49.460]   it's 300 and something dollars a month here and it's 300 something dollars a
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:50.220]   month here,
[00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:52.940]   but here he's got to deal with all these repairs and then all these things.
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:57.060]   And I'm wondering if the advice, the long winded way to give you some details.
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:01.780]   But the question is I'm wondering if my advice needs to change and I'm trying
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:06.620]   and I'm wondering that by looking at the numbers of how expensive it is to fix
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:11.620]   many cars and the days of being able to pull pop the top pop the hood on your
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:17.020]   1986 Chevy pickup truck and replace the alternator for 30 bucks down at Benadotto
[00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:19.820]   parts. Those days are going away.
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:23.900]   And I wonder if it's not better to be up in that beginning curve where the car
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:24.900]   is just going to work and you've,
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:28.420]   at least you've got a fixed cost instead of the unknowns. What do you think?
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:31.060]   Do you think our advice is going to need to be changing as time goes by?
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:34.460]   It might as you get self driving cars and some things like that.
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:36.860]   I think it could have to change and I,
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:41.380]   that's going to be a really sad day because if people don't have the option to
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:45.100]   control the cost, they're definitely going to lose their wealth to, to cars.
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.700]   You know, unless in your scenario,
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:51.060]   maybe they're using Ubers to come and pick them up with driverless cars.
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:54.900]   Maybe that'll help defray the cost some. But, um,
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:58.620]   but, but I, uh, I haven't, um, uh,
[00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:01.100]   gone back and calculated on how many of my vehicles,
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:05.420]   but I just did with my truck not terribly long ago. And, uh,
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:10.140]   in terms of repair bills and I've owned the truck now, uh, it's four years.
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:14.340]   It was three years at the time I did it cause I did it about a year ago and I
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:16.500]   had only done standard maintenance kinds of things,
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:20.060]   oil changes and stuff like that. I had done the brakes myself. Um, so I,
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:22.660]   so I spent about $400 on the brakes would have been about 11,
[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:26.660]   but I've had no major repairs that vehicle I haven't,
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:28.620]   I've only driven it about 60,000 miles.
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:31.780]   So I haven't driven it enough yet to need to do a timing belt or something.
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:35.660]   But you're, you're right. That is part of the normal maintenance. But, uh,
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:39.100]   you know, unless somebody is going to do, um,
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.660]   a lease where they're always going to have a car payment. And I,
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:45.300]   and I have a friend who was big on the leaf. They, they had, um,
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:50.060]   $198 a month car payments for the lease. Right. And, uh,
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:54.620]   and, and the thing that, the thing to me that's insidious about that piece is
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:58.060]   that that gets you into the lease. And now when you get the next car,
[00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.260]   maybe there's not a deal, right. And now you're, you're hung up. Right. But,
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:05.260]   but, but, you know, for some people that will be an option. And so, you know,
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:07.140]   like I said earlier, my deal is I really just want,
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:10.220]   want people to go in with their eyes wide open. I do think,
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.700]   and I agree with you that, you know,
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:15.300]   I would have recommended the guy get the Honda and so forth, but you know,
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:19.260]   like anything else, Hondas can make some bad cars too. So, um, I don't,
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:24.180]   I don't know the circumstances of him buying, but I think, um,
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.300]   and Todd trusted her.
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:29.780]   And I talked about this when I had him on my show a while back that he never
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:31.740]   buys a car until it's like four or five years old,
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:36.220]   because he wants to know the track record of that individual vehicle and as well
[00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:37.060]   as the model. Right.
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:41.980]   And so if you can get records and you can see that somebody has maintained it
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:45.260]   well over a hundred thousand miles, like my truck had 109,000,
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:48.660]   I wound up buying it from a dealer because it was, um, you know, I don't know,
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:51.860]   I think I got it for $14,000 and it was, um,
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:53.860]   and so I didn't have a lot of history on that one,
[00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:59.220]   but I really like being able to look at the history and see that somebody has
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:02.700]   done all the things that you're talking about. They've owned it since it was new.
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:06.940]   They did the timing belt at a hundred thousand and so forth. And then, you know,
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:08.500]   I think, um, you know,
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:13.220]   just past a hundred is a good place to buy because that gives you a good runway,
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:16.500]   right. So that you can do that. Um, and, and if some,
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:19.300]   some people may do it early so you can kind of look at that, um,
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:23.900]   that people will, will want to sell a car at a hundred. I, a guy,
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:27.140]   I interviewed Jim Munchback who was a, um, uh, uh,
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:32.140]   master mechanic said he calls it the a hundred thousand mile myth. And, uh,
[00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:34.780]   and so he says, I've gotten a lot of sweet deals on cars,
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.620]   buying them at a hundred thousand miles. So I think that's a good spot.
[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:41.340]   Used to be the lifespan. Yes. I think two 50 is the new hundred.
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:45.460]   Yeah. Yeah. I'm with you on that. And that's what I tell people is that, uh,
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:46.900]   especially, uh, if,
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:50.180]   if somebody has got a car that's paid for and they're coming to me saying, Hey,
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:54.220]   should I buy a new car? And I'm like, well, let's do the math. And, and I,
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:56.740]   I use Edmonds, uh, depreciation tool, right?
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:59.580]   So it actually says most of the time it's like 20% the first year.
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:01.580]   And I know it varies, you know, like a Hyundai, right.
[00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:05.100]   It's probably gonna appreciate more than a Lexus, et cetera. But, um, but,
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:05.980]   but it, it, it,
[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:11.140]   it almost never makes sense to trade in a vehicle based on a single repair,
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:14.060]   right. Given, and buying new, because you know,
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:17.300]   a $33,000 car based on Edmonds, uh,
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:21.620]   loses about $8,000 in depreciation. And then on top of that, uh,
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:24.780]   now you're going to make the $484 a month car payments.
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:27.180]   You're $13,000 out the first year.
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:31.780]   Median income is 27 for individual. The math doesn't work, right?
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:36.340]   You're never gonna get that. And, and, and those are the, and oftentimes,
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:38.900]   those are the people buying. I mean, my first car,
[00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:43.500]   I made $8,000 a year and I bought an $8,300 car. I mean,
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:47.260]   maybe I made 8,500, right. And I bought an $8,300 car.
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:49.380]   I was living at home with my parents. I mean,
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:52.020]   but that's what people don't get about the millionaire math.
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:55.420]   And I wish people would focus on it. If the guy who's,
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:59.100]   let's say you've got $10 million. If you go out and buy a hundred thousand
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:02.700]   dollar car, and if you take that ratio, I'm not gonna try to do it in my head,
[00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:04.980]   but you take the ratio of what that means.
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:08.300]   If you make a hundred thousand dollars a year and you take the percentage that
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.140]   a hundred thousand dollar car would be of the millionaire,
[00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:13.100]   that's the kind of car you can afford. And the same thing with houses.
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:16.180]   People look at a million at a mansion, like, like Dave Ramsey,
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:20.580]   whatever his mansion cost him. I guarantee, well, I can't care. I hope,
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:24.700]   I'm pretty confident that if you were to compare his net worth to his house,
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:26.580]   it would be way, way, way,
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:31.340]   way less than me with my $250,000 house compared to my net worth.
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:33.740]   And the point is people,
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:38.300]   you get rich by buying investments and not consumption items. Bingo.
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:42.220]   Yeah, it's pretty simple. It really is. And so, you know,
[00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:44.340]   and you said it's that opportunity cost.
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:46.980]   So every dollar you're putting into that car payment is something that you're
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:50.180]   not putting into your retirement. You're not putting an investment property.
[00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:52.100]   You're not investing the stock market.
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:55.460]   You're not investing in your child's future. And, and, and, you know,
[00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:58.860]   it goes back to the old, uh, you know, if you want to see where somebody's heart is,
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:01.660]   look where their, their money goes. Right. So, uh,
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:04.660]   some people just love their cars more than they love anything else in their life.
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:08.460]   And, and, and, and again, there's no stigma about it in society.
[00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:12.020]   I have a friend who went through Dave Ramsey's financial peace university,
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:16.500]   sold a Mercedes and got a Honda CRV. And he,
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:20.340]   he says now when he drives around and he looks at all these fancy cars, he says,
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:23.460]   he, he pictures them with a bubble behind them, dragging, uh,
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:27.900]   some debt behind them at some level. Right. And, and, and, and, and you're right.
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:30.860]   It's not always the case. There are rich people who, you know, uh,
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:33.900]   can make whatever choices they want and it, and it doesn't impact them.
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:36.740]   Dave Ramsey tells a great story about a guy who's, um,
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:40.540]   who's worth like several billion dollars and he gives away, um, you know,
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:42.540]   like $300 million a year or something.
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:47.820]   And he bought $120,000 vehicle and some of his more conservative Christian
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:52.100]   friends like lambasted him for it. And Dave Ramsey's like, as a percentage,
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:53.700]   that doesn't move the needle for this guy.
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:57.780]   It's just like me buying a latte at Starbucks. Come on people. Right. Yeah.
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:01.380]   So, so it is about that scale. If you're making, you know,
[00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:04.940]   $50,000 a year as a, as a household, um, you know,
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:07.620]   you probably should be driving $5,000 cars.
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:11.220]   It's 10% of what you make every year. Right. I mean, yeah,
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:14.140]   I was just going to say, I've, I think rules are thumb.
[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:18.540]   I think the first place I stole it from Sam at financial samurai.com,
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:21.780]   he wrote about the 10% of income rule. And as soon as I read it,
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:24.300]   I immediately said, yep, I'm going to take that one. That's the number.
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:28.060]   You make $50,000 that you can, you can buy, you can own cars.
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:31.740]   Dave Ramsey would say 50% of your annual income should be the total value.
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:34.340]   That's his number. That's fine. That's better than many people.
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:36.900]   I like the 10% number. This is the radical personal finance.
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:41.380]   I like the 10% number. Take your annual income. If it's a hundred thousand dollars,
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:44.140]   you're allowed to own cars that are worth $10,000. Right.
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:46.740]   And if you do that over time,
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:51.780]   what's happening is you're putting so much extra money toward the investing side
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:56.780]   of the equation than you are towards the consumption side that your ratio,
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:59.660]   your net worth is just going to massively increase much more quickly.
[00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:03.380]   Now, if you want to make it 50% fine, but the point is have a number.
[00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:06.620]   And I like rules of thumb like that as a starting place.
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:10.260]   Because with that, think about how every person, if you,
[00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:13.020]   if every person is listening, they can't, you can't unhear that.
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:16.060]   What I just said. So if you go and you're thinking,
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:18.540]   everyone did the math automatically in their head, as soon as I said it,
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:21.820]   I make a $6,000 car. Well, without that,
[00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:24.700]   you trot down to the Toyota dealership and you're thinking, all right,
[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:28.380]   Toyota Camry, I get this thing. It's $24,000. It's two years old.
[00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:30.300]   This is really great. I've, you know, I'm buying,
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:33.740]   and even if you're paying cash for it, I'm buying a cash car, a Toyota Camry,
[00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:36.980]   $26,000. This is against two years old. It's already lost.
[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:38.780]   You know, depreciation is great. It's a good deal.
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:42.860]   I got a good service package. I'm making a great decision. Maybe. Yeah.
[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:48.100]   But you're still facing the fact that as compared to your income,
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:50.460]   you're buying an expensive car, right?
[00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:53.060]   Better for you to buy a $6,000 car,
[00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:57.860]   raise your income to 260,000 and then go get your Camry.
[00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:00.420]   And by having a different starting point,
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:02.740]   it completely changes the decision paradigm.
[00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:05.540]   And I think people make a better decision. I do too. I do too. I mean,
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:09.780]   there's no challenge to the status quo out there. I mean, you know,
[00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:11.260]   I have a friend of mine who, uh,
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:15.380]   he's got his MBAs and he's in the finance world and banking and all that.
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:18.540]   And he's like, I really like what you're doing. He goes, but man,
[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:21.420]   you are taking on two of the most powerful entities,
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:24.340]   the car manufacturers and the advertisers.
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:26.620]   You are in an uphill battle, my friend.
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:29.780]   That's right. You got a good enemy and a good enemy is a good,
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.260]   is a good thing. Well, James,
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:34.740]   tell everyone about your show and where to get it and the name and kind of what
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:35.380]   you talk about.
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:38.460]   Cause I think it'll be a good resource for the listeners who would like to dig
[00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:39.660]   deeper into some of your content.
[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:43.260]   Sure. So, uh, it's cashcarconvert.com. Uh,
[00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:46.740]   you can also find me on Twitter at cashcarconvert. Uh,
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:49.580]   I have a Facebook page, uh, which is cashcarconvert.
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:52.140]   And then I also have a cashcarconvert community on Facebook.
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:55.900]   So it's a private, uh, community, but you know, just ask to join.
[00:51:55.900 --> 00:52:00.100]   I'm just trying to keep the spammers out and the show itself. Um, I,
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:04.460]   I detail how to, how to step by step by an inexpensive car.
[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:08.300]   And then, um, I have people on who, uh,
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:11.820]   make choices that have allowed them to have entrepreneurial careers.
[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:16.540]   And I do some inspirational things as well, because I think, uh, uh,
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:20.500]   as Tom Corley talks about rich habits, you know, it's our habits that,
[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:24.340]   that really, uh, define who we're going to be in the long run.
[00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:28.060]   And so I want people to be people of excellence. And as part of that,
[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:30.980]   I think they should drive a cash car. And, uh, as I say,
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:33.020]   invest in themselves, not others.
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.340]   Keep fighting the good fight, man.
[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:37.740]   We need more of you and fewer of Madison Avenue. Thanks for coming on.
[00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:44.700]   The car decision you make will have a profound impact
[00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:49.900]   on your financial life. If you're not yet a multimillionaire,
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:51.860]   if you're a multimillionaire, well,
[00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:54.780]   it's not probably going to have that big of an impact unless you buy a
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:59.380]   collectible. It's a few hundred grand, but for most normal cars, uh,
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:01.380]   you need to be a multimillionaire by the time, uh,
[00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:05.100]   before you start to get into that world. So I hope this has been helpful to you.
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:06.740]   I hope it's helpful to you to think about it.
[00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:10.180]   I hope you can look at your own decisions and either feel good about them,
[00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:13.260]   or maybe just consider if you'd like to change something, uh,
[00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:17.020]   if you'd like to change something, get after it, uh, go check out James's show.
[00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:20.980]   It can be a great resource. He dives deep on this subject. Uh, and I love,
[00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:24.580]   check out some of the interviews he's done, uh, where with people,
[00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:28.620]   and talking about the impact that this has made on other entrepreneurs.
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:30.740]   I know for me, if I had car payments,
[00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:33.020]   I couldn't do what I'm doing as far as an entrepreneur. I mean,
[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:37.380]   just imagine trying to come up with, what are we at with Patreon? A couple,
[00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:38.940]   just over a couple thousand bucks a month.
[00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:42.380]   Imagine if I had seven or $800 a month of car payments in my household,
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:46.260]   that would be the bulk of my income from the show, uh,
[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:49.340]   put towards car payments. That doesn't work. Uh,
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:53.540]   but by not having car payments and thankfully I've never had one,
[00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:56.700]   but not having car payments, it frees up time.
[00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:59.980]   So I ought to tell James to interview me on his show. James,
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:03.740]   send me an email and come interview me on your show and we'll talk it.
[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:06.620]   I'll tell you my story. I'll be one of your entrepreneur stories or wait a year
[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:09.300]   until, uh, until we hit the big leagues. And then, uh,
[00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:12.020]   and then I'll be glad to come on. So thank you all so much for listening.
