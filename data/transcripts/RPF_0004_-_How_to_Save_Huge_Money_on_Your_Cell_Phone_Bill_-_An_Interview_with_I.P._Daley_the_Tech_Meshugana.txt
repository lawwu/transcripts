[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. I'm your host, Joshua Sheets. I don't remember
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.580]   what episode today is, so we'll just wing that, and if you care too much about what
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.960]   episode it is, go to the blog and figure out what number is at the top of this. But today
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.920]   I am excited to do our first interview that's going to be going up on the podcast. And I'm
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.980]   going to be interviewing somebody who is one of my favorite online forum participants.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.420]   I first found him over in the Mr. Money mustache forums. He goes under the screen name IP Daily,
[00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.800]   real name Will McClendon, and reached out to Will to interview him regarding how to
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.100]   save money on your cell phone bill. Interestingly, I think one of the things that I think about
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:56.000]   in our current culture, one of the expenses that we have, most people, that's different
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.320]   than 10 years ago, one of the few expenses that's higher than 10 years ago, is the fact
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.880]   that we spend on our mobile devices. It's absolutely huge. And so if we could figure
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.320]   out how to get all of the same usage and convenience and features, but do it for a lot cheaper,
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.840]   that would be a really good place to start. So with that, Mr. IP Daily slash Will, welcome
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.580]   to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.100]   Great to be here, Joshua, and hello, greater endocrines.
[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.100]   So you are the author of the world-famous,
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.040]   super guide to, let's see, I don't remember the title, the super guide to all things cell
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.400]   phone, VoIP, and communications guide over on the Mr. Money mustache. Why did you ever
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.960]   start writing that thing? I'm curious.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.460]   Well, it wound up kind of coming out of several years' worth of research and experience on
[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.980]   the subject, and after seeing Dahlink's article, or thread that they'd posted, I realized,
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.960]   there's so much information out there that really needs to be condensed down and presented
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:11.440]   in a concise format, and that's kind of what brought about the super guide and ultimately
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.220]   the online resource, their technical mashugana.
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.640]   I forgot to mention, yes, you blog over at techmashugana.com.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.940]   Correct.
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.940]   And then any other online presence that you want to tell us about?
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:26.940]   Not here.
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:36.820]   Fair enough. Good call. So let's get people's attention, hopefully, because our
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.060]   goal today, if we succeed in this interview, our goal today is to provide, I don't know,
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.800]   maybe this will be an hour's audio that at the end of it is going to help people save
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.580]   tons and tons of money on their cell phone bills and on their communications bills. So
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.900]   let's get a little teaser here.
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.900]   Okay.
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.540]   So, Dahlink, why don't you go first. Walk us through what you spend every month, what
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.280]   you used to spend every month, and just a quick overview of the features and things
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.220]   that you have now and the price that you're paying, and then I'll go after you do.
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:16.780]   All right. Well, right now we're spending on average about $70 a month for two cell
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.900]   phones, home phone, business line, internet connection, and entertainment.
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.900]   Nice. And the average cost in America is $10.
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.900]   Yeah.
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.900]   So that's probably ...
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.900]   About $250 for the same thing.
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.660]   That would probably sound about right. So this is going to be good. So I'll tell you
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:42.420]   my story too. I used to spend, even just with AT&T back in the day, my wife and I used to
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:50.580]   spend 230 bucks a month for unlimited everything plans, talk, text, data, two iPhones and an
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.240]   iPad, and then plus all the rest of it. We've gotten it down in our household. We've gotten
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.240]   it down.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.560]   So we've gotten it down to 10 bucks a month for my iPhone, 10 bucks a month for her iPhone,
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.660]   $15 a month for Comcast internet, and that is it. We do the TV stuff over there. So I
[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.240]   think I've got you beat, but I'm about to add a VoIP phone, so that's going to go up
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.480]   probably a couple bucks a month.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.240]   So I'm edging up, but that's all right. I got the room. Under 40 bucks a month for the
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.240]   two of us.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.040]   Well, considering the fact that you got lucky and only have to pay 15 bucks a month with
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.040]   Comcast, this is just absolutely phenomenal. I'd like to know how you pulled that off, honestly.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.500]   I'll tell you. It's actually a story. So we moved into the house that we lived in about
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.840]   six months ago, seven months ago. And at that point in time, I was shopping for internet,
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.160]   and I started going around and trying to see. I actually jumped off of your Super Guide
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.280]   over to the, I think you recommended their broadband reports, right?
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.280]   Mm-hmm.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.840]   Okay. So I jumped over to broadband reports, and I was trying to find what I could find.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.660]   I didn't find any useful data from my area, which is Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, West
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.520]   Palm Beach, Florida, off of broadband reports or anything there. I tried kind of following
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.160]   all the links, didn't find anything. So I just said, "Well, let's see who's here," and
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.160]   it's Comcast and it's AT&T, U-verse.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.080]   Oh, what a duopoly to choose from.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.000]   Yeah, wonderful. So here was the deal. As I went online, the best deal was just right
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.640]   listed on the front of Comcast's website, and they were offering me something for $14.99
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.240]   a month. They offered something for $14.99. So I was shopping around, and the best deal
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.240]   at that time that I could find was U-verse was offering something for $22 or $23.99. So
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.280]   I called Comcast. I said, "Hey, I want this deal." The rep said, "Oh, that deal's not
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.320]   available in your area." I said, "I just saw it on the website. What do you mean?"
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.640]   I put in my address and everything. He said, "No, it's not available." So I said, "Well,
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.680]   fine. I got to go back and shop it all." So I called back five minutes later, speak to
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.440]   a different rep.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.680]   I say, "Hey, I'd like this $14.99 deal." They said, "Okay, no problem." So they gave
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.560]   it to me right over the phone. Five minutes later, the deal that wasn't available five
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.880]   minutes previously was now magically available with a different rep at $14.99 a month for
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.880]   Comcast.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.120]   Well, is that a fixed thing or just for a year?
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.440]   I'm not sure because if it's a year, that's fine. I'm fine with it. I'll shop
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.240]   it again. I actually just got a letter in the mail, a flyer last week from U-verse offering
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.920]   it to me for $15.99, same price basically. So they must be trying to match Comcast. I
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.360]   asked the rep, I said, "Does this expire after a year? Is this an intro contract?"
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.680]   And they assured me on the phone that no, this was a long-term rate.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.560]   Oh, wow. Score.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.120]   I don't believe it. I don't really believe it because I think in another six months,
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.400]   it's probably going to jump up and I'll have to call and we'll play that whole game. But
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:54.040]   for now, it's working well. And thanks to you, I went with – that was a really cheap
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.800]   rate on the three – I think I have three megabits per second. And you, based on your
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.920]   guide, I decided, well, that's enough is the three megabits per second. But they were
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.480]   trying to push me up to the faster connection.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.480]   Oh, of course they were.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.280]   So you saved me lots of money already. So thank you.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:17.340]   Excellent, excellent. Yeah, and I got to admit, yes, I'm spending about 70 bucks
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:22.920]   a month. You technically got me beat right now, but we don't have any – we're not
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.840]   under any contract.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:30.600]   No contracts. This is the regular rate that we're paying. And I'm one of those people.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:37.540]   I'm not a big fan of doing the monkey dance, trying to fight for an hour to get the bill
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:43.140]   back down a lot. Just the fact that what we're spending today is less than what we used to
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:49.420]   just spend with AT&T alone for our cell phone service, that's plenty enough for me. Why
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.640]   do I need to really push that much further down?
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:58.180]   Absolutely. I'm with you. So let's see. Let's start with what is going on in the
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:04.940]   world of cell phones and build the foundation for us. So if we're going to provide a useful
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:10.980]   guide to people, what are the basic building blocks that each person needs to look at to
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.600]   figure out what would be right for their situation?
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:20.080]   Well, if we're going to talk about recent news in the cell phone industry, we should
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.440]   probably hit on some of the recent news here.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:30.440]   I've seen some news here lately coming out of T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon. This whole
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:39.640]   jump program where they're trying to get people to pay more money to be able to continue to
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.440]   upgrade their devices every few months.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.940]   Really? I haven't heard of that.
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:50.240]   Yeah. This is actually just like the past week or so that this has really started to
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.240]   come up. And it was on the heel of...
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.140]   ...the heel of T-Mobile's supposed announcement of doing away with contracts and early termination
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:07.540]   fees, which let's be honest here. Okay. You're spending $70 a month with T-Mobile before they
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:16.340]   do away with their contracts. And when you were paying that $70 a month, you had a two-year
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:22.320]   contract where you had to pay for the phone and they wouldn't carry or unlock the phone
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:22.320]   for you.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:28.320]   And you couldn't go anywhere else or reduce your plan any. Now they offer you, say, a
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:35.320]   $60 a month plan where you're spending another $10 a month on a cell phone that you cannot
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:47.820]   carry or unlock for two years until it's paid off and you can't take your business elsewhere
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:52.120]   until you pay off the rest of the phone. Is it just me or does that sound like the exact
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.120]   same deal?
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.120]   Exactly.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:59.120]   But on the heels of this announcement, well, if you want to call a few months heels, they
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:07.120]   wound up introducing the new Jump program to introduce another layer of contract to
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:14.120]   bleed customers for another $10 a month. And the reason why they are doing this is the
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:21.120]   reality of the American cell phone market is we're at market saturation. We have 110%
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:27.120]   market penetration in this country with cell phone usage.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.120]   Wow. Interesting.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:36.120]   Yeah. And it's still growing. And it's partly because of this. It's the tablet movement.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:44.120]   You have no idea how many people wind up owning like two devices. It's insane. It really is.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:50.120]   And they're getting desperate and they're trying to find ways to continue to work with the
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.120]   customer.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.120]   And they're trying to find ways to continue to bleed the customer for as much money as
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:11:02.120]   possible. And this has been the latest fad. Instead of actually giving people reasonable
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:15.120]   rates and allowing them the freedom to choose not because they've become an indentured slave
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.120]   to the cell phone carrier, but because the cell phone carrier is actually providing a
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.120]   good enough service to keep them.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.120]   Okay. Go ahead.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:26.120]   It's the complete opposite of what you'd expect in a free market capitalist society,
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.120]   let's be honest.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:34.120]   I hear you, but I'm going to disagree with you a little bit. Because here's why.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:43.120]   Wouldn't you say that isn't there – it's just my impression is that there's actually – the big four are going
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:48.120]   that direction, but there are lots and lots of other companies that are going that direction.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.120]   But there are lots and lots and lots and lots more choices coming out, especially if you're
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:58.120]   willing to switch over to the prepaid world. And so now, that's our job basically is to
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.120]   get the information out there, right?
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:07.120]   Yeah. But the thing is ultimately, we're still primarily dealing with the same big four carriers
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:17.120]   even though we're going through a third party that's buying in bulk. And this is not – this
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:25.120]   is not what you would consider straight up free market capitalism because if that were the case,
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:34.120]   we'd be operating not based on contracts and trying to get as much money out of the customer
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:41.120]   as possible, but actually offering an affordable service upfront to begin with and such a good
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.120]   service that you're willing to stay without a contract.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.120]   Yeah. Yeah. I agree. I agree.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:52.120]   All right. So let's start with – we're working off an outline here. Let's start with some myths
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.120]   that we've got listed here. Myth number one, prepaid versus postpaid.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:01.120]   Well, that kind of goes into the insanity here within this country with cell phone usage.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:10.120]   So many people here are conditioned to think that we need to be postpaid with our cell phone service
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:15.120]   because prepaid is for poor people and for criminals.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:24.120]   Who need the throwaway phone that Jason Bourne buys in the train station in England.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:33.120]   Yeah. But the reality is, is that we're – the United States and Canada is an aberration in the cell phone market.
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:44.120]   Europe and Asia alone are about 70% prepaid customers. Are you going to tell me that 70% of European cell phone buyers
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.120]   are poor and criminals?
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:59.120]   And I mean, India and Africa are over 95% prepaid. I want to say the global average of the roughly 6 billion
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:09.120]   cell phones working and operational in the world, I want to put it somewhere like 85%, 90% are prepaid.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.120]   So clearly, prepaid is a good thing.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:22.120]   And prepaid in this country has just gotten a bum rap from the burner phones that you get down at Walmart,
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:27.120]   your track phones, your Net10 and the like.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:40.120]   But the reality is, is that most of the world pays for what they get and not get billed for what they use.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.120]   $3,000 for traveling to Europe with your phone.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.120]   And that's a lot of the money that you're going to be paying to Europe with your phone that you left the data on.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.120]   Exactly.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.120]   They're not going into contracts. They're not subsidizing their cell phone purchases.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:15:00.120]   They're paying for the phones upfront for their actual value and they are paying for what they use, plain and simple.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.120]   And there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.120]   And I'm with you.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:10.120]   I think prepaid seems like it was – back when cell phones were a thing.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:18.120]   Back when cell phones were coming out of the bricks on your hip or the car phone type of era, it seemed like prepaid was an option.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:26.120]   But it seems to me as a young guy that they seem to only ever work for the – like you said, the burner phone at Walmart.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:34.120]   And so when you say, "I want a nice device. I want a fun device. I want something that does more for me," you don't usually traditionally think of prepaid.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.120]   Exactly.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.120]   But with my $10 a month, that's a prepaid plan and I love it.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.120]   So next myth, unlimited anything.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.120]   Well, let's face it. Nobody needs unlimited anything.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:58.120]   I've lost track of how many people I've talked to who say they need like unlimited text and then I ask them, "Well, how many text messages are you sending a month?"
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.120]   And they're, "Oh, 500, 600."
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.120]   And it's like you're kidding me, right?
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:08.120]   On most prepaid plans, some of the cheapest text rates out there are 100.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.120]   Some of the cheapest text rates out there are like two cents a text message.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.120]   That 500 messages is $10.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:20.120]   And you're telling me that you need to – you're not calling anyone.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.120]   You're not using any data.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.120]   But you need to send like 500, 600 messages a month.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:33.120]   So that's why you're justifying spending something like $55, $60 a month on your cell phone service?
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.120]   Exactly.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.120]   And that applies to minutes?
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:44.120]   That applies to minutes, data, messages, anything.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:49.120]   I mean you don't need unlimited anything.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.120]   And everything is finite.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:58.120]   We're not talking about infinite minutes here.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:03.120]   There's only so many hours a day that you can be awake and using this stuff.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.120]   So be aware of what you're actually spending.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.120]   Be aware of what you're actually using.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:13.120]   And odds are you're not using near as much as you think you are.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.120]   Daley, here's one important point though.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.120]   You are right for adults.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:25.120]   But from what I read about 13-year-old girls, the number of texts they can use, they might actually need unlimited texting, right?
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.120]   Don't get me started on teenage girls and texting.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.120]   That will just derail the entire thing.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.120]   All right.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.120]   Next, data.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:41.120]   Well, data, basically you don't really need as much data as you think.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:18:04.120]   If you're using your phone as an actual honest-to-goodness portable emergency communications device, that means you're going to be using email, SMS text alternatives, maybe a little bit of GPS data or something like that, and very, very light web browsing to look up resources or whatnot.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:08.120]   That's nowhere near as much data as you think it is.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:27.120]   I mean, you could easily, you know, with the right phone and cutting out any streaming anything like streaming media or heavy, heavy GPS usage, you really don't need much data.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:32.120]   I mean, we're talking about with some SMS text replacement applications like Kik and other things.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.120]   I mean, you could easily, you know, with the right phone and cutting out any streaming anything like streaming media or heavy, heavy GPS usage, you really don't need much data.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:38.280]   like Kik and XMS, we're talking close to, like,
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:46.120]   a thousand SMS-sized equivalent text messages and one megabyte of data.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.720]   Wow.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:52.500]   Well, the data thing is interesting,
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.780]   and it ties in with what you just said, unlimited anything.
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:58.180]   Because the thing that frustrated me, what finally got me,
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.540]   and here this AT&T, if you're listening,
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:05.940]   what finally got me, and I think I was an AT&T customer for at least a decade,
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.380]   probably more than a decade,
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:12.740]   what finally got me was for years I paid for an unlimited data plan.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:16.260]   And because it was the original data plan,
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.540]   so I was grandfathered in and I couldn't get it,
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:19.920]   and I enjoyed using data.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.940]   There would be all the data from the applications,
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.680]   just the normal apps that I would use.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.760]   But then I also would love streaming.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.600]   The reason I do a podcast is because I love streaming.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.840]   I love streaming audio.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.840]   I would stream hours of video off of YouTube.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.920]   So I was a heavy data user.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.000]   I think my record was something like five or six gigs one month.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.280]   But any time I would get any heavy data usage,
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.120]   even with my unlimited plan,
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.480]   AT&T would send me this little pop-up thing on my phone that would say,
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.120]   "Well, you're near your cap, so we got to cut you down."
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.920]   So unlimited data didn't exist,
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.200]   and all I did was just change my usage a little bit.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:04.520]   And quit streaming media over it,
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.880]   and just download podcasts before,
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.520]   and then watch videos when I'm on Wi-Fi.
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.520]   And it's worked well for me.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:16.160]   It's amazing how much a little bit of preparation can do
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.880]   to pretty much gut your data usage.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.920]   And even if people are using...
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.200]   Because here would be one difference,
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.760]   is that even if people do have a lot of applications
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.280]   that they like to use a lot of times,
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.640]   most of them,
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.600]   at least my experience is,
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.600]   they don't actually use that much data.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.120]   I would never...
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.080]   What is the average usage?
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.600]   It's one gig, right, in this country?
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.280]   Yeah, something like that.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.480]   Even that seems embarrassingly high, honestly.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.440]   It is.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:47.000]   And if I didn't stream anything just from applications,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.200]   it wouldn't be that much.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.960]   It's not that much data from the applications.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.320]   Next, we've got on our outline here, hours.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.400]   Hours?
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.480]   Well, hours are...
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.280]   You're talking about this 7:00 to 7:00 thing where you've got...
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.680]   Well...
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.360]   And hours in the day?
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:15.880]   All that stuff has always seemed goofy to me.
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.360]   It's like all these little things of,
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.840]   "Okay, you get free cell...
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.800]   The thing I hear is this.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:22.840]   I've got a family plan.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.000]   So I get my six friends that I always talk to
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.920]   and I put them on my family plan.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.080]   And, you know, so we get free usage
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.200]   between after 7:00 PM and..."
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.600]   Like you said, how often do you really spend four hours on the phone?
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.960]   If you have a girlfriend or something,
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.040]   that's your one person that you talk to.
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.000]   I get it.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.040]   But it seems...
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.840]   Well, it ties back into the unlimited anything.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.600]   You don't need unlimited data.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.520]   You don't need unlimited hours.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.200]   You...
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.400]   Again, you only have a finite amount of time.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:59.080]   And trying to game for prime times or anything
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.120]   like that, that's wasting your own time.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.680]   You should have the freedom to be able to just talk whenever you need to.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:13.800]   And when you're trying to utilize their off-peak hours or whatnot
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.840]   to be able to get that unlimited time,
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.640]   to game the system to try and keep your costs down lower,
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.040]   you're just...
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:28.840]   It speaks to a need for situational awareness, honestly.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:39.160]   And honestly, if you're waiting until after 8:00 PM to make a call anyway,
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.000]   you're probably already home.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:48.200]   And you might as well take advantage of much cheaper data and phone services at home
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:53.640]   than using your mobile service.
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.200]   All right, here's my favorite.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.680]   "Daily, I'm going to save so much money
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:04.040]   to bundle my internet and my cable TV and my cell phone and my car payment,
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.240]   all in the same payment."
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:05.800]   Ah, yes.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:12.280]   What's known to the insiders in the industry is the triple play.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:18.200]   Being able to get the phone, the internet, and cable TV all together in one package.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.480]   You know why they love selling you bundled packages?
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:28.520]   Because they can inflate the bills that they want to charge you just that much more.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.320]   I'll tell a little personal story.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.840]   Years ago, I used to work for a market research company.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.560]   And one of the things that we...
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.520]   One of the many...
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.280]   We worked a lot with fast food restaurants.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.320]   And we worked with a famous fast food restaurant brand.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.040]   And I got to see some of the data that they used.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.320]   And it's very interesting.
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:58.360]   This particular brand, at one point, was offering these huge burgers with multiple, multiple patties.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:04.200]   So, you know, you can have the one patty burger, the two patty burger, the three patty burger,
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.640]   and the four patty burger.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.760]   And you look at the four patty burger, and the thing is the size of your head.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:14.760]   And you say, "What person would ever eat the hamburger that looks like that?"
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:19.560]   Well, what the research showed very consistently is that the biggest burger that was on the
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.160]   menu was a three patty burger.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:28.200]   The restaurant might serve a total of five of them, and they would sell in one day five
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.080]   of them.
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.680]   But, you know, they would sell lots and lots of two patty burgers.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:38.520]   But if they put a four patty burger on the menu, they would sell maybe like four of the
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.400]   four...
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.240]   Four or five of the four patty burgers.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.440]   But they would sell dozens and dozens and dozens of the three patty burgers.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.240]   So everyone would go from the two patty up to the three patty.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:53.480]   And to me, that's like bundling, is that, "Well, listen, I probably don't need this,
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:58.040]   you know, this 483-channel package on my cable TV.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:03.080]   I don't need necessarily, you know, 50 gigs of speed on my...
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.440]   I don't even know what the speed ones are...
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.680]   50 megabytes of speed on my internet.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.480]   But if I bundle it all together, it's only $342 a month."
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:17.640]   And, I mean, the thing is, is if I had actually, you know, gone for the triple play with Cox
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:23.880]   to where I'm paying for even just basic cable TV, you know, basically getting the exact
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.880]   same stations I get over the air with the rabbit ears for free.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:34.040]   And bundled our home phone with them and the internet, I would probably be spending somewhere
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:40.120]   in the neighborhood of about $130, $140 a month instead of $70.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:47.000]   So it just goes to show, as long as you keep control of who you get your services provided
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:54.440]   from, you are always going to be able to get a deal cheaper than trying to bundle everything
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.040]   into one bill with someone else.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.720]   It may be slightly more convenient.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:03.400]   It may be slightly more convenient for billing purposes, only paying one company, but how
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.440]   much of your money is worth that convenience?
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.920]   And seriously, put it on an automatic payment off your credit card and it's just as convenient.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.080]   All right.
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.760]   Business use versus home use.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:27.560]   Well, the whole business use versus home use, if you're using your phone for business
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:32.040]   use, then your employer should be paying for it.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:43.000]   So if you're using the whole excuse of, I have to use my cell phone X number of minutes
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:50.760]   because it's for business, then yeah, you can justify maybe a postpaid contract or something
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:56.840]   with one of the major carriers, but honestly, under those situations, your employer should
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:57.480]   be paying for it.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.280]   Not you.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:06.120]   And I mean, home use, again, if you're using it at home.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.000]   Why are you on your cell phone?
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.440]   Why are you on your cell phone?
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.680]   It is specifically designed to be a mobile device.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:18.920]   And you've got to think about this stuff.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:25.960]   If you know what you're getting into and what you're using it for, you can figure out how
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.240]   to better save on it.
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:35.640]   And the thing with mobile services is it's expensive to be mobile.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:41.880]   So why are you using mobile services when you're stationary?
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:42.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:48.600]   And on that point, I think this is one of the reasons why stuff changes so much is because
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.960]   it used to be that using the cell phone was expensive.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.280]   So people would have the cell phone as being expensive and then they would use the home
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.080]   line.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.680]   And then what happened is cell phone prices seemed to come down so much.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.280]   People said, "Well, I use the cell phone.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.240]   I prefer that.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.920]   Now I'll just dump the home line."
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:10.120]   And so my wife and I don't have any kind of wired line.
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:13.640]   And that's where we get into VoIP, voice over IP.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:20.040]   And if you don't have a voice over IP solution, then not using the cell phone thing doesn't
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.160]   make any sense.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:26.680]   So you've got to get the voice over IP solution into play, but once it does, like you said,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.040]   it's a lot of work.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.840]   And then you've got to get the voice over IP solution into play.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.080]   So you've got to get the voice over IP solution into play.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.640]   And then you've got to get the voice over IP solution into play.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.880]   And then you've got to get the voice over IP solution into play.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.800]   And then you've got to get the voice over IP solution into play.
