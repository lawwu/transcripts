[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. I'm your host Joshua Sheets. I don't remember
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.960]   what episode today is so we'll just wing that and if you care too much about what episode
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.560]   it is, go to the blog and figure out what number is at the top of this. Today I am excited
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.240]   to do our first interview that's going to be going up on the podcast. I'm going to be
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.720]   interviewing somebody who is one of my favorite online forum participants. I first found him
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.180]   over in the Mr. Money Mustache forums. He goes under the screen name IPDaily, real name
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.280]   Will McClendon, and reached out to Will to interview him regarding how to save money
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.720]   on your cell phone bill. Interestingly, I think one of the things that I think about
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.040]   in our current culture, one of the expenses that we have, most people, that's different
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.320]   than 10 years ago, one of the few expenses that's higher than 10 years ago is the amount
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.040]   of money that we spend on our mobile devices. It's absolutely huge. If we could figure out
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.920]   how to get all of the same usage and convenience and features but do it for a lot cheaper,
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.120]   that would be a really good place to start. With that, Mr. IPDaily/Will, welcome to the
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.000]   Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.560]   Great to be here, Joshua. Hello, greater endocrines.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:36.120]   You are the author of the world famous super guide to all things cell phone, VoIP, and
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.440]   communications guide over on the Mr. Money Mustache. Why did you ever start writing that
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.440]   thing?
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:49.000]   I wound up coming out of several years worth of research and experience on the subject.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.520]   After seeing Dahlink's article or thread that they'd posted, I realized there's so much
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:05.440]   information out there that really needs to be condensed down and presented in a concise
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:14.160]   format. That's what brought about the super guide and ultimately the online resource,
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.160]   their technical meshugganah.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.680]   I forgot to mention, yes, you blog over at techmeshugganah.com.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.800]   Correct.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.840]   Any other online presence that you want to tell us about?
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.840]   Not here.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:37.840]   Fair enough. Good call. Let's get people's attention, hopefully, because our goal today,
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.600]   if we succeed in this interview, our goal today is to provide, I don't know, maybe this
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.600]   will be an hour's audio that at the end of it is going to help people save tons and tons
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.080]   of money on their cell phone bills and on their communications bills. Let's get a little
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.520]   teaser here. Why don't you go first? Walk us through what you spend every month, what
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.240]   you used to spend every month, and just a quick overview of the features and things
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.360]   that you have now and the price that you're paying. Then I'll go after you do.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:18.600]   Right now, we're spending on average about $70 a month for two cell phones, home phone,
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.840]   business line, internet connection, and entertainment.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.440]   Nice. The average cost in America is probably ...
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.320]   About $250 for the same thing.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.280]   That would probably sound about right. This is going to be good. I'll tell you my story
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.760]   too. I used to spend, even just with AT&T back in the day, my wife and I used to spend
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:51.200]   $230 a month for unlimited everything plans, talk, text, data, two iPhones and an iPad.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   Then plus all the rest of it, we've gotten it down in our household. We've gotten it
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:03.640]   down to $10 a month for my iPhone, $10 a month for her iPhone, $15 a month for Comcast internet,
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.520]   and that is it. We do the TV stuff over there. I think I've got you beat, but I'm about to
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:17.280]   add a VoIP phone, so that's going to go up probably a couple bucks a month. I'm edging
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.080]   up, but that's all right. I got the room. Under $40 a month for the two of us.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.880]   Considering the fact that you got lucky and only have to pay $15 a month with Comcast,
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.120]   it's just absolutely phenomenal. I'd like to know how you pulled that off, honestly.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.880]   I'll tell you. It's actually a story. We moved into the house that we lived in about seven
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.440]   months ago. At that point in time, I was shopping for internet. I started going around and trying
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.080]   to see. I actually jumped off of your super guide over to the ... I think you recommended
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.960]   in there Broadband Reports, right? I jumped over to Broadband Reports, and I was trying
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.880]   to find what I could find. I didn't find any useful data for my area, which is Palm Beach
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.560]   Gardens, Florida, West Palm Beach, Florida, off of Broadband Reports or anything there.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.680]   I tried following all the links, didn't find anything. I just said, "Well, let's see who's
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.360]   here," and it's Comcast and it's AT&T, U-verse.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.360]   What a duopoly to choose from.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.360]   Yeah, wonderful. Here was the deal. As I went online, the best deal was just right listed
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:28.440]   on the front of Comcast's website. They were offering me something for $14.99. I was shopping
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.520]   around, and the best deal at that time that I could find was U-verse was offering something
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.840]   for $22 or $23.99. I called Comcast. I said, "Hey, I want this deal." The rep said, "Oh,
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.720]   that deal's not available in your area." I said, "I just saw it on the website." What
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.080]   do you mean? I put in my address and everything. He said, "No, it's not available." I said,
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.560]   "Well, fine. I got to go back and shop at all." I called back five minutes later, speak
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.160]   to a different rep, and I say, "Hey, I'd like this $14.99 deal." They said, "Okay, no problem."
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.280]   They gave it to me right over the phone. Five minutes later, the deal that wasn't available
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.480]   five minutes previously was now magically available with a different rep at $14.99 a
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.480]   month for Comcast.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.440]   Is that a fixed thing or just for a year?
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.200]   I'm not sure. If it's a year, that's fine. I'm fine with it. I'll shop again. I actually
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.480]   just got a letter in the mail, a flyer last week from U-verse offering it to me for $15,
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.000]   same price basically. They must be trying to match Comcast. I asked the rep. I said,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.600]   "Does this expire after a year? Is this an intro contract?" They assured me on the phone
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.480]   that no, this was a long-term rate.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.480]   Wow. Score.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.480]   I don't really believe it because I think in another six months, I'm probably going
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.240]   to jump up and I'll have to call and we'll play that whole game. But for now, it's working
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:57.200]   well. Thanks to you, that was a really cheap rate on the three, I think it had three megabits
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:03.080]   per second. Based on your guide, I decided, "Well, that's enough," is the three megabits
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.480]   per second. But they were trying to push me up to the faster connection.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.480]   Of course they were.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.480]   I was not.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.480]   You saved me lots of money already. So thank you.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:19.160]   Excellent. I got to admit, yes, I'm spending about 70 bucks a month. You technically got
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:26.960]   me beat right now, but we're not under any contracts. This is the regular rate that we're
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:34.160]   paying. I'm one of those people. I'm not a big fan of doing the monkey dance, trying
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:40.360]   to fight for an hour or two, get the bill back down a lot. Just the fact that what we're
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.640]   spending today is less than what we used to just spend with AT&T alone for our cell phone
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:51.920]   service, that's plenty enough for me. Why do I need to really push that much further
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.920]   down?
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:58.320]   Yes, absolutely. I'm with you. So let's see. Let's start with what is going on in the world
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:04.880]   of cell phones and build the foundation for us. So if we're going to provide a useful
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:10.960]   guide to people, what are the basic building blocks that each person needs to look at to
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.400]   figure out what would be right for their situation?
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:21.320]   If we're going to talk about recent news in the cell phone industry, we should probably
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:30.160]   hit on some of the recent news here lately coming out of T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:39.160]   This whole jump program where they're trying to get people to pay more money to be able
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.320]   to continue to upgrade their devices every few months.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.400]   Really? I haven't heard of that.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:52.120]   This is actually just like the past week or so that this has really started to come up.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:58.040]   It was on the heel of T-Mobile's supposed announcement of doing away with contracts
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:05.960]   and early termination fees, which let's be honest here. You're spending $70 a month with
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:15.920]   T-Mobile before they do away with their contracts. When you were paying that $70 a month, you
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:21.840]   had a two-year contract where you had to pay for the phone and they wouldn't carry or unlock
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.920]   the phone for you until you finished that two-year contract. You couldn't go anywhere
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.140]   else or reduce your plan any.
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:38.440]   Now they offer you, say, a $60 a month plan where you're spending another $10 a month
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:45.320]   on a cell phone that you cannot carry or unlock for two years until it's paid off and you
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:50.840]   can't take your business elsewhere until you pay off the rest of the phone. Is it just
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.080]   me or does that sound like the exact same deal?
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.080]   Exactly.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:02.120]   On the heels of this announcement, well, if you want to call a few months heels, they
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:08.480]   wound up introducing the new Jump program to introduce another layer of contract to
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:15.920]   bleed customers for another $10 a month. The reason why they are doing this is the reality
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:24.840]   of the American cell phone market is we're at market saturation. We have 110% market
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.600]   penetration in this country with cell phone usage.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.040]   Wow. Interesting.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:36.800]   Yeah. And it's still growing. And it's partly because of this. It's the tablet movement.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:45.840]   You have no idea how many people wind up owning two devices. It's insane. It really is. And
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:52.280]   they're getting desperate. And they're trying to find ways to continue to bleed the customer
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:11:01.600]   for as much money as possible. And this has been the latest fad. Instead of actually giving
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:12.240]   people reasonable rates and allowing them the freedom to choose not because they've
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:18.080]   become an indentured slave to the cell phone carrier, but because the cell phone carrier
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.560]   is actually providing a good enough service to keep them.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.880]   Okay. Go ahead.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:30.880]   It's the complete opposite of what you'd expect in a free market capitalist society, let's
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:31.880]   be honest.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:37.960]   I hear you, but I'm going to disagree with you a little bit because here's why. Wouldn't
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:48.120]   you say that it's just my impression is that the big four are going that direction, but
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.440]   there are lots and lots and lots and lots more choices coming out, especially if you're
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:57.560]   willing to switch over to the prepaid world. And so now that's our job basically is to
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.080]   get the information out there, right?
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:07.720]   Yeah. But the thing is, ultimately we're still primarily dealing with the same big four carriers
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:19.840]   even though we're going through a third party that's buying in bulk. And this is not what
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:26.200]   you would consider straight up free market capitalism because if that were the case,
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:34.440]   we'd be operating not based on contracts and trying to get as much money out of the customer
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:41.200]   as possible, but actually offering an affordable service upfront to begin with and such a good
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.280]   service that you're willing to stay without a contract.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:50.640]   Yeah. Yeah. I agree. I agree. All right. So let's start with, we're working off an outline
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.960]   here. Let's start with some myths that we've got listed here. Myth number one, prepaid
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.960]   versus postpaid.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:03.720]   Well, that kind of goes into the insanity here within this country with cell phone usage.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:09.760]   So many people here are conditioned to think that we need to be postpaid with our cell
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:16.320]   phone service because prepaid is for poor people and for criminals.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:24.280]   Who need the throwaway phone that Jason Bourne buys in the train station in England.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:33.080]   Yeah. But the reality is that the United States and Canada is an aberration in the cell phone
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:40.960]   market. Europe and Asia alone are about 70% prepaid customers. Are you going to tell me
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:50.080]   that 70% of European cell phone buyers are poor and criminals? And I mean, India and
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:58.840]   Africa are over 95% prepaid. I want to say the global average of the roughly 6 billion
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:06.440]   cell phones working and operational in the world. I want to put it somewhere like 85,
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:19.520]   90% are prepaid. So clearly prepaid in this country has just gotten a bum rap from the
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:26.680]   burner phones that you get down at Walmart. You know, your track phones, your net 10 and
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:36.760]   the like. So, but the reality is that most of the world pays for what they get and not
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:43.760]   get billed for what they use. $3,000 for traveling to Europe with your phone that you left the
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:52.080]   data on. Exactly. They're not going into contracts. They're not subsidizing their cell phone purchases.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:58.480]   They're paying for the phones upfront for their actual value and they are paying for
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.640]   what they use, plain and simple. And there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:13.960]   Yeah. And I'm with you. I think prepaid seems like it was back when cell phones were coming
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:18.840]   out of the bricks on your hip or the car phone type of era. It seemed like prepaid was an
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:25.280]   option. But it seems to me as a young guy that they seemed to only ever work for the,
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.640]   like you said, the burner phone at Walmart. And so when you say, I want a nice device,
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:33.880]   I want a fun device, I want something that does more for me, you don't usually traditionally
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.440]   think of prepaid. Exactly.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:41.920]   But with my $10 a month, that's a prepaid plan and I love it. So next myth, unlimited
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.200]   anything. Well, let's face it. Nobody needs unlimited
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:53.440]   anything. I've lost track of how many people I've talked to who say they need like unlimited
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:58.520]   text. And then I ask them, well, how many text messages are you sending a month? And
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:06.840]   they're, oh, 500, 600. And it's like, you're kidding me, right? On most prepaid plans,
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:12.840]   some of the cheapest text rates out there are like two cents a text message. That 500
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:20.800]   messages is 10 bucks. And you're telling me that you need to, you're not calling anyone,
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:27.040]   you're not using any data, but you need to send like five, 600 messages a month. So that's
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:33.840]   why you're justifying spending something like 55, $60 a month on your cell phone service.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:41.960]   Exactly. And that applies to minutes, minutes, data,
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:51.680]   messages, anything. I mean, you don't need unlimited anything. And everything is finite.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:58.680]   We're not talking about, you know, we're not talking about infinite minutes here. There's
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:06.600]   only so many hours a day that you can be awake and using this stuff. So be aware of what
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:12.760]   you're actually using. And odds are you're not using near as much as you think you are.
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:18.800]   Daily. Here's one important point though, is you are right for adults. But from what
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.960]   I read about 13 year old girls, the number of texts they can use, they might actually
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.920]   need unlimited texting, right? Don't get me started on teenage girls and
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:35.920]   texting that will just derail the entire thing. All right, next data.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:42.080]   Well, data, basically you don't really need as much data as you think. If you're using
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:48.320]   your phone as an actual honest to goodness, portable emergency communications device,
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:54.720]   that means you're going to be using email, SMS text alternatives, maybe a little bit
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:18:03.200]   of GPS data or something like that. And very, very light web browsing to look up resources
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:09.800]   or whatnot. That's nowhere near as much data as you think it is. I mean, you could easily,
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:18.200]   you know, with the right phone and cutting out any streaming anything like streaming
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:29.400]   media or heavy, heavy GPS usage, you really don't need much data. I mean, we're talking
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:38.160]   about with some SMS text replacement applications like Kik and XMS, we're talking close to like
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:46.800]   a thousand SMS sized equivalent text messages and one megabyte of data.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:54.400]   Wow. Well, the data thing is interesting and it ties in with what you just said, unlimited
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:59.800]   anything. Because the thing that frustrated me, what finally got me, and here this AT&T
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:05.240]   if you're listening, what finally got me, I think I was an AT&T customer for at least
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:11.560]   a decade, probably more than a decade. What finally got me was for years I paid for an
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:17.200]   unlimited data plan. And because it was, you know, the original data plan, I was grandfathered
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:21.320]   in and I couldn't get it. And I enjoyed using data. There would be all the data from the
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:26.320]   applications that, you know, just the normal apps that I would use. But then I also would,
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:32.120]   I love streaming. You know, the reason I do a podcast is because I love streaming audio.
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:38.000]   I would, you know, stream hours of video off of YouTube. So I was a heavy data user. I
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.760]   think my record was something like five or six gigs one month. But anytime I would get,
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:48.880]   you know, any heavy data usage, even with my unlimited plan, AT&T would send me this
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:54.440]   little pop-up thing on my phone that would say, well, you know, you're near your cap.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.920]   So we got to cut you down. So unlimited data didn't exist. And all I did was just change
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:05.920]   my usage a little bit and quit streaming media over it and just download the, you know, download
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:13.600]   podcasts before and then watch videos when I'm on Wi-Fi. And it's worked well for me.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:19.320]   It's amazing how much a little bit of preparation can do to pretty much gut your data usage.
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:24.960]   Yeah, exactly. And even if people are, because here would be one difference, is that even
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:29.640]   if people do have a lot of applications that they like to use a lot of times, most of them,
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:34.360]   at least my experience is they don't actually use that much data. I would never, what is
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.760]   the average usage? Just one gig, right, in this country?
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:41.520]   Yeah, something like that. Even that seems embarrassingly high, honestly.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:48.520]   It is. And if I didn't stream anything just from applications, it wouldn't be that much.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:58.360]   It's not that much data from the applications. Next you've got, we've got on our outline
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.560]   here, hours.
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.360]   Hours, well, hours are, you know...
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.360]   You're talking about this like 7 to 7 thing where you've got to...
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.760]   Yeah, well...
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:14.760]   And hours in the day. All that stuff just has always seemed goofy to me. It's like all
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:21.800]   these little things of, okay, you get, you know, free cell...the thing I hear is this,
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.680]   I've got a family plan, so I get my six friends that I always talk to and I put them on my
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:31.360]   family plan and, you know, so we get free usage between, you know, after 7 o'clock PM
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:36.120]   and like you said, how often do you really, you know, do you really spend four hours on
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:40.080]   the phone? If you have a girlfriend or something, that's your one person that you talk to, I
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.120]   get it, but it seems...
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.920]   It ties back into the unlimited anything. You don't need unlimited data, you don't need
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:53.920]   unlimited hours. You, again, you only have a finite amount of time and trying to game
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:22:02.720]   for, you know, prime times or anything like that, that's wasting your own time. You should
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:09.880]   have the freedom to be able to just talk whenever you need to and when you're trying to utilize
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:18.760]   their off-peak hours or whatnot to be able to get that unlimited time, to game the system,
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:26.000]   to try and keep your costs down lower. You're just...it speaks to a need for situational
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.400]   awareness, honestly.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.600]   Yes.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:37.600]   And honestly, if you're waiting until after 8 PM to make a call anyway, you're probably
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:46.720]   already home and you might as well, you know, take advantage of much cheaper data and phone
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.920]   services at home than, you know, using your mobile service.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:58.920]   Yeah. All right, here's my favorite. "Daley, I'm going to save so much money if I bundle
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:06.000]   my internet and my cable TV and my cell phone and my car payment all in the same payment."
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:12.920]   Really, what's known to the insiders in the industry is the triple play, being able to
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:18.680]   get the phone, the internet, and like cable TV all together in one package. You know why
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:25.680]   they love selling you bundled packages? Because they can inflate the bills that they want
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.160]   to charge you just that much more.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:34.280]   Yeah. I'll tell a little personal story. Years ago, I used to work for a market research
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:41.280]   company and one of the things that we worked a lot with fast food restaurants and we worked
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:48.480]   with a famous fast food restaurant brand and I got to see some of the data that they used
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:55.480]   and it's very interesting. This particular brand at one point was offering these huge
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:02.200]   burgers with multiple, multiple patties. So, you know, you can have the one patty burger,
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.400]   the two patty burger, the three patty burger, and the four patty burger. And you look at
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:11.240]   the four patty burger and the thing is the size of your head. And you say, "What person
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:16.680]   would ever eat the hamburger that looks like that?" Well, what the research showed very
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:21.440]   consistently is that the biggest burger that was on the menu was a three patty burger.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:27.960]   The restaurant might serve a total of five of them and they would sell in one day five
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:33.360]   of them, but they would sell lots and lots of two patty burgers. But if they put a four
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:40.200]   patty burger on the menu, they would sell maybe like four or five of the four patty
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.360]   burgers, but they would sell dozens and dozens and dozens of the three patty burgers. So
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:49.760]   everyone would go from the two patty up to the three patty. And to me, that's like bundling.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:56.760]   Is that, "Wow, listen, I probably don't need this 483 channel package on my cable TV and
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:04.280]   I don't need necessarily 50 gigs of speed on my, I don't even know what the speed ones
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:08.000]   are, 50 megabytes of speed on my internet. But if I bundle it all together, it's only
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.480]   $342 a month."
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:16.280]   Yeah, exactly. And I mean, the thing is, is if I had actually gone for the triple play
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:23.280]   with Cox to where I'm paying for even just basic cable TV, basically getting the exact
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:28.760]   same stations I get over the air with the rabbit ears for free and bundled our home
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:34.600]   phone with them and the internet, I would probably be spending somewhere in the neighborhood
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:41.600]   of about $130, $140 a month instead of 70. So it just goes to show as long as you can
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:48.880]   keep control of who you get your services provided from, you are always going to be
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:55.560]   able to get a deal cheaper than trying to bundle everything into one bill with someone
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:26:02.560]   else. It may be slightly more convenient for billing purposes, only paying one company,
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.200]   but how much of your money is worth that convenience?
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:10.440]   Yeah. And seriously, put it on an automatic payment off your credit card and it's just
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.360]   as convenient.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.760]   All right, business use versus home use.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:21.760]   Well, the whole business use versus home use, if you're using your phone for business use,
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:35.600]   then your employer should be paying for it. So if you're using the whole excuse of, "I
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:44.040]   have to use my cell phone X number of minutes because it's for business," to get a deal
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:51.240]   for business, then yeah, you can justify maybe a postpaid contract or something with one
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:56.880]   of the major carriers. But honestly, under those situations, your employer should be
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:03.880]   paying for it, not you. And I mean, home use, again, if you're using it at home...
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:09.080]   Why are you on your cell phone?
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:16.080]   Why are you on your cell phone? It is specifically designed to be a mobile device. And you've
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:23.440]   got to think about this stuff. If you know what you're getting into and what you're using
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:30.600]   it for, you can figure out how to better save on it. And the thing with mobile services
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:38.560]   is it's expensive to be mobile. So why are you using mobile services when you're staying
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.680]   near stationary?
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:47.040]   Yeah. And on that point, I think there's... This is one of the reasons why stuff changes
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:53.880]   so much is because it used to be that using the cell phone was expensive. So people would
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.560]   have the cell phone as being expensive and then they would use the home line. Well, then
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.280]   what happened is cell phone prices seemed to come down so much, people said, "Well,
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:06.320]   I use the cell phone. I prefer that, not as dump the home line." And so my wife and I
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:13.320]   don't have any kind of wired line. And that's where we get into VoIP, voice over IP. And
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:19.680]   that... If you don't have a voice over IP solution, then not using the cell phone thing
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.320]   doesn't make any sense. So you've got to get the voice over IP solution into play. But
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:30.800]   once it does, like you said, there's plenty of time. It's all... I mean, you can get unlimited
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:35.840]   services for a couple bucks a month versus the big... The much... Relatively much larger
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:42.760]   cost on the mobile device. And then on the business use thing, I agree with you. If you've
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:49.760]   got to use your phone for work, you should consider that your boss needs to pay for it.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:55.680]   And then the other thing is that do you really want all your work on your phone? I'm an entrepreneur.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:02.240]   I do... I keep my phone with me and I do business on my phone, but I often think very hard about
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:07.760]   it. Am I really that important? That I have to be available all that time? And you read
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:11.840]   any productivity book, you read any productivity blog, you read any lifestyle blog, and one
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:17.680]   of the first things that people should consider is, am I that important that I need to be
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:24.440]   answering my email constantly or can I do it during normal hours? So I'm with you.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:29.680]   So let's start at the beginning. So I would say step one, calculate what you actually
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:37.440]   need and talk us through how to do that. But here's my thing. One of my big pet peeves
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:50.800]   is when people assume that every situation is equal. So I may not be on the road much
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:55.120]   and I may not use my phone that much, but then again, I may be a contractor who's on
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:59.440]   the road constantly. So I would say count what you actually need, but count it. Because
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:04.320]   I used to be on the road a lot and when I actually sat down and even though I was on
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:08.520]   the phone a ton on the road, when I actually sat down and counted it, it was nowhere near
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.000]   what I thought it was. So walk us through your thoughts.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.800]   Well, basically you need to start by inspecting your bills. You got to count the usage on
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:22.720]   minutes and we're not just talking the minutes they bill you for, but your off peak minutes,
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:29.040]   your in network minutes, count all your minutes every month for like the past three, four
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:37.800]   months, average them out, get some solid statistical analysis going on how many minutes you're
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:45.360]   using. Then do it again for your texting and for your data. Find out what the baseline
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:51.200]   is on actual usage for your phones. They're not just giving you those bills to collect
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:57.840]   money. They are basically giving you a tool that you could potentially use to educate
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:03.680]   yourself to what your needs actually are without you having to sit down and keep track of all
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.680]   of it yourself.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:09.400]   Yeah. And most of the big ones, especially if you're with a big carrier, they've got
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:14.440]   a nice thing online where you can pull it up online and you can chart it out. And if
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.680]   you don't have that, if you don't have the paper bills, if you don't have the online
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:21.960]   bills, you can use the counter on the phone, right? And it'll tell you your total talk
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:27.160]   time. It'll tell you when it was last reset and then reset it once a month and see how
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.840]   it goes for a couple of months.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:40.640]   Absolutely. And from that point, once you know what you're using and when, figure out
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:46.120]   where you're actually using it. Is it mostly at home? Is it mostly at work? Is it on the
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:52.560]   road? If you know how much you're using and you know how much of it you're using in these
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:32:01.200]   stationary locations where you already have network access or something like that, then
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:08.880]   don't use your cell phone to communicate with. Use a VoIP service. Bring back the home phone.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:17.280]   I can see a YouTube video of you. You've got your beard and saying, "Bring back the home
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.880]   phone, please, people." We should create that.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.880]   Indeed.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:29.120]   We'll use your avatar off of Mr. Money Mustache and stick that on there and say, "Bring back
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.120]   the home phone."
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:42.080]   Even with SMS replacements and the like, if you're at home, use your home data and use
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:48.240]   VoIP services and use your home connection for Internet access. I've lost track of how
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:56.960]   many people who I've talked to who pay Netflix like eight bucks a month to stream video to
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:03.680]   their iPhone, and then I find out they usually watch the videos at home. But are they even
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:13.760]   connected to their home network? No. They're streaming the video over the 3G or LTE service,
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:22.760]   spending just that much more money. It's absurd. Why spend the money on data service if you're
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:28.480]   not going to actually use it at home? And if you have a cheaper source of data at home,
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:34.320]   why would you not use that instead of the data service that they're going to gouge you
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:43.880]   for over the air?
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:49.960]   You got to take advantage of what you have available, and you ultimately need to realize
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:59.760]   that landline anything is typically going to be cheaper, plain and simple.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:07.320]   And so there's basically just a couple of things. Number one, if you can move data usage
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:11.480]   to your home Internet, it's pretty easy to do. So switch out one app that you always
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:17.720]   stream audio through and switch it to an app that you download the audio first. Number
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:24.920]   two is get a voice over IP phone and switch your talking to that. And then number three
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:30.320]   is consider some kind of easy SMS replacement. The one that works well for me is the main
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:34.680]   person that I would text would always be my wife. And I would imagine that I'm not the
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:41.680]   only one. It's not uncommon for couples or spouses to send lots and lots of text messages.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:47.640]   Probably like 70, 80% of anyone's text usage is between the same two or three people.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:52.560]   Yeah. So we just switched to Skype. She's on a computer, I'm on a computer, my phone
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:59.040]   can do Skype on Wi-Fi. So we just switched to Skype on the phone or on the computer.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:03.520]   And there went hundreds of text messages, and that was an easy thing to do. And if she
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:10.040]   needs me, she can still text me. But for the most part, most of those other times, we just
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:18.960]   use Skype instead. So next on our outline here, the wonderful world of early termination
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.880]   fees. Let's do the math. Okay. Well, once you know what you're actually
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:32.120]   using and you start pricing prepaid alternatives, you can sit down and you can actually do the
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:38.280]   math to see if a breaking contract makes sense financially. And you'd be surprised. More
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:47.520]   often than not, it does make sense financially. If you're in for $100 a month, and in reality
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:56.400]   you could get away with only spending like $20, $25 a month on service, and you've still
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:02.760]   got like a year left on your contract, think about how much money you can potentially save
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:11.200]   just going from $100 to $25 a month. You've got a $200 ETF. I mean, let's see, you'd basically
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:22.000]   break even in four months and start saving money shortly thereafter. Once you know what
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:30.080]   the price is on your head and how much longer you have left on the contract and how much
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:35.520]   money you can save, you can figure out if it makes financial sense to just pay the money
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:42.560]   and get out or not. And so many people think that they need to wait out their contract,
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:49.020]   when in reality, they shouldn't because doing so is just going to be flushing that much
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:58.480]   more money down the crapper. Excuse my language. And what's more important, actually saving
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:01.840]   money or trying to take the easy way?
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:08.200]   Well, plus, I'll add to that because I think you're exactly right. I paid the early termination
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:15.400]   fees when I switched out of AT&T because I calculated that in two months I'd make back
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:21.920]   that whole early termination fee. I don't know any really good formula for figuring
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:26.640]   out if it's worth it or not. I mean, it's hard to say, "Okay, at three months it's worth
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.920]   it, but at four months it's not." It's kind of a gut call. You could apply some kind of
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:35.680]   capitalization rate as far as what you're making on your investment and say, "Okay,
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:41.720]   well, if it's in excess of 10%, it'd be worth it." But to me, it's usually pretty simple.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:42.720]   But go ahead.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:47.400]   Well, Ed, that's one of the reasons why there's an ETF calculator on the website.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:55.040]   I was just going to say that. Good. So, plug for your protectmeshugana.com and I'll put
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:59.880]   a link in the show notes. You build a nice, pretty-looking, fancy little calculator where
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:05.840]   you put in your current cost, you put in the early termination fee, and then you put it
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.120]   there and it'll tell you when you break even and if it's worth it or not.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:14.160]   Yep. And sometimes it'll make sense to wait out the contract. One of those instances is
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:22.000]   like some of T-Mobile's old contracts where it doesn't decrease over time, where they
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:30.760]   basically have flat rates on the ETF fee at the 6-month, 12-month, and 24-month periods.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:34.840]   But now that they've kind of gotten away from that, it doesn't matter as much. But I'm sure
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:41.280]   there are still some people out there under contract with T-Mobile that, you know, there
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:46.720]   will be situations where it'll cost less to wait out the contract versus paying off in
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:53.720]   advance. But typically, no, especially if there's a lot of time left on your contract.
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:58.600]   And there's a whole other like aspect to it as well, and that's the fact that the reason
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:03.920]   that you're paying an early termination fee is because you're under a contract. And the
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:07.160]   reason you're under a contract is because you got a subsidized phone.
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.840]   Yep. So, the way that the contracts work is, let's
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:15.360]   say Apple charges AT&T $600 for, I don't know, an iPhone 5. Well, AT&T will sell it to you
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:22.480]   for $200 and to your contract. So, if you leave before the two-year contract, then they
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:26.480]   pay the early termination fee, and that's where AT&T makes their money on the device.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:32.360]   So, your choice is, do you want the device, and you may or may not, depending on who you're
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:37.040]   switching to. So, if you're switching from a device that's only compatible with one option,
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:41.080]   and you want to switch to something else, you may sell the device. And/or you may just
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:45.520]   decide that there's a cheaper device that can do your job for you. So, maybe you've
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:49.440]   had iPhones. I'll pick on iPhones because I have one, and that's what I use. Let's say
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:55.240]   you've had iPhones, and I know you hate them too, which is fine. I'll make sure to put
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:02.560]   a link to your iPhone article about why you despise them in the show notes.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:07.000]   But the point is that let's say you've had iPhones for a couple years, and you say,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:14.280]   "You know what? I'm done with this." Terminate the contract, pay the fee, sell the device
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:21.040]   on eBay or another site, and you probably are going to make more than the early termination
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:25.200]   fee, and you might make enough if you've got an in-demand device. You might make enough
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:29.720]   to turn around and buy your whole new device.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:36.280]   Well, the thing is, basically, the reason for the contracts to begin with is because
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:41.680]   they're preying on the fact that people stink at math, especially when they're out shopping.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:47.240]   They don't actually sit down and run the actual numbers. They just get presented with these
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:54.760]   reasonable sounding amounts of money in little chunks, and it overrides common sense. So,
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:41:00.320]   basically, because we as consumers suck at math, they're exploiting that for their own
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:08.320]   financial gain. But if you actually sit down and look at the cost of breaking contract,
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:13.080]   you think from the surface, looking at it, "Oh, it'll be more financially beneficial
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:20.040]   for me to stay put until the end of the contract instead of buying my way out." But in reality,
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:27.080]   they're using that emotional bias against you. So, always do the math.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:33.240]   Amen. Do you know any off the top of your head, do you know any web, any of, I need
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:37.760]   to research some. My brother used one. Any of the ones that make it easy to sell your
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.080]   device, to resell your device that aren't eBay?
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:45.800]   Well, there are a couple of outfits. I can't remember their names off the top of my head.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.960]   I'll look them up and put them in the show notes. I'll figure out what that is and I'll
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.920]   put them in the show notes. I don't remember what they are off the top of my head, but
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:52.920]   I'll find out.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:53.920]   All right.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:58.300]   All right. Devices. Smartphones.
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.300]   Well, do we really need them?
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:12.700]   Good question. Here's my answer to that. When I watched the Steve Jobs presentation years
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:17.180]   ago at the Apple Developers Conference, I actually watched it live. I used to be a bit
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:22.920]   of a nerd. I'm still a nerd, but I was into that stuff years ago. When I watched him give
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:31.760]   his presentation, I still remember the slides flashing. Communication device, web browser,
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:36.160]   music storage thing. I said, "I need this iPhone. Look how cool it is. I need it. I
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:41.280]   need it. I need it. I need it." But I tell you, at this stage, I'm kind of over it. It's
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.280]   not really as exciting as it used to be.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:49.080]   Well, that's the thing. When you start slapping several functions into a singular device,
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:53.800]   you wind up having to compromise on its design, and you wind up having a device that stinks
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:59.240]   at everything. Let's be honest here. When was the last time you used a smartphone that
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:05.040]   was actually good at making telephone calls and typing out messages?
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:10.760]   And didn't mute half of my calls, or the person saying, "Hello, hello," because my cheek bumped
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:11.760]   the mute thing.
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:22.920]   Yeah. And iPhones, Android phones, BlackBerrys, these things, I don't doubt that some of the
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:29.600]   features are very useful for some professionals. If you actually have a need and purpose for
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:36.640]   a lot of this stuff, then yeah, spend the money because you are investing in a tool.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:43.480]   But so many people don't realize how many feature phones today... Were you aware that
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:50.720]   a $100 Nokia Asha is capable of doing GPS navigation?
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:52.720]   No.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:44:00.080]   Exactly. You'd be surprised at what feature phones are actually capable of doing from
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:08.840]   a technological standpoint now, even on the J2ME platform. It's just... You don't need
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:13.440]   a smartphone to get some of this functionality.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:17.360]   What do you classify as a feature phone? Because that's... You're talking about the thing with
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.520]   the nine-digit keypad, or...
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:26.240]   Feature phone is basically any phone that isn't an actual full-blown smartphone. But
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:33.320]   the thing is that the line has been kind of blurred between the two. With the proliferation
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:41.800]   of cheap technology, ultimately what defines a smartphone is software and the availability
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:51.000]   of apps. But the industry basically puts the divider between smartphone and feature phone
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:45:01.840]   as iPhones and Android devices, and like Blackberry, those are smartphones. And J2ME-based devices
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:09.360]   and simple phones with just keypads on them or something like that, those are more regarded
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:17.280]   as feature phones. And kind of in the nebulous in between, you've got Nokia's old Symbian
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:26.840]   devices and a few other little platforms. It kind of depends. I think what really defines
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:35.040]   a smartphone is exactly how much ridiculous amounts of hardware you have to throw into
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:41.760]   the device to make it functional. Just jacking the price up that much further.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:50.960]   Got it. Well, I see both sides of the smartphone thing. I have friends who are actually app
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:59.960]   developers, and apps are fun. They really are. They're fun to use. I have some language
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:07.840]   apps that I enjoy using. Apps are fun. But the reality is that if I'm actually honest,
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:11.800]   I'm not a bit more productive because I've got a fancy checklist. I'm no more productive
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:15.680]   because I've got a fancy checklist on my phone than I did if I had a three by five card with
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:22.040]   a list on it. And I'm not any more fit because I still don't go running. Just because I can
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:27.720]   track my run with the GPS doesn't mean I actually go running. And the reality is that the stupid
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:33.320]   iPhone bouncing on my arm with the armband is not nearly as comfortable as my tiny little
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:39.800]   iPod Nano. It's basically the more features you have on there, the more likely it is to
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:48.280]   distract you from doing things. And that distraction has gotten out of hand. Let's be honest. It's
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:53.360]   gotten out of hand. People walking down the street no longer are even civil to one another
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:57.920]   because they're staring into these tiny little glowing rectangles instead of interacting
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:07.480]   with one another. We've become a society afraid of being bored. And it damages the fabric
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:16.800]   of our society. Do we really want to contribute to that damage and decline? If you do, keep
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:23.440]   using your smartphone every waking minute of the day. It'll chew up your time. It'll
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:28.960]   make you feel like you're being productive without actually doing so. You'll never have
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:35.320]   to think about anything ever again. And tra la, tra la. And next thing you know, you'll
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:40.920]   look outside and the apocalypse is on the horizon. And you'll see giant flicking flames
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:48.180]   at the sky and someone rolling past taking a picture of it and posting it to Twitter
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:54.720]   and then keeping on. This is not the future we want.
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:01.480]   Well, tell me how you really feel. I'm a little confused as to your actual feelings on the
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:06.680]   subject. Cell phones are destroying America, people. Wake up.
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:15.400]   There we go. I like it. Well, the good news is this. So we'll give people options if they
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:21.160]   want to keep their smartphones. And we'll give people options if they don't. And it's
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:27.560]   up to them what they want to do. My message is, use it as a tool, not as an
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:32.380]   entertainment device. As long as you're using it as a tool, you're going to be able to save
[00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:37.960]   money on the device. You're going to be able to be more productive. And you're going to
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:42.080]   be able to actually get more things done. And that's what technology is supposed to
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:49.600]   do for us, make our lives genuinely easier. And that's what this is about. I want to help
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:56.080]   people actually reclaim that freedom and that advantage to using the technology. And you
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:02.640]   can't do it as long as you're a slave to your data plan and your device and it's just eating
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:07.680]   up every waking hour of your day. To be clear, you're not a Luddite.
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:11.080]   No. You're not against technology. You have a
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:15.520]   highly technical -- we kind of skipped over any kind of background, but I know from speaking
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:18.680]   with you that you have a technical background. You're not a Luddite. You just want it to
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:23.360]   work well and to be in the right place. Yeah. I've spent a decade and a half in IT.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:32.080]   I'm a freelance systems administrator. I work in Unix, BSD, and Linux servers for a living.
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:39.760]   This is what I do. I love technology. I just -- it terrifies me to see people becoming
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:45.880]   enslaved to the technology instead of using it for what it's supposed to be, a tool.
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:54.920]   Yeah. I'm with you. Okay. Let's give people some tools, first of all, to keep usage low.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:50:00.560]   So walk us through some tools to keep our usage low so that we can get by with some
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:03.080]   of the cheaper plans without feeling totally deprived.
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:07.840]   Well, for one, I've noticed a lot of people wind up using a lot of data from GPS.
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:12.520]   Yeah. That one's a big deal for me. So I'm interested in anything that you've got on
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:13.520]   that one.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:20.280]   Well, the nice thing is you don't actually need data services for GPS. Like on the Android
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:27.240]   platform, this is actually a more recent development, but Google Maps has an offline mode. You plan
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:33.680]   ahead and you can load your map onto the phone in advance, and then you don't need to use
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:42.360]   data while you're out in the field. On the iPhone, there's map software called -- I can't
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:49.480]   remember the name of it. It's from Sygic. It is a completely offline GPS service. And
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:56.040]   of course, people have forgotten about the old GPS units that they used to sell that
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:51:04.000]   didn't need any sort of online data access either. And what about paper maps?
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.520]   You're right.
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:16.040]   But moving on from GPS, streaming audio and video. You don't need to stream your entertainment.
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:22.520]   Read a book. If you really want to listen to audio or watch something, download it and
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:31.680]   preload it to your phone before you leave. Basically, you know, anything that is bandwidth
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:42.840]   intensive and takes advantage of your need and desire to exploit your impulse control,
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:47.860]   you probably don't -- you either don't need it at all, or there are much simpler solutions
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:52:01.560]   that you've forgotten about. And the biggest money pits in data usage is GPS and entertainment.
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:09.320]   You plan ahead, you eliminate that cost. It's as simple as that.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:15.240]   Do you know of any solutions for iPad/iPhone to have offline GPS usage?
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:16.240]   Yeah, that was the --
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:24.140]   Side joke. Okay, I'll look that up and figure out -- I'll look that up and include it in
[00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:31.740]   the notes. Because this one actually has hurt me because I'm using -- well, it's two things.
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:37.300]   Number one is using the iPad internationally where I didn't have any data. It was useless,
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:41.260]   which was a pain because I didn't realize that one time before I did it. And I was driving
[00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:46.740]   across Haiti in a car and trying to use my iPad to navigate with and I had zero data.
[00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:52.460]   That's a story for another day. But that was one experience. And then currently I'm using
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:57.980]   Air Voice and I'm not using the data. So from time to time -- I have an old-fashioned GPS
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:03.500]   that just -- you know, an old Garmin. But I'll be interested to look up that.
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:05.940]   It's called SIGIC GPS navigation.
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:06.940]   S-I-J-I-C-K?
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:07.940]   No, S-Y-G-I-C.
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:19.780]   Okay. All right. I'll look that up, too. All right. That's useful. SMS replacement?
[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:26.980]   Well, there's stuff like XMS, Kik, Nimbus, Takanot, Google Voice. You mentioned Skype
[00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:37.300]   earlier. Basically, if you've got a basic smartphone or even a higher-end feature phone,
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:45.420]   a lot of this stuff, you don't need to actually use SMS. I mean, yeah, you can keep using
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:54.460]   SMS, but I mean, XMS and Kik, like I mentioned earlier, you can pass nearly 1,000 messages
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:54:03.220]   for one megabyte worth of data. What's cheaper? 1,000 messages like on PlatinumTel for 20
[00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:10.900]   bucks or 1,000 messages in one megadata for, you know, 10 cents.
[00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:18.300]   Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Do any of those -- do all of those -- how do those work, though,
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:22.900]   as far as your number? Like, are those apps where you have to -- the other person has
[00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:24.580]   to have that same app to do it?
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:30.460]   Yes. A lot of these, you need the same app to do it. It's basically just -- it's basically
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:36.900]   nothing more than an IM client, like on your desktop computer, except a lot of these are
[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:42.700]   specifically targeted for the phones themselves. It's one of the things I like about Takanot
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:53.340]   personally, because it's not so much a dedicated SMS replacement utility type of thing, so
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:55:00.900]   much as an application that allows you to use a Jabber server for communicating. So
[00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:12.500]   you can use, like, Google Talk or any of the other Jabber XMPP services out there, and
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:20.820]   you don't have to actually, you know, use custom applications that are only available
[00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:27.620]   for phones. So with Takanot, I log into that. If my wife's at home on her computer, kind
[00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:34.340]   of like you with Skype, we're able to bridge the cell phone/computer divide and be able
[00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:40.000]   to continue to message just for the cost of text -- or for data.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:47.060]   So I'm going to switch it on you. What if -- with all these apps, what's your opinion
[00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:54.820]   on switching from a phone with voice and minutes and data? What about -- what do you think
[00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:59.500]   about switching to a tablet, maybe a small tablet, like an iPad Mini with a data connection,
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:04.660]   where you're just paying a flat fee for data, and then using apps like I use on my iPad?
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:11.100]   I've used Talkatone to do mobile talking and mobile texting off the data connection. What
[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:12.100]   do you think about that approach?
[00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:17.780]   Well, I'm not a big fan of paying any extra for the data connection to begin with, because
[00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:18.780]   --
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:20.740]   What if that -- what if that replaced the phone, though?
[00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:29.100]   Well, the problem there is going to a peer VoIP solution. You -- we'll get to that a
[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:38.020]   little later, I think. There was an encounter that I had a few weeks back during the May
[00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:48.140]   31st tornado out in El Reno, and relying on all of your mobile emergency communications
[00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:54.500]   is just a bad idea. And we'll kind of cover that more when we get to, like, some of the
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:55.500]   carriers.
[00:56:55.500 --> 00:57:01.140]   Okay. All right. Deal. The other question I have is, what do you think about some of
[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:07.140]   these apps that compress data? Like, so I saw recently an article on -- I don't know
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:08.140]   how to say it. Is it Onavo?
[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:09.140]   Yeah.
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:10.140]   I think so, innit?
[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:17.060]   Yeah, I believe it's Onavo. They can cut down on some data usage, but the thing is, is that
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:23.340]   -- like, with Onavo on the Android platform, most of Google's traffic's already compressed
[00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:30.580]   anyway, and you introduce a third-party proxy, they're basically, you know -- you're pushing
[00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:36.500]   all of your information through their servers. So they're basically able to, you know, sniff
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:43.140]   all your packets and see what you're doing. And there's no such thing as a free lunch.
[00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:48.940]   If you're getting a free service here, you need to ask yourself why. But it can cut down
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:54.520]   a little bit on data usage, potentially, but if you're already using a phone that's lean
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:59.740]   on data to begin with and is already, you know, compressing most all of the text-based
[00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:10.420]   traffic between the origin servers and your phone, and you're mostly sticking to text-based
[00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:14.980]   communications anyway, you don't really need that much compression.
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:20.900]   Makes sense. Makes sense. And then the other one I saw -- and I don't know if you know
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:24.980]   anything about it. I haven't used it. Opera Mini? I saw an article on that. Do you know
[00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:25.980]   anything about that one?
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:33.100]   Opera Mini, they basically -- they're doing the proxy compression thing again with all
[00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:34.100]   of your usage.
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:35.100]   Same thing?
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:41.340]   Basically, yeah, it's the same thing. You're pushing all of your web data through their
[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:48.860]   servers to have it optimized and compressed to cut down on data usage. That's fine if
[00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:56.140]   you want someone else rifling through your online business. But if you're seriously looking
[00:58:56.140 --> 00:59:04.540]   at Opera Mini to compress and optimize the data usage that you're using on your smartphone
[00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:09.340]   anyway, especially your Android device, maybe you should consider going with Dolphin instead
[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:16.180]   where you can just turn off image loading because that's going to be about 90% of your
[00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:18.100]   bandwidth traffic right there.
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:21.140]   Okay, that's a browser. Dolphin is a browser?
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.140]   Yeah.
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:26.460]   Okay, I'll look that one up because that one's new to me too. Interesting. Okay, so those
[00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:32.620]   are -- yeah, I think it's going to get faster. It's going to be less and less data. And so
[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:36.740]   it's interesting to kind of hear, understand. I'm not a technical -- I'm not a techie, so
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:40.060]   it's interesting to kind of hear what's going on behind the scenes with some of these things
[00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:46.820]   that I read articles about. So, good. All right, let's get on to the actual here's where
[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:53.660]   you should go and can go as far as provider selection. So, first thing on our list, MNO
[00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:56.700]   versus MVNO. What does that mean?
[00:59:56.700 --> 01:00:03.100]   Well, we'll start with MVNO. MVNO is Mobile Virtual Network Operator. They basically piggyback
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:13.340]   off of the MNO or the Mobile Network Operator and resell the services. The MNOs, those are
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:21.780]   your AT&Ts, your Sprints, your T-Mobiles, and your Verizons. MVNO is your Air Voice
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:28.940]   Wireless, your PlatinumTel, your GoSmart Mobile. Well, actually not GoSmart so much, but your
[01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:36.380]   TANG, the smaller carriers. They're basically reselling the service from the big guys on
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:40.180]   their network.
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:47.900]   When they do that, I've talked with...so, I'm using an MVNO, Air Voice Wireless, and
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:56.580]   I've also in the past used the Straight Talk service from Walmart, which we'll get to in
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:01:02.140]   just a minute. But the two things that I've heard, one is I was talking with somebody
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:09.100]   who was a salesperson for one of the big four, and they said that by using an MVNO, I would
[01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:15.260]   come second in line to all of the big fours, even though I'm using the same towers as AT&T,
[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:18.900]   because I'm not an AT&T customer. If there was an overload on the system, I would come
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.900]   second. Do you know if that's true?
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:31.940]   I'm not sure if that's necessarily true or not. I guess theoretically, the primary operators
[01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:42.020]   would wind up getting preferential treatment and primary access to the towers. But if we're
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:48.380]   treating our mobile devices as an emergency communicator anyway, you don't really need
[01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:54.700]   to worry about that, because when you dial 911, it doesn't matter if you have access
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:02:05.780]   to the closest tower or not. If you're with Air Voice and you're not near an AT&T tower,
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:11.940]   but you are near a T-Mobile tower, you're still going to be able to complete that 911
[01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:19.940]   call, and you are going to get priority over everyone else. Let's face it, if we're minimizing
[01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:26.980]   our communications to their bare necessities when we're out and about, the stuff that we're
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:39.180]   going to communicate is either going to be life-threateningly important, in which when
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:44.900]   we dial that emergency number, we are going to get priority, or it's going to be something
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:54.740]   that, you know what, doesn't really matter if we're getting the best possible call connection
[01:02:54.740 --> 01:03:02.220]   on that call, as long as the information gets relayed. That should be what matters. And
[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:10.640]   I've never had that problem of my carrier not being able to complete that call, even
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:20.260]   on an MVNO. So there may be truth to it, but in reality, when you actually see it in action,
[01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:22.700]   you certainly aren't going to notice the difference.
[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:28.700]   Yeah, that makes sense. What about data speed? Do you think that...because one thing I...and
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:33.620]   I'm not...I've never been techie enough to kind of run like the speed tests and stuff,
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:39.940]   but I had a...I always thought that when I switched from AT&T to Straight Talk, that
[01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:45.220]   even though at that time I was running still on the AT&T towers, I felt like my data speed
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:48.700]   was slower. Would that be normal, or is that probably not true?
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:57.820]   Yeah, that actually is true. Most MVNOs, you're not going to have near as fast a network connection
[01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:04.020]   as directly through, because, you know, you're basically adding on a third-party layer with
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:12.940]   that, using a smaller carrier servers. But it's not really a restriction so much on the
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:23.460]   network itself as the MVNO you're dealing with. Like in the case of PagePlus, they're
[01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:30.900]   operating all their own servers, and even though the Verizon network can provide a much
[01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:39.260]   faster connection speed off of their 3G service, you're ultimately going to get capped at something
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:45.420]   like 350 kilobytes a second, absolute maximum. So yeah, you're going to get a...you're going
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:53.100]   to take a little bit of a hit on data speeds, but if you're only using text-based communications
[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:58.340]   and you're eliminating streaming video and audio and the like, odds are you're not going
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:03.020]   to notice the difference. Yeah, the only place that I noticed it at
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:09.380]   that time, and the reason I'm kind of harping on it and asking these questions, because
[01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:15.460]   I want people, like with the information that we're providing, I think a lot of people are
[01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:20.540]   going to be able to go in the direction that you advocate as far as, "Hey, just cut your
[01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:25.340]   usage down, change your usage patterns." But there's a lot of people my age that are going
[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:32.660]   to still say, "Listen, I like...you like using iHeartRadio, I like using this app that sends
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:36.260]   data off, I like posting on Twitter," things like that.
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:42.540]   Well, at that point, you need to basically justify how much that convenience is going
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:48.300]   to ultimately be worth to you, because being able to keep that convenience is going to
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:53.860]   drastically impact the bottom line on how much you can potentially save with your communications
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:57.220]   budget. Correct, but there are some options that
[01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:03.940]   we're going to get to with some of these carriers, sorry, some of these MVNOs, and where just
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:10.660]   by at least by switching to a prepaid plan, you can have everything except like 4G YouTube
[01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:17.780]   videos. So that was where for a while I was on Straight Talk. I still cut $30 a month
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:23.420]   off my plan by switching from AT&T to Straight Talk, and I could still have...I had unlimited
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:27.620]   data. Well, that's different now, which we'll get to in a minute, but I had unlimited talk,
[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:34.900]   unlimited text, and yet it saved me a good bit of money, and I could still use all those
[01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:39.500]   apps. So those options are there. They're just still going to be in the, what, $40 to
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:45.980]   $50 a month range instead of the $10 to $20. Yeah, potentially, and even then, you're still...there's
[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:51.540]   no such thing as unlimited anything. You read the contracts, and there's going to be caps
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:57.220]   in place. Well, so let's go there. What do we look for? How do we choose between people?
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:00.900]   If I'm...because we're going to, on the show notes, we're going to give people a list of
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:06.980]   providers to consider and see what's appropriate for them. What do we look for? Well, first
[01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:13.380]   thing you need to look for is a provider that's going to be able to provide you all the features
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:20.580]   that you actually need. Not all MVNOs provide things like call forwarding, for example.
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:26.540]   So if call forwarding is important to you, you need to look for a provider that gives
[01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:35.140]   you call forwarding. If cheaper data services is more important to you than cost per minute,
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:41.980]   then you need to find a provider that gives you cheaper per megabyte costs on the prepaid
[01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:50.560]   end than per minute. And the best way to find out what you're actually going to get out
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:56.820]   of your service is to actually sit down and read the contract.
[01:07:56.820 --> 01:08:00.660]   Nobody does that, Will. Come on. Seriously.
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:01.660]   Everybody needs to.
[01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:07.740]   I know. It's been...I've read some of your posts on the Superguide, and it's pretty...I
[01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:11.820]   never used to read those things. And kind of reading through some of your posts when
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:16.260]   I saw some of the stuff that was in there, I mean, you're exactly right. It's foolish.
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:21.300]   I've started reading all those things when you get an application, because there's...especially
[01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:30.060]   with all the privacy stuff with Snowden, it's a good wake-up call for people to say, "Okay,
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:34.460]   I know that...I always knew that everything was public, but let me actually read these
[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:38.220]   terms of service. What does this actually say? What am I literally signing? Yes, I'm
[01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:39.220]   fine with this."
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:49.260]   Yeah. Let's take Street Talk and Net10 and their unlimited bring-your-own-device services.
[01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:53.220]   Have you actually sat down and read the terms of service from them?
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:57.940]   No, I read your...I haven't. I read your analysis on the Superguide.
[01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:03.140]   Well, basically, right there in black and white, they basically state that they can
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:10.220]   terminate you for using streaming media or any other bandwidth-intensive data usage that
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:18.940]   falls outside of email, purchasing songs online, and very basic web surfing and instant messenger
[01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:27.020]   communication. What good is unlimited data service if they have you so thoroughly tied
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:36.180]   on what you can and cannot do that you'd never be able to even break two gig worth of traffic
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:37.180]   a month?
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:43.900]   Yeah. And that...they've...man, I tell you, Street Talk got a lot...if you go online and
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:48.020]   you start looking in the forums, they've cut so many people off of their data and just,
[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:49.780]   boom, the whole thing just stops working.
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:58.020]   And you lose your number, you lose any remaining credit you paid. I feel really sorry for the
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:04.780]   folks with, like, Street Talk who, "Ooh, if I pay for a year in advance, I can get it
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:11.980]   down from that $45 a month down to, what is it, like, $40?" And then two weeks in, they're
[01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:16.820]   streaming something off of YouTube, and they wind up losing their service because they're
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:17.820]   in...
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:20.820]   You've got to call Mexico to get to speak to the customers.
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:25.180]   Yeah, and they're not going to do anything for you anyway except, you know what, you
[01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:31.700]   kiss your money goodbye because you breached the terms of service contract, and they get
[01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:36.140]   to keep your money, they get to keep your phone number if you liked it, and, I mean,
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:43.540]   that's the way it is. So it's important to read the contract to see what is provided,
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:48.540]   what's not provided, and what can get you ultimately booted. And that's one of the things
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:57.940]   that makes the claim of unlimited so dangerous with a lot of these providers. And it is something,
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:05.180]   even with the good providers, that you need to be aware of. There are clauses wherever
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:15.180]   unlimited is bandied about that they can arbitrarily define what constitutes network abuse and
[01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:24.500]   terminate you. And if you truly need the ability to have, like, 5,000, 6,000 minutes a month,
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:29.260]   you need to either pay for those... You need a provider where you can actually pay for
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:36.420]   those minutes, or you need a provider who's going to tolerate that level of usage. And
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:39.420]   that's not going to be from an end to you know.
[01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:45.900]   Yeah, yeah. Yeah, there still is a place for the big four. You know, we're pretty hard
[01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:51.820]   on them, but it's all about, just like with anything, and I know my show is brand new,
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:58.380]   but I'll tell you just kind of who I am. The thing that drives me nuts is anybody saying
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:05.580]   that this is the way it is, especially talking heads on, you know, and things. People always
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:10.060]   say, "Well, this is how it is." Well, I think that the reality is that each person is going
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:17.540]   to know their usage patterns, and we can challenge them like we're doing to say, "Do you really
[01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:23.900]   need this? Is it not worth doing something?" But at the end of the day, there are going
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:28.340]   to be people who are going to need 6,000 minutes a month, and they're going to be out in the
[01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:32.260]   boonies, and so Verizon is the only tower that's going to work there, and they need
[01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:38.980]   a smartphone because, you know, that's their only connection to the grid. You know, that's
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:42.340]   a good spot for an iPhone on Verizon, right?
[01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:51.620]   Yeah, if you need it, if you have the justification to do it, then do so. It's all about using
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:13:00.660]   it as a tool, though, and prioritizing what's more important. When you're questioning whether
[01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:07.260]   it's worth spending even like $70 a month on a cell phone, then you are clearly paying
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:17.560]   too much. If you can't see the value to it, then you're already there. You need to make
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:25.980]   the cut. Going back around a little bit, I have to point out how absurd it is in this
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:32.940]   country that in order to actually be able to save money on our cell phone bills, that
[01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:41.020]   we have to actually abandon the major four carriers and go to third-party resellers of
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:47.760]   those services who have their own overhead and their own technical support and sales
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:59.080]   support people just to be able to save money. It's mind-blowing, but it is what it is, and
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:06.340]   as long as the only way to get affordable service is to do the song and dance, then
[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:12.240]   let's help people do the song and dance. It's not as hard as, say, trying to talk your cable
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:20.000]   provider into shaving $10 a month off of your internet connection again for like six months.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.200]   You just pay for it and you go.
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:30.040]   >> Yeah. Yeah. Let's give some people, on the comment you just made, one quick comment,
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:39.380]   my hope, and I think it's really possible, I bet you, whatever you want to bet, a cold
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:46.080]   Coke or whatever, I bet you that in two years, my hope is that all this information that
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:51.220]   we're giving is hopelessly out of date because the major carriers are losing so much, the
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:55.860]   contract players are losing so much business that they have to wise up and say, "You know
[01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:56.860]   what? We've got to change something."
[01:14:56.860 --> 01:15:01.760]   >> Well, technically speaking, last year was the first year that they've actually had negative
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:07.720]   growth in the cell phone industry, and it's been because Americans have finally started
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:11.040]   going over to more and more prepaid plans through MV&Os.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:17.080]   >> Well, good. Maybe we'll continue to contribute to that, and they'll wake up when they get
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.080]   to that.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.080]   >> Yep.
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:24.240]   >> So let's go to some providers. Before we do, though, I want to show why this is such
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:30.600]   a big deal because my fear is that people maybe have heard this, and we've talked, I
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:35.720]   think, pretty straightforwardly about the advantages and disadvantages, but I just want
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:41.200]   to talk about the impact of saving money. So I'm going to run it quick. I've got my
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:45.040]   trusty financial calculator here, and here is one of the things that I did. So I said
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:51.400]   I was previously paying about $220 a month with AT&T for the two phones and the iPad
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:59.600]   line, unlimited everything, and I've switched that to, like I said, to $35 with Internet
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:03.960]   at Home. Instead of using unlimited data on the phones, I switched to Internet at Home,
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:10.880]   and then we're using Air Voice. So that's $185 a month of savings. So let me run a quick
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:16.920]   calculation here. Let's say $185 a month into an investment account. Let's just for round
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:24.360]   numbers say that we use 10%. And let's see, our target, I don't know, let's say that we're
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:29.520]   doing this at 30 years old and over the course of 30 years of savings, right? So let me use
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:36.320]   a 30-year period of time, starting with nothing. If I took that money and invested that, my
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:40.560]   trusty financial calculator here at a 10% rate of return, which is a historical average
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:47.560]   of the stock market, $421,675.18.
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:51.560]   Oh, shucks. I was figuring you'd at least be a millionaire by that point.
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:57.680]   Here, I'll go to 40 years. I'll go to 40 years. So we'll call this 25 to 65, and we'll go
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:04.680]   to 40 years here, and we'll have $1,179,704.35.
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:16.000]   There we go. And suddenly I'm reminded of that old Joy of Tech comic where the kid goes
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:23.120]   to his financial advisor asking about if he should invest in an iPhone, and the financial
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:27.640]   advisor goes, "Well, if you invested that money instead, you'd be a millionaire by the
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:34.640]   time you retired." And the last panelist, "iPhone 3G! Woo-hoo!"
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:38.920]   That's exactly true, and that's why it's such a big deal, because a lot of times we forget
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:43.800]   that, yes, I like convenience. I like apps and things like that, but the opportunity
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:49.320]   cost is that now I'm likely to have, based upon the changes that I've done, and just
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:53.960]   by being willing to download podcasts when I'm on Wi-Fi instead of on the road, and by
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:59.680]   being willing to use my GPS in the car that doesn't need data, just a few very small,
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:04.200]   minor things, it's likely to result in an extra half million to a million dollars of
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:10.880]   net worth in my lifetime, just that one little change. So it's a big deal.
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:16.440]   My encouragement for folks listening is that run your own calculation. Maybe 40 years is
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:20.120]   a long time. It always feels a little silly when you go that far out, because it's hard
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:28.680]   to imagine 40 years. Maybe figure it on a year. $185 a month is, in a year's time, that
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:34.400]   comes out to $2,220. That's a really nice trip to a foreign country.
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:41.800]   What is it that Pete there, Mr. Money Mustache, what is it he always says? $10 saved every
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:47.160]   month is like $100 invested permanently or something such as that?
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:54.880]   He uses a really useful rule of thumb. He uses 173. He says take your monthly number,
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:19:00.640]   multiply it times 173, and that will give you a 10-year return. I think he used, I can't
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:08.680]   remember, it's an 8% return. So let's say, in my example, using his formula, $185 times
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:14.320]   173, quick and easy over a 10-year period of time. If you take that money and invest
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:18.640]   it instead, that's $32,000. So big money.
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.400]   Yep, it really is.
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:25.680]   Big money. All right, providers. So first one on our list is Airvoice. I'll go first
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:30.920]   because this one's the one that I'm using. I know your favorite one is the second one
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:37.000]   on our list. So I'll comment on Airvoice since I've done some research on that one, and then
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.640]   you can fill in any gaps I missed.
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:39.640]   Okay.
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:46.920]   So first of all, Airvoice is an MVNO that resells space on the AT&T towers. I've switched
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:53.040]   to them four months ago. They've been great. They really have been great. Even just signing
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:59.080]   it up, I don't know all the technical stuff, but the people answer the phone in English.
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:03.680]   They know what they're doing, and I can tell that they're probably in the US. If not, they've
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:05.240]   got really good accent.
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:10.600]   Well, they are located out of the Great Lakes area. I think Airvoice is actually up in Chicago,
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:12.200]   if I recall correctly.
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:19.080]   Okay. Well, they're doing a really good job. They have a plan that's a $10 a month plan.
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:24.960]   So you have $10 a month, and you can split that out into any combination of voice minutes,
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:29.000]   text or data. And voice is billed at four cents a minute. Texts are billed at two cents
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:34.640]   a text message, and data is billed at 33 cents a megabyte, right?
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:44.080]   And so that comes out to your $10. If you do that, $10 comes out to 250 minutes, 500
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:48.280]   text messages, or I don't figure out the data thing. The data price seems really high to
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:49.800]   me, so I just don't use the data.
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:55.600]   Yeah. It's something like a 30 megabyte of data or something such as that. Some insulting
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:21:02.280]   amount of data, which I mean, honestly, if... We're talking reduced data rates, but the
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:10.440]   way AT&T charges their MVNOs for data, you'd think the stuff was made out of the finest
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:19.520]   gold and jewel-encrusted bits of data that were somehow magically entrusted upon you
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:28.080]   through the network. It's just... It's absurd. But it's neither here nor there.
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:30.680]   So what did I miss on Airvoice? Did I miss anything?
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:38.240]   A couple things. Airvoice does offer auto-renew plans, which is actually pretty rare in the
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:47.640]   MVNO market. They do have rollover with that plan, so anything you don't use out of that
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:55.840]   $10 every month is going to continue to carry over, so you're not just losing what you don't
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:02.720]   use at the end. It'll keep going, and that's one of the nice things about averaging out
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:09.660]   your usages. If you do wind up having a couple of lighter usage months followed by a really
[01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:16.800]   heavy usage month, given that rollover is there, it's going to be able to absorb the
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:23.720]   shock of using more than what you normally buy, and that can be incredibly useful to
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:31.080]   know. Let's see, Airvoice also does call forwarding on their per-minute plans. Not their unlimited,
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:37.320]   but on their per-minute plans, so that's something to keep in mind for those of you who are using
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:45.800]   like Femto cells in your homes to try and get coverage in your house where you're not
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:52.520]   actually getting like AT&T reception. You can set up your cell phone to forward to your
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:56.960]   handy new voice number if you like, and then you don't have to worry about missing any
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:57.960]   calls.
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:05.760]   That's cool. I saw in the notes here about the call forwarding, but I didn't think about
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:08.880]   why that's important, so that makes sense to me.
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:13.920]   Of course, you're still going to get billed per minute, and you'll want to be real careful
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:20.880]   about not staying too long on calls where you know it's been forwarded through, but
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:26.080]   it is something to consider and something that can be potentially useful, and beyond
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:32.080]   that, they're basically a bring-your-own-device company, so as long as you have a carrier-unlocked
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:35.960]   GSM cell phone, you're set to go.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:40.360]   And also, on the $10 a month thing, I want to emphasize, because I actually was talking
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:48.320]   with some friends last night about it. If I run out of texts per minute, I just buy
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:53.720]   another $10, and, "Oh, I spent $20 this month. Big deal."
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:57.440]   "Oh, I've doubled my expenses!"
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:06.120]   I mean, if you actually run it, even at those rates, let's say that I do $30 of minutes
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:11.840]   divided by $0.04, that's 750 minutes. That's a lot of talking, and yet I'm still cheaper
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.880]   than I was.
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:19.200]   For me, the reason I love it so much is because I can still have all the fun of my iPhone.
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:24.960]   I have my Kindle on there, so if I'm waiting in line, I can read a Kindle book. I've
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:29.680]   still got all of the usefulness of all of my applications, but I just am using it kind
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:36.200]   of like an iPod Touch or a tablet that doesn't have a data connection, but yet I can still
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:39.040]   get the few phone calls and texts that I want to get.
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:43.120]   So it's been super, super – we love it. We're super pleased with it.
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:51.000]   >> By that same token, though, if you're consistently having to spend $25, $30 a month
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.720]   on per-minute costs, then you might want to reevaluate whether you want to stick with
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:25:01.720]   per-minute or potentially jump up to one of their "unlimited plans" on the talk and
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:02.720]   text.
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:09.040]   >> Yeah, I've only had one – you're exactly right. I've only had one month where I wound
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:13.120]   up doing $20 instead of $10 because I was on the road. Actually, the reason it was,
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:14.120]   I had a car accident.
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:15.120]   >> That'd do it.
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:20.240]   >> Yeah, so I'm on the side of the road and I needed to turn data on to get on the
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:23.440]   Internet and get some phone numbers and stuff while I'm sitting on the side of the road.
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:28.920]   So I burned through $6 of data on the side of the road, but hey, whatever. That's what
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:32.360]   it's there for. So it was fine.
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.400]   Next on the list, your favorite, PlatinumTel.
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:41.600]   >> Yeah, PlatinumTel – technically, PlatinumTel has a sister company called GiveMobile as
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:49.640]   well. We'll get to them in a minute. They're on the T-Mobile network. They've got U.S.-based
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:56.480]   customer support just like AirVoice does. Same region of the country as well. Kind,
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:03.080]   wonderful folks up in the Great Lakes region. We as a country do not give those people near
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:12.560]   the credit they really deserve. They're just salt of the earth, man. But their voice prices
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:18.720]   per minute are a penny higher than AirVoice's $10 plan, so you're spending five cents a
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:26.880]   minute. But their text rates are the same, and more importantly, their per megabyte charge
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:39.200]   is basically nearly a third of what AirVoice is charging. Yeah, 10 cents a megabyte. So
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:47.320]   you can actually – that's a fair chunk of data. I mean, 10 bucks will get you 100 megabytes,
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:57.200]   so that's not too bad. We're talking in an era where we're talking about 100 megabytes
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:07.880]   of data for $10 isn't bad. This is embarrassing. Welcome to the future, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:16.320]   Thank you, data caps. But you got cheap data prices. They don't have any auto-renew, but
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:25.760]   they have really long airtime with their pay as you go. 10 bucks gets you 60 days of service,
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:36.120]   20 gets you 90, and it just keeps going up until I think 100 bucks gets you a year. And
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:43.120]   that takes care of things sufficiently to where you don't have to sweat things too much
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:50.200]   on, "Oh, I got to stay on top of it every month to renew stuff." If you just buy a
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:57.600]   giant wad of – you figure out how much you need in the way of minutes and say if you
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:04.520]   figure you're going to wind up using about 10 bucks airtime a month, go ahead and get
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:11.720]   like the $100 of airtime, and then you don't really have to worry about it until a year
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:16.160]   from now. You'll get the little message, "Hi, you need to pay before this such and
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:21.040]   such a date or else your service is going to get cut off and you'll lose any rollover."
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:26.720]   But even if you wind up missing that time, if you read their terms of service, which
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:34.320]   is actually one of the shortest in the industry, you've got something like 30 or 60 days after
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:43.680]   that point to reactivate the account and keep your phone number, which is a drastic shift
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:49.680]   in what a lot of people are used to with like Straight Talk, Net10, and TrackPhone, where
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:29:00.640]   basically you let your account lapse, you lose your number within 24 hours. It emphasizes
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:09.640]   again that you need to read the terms of service. But I mean, they're forgiving. And I mean,
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:16.520]   PlatinumTel really shines as a per-minute pay-as-you-go provider. They're a little
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:25.160]   more expensive than T-Mobile's own GoSmart for the "unlimited packages," but by the
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:32.320]   same token, PlatinumTel's customer service is just that much better than anything T-Mobile's
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:44.320]   ever going to provide you, especially on their prepaid services. And to that regard, too,
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:49.480]   with GiveMobile, their sister company, it's a service that just launched a few months
[01:29:49.480 --> 01:30:00.160]   back. For the same price as those unlimited packages on the PlatinumTel end, on the Give
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:06.440]   end, they donate 8% of your bill to three charities of your choice from like a list
[01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:15.640]   of 45 that they support. So you get better -- you may wind up paying a little bit more
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:26.360]   than GoSmart for the same amount of data and unlimited talk and text, but you get better
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:32.000]   customer service and you have the option of doing good in the world.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:38.440]   >> I wonder if they send you a receipt so that you can deduct your 8% of yourself.
[01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:45.320]   >> I doubt it. That's not something I'd consider outright charity on your behalf because you
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:47.880]   got the middle man there. But I mean, it's still --
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:50.520]   >> It feels good and it helps.
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:58.720]   >> Yeah, it helps. And more people need to be charitable, doggone it. We need to do more
[01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:06.480]   good with our money. And if you can potentially do that by switching to a provider that does
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:16.640]   that, hey, just like Credo Wireless over on Sprint, if the billing works for you and the
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:22.320]   organizations that they support float your boat, go for it, man. It's better than just
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:32.480]   flushing the money directly down the chute and can potentially help other people.
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:34.960]   >> And they have international options, right?
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:42.080]   >> Yeah, PlatinumTel, that's one of the things where you wind up getting that price differential.
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:46.920]   The reason why they seem a little more expensive than like GoSmart for basically the exact
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:52.360]   same service or very close to it, it's because they've already got international services
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:32:01.400]   rolled into it. So in actuality, if you need like international texting or whatnot, then
[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:08.040]   PlatinumTel and Give are going to cost the same amount of money per month as GoSmart
[01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:18.000]   is with that international bundle added on. So you might as well just go the one route
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000]   versus the other anyway.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.160]   >> Got it. GoSmart then, you're just mentioning them. What's the deal with GoSmart?
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:30.360]   >> GoSmart's actually a new brand owned by T-Mobile. They've been making a big push into
[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:35.600]   the MVNO marketplace themselves the past few months. And they don't have any pay-as-you-go
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:44.120]   stuff. But if you're in that category of $30 plus a month on your cell phone service and
[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:50.280]   you just can't rope your usage in, but you want to go with a T-Mobile provider that has
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:55.360]   cheap data, GoSmart's going to be the one you want to go to.
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:33:01.800]   >> So that would be good for my young friends who are iPhone app developers that say, "There's
[01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:06.120]   no chance that I'm going to... Joshua, you're being a dumb-dumb here thinking that I'm going
[01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:10.200]   to give up all my data usage." But I go, "Okay, listen, consider GoSmart, right?"
[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:18.320]   >> Yeah. For $45 a month, you can get that unlimited talk text and 5 gig of unmetered,
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:25.920]   unthrottled data. And then after that 5 gig, you'll get throttled down to edge speeds.
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:32.720]   But I mean, anyone who's able to use 5 gig of data a month on a cell phone really is
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:36.200]   using so much data that they need to be on a desktop anyway.
[01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:41.400]   >> Yeah. That's a monster. And you would say even though straight talk offers similar,
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:44.240]   although theirs is capped at what, 3 or 4, I think...
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:48.640]   >> Well, that's the thing. They don't actually disclose what their caps are.
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:55.320]   >> Okay. Yeah. You're right. You're right. But at least you would say GoSmart better
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:56.320]   than straight talk, right?
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:01.480]   >> Yeah, absolutely. And fact of the matter is, is I think straight talk, America Mobile
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:08.400]   actually switched over to T-Mobile as their primary SIM card provider now. So honestly,
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:14.840]   for the money, you're getting no better. The only thing is, is you're getting an even longer
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:21.240]   contract with an even longer terms of service with even more dubious points of contention
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:29.920]   where they can just terminate your service without any warning or question. So if you're
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:37.080]   going to wind up on a T-Mobile network anyway for your data service, go with someone where
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:43.240]   they're actually upfront and honest about how much data you're actually going to use.
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:47.840]   >> I got--I just--I thought I had heard something and I just went and Googled it while you were
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:52.160]   talking. I heard--I was listening to Clark Howard the other day and he had really recommended
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:56.520]   straight talk but all of his listeners were so frustrated with not knowing the cap. So
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:03.640]   they hammered on straight talk and they finally got straight talk to give the number.
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:04.640]   >> Really?
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:07.880]   >> Yeah, 2.5 gigs. I'll send you the--I'll send you the--
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:08.880]   >> 2.5 gig.
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:16.360]   >> Yeah. So I'll send you the link and I'll put it in the show notes on his blog. So 2.5
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:21.520]   gigs of high speed data. After 2.5, you're throttled to--you're throttled down and there's
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:25.400]   a hard cap at 4 gigs. So their unsubmitted data is 2.5 gigs.
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:32.360]   >> It was a hard cap at 4 gig. And even more interestingly is that may be, you know, 2.5
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:37.600]   gig in a month but if I recall correctly, their data throttling practices are actually
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:43.480]   on a daily basis. So if you exceed something like--I want to say that others had kind of
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:49.720]   figured out that the daily cap was like somewhere around 70, 80 megabyte and you exceeded that
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:56.320]   and they'd already start to throttle you for the rest of the day. So, yeah. Let me tell
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:36:04.440]   you, the best place for resources on finding out the more unsavory side of any particular
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:10.560]   MVNO carrier, even the good ones here, and it's important with research. You really need
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:16.240]   to know who you're dealing with and you should look at both good and bad with any of them.
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:21.480]   But I mean, Howard Forums is just an absolute fantastic resource for that because you're
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:26.280]   going to get full spectrum. You're going to have the people who absolutely love the service.
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:34.200]   You're going to have the people who absolutely hate it. And there is value in negative feedback
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:39.960]   because you can tell by that negative feedback where the problems and the shortcomings are
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:43.880]   in the service. >> So you said Howard Forums?
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:48.680]   >> Yes, Howard Forums. >> Okay. I'll look that up and put it in
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:55.440]   the show. Moving on, Ting. My brother uses Ting and he--they got this thing where like
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:00.600]   you change your plan every month based upon your usage, right?
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:06.080]   >> Yeah. It's basically kind of this hybrid prepaid, postpaid, paid monster, kind of the
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:11.440]   best of both worlds in a lot of regards. And they have some really nice tools that allow
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:22.160]   you to restrict and cap usage and really good provider if you need several--if you're doing
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:27.640]   like the family plan type of thing where you just want one bill for everyone and they'll
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:35.000]   basically, you know, you pool everyone's usage together and bill you only for what you're
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:42.160]   actually used. There's no unlimited anything there. They're a newer company. I typically
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:49.920]   try and skew towards older established MVNOs simply because the marketplace is just so
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:57.080]   cutthroat and brutal. So like Airvoice and PlatinumTel, they're really the granddaddies
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:02.160]   of the MVNO marketplace. They've been--they've both been around for over a decade just like
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:08.240]   Virgin Mobile has, though technically Virgin was bought out by Sprint. So that's kind of
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:17.320]   cheating a little bit on that particular number. But you want to go with providers who've proven
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:24.240]   themselves in the marketplace. But I do make exceptions on rare occasion. Ting is one of
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:29.120]   them. They've only been around for like a year and a half, but they're backed by 2Cows.
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:34.280]   You remember the company back in the late '90s where you used to go for like freeware
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:36.600]   and shareware on the internet?
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:37.600]   >> Yeah.
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:38.600]   >> Yeah.
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:39.600]   >> Yeah.
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:47.120]   >> That's them. They're actually a pretty large internet services provider and back
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:54.240]   bone bandwidth, the whole nine. And they recently got into MVNO usage. And one of the other
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:39:05.120]   nice things is Sprint's network is, I believe, the smallest network footprint on the nation.
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:11.080]   With Ting, they actually allow for voice roaming with Verizon as well. So that kind of fills
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:18.480]   in a lot of gaps and shortcomings for a lot of Sprint MVNO users. So if you're seriously
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:24.880]   thinking about going Sprint, you need to go with the Sprint MVNO, you should probably
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:29.320]   consider using Ting. And it doesn't hurt that they actually let you bring your own Sprint
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:30.320]   device as well.
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:37.360]   >> Cool. Cool. Virgin Mobile, is that still owned by Richard Branson or did he sell that
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.360]   off?
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:44.840]   >> No, he sold it off a couple of years after establishing it here. And Virgin Mobile in
[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:47.640]   this country is actually owned by Sprint. Just like...
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:52.200]   >> My sister's on their network and she's had a good deal with just with the dumb phone
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:55.000]   for a long time. But she's really liked their service.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:01.920]   >> Yeah. Their prices and services aren't too bad for both packages that skew more towards
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:11.400]   voice usage and other plans that skew more towards data usage. They're decent enough.
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:22.960]   And if you just absolutely positively have to have a CDMA-based iPhone, go Virgin Mobile.
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:27.360]   >> So CDMA, you mean if you were on Verizon?
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:33.160]   >> If you were...well, if you've got good Sprint coverage, clearly, because you're really
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:38.280]   not going to be able to bring any sort of iPhone over to a Verizon MVNO. But if you
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:45.200]   just absolutely positively have to have CDMA coverage and you have to have an iPhone, then
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:46.200]   you...
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:50.680]   >> What I'm asking is the CDMA, I thought it was Verizon that used CDMA. Is Sprint...
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:53.680]   >> Both Sprint and...yeah, both Sprint and Verizon.
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:59.280]   >> Okay. Do you think that...is there any deals to be had there if somebody buys a CDMA
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:01.920]   iPhone off eBay or something? Is that something to be...
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:07.720]   >> No. You have to buy the iPhone straight from Virgin. It's got to be a Virgin-branded
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:18.040]   device. They don't really...they kind of have a bring your own Sprint device policy unofficially,
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:24.800]   but it's kind of difficult to do. It's just easier to buy an actual Virgin-branded device.
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:31.400]   It cuts down on portability, but...and you're already getting clipped hard on the whole
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:38.160]   portability and taking your handset wherever you go with a CDMA provider anyway, so...
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:41.400]   >> Okay. Let's see, PagePlus.
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:52.240]   >> Yes, PagePlus. They're currently a...they're a Verizon-based MVNO. They've got a reasonably
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:42:00.840]   decent history and track record of good...they've got good packages at good price points, but
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:07.240]   I am getting a little hesitant on the idea of recommending them anymore because...you
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:15.520]   know how I keep kind of not saying the kindest things about the realities of services from,
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:23.560]   you know, like Straight Talk, Net10, TrackPhone, any of the other America Mobile-branded services?
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:37.200]   America Mobile put in a bid to buy out PagePlus's parent company, and pretty much every MVNO
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:45.680]   that America Mobile has bought out has ultimately gone over to the worse, I'm sorry to say.
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:56.240]   I just...the support is terrible. The prices for what you're getting are not that competitive.
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:05.440]   I find it hilarious that people think they're getting, like, this fantastic deal on TrackPhone
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:11.600]   with, you know, triple minutes for life on the goofy little proprietary phone that they
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:18.000]   sell you, and you do the math and the triple minutes for life, you're still paying, you
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:27.400]   know, you're still paying, let's see, $20 for 90 minutes, so you're getting, like, oh
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:37.800]   geez, 270 minutes for 20 bucks. Well, even the PlatinumTel 200 minutes is, you know,
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:44.320]   10. You're way overpaying. But we'll kind of get more...I've jumped off of PagePlus
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:52.000]   and gone straight to...I've gone straight to the America Mobile properties, but back
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:59.120]   to PagePlus. For the moment, they've still got some good plans, and they've kind of been
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:10.040]   the default go-to for Verizon refugees who just wanted to get out. And unless you need
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:18.560]   to bring an LP device or a BlackBerry or an iPhone, you can usually just bring your Verizon
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:27.640]   device over with you as well without any problems. But given the whole America Mobile thing,
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:34.280]   you know, we do need to...what happens if we lose PagePlus? Well, there is an outfit
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:39.480]   called Talk for Good. They're kind of new. I am a little skittish about their long-term
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:46.680]   survivability, but odds are if the deal goes through for PagePlus, they've pretty much
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:54.120]   got it locked and made as long as they, you know, don't extend themselves too thin. So
[01:44:54.120 --> 01:45:05.080]   same benefits right there. So consider them potentially as well, but do keep in mind that
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:13.000]   they haven't been on the scene for that long. So caveat dumped or, you know.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:20.960]   - Got it. Straight Talk, Net10, TrackPhone, you pretty much covered, not a huge fan. And
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:24.520]   we've talked a few times about Straight Talk. Is there anything that they do well? Like,
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:26.360]   is there any reason to go for them?
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:28.160]   - Well, if you're...
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:35.040]   - That was kind of a leading question. I didn't mean to sound quite that bad, but I mean...
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:42.400]   - Well, as a perfectly cromulent, horrible response to that question, if you're a masochist,
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:51.200]   why not? But, you know, there are limited situations where they may be of use. Like
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:57.920]   if you are up in the $40 to $50 a month range where you're wanting to bring your own device
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:04.560]   and you need the ability...where you're on a GSM carrier and you need the ability to
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:16.600]   roam off network from your primary provider. Like if your T-Mobile coverage or your AT&T
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:21.360]   coverage isn't sufficient for every place you go, but is mostly sufficient, but you
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:29.520]   still need that critical reception that's more than just 911 service access, and you
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:39.520]   can justify, you know, the usage and the money, then yeah, you could find a case for usage
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:50.280]   on that in certain situations, but not often. So...
[01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:54.920]   When you get down to it, it's all about doing the math. Do the math for what they're actually
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:59.600]   charging for those services, and you're going to find that there are going to be better
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:06.520]   providers out there offering the exact same service for cheaper. And you don't have to
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:11.400]   use their crummy phones.
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:14.200]   - And I guess you figured, who's the guy that owns those...
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:15.200]   - Carlos Slim.
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:21.200]   - The richest man in the world. So he's doing okay. He'll be all right. He's out here, I
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:22.200]   guess.
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:24.200]   - He's on his bottom line, not giving them any business.
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:28.440]   - Yeah. Of course, Carlos, if you need anything, call me. I'm happy to help. You know, we can
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:35.200]   help you work out your customer service problems here. Republic Wireless.
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:41.360]   - Okay. We were talking earlier about the dangers of potentially, you know, getting
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:49.040]   all of your service through data, and this is Republic Wireless and Freedom Pops actually
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:59.840]   introducing a new phone service here through their data as well. And like I said, I was
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:06.600]   out in the thick of the May 31st tornado here in Oklahoma, the one that ripped through El
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:16.160]   Reno, and I noticed that the first thing that went was data. Second thing to go was voice,
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:23.120]   and the third to go was SMS. And as much as I would love to like Republic Wireless and
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:32.560]   Freedom Pop for, you know, providing these "incredibly cheap, unlimited services," I
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:42.800]   can't because all it is is VoIP service wrapped up in a proprietary mobile phone. And that
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:49.400]   means you're getting the worst of both mobile service and VoIP. And you're restricted to
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:54.880]   the Sprint network, which, you know, doesn't exactly have some of the fastest data speeds
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:49:04.720]   anyway, especially on the MVNO end. And if you wind up being in an emergency situation
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:10.600]   with an emergency phone, and the first thing to go is your data service, you've basically
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:19.400]   lost all forms of communication with that device. So that needs to be something that
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:25.920]   you are aware of. And if you really want an emergency communications device, you need
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:31.320]   to be able to go through multiple channels of communication, and you can't do that with
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:37.240]   those providers. You think you can, but you can't.
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:42.880]   >> That makes sense. So it would -- so those -- because I, you know, I like the Republic
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:51.760]   Wireless idea. I mean, basically their deal is $19. Their drum they beat is $19 a month,
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:55.600]   no caps on anything. And the reason we can give it to you really cheap is because we're
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:00.800]   going to run you through Wi-Fi when we're on Wi-Fi, and then we're going to trust you
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:05.080]   to be part of the family and not go too high on your usage when you're not on Wi-Fi.
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:10.320]   >> But in reality, if you use too much data, you're going to wind up losing your service
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:17.400]   anyway. And let's be honest, if you're going to be saddled at home using a VoIP provider
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:25.200]   anyway, why do it through the worst possible way to do it? Why not just properly get a
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:32.440]   cheaper VoIP provider like VoIPo or some such and just go that path?
[01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:39.680]   >> Yeah. It's -- you're right. I was -- I recommended recently Republic Wireless to
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:44.680]   my sister because she's on a dumb phone with Virgin Mobile, and she's, you know, years
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:48.880]   later she's like, "I think I'm finally ready to go ahead and get a smartphone." So I said,
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:52.120]   "Well, you know, you've got this great cheap plan. If you really want a smartphone, you
[01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:56.400]   don't use that much. You're at the house where you've got Wi-Fi all day. Why don't you, you
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:00.720]   know, consider this Android that Republic Wireless has. It's probably good enough for
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:06.120]   you to get the experience of the smartphone without going too high." But, you know, your
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:10.920]   point about the risks of everything being on the data connection is exactly, you know,
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:18.800]   it's well received. What would you -- so what would you recommend to her, you know, to get
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:22.600]   the smartphone experience? You know, because I didn't want her to -- my conundrum was I
[01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:26.760]   didn't want her to be worrying about not using data on the road. So I figured, well, the
[01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:30.800]   easiest thing if she wants the smartphone experience would be Republic Wireless.
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:36.600]   >> Well, you're not really going to get much of a smartphone experience with Republic Wireless
[01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:45.480]   anyway. But probably one of the T-Mobile providers, if that is that much of a concern with the
[01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:51.880]   whole, you know, smartphone experience, then, you know, go with the carrier that has the
[01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:55.280]   cheapest data services available, you know.
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:52:05.760]   >> Yeah. Makes sense. Let's see. Anything else on this list here? I guess next thing
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:11.280]   up on our list is that there are other features and talk us through Google Voice and other
[01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:12.280]   providers.
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:16.480]   >> Well, Google Voice, it's a great -- a lot of people use it to augment their service
[01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:25.000]   with and -- but because it's basically VoIP. So it makes things, you know, cheaper as long
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:30.560]   as, you know, you're not having to pay too awful much for your data. But the thing that
[01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:34.640]   a lot of people don't realize is a lot of Google Voice's features are not exclusive
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:41.840]   to Google Voice. Things like global call hunt, SMS support, you know, voicemail to email,
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:48.640]   that sort of thing, cheap international rates, those can be had with services like VoIPO,
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:53:00.600]   VoIP MS, and call centric. So why get involved with Google's data mining? Because, I mean,
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:04.400]   let's face it, there's no such thing as a free lunch. So why bother?
[01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:10.240]   >> Yeah, Mr. Plummer needs to listen to my calls. It's okay.
[01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:16.520]   >> But I mean -- but it does highlight the necessity for using VoIP as a way to augment
[01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:24.080]   and cut down on prices. You want VoIP for your home. So, you know, Google Voice plus
[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:28.720]   Talkatone or an OB device at home, if you really want to go the Google Voice route,
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:29.720]   that can work.
[01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:30.720]   >> What is OB?
[01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:38.800]   >> The OB, the OB high devices like the OB 110, they're basically little ATAs that you
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:46.480]   can actually tie into Google Voice, just like Talkatone can on a smartphone. So --
[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:47.480]   >> Got it.
[01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:54.840]   >> Yeah, that basically allows you to tie like an old analog telephone to your Google
[01:53:54.840 --> 01:54:00.520]   Voice account. But you get what you pay for and Google Voice is not that great of a service.
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:05.480]   I take it from someone who's had them since the Grand Central days. The only reason why
[01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:16.560]   I'm still with them is purely the momentum and the fact that I don't want to give Google
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:19.560]   a credit card number.
[01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:25.920]   >> Here's one thing also that I like about Google Voice, and maybe there are others as
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:33.960]   well, but one thing I like about Google Voice is that I can have one phone number that I
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:39.400]   don't have to pay for as far as money out of pocket that I can always use. So even if
[01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:43.560]   I go out of the country for a month or a couple months or things like that, I can just shut
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:49.240]   off, especially with prepaid. It's so wonderful. I can just turn off my prepaid phones and
[01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:53.120]   no one has those numbers. I can disconnect any kind of like those services and save that
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:58.280]   money and Google Voice will email me my voicemails and I can call people on the road.
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:05.560]   >> And like I said, that's not a service exclusive to Google Voice anymore. Most really good
[01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:07.720]   VoIP providers already have that option as well.
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:11.320]   >> Do they have it for free, like without a monthly fee?
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:16.960]   >> Well, not without a monthly fee. If you're paying for VoIP service, but you do get it
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:22.280]   as part of the base package. You're not spending extra for it. So if you're already going to
[01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:28.040]   be spending money for VoIP service at home, why drag Google Voice into the mix when you
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:30.400]   can replicate those features for...
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:31.800]   >> That makes sense.
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:32.800]   >> Yeah.
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:36.520]   >> I'm with you. All right. Anybody else on that list? Anything special about phone power
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:37.520]   and NetTalk?
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:43.320]   >> Well, Talkatone, or sorry, not Talkatone, VoIPO, VoIPMS, Callcentric, Future9, Phone
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:51.960]   Power and NetTalk, those are kind of the core providers that offer some of the cheapest
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:55.720]   things. The thing with NetTalk is I'm not crazy about them because they're basically
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:56:01.680]   selling a proprietary device and you're locked into it. But if you're just absolutely positively
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:08.840]   looking for the absolute cheapest VoIP service at home possible, go NetTalk. It's going to
[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:19.080]   be cheaper than the MagicJack. The service is going to be better and you're not going
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:26.120]   to have the restrictions with it. But all of these providers, it's just like the MVNOs.
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:30.980]   You need to look to see what's going to give you the best options that you need because
[01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:37.120]   not all of them have things like SMS support. Not all of them have visual voicemail. Not
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:52.040]   all of them do global call hunt. And some of them have the option of a free second number.
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:57.160]   You just got to look at the services, what they offer, what their prices are and kind
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:57:02.840]   of determine where to go from there. But that said, of all of them, per month, if you're
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:07.120]   willing to pay for a couple of years up front, VoIP is going to be your cheapest, most feature-rich
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:08.120]   for the money.
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:18.400]   We may have to do another show just on VoIP because we're going long. I'd love to provide
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:24.320]   a resource just on VoIP and talk people through their options because you mentioned MagicJack,
[01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:28.480]   you mentioned these here. We haven't talked about Ooma. We don't need to go into it right
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:29.480]   now.
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:33.920]   I'm not a fan of Ooma. Don't get me started on Ooma.
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:37.640]   All right. Understood. We're going to have to have an extra one because it's interesting
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:41.720]   because Consumer Reports says Ooma is the best one for the last few years.
[01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:44.320]   Someone's not doing any math on that.
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:49.520]   I'll be interested in hearing your thoughts on it. And obviously, here's the other thing
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:55.440]   is that people need to understand where they're at as far as the technological side of it.
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:58:00.280]   So sometimes, if you just want a plug-and-play solution, you might need to choose one. It
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:07.800]   may not be the cheapest, but if you can bring together a situation, there's always little
[01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:10.960]   things that you can exploit if you know what you're doing.
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:11.960]   Absolutely.
[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:15.960]   And the last thing is, I think we said it before, but there's always the option of maybe
[01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:17.720]   you don't quite need a cell phone.
[01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:25.000]   Yeah. Maybe you don't actually need a cell phone. But by the same token, I can understand
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:31.520]   the concern for those people where, I mean, we've become a society without any payphones
[01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:38.000]   because of cell phones. So you want that emergency lifeline. Well, good news. You don't have
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:42.320]   to pay money for that emergency lifeline. If you're just looking for a phone that can
[01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:47.960]   dial 911 access, any decommissioned phone will work.
[01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:54.680]   Absolutely. And any phone is going to dial 911, no matter what it's going to dial. And
[01:58:54.680 --> 01:59:00.480]   here are my other things. If you need that emergency phone, that's thing one. Thing
[01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:07.880]   two is you can use either some sort of mobile device or tablet that has Wi-Fi. You can use
[01:59:07.880 --> 01:59:12.480]   an iPod Touch, a cheap iPod Touch off of eBay, and you can use that for all of the email
[01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:17.960]   stuff. And there's Wi-Fi everywhere. And/or you can always go and find an old Kindle 3G
[01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:21.520]   that will have limited email on the phone, and all that stuff is free.
[01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:26.680]   So for those who are pretty hardcore, there are lots of free solutions that you can accomplish.
[01:59:26.680 --> 01:59:30.880]   Absolutely. All right. I'm going to throw at you a couple
[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:35.640]   of scenarios. And because we've talked about a lot, and obviously, this has been really
[01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:39.720]   great. I've enjoyed it. I'm going to give you a couple of scenarios. And first, I want
[01:59:39.720 --> 01:59:48.960]   to give people carrier guidance. Because a lot of times you get into CDMA and GSM and
[01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:54.840]   all this, what phones work with what phones? So if I have an AT&T phone, of the list of
[01:59:54.840 --> 02:00:01.080]   MVNO providers that we're suggesting people look at, which of those providers will take
[02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:07.320]   my AT&T phone? Well, providers, without being carrier unlocked,
[02:00:07.320 --> 02:00:17.320]   you're pretty much stuck with AT&T MVNOs like Air Voice, H2O Wireless, a few others I'm
[02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:23.440]   at a loss for at the moment. But I mean... So that's two. So if my phone is not unlocked,
[02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:27.480]   I can take it to Air Voice or you said H2O Wireless?
[02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:29.880]   H2O. H2O Wireless.
[02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:36.360]   And conversely, if you're someone under an AT&T contract and you want a new phone, technically
[02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:40.880]   speaking, you can just buy one of those Go phones off the shelf, one of the AT&T's prepaid
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:46.280]   phones. They'll work just as well. Just drop a SIM card in and you're done.
[02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:53.720]   Got it. And now if my phone is unlocked but it's an AT&T phone, then I can go to Air Voice,
[02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:58.680]   PlatinumTel, who else? Pretty much any GSM provider.
[02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:08.440]   Which ones are the GSM providers? Well, Air Voice, GoSmart, PlatinumTel, GiveMobile.
[02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:15.120]   There's... Oh, geez. There's someone else I want to mention but I'm drawn a blank at
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:22.040]   the moment. They weren't that important. I primarily stick with just recommending those
[02:01:22.040 --> 02:01:29.940]   guys anyway simply because of the price and the service and the longevity. But basically,
[02:01:29.940 --> 02:01:34.680]   if any provider... Oh, Consumer Cellular. That's who I was talking about. They're kind
[02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:44.720]   of the GSM equivalent of Ting, only you have to manually juggle between tiers of service
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:53.280]   and they have really steep overages. And well, it's basically what you'd expect from the
[02:01:53.280 --> 02:02:02.320]   Ting experience if it was filtered through the AT&T distortion field.
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:13.160]   Got it. Consumer Cellular is actually not too terrible,
[02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:23.400]   but it's considerably more expensive as is pretty much nearly any AT&T MVNO. But any
[02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:29.160]   MVNO that provides a SIM card, you're going to be able to use in your unlocked AT&T or
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:35.320]   unlocked T-Mobile phone. So T-Mobile phones would be the same list that you just gave
[02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:43.060]   me for AT&T? Yeah. You are going to run into some issues
[02:02:43.060 --> 02:02:51.040]   if you're wanting high-speed data with like a T-Mobile MVNO. There are some changes being
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:58.080]   made, but if high-speed data really matters to you, you're probably going to want to get
[02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:08.040]   a Pentaband T-Mobile cell phone that's carrier unlocked to be able to take advantage of high-speed
[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:19.400]   access from a T-Mobile network provider. But beyond that, basically whatever applied for
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:28.980]   AT&T, you can switch it around for the T-Mobile MVNOs and vice versa. So basically just reverse
[02:03:28.980 --> 02:03:35.120]   what I said before. Got it. Now, if I've got Verizon, I can go
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:38.320]   directly to which of these characters without any trouble?
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:42.900]   Page Plus or Talk4Good. Okay. So if I've got Verizon, Page Plus and
[02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:49.320]   Talk4Good is where I go. And then Sprint? Your options pretty much are going to be like
[02:03:49.320 --> 02:04:01.720]   Ting, Virgin Mobile, and EcoMobile. Okay. Got it. All right. Any closing thoughts
[02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:06.520]   or anything we missed? Well, all I can really say is the same thing
[02:04:06.520 --> 02:04:12.680]   that I always say, research, research, research. Do the research, work out what you actually
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:23.040]   need to be well-informed as a customer. Do the math and sit down with your bills. I mean,
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:29.800]   know that very few people in this world need anything near approaching Unlimited. And remember
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:37.480]   that Unlimited doesn't actually mean infinite. So do the math and read the contracts that
[02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:43.720]   you're getting into. Understand them. If you see a contract that's way too long, that's
[02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:53.000]   not a good sign. So as long as you know what you need, you've researched, you've done the
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:05:01.320]   math, you know what you need out of your provider, and you have a contract that you understand,
[02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:07.800]   you're golden. Beyond that, I always advise try and stay away from any sort of vendor
[02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:17.080]   walk-in with handsets and devices. If you buy a phone that is proprietary only to that
[02:05:17.080 --> 02:05:22.960]   provider and you literally cannot take it anywhere else, well, kind of like Virgin Mobile's
[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:38.280]   handsets or Cricket or any of the phones from Straight Talk Net 10 and TrackPhone, you're
[02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:45.000]   walked into those providers. You're not going to be able to take it anywhere else. So walk-in
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:50.480]   can be a nasty thing. And as long as you're walked in, you don't have the freedom to be
[02:05:50.480 --> 02:05:57.480]   able to go elsewhere. And ultimately, you need to be willing to compromise.
[02:05:57.480 --> 02:06:06.960]   >> Yeah. It's been -- you know, I think I've got a good understanding of what I think -- how
[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:12.840]   a lot of people think about it. I used to be very scarred about going over and having
[02:06:12.840 --> 02:06:16.880]   -- being shocked by a huge bill. And so I said, "Well, I'll just go with unlimited,
[02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:21.120]   and that way I don't have to think about it." And it's an easy thing to think about. But
[02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:26.480]   as my little math example proves, that if you need unlimited, like if you need, like
[02:06:26.480 --> 02:06:33.000]   you said, thousands and thousands of minutes, great. Go for it. But most people don't. And
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:38.040]   it's worth it. It's worth the time. You know, saving an extra 50 bucks a month just by making
[02:06:38.040 --> 02:06:47.560]   a couple of switches is substantial over time, saved and invested. So it's been fun.
[02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:48.560]   >> Yes, it is.
[02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:51.400]   >> It's been fun. Well, I've enjoyed having you on. And --
[02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:53.600]   >> Thank you for having me.
[02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:58.160]   >> As far as where people should go, so you've got your site. I'll put links -- I'm going
[02:06:58.160 --> 02:07:03.760]   to put extensive show notes for this episode. And again, this episode, when checked, is
[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:11.800]   going to be episode four. So to get to the show notes, go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/episode4.
[02:07:11.800 --> 02:07:15.280]   Just type that into the browser. It'll go right there. I'll put extensive show notes
[02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:21.080]   directing people to techmashugana.com, also to the Super Guide on the Money Mustache Forums.
[02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:26.040]   Let's see, would you prefer people ask you -- if people want to ask you questions, would
[02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:29.920]   you prefer they do it on the Super Guide or on your website? Or do you have a preference
[02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:30.920]   there?
[02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:37.160]   >> If you want to ask questions there on Radical Personal Finance or drop me a line directly
[02:07:37.160 --> 02:07:42.800]   off of my feedback form on my website, that'd be fantastic. I mean, I do frequent the forums
[02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:48.160]   as well. I'll answer questions wherever, but don't be afraid to ask.
[02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:56.200]   >> Yes, so people can leave questions right in the notes on this podcast. And we'll try
[02:07:56.200 --> 02:08:00.440]   to make sure that Will sees them. And then if there's something we can do -- and I got
[02:08:00.440 --> 02:08:05.320]   an idea that if you're Will and we might be doing this in a year and it'd be totally different.
[02:08:05.320 --> 02:08:07.720]   >> Yes, the markets change.
[02:08:07.720 --> 02:08:12.840]   >> They change quite quick. And then we'll see about kind of the schedule. If this is
[02:08:12.840 --> 02:08:16.320]   well received, maybe we'll do another one on VoIP because I know that's something you've
[02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:20.160]   got expertise in. It's totally new to me. I just bought a MagicJack and --
[02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:22.160]   >> Oh, you poor thing.
[02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:28.480]   >> Well, that's what I'm saying. I just decided it was on sale and I said, "Well, let's try
[02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:31.880]   it out." But I probably could return it. So maybe we should do it sooner than later, but
[02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:32.880]   we'll see.
[02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:33.880]   >> Very.
[02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:38.040]   >> I'll play with it. Thank you, Will. And with that, this has been Episode 4 of the
[02:08:38.040 --> 02:08:44.680]   Radical Personal Finance Podcast. As always, leave some comments on the show. Let us know
[02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:52.480]   how we can help you. My goal is to provide world-class information, content, and advice
[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:56.000]   that doesn't have a specific agenda to beat you over the head to say this is what you
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:00.440]   should do, but rather to -- with the assumption that you're an intelligent consumer. If you
[02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:04.520]   know the information, you'll make the decisions that are right for you. So have a great day,
[02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:04.960]   everybody.
