[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680]   I want Christ to be the treasure of my life.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.960]   In fact, I often find the wanting of him to be my treasure a more common reality in my
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.360]   life than the actual act of treasuring and enjoying him as my treasure.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.960]   Is such an experience normative?
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.560]   It's a really important question, and this time it comes from a podcast listener named
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.560]   Kai.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.200]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.120]   I keep hearing your answers on this podcast talking about how we need to enjoy God's glory
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.080]   and be satisfied in Jesus and embrace him as our treasure, but I cannot seem to manage
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.080]   it.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.240]   I always want Jesus.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.960]   I always want to glorify God.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.600]   It is always my ambition to do so, but I almost never feel as though I actually have Jesus
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.560]   or love the glory of God.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.720]   I feel like I'm always wanting and recognizing my lack without being satisfied by him.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.960]   Is this normal?
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.080]   Is my experience normal?"
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:06.160]   Back in the '80s, 1980s, when I was thinking about writing a book—actually, they were
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:14.320]   sermons first on Christian hedonism, what would become my life passion and ministry—I
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.240]   wondered what should I call it?
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.240]   J.I.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.720]   Packer had written a book called Knowing God, and Charles Colson had written a book called
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.360]   Loving God.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.400]   So I decided on the title Desiring God.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.280]   I liked the ring of it.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.200]   I liked lining up behind those two guys.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.560]   But there was something oh so much more significant behind that title.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.920]   I can remember in those early days of my pastoral ministry walking to church seven minutes from
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.080]   our house—I've done it 15,000, 20,000 times—regularly feeling in the early years
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:11.320]   insecure, a little discouraged, praying all the way to church for God's help, whether
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:19.160]   I was going to a staff meeting or a funeral or a preaching service or some tough counseling
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.160]   session.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:33.680]   And I remember that two Bible passages dominated my mind for an important season in the mid-80s,
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.040]   maybe even longer than that.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:44.160]   They were like the music on the answering machine in my brain.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.640]   If I called in for help, this would be the message of my mind.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.920]   One of them was Psalm 42, 5.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.840]   "Why are you downcast, O my soul?
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.720]   Why are you in turmoil within me?
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.480]   Hope in God."
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.840]   And we put that on a big sign so I could see it.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.000]   It was a big sign on the old sanctuary.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.880]   It's torn down now, but for a decade or more we had this big "Hope in God" sign so that
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.280]   John Piper would take heart as he's walking to church.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:25.520]   So the psalmist says, "Hope in God, for I shall again praise him, my help and my God."
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:33.840]   And you can see that this is the prayer of a man whose heart is not as full of God as
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.520]   it should be because he says, "I shall again praise him," meaning praises are not spontaneously
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.520]   welling up joyfully from his heart, and he knows it.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.780]   He's preaching to himself that God is infinitely worthy of being trusted, and he's declaring
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.120]   confidence that praises are going to return.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:05.360]   In other words, this is the prayer of a man who has tasted and known the satisfying preciousness
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.520]   of God is better than anything else, and he's not experiencing it to the degree that he
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.520]   knows he should.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.160]   Now, that was one of the texts.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.760]   Here's the other one, namely Psalm 73, 24.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.460]   I can remember being called on to pray in many situations where I wasn't expecting it,
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.140]   and I pushed the button.
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.580]   I called into my brain, and this is the music that came out.
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.660]   You guide me with your counsel; afterward you will receive me to glory.
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.820]   Whom have I in heaven but you, and there's nothing on earth I desire besides you?
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:48.500]   My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:57.060]   Now, probably, if there was one text that I could trace the title of the book Desiring
[00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.380]   God to, that would be it.
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:10.560]   Whom have I in heaven but you, and on earth there's nothing I desire besides you?
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.260]   When he says there's nothing I desire besides you, I think that is the psalmist's way of
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:25.340]   saying what Paul said in Philippians 3, 8, "I count everything as loss compared to the
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.140]   surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord."
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.740]   Technically, there are other desires.
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:42.060]   We get hungry, we get thirsty, we have sexual desires, we get sleepy, but compared to God,
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:49.420]   compared to God and his fellowship, all that he is for us in Christ, these other desires
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.660]   fade.
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.220]   We know, we've tasted.
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:59.340]   But what kind of desire is this in Psalm 42 and 73?
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:05.980]   The key to its essence, I think, is found in 1 Peter 2, 2 and 3.
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:12.860]   It says, "Like newborn infants," it's a command now, "desire," that's an imperative of the
[00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.820]   verb "desire."
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.620]   "Desire the pure spiritual milk that by it you may grow up into salvation," and then
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.340]   comes this all-important "if" clause.
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:31.140]   "If indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good."
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.620]   Now, think carefully about that with me for a minute.
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:42.380]   There are desires that unbelievers have for something beyond this world that they can't
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.380]   name.
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.700]   These desires may lead them to God.
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.420]   They did for C.S. Lewis, for example.
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:57.720]   But until a person is born again, these desires are not spiritual desires.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:03.820]   They are not the work of God's Spirit and are not based on true experience of the beauty
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:04.900]   and worth of God.
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.820]   They are simply expressions of the empty place in our heart that's made for God.
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:17.580]   What must happen for those desires to be spiritual and God-pleasing desires, the desires that
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:26.060]   really magnify God, is this, "If indeed you have tasted."
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.900]   So "desire God if you've tasted God."
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:36.900]   The difference between the desires of the non-Christian and the born-again person is
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:45.180]   the new desires of the born-again person are owing to a new taste, a new spiritual taste
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.180]   for God.
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.540]   They have seen something, smelled something, tasted something spiritually that is different
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.220]   than anything they had known before.
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:08:01.800]   So here's what I'm saying to Kai when he says, "I always want Jesus, but I almost never
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.540]   feel as though I actually have Jesus."
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:14.940]   I am saying that if by the work of God's regenerating Holy Spirit you have tasted the
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:24.820]   true glory or beauty or worth and greatness of Jesus, that taste is present in all your
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.020]   wanting.
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:33.780]   It's present in all your wanting, all your desiring, and therefore even your wanting
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:41.860]   is the kind of delighting, even your wanting is a kind of satisfaction, a true experience
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.820]   of satisfaction in Jesus.
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:51.140]   C.S. Lewis analyzed the relationship between desire and satisfaction as deeply as anybody
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.400]   I know.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:09:00.980]   He said, "Joy is the experience," this is a quote now, "of an unsatisfied desire which
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.780]   is itself more desirable than any other satisfaction."
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:10.380]   Let me say that again, because that's pretty, pretty profound for somebody like Kai to come
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.980]   to terms with.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:18.660]   Joy is the experience, and he's capitalizing joy, this is what he means by true joy in
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:27.780]   God, is the experience of an unsatisfied desire which is itself more desirable, in other words,
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:38.520]   the taste of the desired in that desire is better than any other satisfaction, end quote.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:47.100]   And I think he's right when he says that on earth we will never have an experience of
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:55.980]   joy in God that is not composed mainly of desiring.
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:02.740]   In other words, only in God's immediate presence in heaven or in the new age, only in God's
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:10.620]   immediate presence is there fullness of joy and pleasures forevermore, Psalm 1611.
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:21.800]   For now, in all this fallen world, satisfaction in God will be in measure, not in fullness.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:30.460]   And the most common way we will experience those measures will be in desiring and wanting
[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:35.140]   and longing based on a true taste.
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:43.040]   If we have tasted the true goodness of the Lord by His Spirit, that desiring, as Lewis
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:52.720]   says, will be more desirable than any other satisfaction, and God will be honored in it.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.720]   Yeah, very interesting.
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:57.720]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thanks for the question, Kai, and thank you for listening
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.720]   to the podcast.

[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:10.520]   Well, next time we talk junk food.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:15.000]   Is it hypocritical to pray and thank God for a Big Mac value meal we know is not healthy
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.120]   for us?
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.000]   How should we think of gratitude and junk food?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.640]   Wow, you all send in a lot of really interesting questions.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.640]   Keep those coming in to us.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.640]   I'm your host, Tony Reik.

[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.300]   Bye.
