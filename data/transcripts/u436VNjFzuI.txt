[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   The most important thing that fund managers get wrong is not having appropriate reserves
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.840]   for your winners. So take 20 billion off the table of that 20 billion, I would probably take
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.400]   two thirds of it. And I would go to all the hyperscalers and anybody that's providing cloud
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.480]   compute and essentially buy out all of the compute credits on GPUs so that I could tell any startup
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.120]   in the world, you will do a safe with me, I will give you free compute on pick your cloud provider,
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.920]   pick your model, I don't care. In return, we get 7% up front and you have to tell us some
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.480]   benchmark of how this model is improving. Now you've scoped the problem to 20 billion is in
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.120]   reserves, 15 billion of it is tied up in credits. And then the 5 billion, a billion and a half to
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.640]   the hardware, a billion and a half to infrastructure, a billion and a half to some of these
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.560]   discrete ideas, you probably need a 30 or 40 person team total no more, but that business could make a
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.480]   trillion dollars if it was set up that way.
