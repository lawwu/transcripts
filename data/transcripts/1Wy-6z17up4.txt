[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:22.160]   Nice, Mark, there it is.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.660]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.060]   This video is of Mark Zuckerberg and I, Lex Freedman, training jujitsu.
[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.660]   Martial art with the goal of attaining positional dominance of your opponent,
[00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.420]   and then to submit them by breaking their arm or leg or choking them unconscious.
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.220]   But stopping right before that,
[00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.780]   as your opponent taps twice to designate that they give up.
[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.240]   I'm a black belt in jujitsu and I've been doing it for over 15 years, and
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.460]   also judo and wrestling for 10 more.
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.780]   Mark has been training jujitsu for just over a year, and
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.260]   has taken this journey on with humility and
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.700]   with a seriousness that to me is truly inspiring.
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.940]   This was recorded shortly after our recent podcast conversation.
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.780]   And given the recent back and forth between Elon and Zuck on social media,
[00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.860]   I should mention that I'm a longtime friend of Elon and a new friend of Zuck.
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.460]   And I'm excited to see them take on the journey of being martial artists
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.340]   in their own way, and I look forward to training with each of them.
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.300]   They both run large, successful, impactful companies, and so they're super busy.
[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.220]   But I do believe there's tremendous value in them practicing martial arts,
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.380]   as it will make them better leaders, better human beings, and
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.660]   students of human nature.
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.540]   First and foremost, at least to me, jujitsu is humbling, and
[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.300]   humility is a powerful tool for innovation and leadership.
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.980]   Let me quote here as one must, the great Miyamoto Musashi,
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.620]   a Japanese swordsman and warrior philosopher from the 17th century.
[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.500]   Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.620]   That said, this is a martial art.
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:14.940]   So he also did say that the way of the warrior is the resolute acceptance of death.
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.260]   In this video, you see Mark and I doing live technical training and
[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.860]   some practice of techniques under the guidance of the legendary jiu jitsu and
[00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.260]   judo instructor Dave Comorillo.
[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.180]   And now, dear friends, here's Mark Zuckerberg and I training some jiu jitsu.
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:42.180]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.100]   >> You can grapple too.
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.980]   >> [INAUDIBLE] >> You want to do it with both hands?
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.580]   >> I just don't want to do it with the hands.
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.960]   >> Okay, yeah, no worries.

[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.960]   Sorry.

[00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.960]   Nice.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.960]   Up, up, up, up.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.960]   Close your hand on your arm.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.960]   Yes.

[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.960]   All right, time for one more.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.960]   Let's put Mark and Lex together.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.960]   >> We had such a great run on this one.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.960]   >> All right.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.960]   >> Start with four positions.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.960]   >> Take that.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.960]   >> Come on, bud.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.960]   >> You need to use pins.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.960]   Get Nick down and get them.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:34.960]   >> Yeah, that was great.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.960]   >> You look like a jitsu guy.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.960]   >> Nick, double up on that.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.960]   Get on with the double.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:38.960]   >> I'm not.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.960]   >> You look like a jitsu guy.

[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:47.960]   >> Nice.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.960]   >> I don't think you can go for the double.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.960]   >> You got to lean back against the wall.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:50.960]   His legs were pinned together.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.960]   You've got to double and pull up.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:52.960]   >> When he has that guillotine, turn away from the elbow.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.960]   Like, turn towards the elbow.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:56.960]   >> Don't go in here.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.960]   >> I'm not.

[00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.960]   >> I'm not.

[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.960]   >> You need to sweep and get a pin.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:16.960]   Especially if you're tired.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.960]   Pin him.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:18.960]   Left shoulder tight.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.960]   Grab his neck or trap.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.960]   Pin it.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.960]   Watch that bump, Michaud.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.960]   Head up.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.960]   Yep, posture up, posture up.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.960]   Posture up.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:25.960]   Yep, posture, posture.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.960]   Yep.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.960]   You need to get to him.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.960]   >> I'm not.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:29.960]   >> You need to get to him.
