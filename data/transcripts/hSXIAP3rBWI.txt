[00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.020]   It feels tangible and real, but it's sort of underselling
[00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.940]   the job that each of you does.
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.880]   Code is sort of 10% to 20% of the value that you bring.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.540]   The other 80% to 90% is in structured communication.
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.160]   And this is going to be different for everyone,
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.680]   but a process typically looks something
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.080]   like you talk to users in order to understand their challenges.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.100]   You distill these stories down and then
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.280]   ideate about how to solve these problems.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.960]   What is the goal that you want to achieve?
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.280]   You plan ways to achieve those goals.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.160]   You share those plans with your colleagues.
