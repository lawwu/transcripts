[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Our good friend Kenny Kane taught me something, he's shaking his head, the best.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   He's a wonderful guy.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.400]   You're not going to find him on social media because a few years ago he just decided to
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.320]   take his gym and himself off social media.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.320]   He's a very, very talented trainer.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.320]   So we're going to give you his phone number.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.640]   We're going to have you call him because you can't DM him.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.640]   Very talented athlete and wonderful person.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.120]   He taught me something, I would say about eight years ago, that I've found oh so useful
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:36.160]   for my training longevity, my enjoyment of training, and it was this.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.160]   Very simple.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.080]   80% of your workouts, Andrew, he said, are going to be at 80% of what you could do that
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.280]   day.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.840]   Okay, that involves some humility.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.840]   I like to sweat hard.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.840]   I associate intensity with hard work, et cetera.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:58.020]   He said 10% are going to be at 90% intensity, meaning 100% is the most you could give, possibly
[00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.600]   in whatever time is allotted on that day, given the sleep, given the nutrition, given
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.440]   the life circumstances on that day.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.440]   The readiness for that day.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.440]   Right.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.360]   And then here's where it breaks down a little bit more, 5% are going to be at 95% and 5%
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.600]   across the year are going to be maximum 100% everything you can give, do or die workouts
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.600]   that day.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.440]   One thing for me last year, I believe it was, was that was the rock carry, Cam Hands' podcast.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.960]   I gave everything I had.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.920]   Of course, had the mountain been a little bit higher, I'd like to think I would've gone
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.840]   a little bit further, but I gave everything I could because that rock was slippery and
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.620]   it was muddy and my hamstring was out the day when we started, you know, I was in pain
[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.440]   when we started, anyway.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.120]   I think that advice that Kenny gave me was some of the best advice I've ever heard because
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.840]   my tendency would have been and had been to come in and go at 90, 95 or a hundred percent
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.840]   every single workout.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.840]   Sure.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.840]   It got you a long way.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.840]   Caffeine, pre-workout, et cetera.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.840]   That got you a long way.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.840]   Yep.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.780]   And it also brought me to this place where after eight or 10 weeks of training, I would
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.680]   get a cold or I'd get some nagging thing, a little thing, not, you know, it wouldn't
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.280]   put me under, but then, or I need to take a week off.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.280]   Normal accident theory.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.280]   Right.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.440]   So I think I'd love your thoughts on, on Kenny's recommendation.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.240]   For me, it's one of the things that I pass along anytime, says, "How about some fitness
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.240]   advice?"
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.080]   I say, "Well, listen, I'm a neuroscientist, not a fitness guy, but I know a thing or two
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.880]   based on the mistakes I've made.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.120]   Here's a great piece of advice that's really helped me.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.620]   80% of your workouts, 80% intensity, another 10% at 90%, then the 95, you know, 5% at 95
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.040]   and 5% across the year are the all out, everything you can give, leave it all on the mat type
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.040]   workouts."
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.800]   We could start with a simple idea.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.320]   We say, let's be consistent before we're heroic.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.320]   Right.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.480]   If your intensity causes you to not be able to show up for the gym for three days, I'm
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.480]   like, "Sweet.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.480]   That was sweet."
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.320]   And our adaptation response to that is sucky, right?
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.520]   I much rather you be getting more consistent and not blowing yourself out.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.840]   Remember that there was a phase where we're like, "You shouldn't be sore when you leave
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.840]   the gym."
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.840]   Remember that?
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.320]   Like there were people would talk about, "Hey, leave some reps in reserve, like show up the
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.160]   next day, grease the groove.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.560]   That's old Pavel Tsatsalin stuff."
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.520]   I think that's really good advice, especially since most people are not 20.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.560]   Most people, and when you're 20, you need to go find out what the limits are.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.080]   Touch the fence, the electric fence once in a while, right?
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.080]   Lick all the doorknobs.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.200]   Let's just call it that way.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.840]   But what ends up happening is there's a lot of things have to be in place for you to be
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.080]   able to go to the well that many times.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:38.360]   And what we know now, because we have all of this data, is that we can make better progress
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.480]   not burning it to the ground every single time.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.240]   And it's difficult for us because if I'm just fitnessing, how do I quantify that, right?
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.480]   It's easy for us to quantify another kilo or another watt.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.080]   That's makes it a lot easier.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.240]   And what you'll see is the best practices of these athletes, we do spend a lot of 70-80%
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.240]   heart rate.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.240]   That's what we call recovery.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.400]   In Joel Jameson language, 80 to 90, we're calling that conditioning, 90 and above, overload.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.800]   But what I think is nice is that that gives me a lot of â€“ there are some days where
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.320]   I touch 78 or 80% and it's hard because I'm sleep deprived, stressed out, my nutrition
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.720]   hasn't been great, I'm sleeping in a strange bed, you know, traveling, whatever.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.840]   So I think what you're seeing is something that one of my early coaches talked about,
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.840]   Mike Bergner.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.040]   He says, "When the frying pan's hot, let's cook."
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.160]   And that means I need to know myself and as a coach, I need to know you.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.120]   And I'm like, "Andrew, you look great today.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.120]   How do you feel?"
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.120]   "Great.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.120]   Let's go.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.120]   Let's go chase something."
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.120]   Right?
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.120]   And when the frying pan's hot, we cook.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.280]   But the frying pan is not always hot.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.200]   And if you pour in bang energy and jack 3D, you can't even hear inputs and outputs.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.280]   So I think that's such solid, reasonable advice.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.520]   And really what we're looking at is how can we get you to train much more consistently
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.120]   longer and longer and longer.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.440]   You can only go to the well a few times.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.200]   And what I'll tell you is that as I still love to power clean, it's my favorite thing.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.600]   And that 100 kilo power clean is heavier than it was when I was 40, you know?
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.680]   And I want to pretend like that 100 kilo power clean is not a problem, but I actually have
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.720]   to progress and get myself there.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.200]   And there are days where I'm like, "Oh, 80 kilos is my jam today."
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.920]   So I think that's really good advice.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:32.000]   And difficult for us to say, "How are we measuring success in our training?"
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Positive experience?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   "Oh, no problem.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.080]   Let me give you a baby, keep this newborn alive, and then let's go see how hard your
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.080]   training is the next day.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.080]   You're going to be terrible.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.880]   You haven't slept all night, you're stressed," right?
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.840]   So I think what's nice is having some objective measurements around, maybe body composition
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.480]   is one of them, if that's important to you, but are you getting faster over the course
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.800]   of a week?
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   What are your testing?
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.560]   How do we know inputs and outputs?
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.600]   And right now we're just doing, we're baking a lot, we're making a lot of suicides, right?
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.160]   The old fountain drink where you just mix all the things, they always taste the same
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.880]   at the end like crap, but that suicide where you mix all the fountain drinks is a little
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.120]   bit of what we're seeing in that.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.120]   And one way of protecting ourselves is saying, "Hey, let's make sure you can train tomorrow."
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.120]   Suicides.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.760]   I was reflecting on that the other day for some reason, why at a wedding or a party,
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.480]   typically it's a Y-chromosome-associated disorder to feel like you had to mix a bunch of stuff
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.200]   and then get someone to drink it.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   You're not wrong.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.520]   I've never done alcoholic drinks for young kids, by the way, but mixing all the sodas,
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.880]   putting M&M's in, just something like, "Oh, my male friends are wicked."
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.320]   And I think that's what we see a little bit.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:43.920]   And if you, I am a deep coach nerd, I love fitness, I love fitnessing, I'll jump into
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.720]   any class, any time like, "Sure, let's go, let's see."
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:55.080]   It's so fun, but I need to see, I do get to watch trends come and go.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.040]   Things get very hot, they get very popular.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.160]   And again, fitness has become a hobby.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.340]   It's an amuse.
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.340]   And that's okay.
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.640]   It's totally okay that gym is a hobby, but that doesn't hint about what's the best way
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.820]   to develop capacity, elite capacity, long-term longevity capacity.
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.240]   Those things almost don't go together.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:22.360]   [Music]
