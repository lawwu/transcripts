[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.000]   Just recently, Pastor John and Noel
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   traveled to Holland, France, and Germany.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.680]   Earlier in the year, they traveled to South America,
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.880]   and earlier in the spring,
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.440]   they were in Ireland and Scotland.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.200]   All those trips being ministry trips
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.080]   on behalf of Desiring God.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.700]   Our ministry partners make these international trips possible
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.280]   so thank you.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.520]   And today I'm gonna share with you one moment
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.920]   which was captured in Scotland
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.520]   and recorded at a conference hosted by our friends
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.560]   at 20 Schemes.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.920]   In Scotland, a scheme is something like a housing project,
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.000]   a government subsidized neighborhood
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.320]   that's pretty rough, known for high crime
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.020]   and rampant drug use.
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.160]   More troubling, over half of Scotland's schemes
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.000]   are gospel-less places.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.360]   So 20 Schemes is a ministry to change this
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.600]   by planting gospel-loving churches
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.960]   right into these areas of deprivation.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.760]   While in Scotland, Pastor John sat down
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.180]   to field audience questions
[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.420]   from one of those church planters, Andy Prime,
[00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.720]   who relayed to Pastor John the following question.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.220]   Have a listen.
[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.280]   - Someone says, "Hi, Pastor John.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.120]   "I'm someone who's been exposed
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.180]   "to a lot of Christian talks and events
[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.640]   "in the last couple of years,
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.940]   "but I am still struggling to put my faith in Christ.
[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.720]   "What advice could you give me?"
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.400]   - Still struggling to put my faith in Christ?
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.240]   - Yeah.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.840]   - Wow, I wish I knew you.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.200]   (laughing)
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.520]   I would really probe before I gave an answer.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.520]   I mean, I would probe the word struggle.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.700]   What is that?
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.940]   Where are you, you know?
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.620]   (laughing)
[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.860]   I wanna help you so bad, get over that.
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.480]   Let me just say what comes to my mind.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:48.060]   Let me give you two texts,
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.740]   and then tell you why the word struggle
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.220]   is a little odd and yet understandable.
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.780]   In Matthew 7, Jesus says,
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.780]   "The gate is narrow, and the way is hard
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.680]   "that leads to life, and few there be that find it."
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.620]   Now, that would mean,
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.180]   well, of course you're gonna struggle, it's hard.
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.720]   I mean, that's what he said.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.760]   "The gate is narrow, and the way is hard
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.260]   "that leads to life, and few there be that find it."
[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.700]   He must have said that because he knew
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.980]   you're trying to get through the door, right?
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.740]   And it's hard.
[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.520]   Like, I don't even know how to do this.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.900]   How do you get through the door?
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.940]   The gate's so narrow, and it's hard.
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.100]   Okay, so that text gives me empathy
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.020]   with the word struggle.
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.740]   But what, four chapters later?
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.300]   "Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden,
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.060]   "I will give you rest.
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.560]   "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.080]   "for I am meek and lowly in heart,
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.560]   "and you'll find rest for your souls.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.860]   "For my yoke is easy,
[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.940]   "and my burden is light."
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.060]   Now, just,
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.740]   those are both in the Bible.
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.120]   The way is hard, the gate is narrow.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.700]   It's an easy yoke.
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.460]   It's a light burden.
[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.580]   Both are true.
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.020]   That's what we believe about this book.
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.140]   Both are true.
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.220]   What makes a little theologian out of everybody
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.140]   is trying to make 'em figure out how they're both true.
[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.580]   And in my mind, here's my best shot
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.100]   at how they can both be true.
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.660]   What could be easier than to stop working for God,
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.220]   stop trying to prove anything as a means of salvation,
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.380]   and just rest in the work of Jesus
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.020]   that is so complete, so full, to cover all your sins,
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.060]   give you all the righteousness you need,
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.660]   adopt you into the family without working?
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.500]   What could be easier than to say,
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.160]   "I give up, I fall down, I rest."
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.700]   I'll tell you what could be easier.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.460]   A proud working for God.
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.300]   Because we don't like to become children,
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.140]   unless you turn and become like little children,
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.820]   you can't enter the kingdom of heaven.
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.180]   Who wants to be a little child?
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.540]   I want to be somebody.
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.060]   I want to look competent.
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.980]   Children, they just, I mean, where is he?
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.260]   He walked into one of your pastors.
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.500]   He walked in with that little baby,
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.300]   two-week-old baby a while ago.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.780]   I mean, this guy's gigantic.
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.180]   Raise your hand, where are you?
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.460]   There you are, okay.
[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.860]   Just, you walked in, here's your boy.
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.700]   That baby looked like a dot in his arm.
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.980]   And who wants to look like that baby?
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.620]   I want to look like you.
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.020]   I don't want to mess with you, you know.
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.000]   No, I don't, okay.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.340]   But, you know, he can hold his own in the world
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.100]   and make it in the scheme, I presume.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.100]   But that baby, nobody's gonna raise that baby.
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.340]   That's why it's hard.
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.700]   Our ego makes it hard to come to Jesus.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.460]   It's not hard to come to Jesus.
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.980]   It's not a struggle except the struggle to rest.
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.380]   That's my answer to how those texts can be true.
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.060]   The one says, come and rest.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.780]   It's easy, it's light.
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.180]   And the other one says it's hard.
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.460]   And that's because resting is hard for people with an ego.
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.000]   So I'm being hard on you now.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.220]   Maybe the struggle is rooted in,
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.460]   I want to reserve for myself some power,
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.020]   some ego, some praise,
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.900]   some worth, something instead of I'm just done.
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.220]   I am done trying to prove anything.
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.220]   That's what I'd say.
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.660]   - I think we'll end it there.
[00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.780]   We're gonna sing before we finish.
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.280]   Would you mind praying just to finish off our day?
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.340]   - So Father, for the brother or sister
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.780]   who just asked that question,
[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.020]   I'm sure they are not alone.
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.280]   And that others perhaps here,
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.620]   and we know in our churches do struggle.
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.580]   What does it mean?
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.220]   How can I do it?
[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.380]   How can I lay down all the objections,
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.340]   lay down all the resistance that rises up in my heart
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.300]   that doesn't want to let certain things go?
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.300]   And I just ask right now that the miracle would be wrought
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.840]   and that the eyes of the heart would be so illumined
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.140]   with the beauty of Christ,
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.100]   the sufficiency of Christ and the greatness of Christ
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.860]   and the power of Christ and the wisdom of Christ
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.660]   that all resistance would fall.
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.940]   So strengthen, strengthen the churches, Lord, of 20 schemes.
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.660]   Thank you for this ministry.
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.080]   May every need be met for every church
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.500]   and may the dreams be fulfilled for the 20 plus.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.500]   In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.020]   Amen, yeah, I try to get field recordings like this one
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.740]   from Pastor John's travels to share with you on the podcast,
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.740]   this being one of them.
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.740]   Thanks again to our financial partners
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.980]   who make our international ministry possible,
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.700]   who make our web ministry possible,
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.580]   who make this podcast possible.
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.220]   Thank you for supporting us.
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.100]   We couldn't do it without you, so thank you.
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.380]   And thanks to everyone who listens along
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.540]   and subscribes to Ask Pastor John in a podcast app
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.460]   or in YouTube.
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.780]   We are really grateful to have you along for the ride.
[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.540]   And next time, why does the Bible stress
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.540]   the power of Jesus' name?
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.940]   Why his name, why not his person?
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.820]   Another shrewd question coming from our listeners
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.180]   next time when Pastor John joins me again back in the studio.
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.500]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.700]   We'll see you on Friday.
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.860]   (upbeat music)
