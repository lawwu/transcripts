[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.760]   the Gospel according to St. John in the third chapter and the nineteenth verse. The nineteenth
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:23.760]   verse in the third chapter of the Gospel according to St. John. And this is the condemnation
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:35.280]   that light is come or has come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.240]   their deeds were evil. Now we must remember the context of this statement so I'll go
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:51.240]   back and read again from verse sixteen. For God so loved the world that he gave his only
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:01:00.960]   begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.320]   For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.000]   him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.440]   is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:36.680]   And this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men loved darkness
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:51.640]   rather than light because their deeds were evil. Now if it's true to say that John 3,
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:59.520]   16 is the greatest and the most loving and the most wonderful verse in the whole of the
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:10.480]   Bible, well then I assert that this verse that we are looking at tonight, John 3, 19,
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:18.840]   is certainly the most tragic verse in the whole of the Bible. And I say that it is the
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:29.040]   most tragic verse because it holds us face to face with the whole tragedy of the world
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:39.400]   as it is in sin at this moment. It just puts that right before us. And at the same time,
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:50.840]   of course, it holds us face to face with the most tragic single event that has ever taken
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:03:03.840]   place in the whole long and varied history of the human race. I refer to the rejection
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:14.240]   and to the death and the cross on Calvary's hill of Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:25.240]   This verse, I say, holds us face to face with both these things. We see why the world is
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:35.600]   as it is and we are looking at that tragedy of tragedies. The foolish mob that cried away
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:46.200]   with him, crucified him, and chose a robber Barabbas to be released instead. That is,
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:55.040]   I say, the tragedy with which this verse confronts us.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.640]   We are looking at the world, I say, as it is this evening, in all its pain, its problem,
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:09.560]   its perplexity, its unhappiness. And this verse helps us to see and to understand why
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:18.880]   the world is as it is. What are the elements in the tragedy? It tells us, for instance,
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.920]   that the world is as it is, as I have been trying to show on the two previous Sunday
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:30.840]   evenings. The world is as it is because man misunderstands, does not realize the real
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:38.560]   and the essential nature of his problem and of his need. Man, as we have seen, is still
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.720]   persuaded and convinced that his essential problem is intellectual, whereas our Lord
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:52.400]   is here revealing so clearly that the essential problem is moral and is spiritual. This is
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.480]   the condemnation. That light has come into the world, well, why does not everybody turn
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:11.360]   to it? The answer is that men loved darkness. And as he goes on to say, hated the light.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.560]   It is moral, it is spiritual, but the world does not know that. It thinks the problem
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.020]   is purely intellectual. That is one thing that it reminds us of at once. The second
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:30.640]   element in the tragedy which it puts before us very plainly and clearly is this, that
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:41.680]   the world deliberately rejects its one and only means of deliverance and of salvation.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:48.600]   Men did not turn to it. They loved darkness rather than light because their deeds are
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.440]   deviant. This is, you see, of the very essence of the tragedy, the modern tragedy, the tragedy
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.960]   that the world has been in ever since the beginning when men first fell. He has deliberately
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:10.400]   been rejecting and turning his back upon and spurning the only thing that can really deliver
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:20.680]   him and solve his problems. But perhaps the height of the tragedy is seen when I put it
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:32.440]   in this form. This verse reminds us of it so plainly. The world in its blindness turns
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:44.040]   God's greatest act of love into something that becomes the means of its own condemnation.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:52.000]   Now that, I say, is the very height of the tragedy. This is the condemnation. What is
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   the condemnation? The condemnation is that God's greatest act of love, even God's
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.200]   greatest act of love, is so misunderstood and refused and rejected that that very thing
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:14.760]   becomes the means of our condemnation. Now there is no tragedy greater than that. The
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:24.480]   highest offer of God's love is turned by men in sin and in unbelief into the very cause
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:33.160]   of his condemnation. Now there, I say, at once on the very surface of this verse, we
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:42.360]   are given an analysis of the elements of the predicament and the tragedy of the human race
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:50.560]   this evening. Man has rejected his own Saviour. Now the question that therefore confronts
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:59.080]   us is this, "Why has he done so?" What is the reason for this? With the world, as
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:05.800]   I say, in such trouble, in such despair, in such misery and wretchedness, why is it that
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:16.880]   men and women are still rejecting it? Why is it that the one who was rejected and sent
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:26.400]   to that cruel death nineteen hundred and fifty-seven years ago is still being rejected this evening?
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.720]   Well I want to try to answer that question, and I would answer it like this. The first
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:42.440]   reason is that men do not realize that the fact of Christ is the most momentous question
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:49.280]   facing them. Now I am putting my emphasis upon the fact. The verse does, you see. This
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:57.360]   is the condemnation, that the light has come. That is history. Something has happened. Something
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.120]   has taken place. Well at once you are in the realm of history. You are in the realm of
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:07.600]   facts. Now I say that the first cause of the trouble is that men in sin, mankind as it
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:13.520]   is, does not realize that this is the first thing to consider. Now our Lord was trying
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:19.160]   to bring Nicodemus to see that. He spoke these words, you remember, to this great man Nicodemus.
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:25.520]   And he was drawing attention to himself and trying to wean Nicodemus from all these questions
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.440]   that were agitating his mind, the understanding of miracles and things like that. He says
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:39.560]   in effect, "Look at me. I am the fact. Look at me. The light has come."
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:48.440]   But isn't it still the trouble? There are many intelligent, sincere, honest people in
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:55.880]   the world this evening who are genuinely and honestly concerned about the state of the
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:03.120]   world at this present hour. They don't stop at reading the newspapers. They read books.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:10.960]   They read attempts to solve the problem. They are reading philosophy. They are reading psychology.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.440]   They are reading sociology. They are reading politics, economics, and all these things.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:23.560]   And why? Well, because they have this great concern about the present situation, because
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.200]   they are really becoming desperate about the whole state of the world. They say, "If
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:32.680]   something doesn't happen and all this atomic power goes on being released and being experimented
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.400]   in this way, the whole world is going to be destroyed. And if the world isn't destroyed,
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:42.040]   civilization at any rate is certainly going." And they say, "Something must be done."
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:51.800]   They have a genuine concern. And yet you see the fallacy. You see the tragedy. All along
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:58.760]   they are talking and arguing and debating and discussing in terms of ideas, in terms
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:08.240]   of thoughts and teachings and concepts. And they never look at certain facts which are
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:17.640]   there confronting them. Isn't this the simple truth? They are talking and arguing and discussing
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:23.000]   as if the light had never come, as if nothing had ever happened. They are facing the situation
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.680]   and they say, "Well, now what can we do about this? Now let's consider this theory and that
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:31.120]   theory." And here they are, I say. Some believe that the whole thing is philosophical. Some
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:36.000]   believe it's psychological. Some believe it's political, economic, social, and so on. And
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   here they are arguing about these, putting the one up against the other, trying to put
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.560]   them into practice. And they have been doing so for centuries, and especially during the
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:49.720]   last hundred years. And yet the world is going from bad to worse, and nemesis seems to be
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:12:03.580]   staring us in the face. And I say it is because they are not facing facts. And the business
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:09.160]   of the gospel is to call men and women to face facts. And I say the greatest fact, and
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.920]   the thing that we should start with this evening if we are concerned about the world, is this.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:26.480]   Is the fact that light has come. Now this is historical. I am speaking about revelation.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:32.240]   I am speaking about something that God has actually done, something that has literally
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:39.960]   taken place in the realm and on the field of history. "What do you mean?" says someone.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:51.920]   Well, let me put it like this to you. My text tells us this evening that the light has come.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.320]   Nicodemus was a seeker and searcher after the truth. He was a man who was looking for
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:05.120]   and expecting light. Our Lord says, "Men, can't you see? The light has come." The light
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:11.400]   had come even in the Old Testament in a sense. Now this is the whole case of the Bible, the
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:17.160]   whole case of Christianity and the church tonight. That for the world in its predicament,
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.360]   which is looking frantically for solutions and rushing hither and thither and seeking
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:26.840]   explanations, the Bible says, "What you are doing? Stop! Give up your quest and your
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.240]   searching. Look at the light that has come." I say it is in the Old Testament to start
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:44.040]   with. Go back and look at that old world, B.C. This is what you find. You find that
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:50.840]   there was one nation which stood out amongst all the other nations. It was the nation of
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:57.640]   the Jews. There was a uniqueness about it. There was something separate and distinct.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:02.720]   It was not like the other nations. There were the other nations worshipping a multiplicity
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:11.400]   of gods. Yes, even a learned nation like Greece, proud of her philosophy and of knowledge and
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:17.000]   her understanding. The great city of Athens was cluttered up with temples to the various
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.720]   gods—the god of war, the god of peace, the god of love, the god of hate, the god of thunder,
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:29.280]   and so on. Gods, multiplicity of gods, idols. Oh, you are familiar with the history. Go
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:34.600]   and read it up again. They would bow down before an image made of stone or of wood or
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:43.800]   of metal. Some worshipped the sun and the moon and the stars, worshipped spirits in
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:55.440]   trees and so on. But there was this one nation, a little nation, and it was altogether different,
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:03.480]   with a higher morality, with a purer way of living, with an understanding of life that
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:11.600]   stood out and made it distinct and apart. What is the explanation? The explanation is
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:18.600]   that God had given light to these people. He had brought these people into existence
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:23.560]   specifically in order to give them light and to speak through them. The apostle Paul puts
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.760]   it like this, that the advantage the Jews had was this, that unto them had been given
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:35.440]   the oracles of God. The other nations are remaining in the darkness of paganism and
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:40.280]   they are groping about. They are trying to discover an answer. They are aware of a problem.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:44.560]   They feel that there are forces and powers that they cannot see. And they try to say
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:49.600]   they are in these various objects, some in animals, some, as I say, in the sun and moon
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:55.240]   and stars, others in the gods they have projected out of their own imaginations. And they are
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:00.240]   worshipping them and pleasing them and placating them. But here is a nation that says, "No,
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:09.240]   God is spirit, and God is unseen and eternal. God is the Creator and there is only one God."
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:19.160]   And how would they come to know that, I ask? And the answer is that God had given them
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:28.440]   light. He had revealed and manifested himself to them. He had looked at a man called Abram
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:33.560]   who was brought up as a pagan and dwelt there in Ur of the Chaldees. And he put his hand
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:38.680]   upon him and he said, "Come out. I want to reveal myself to you. I want to make a nation
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:43.360]   out of you. I want to do something in you before the whole world that men and women
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.920]   may see and know that I am the only true and living God." He brought him out and revealed
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:58.280]   himself to him in a most amazing manner. And he produced a nation out of him. And to that
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:05.400]   nation God continued to reveal himself. He gave them light. He called a man called Moses,
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.540]   one of the leaders of this nation on one occasion, up to a mountain. And there he spoke to him.
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:15.760]   He gave him the truth about himself and about his holy laws. He told him how to live and
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:21.400]   told him how to teach the people how to live. The great moral legislation of the Old Testament.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:28.080]   None of the nations had ever seen anything like it. And the world still does not live
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:34.560]   up to it. But where did they get this light from? It was God revealing it. God revealed
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:39.480]   himself to Moses on the mountain and gave him light on all these subjects. That is the
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.760]   explanation. The light has come.
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:48.520]   And so he led them. I must not keep you. He gave them kings, but above all he gave them
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:57.480]   prophets. He raised and sent to them this mighty succession of men whom we call prophets
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:02.880]   and whose writings we have recorded in the Old Testament. And these men addressed the
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:10.760]   nation about the holiness of God and the sinfulness of sin. They revealed unto them the hopelessness
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:18.280]   of men as he is. And they began to tell them of one who was to come, a great deliverer,
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:24.320]   a mighty Messiah, one whom God was going to send who would deliver, one who was going
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:31.240]   to be a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of the people Israel. It was God
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:36.480]   who spoke through them. These men tell us that. They do not say that they sat down and
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:41.080]   tried to think it out or that they suddenly had a poetic inspiration. They say, "The
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:47.440]   burden of the Lord or the word of the Lord came upon me." They say they disavow that
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:52.560]   it is their own composition. They say that they were possessed by the Spirit and God
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:58.880]   opened their eyes and gave them a message and they simply recorded it. Light! The light
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:10.640]   has come. But that is the Old Testament. Ah, we must not depreciate it. You remember how
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:16.480]   the apostle Peter uses it as an argument in his second epistle in the first chapter?
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.960]   He was writing to these people and he said, "Look here, never become unhappy or uncertain
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:25.840]   about your gospel and your belief. Men," he says, "will try to shake you. I am an
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:30.400]   old man. I am about to die. I just want to say these things to you before I die. What
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:40.440]   is your faith based upon? Partly this, that I and James and John went up onto that mountain
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:45.360]   with the Lord and we saw him transfigured and we heard the voice speaking out of the
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:53.840]   excellent glory and saying, 'This is my beloved Son. Hear him.' But you know," says
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:58.640]   Peter, "there is something better than that for you. You have also a more sure word
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:06.360]   of prophecy whereunto you should take heed as unto a light in a dark place shining until
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:14.000]   the day star shall arise in your hearts." What does he mean by that? He means just this.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.280]   If you want to know the truth of these things, says Peter, go back and read those Old Testament
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:23.680]   prophecies. Make a note of what they say about the coming Messiah, where he is going to be
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:28.600]   born, what tribe he is going to belong to, what he is going to do, and this and that.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:34.000]   Make a list of them all and then look at Jesus of Nazareth. There you will see the fulfillment.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.200]   That is the light, the light of the Old Testament. How marvellous, how wonderful. If only the
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.760]   world lived according to the Old Testament like this evening, it would be a much better
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:55.000]   place. But when our Lord says to Nicodemus, "The light has come," he was not only referring
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:03.160]   to that. He was, of course, very especially and very specifically referring to himself.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:09.480]   He is the light. He has been referring to himself right away through this discourse.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:15.760]   He calls himself the Son of Man, God's only begotten Son, and so on. Now he calls himself
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:23.400]   the light, and he is the fact. What he is really trying to get Nicodemus to do, as I
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:36.600]   say, is to look at him. The fact of Jesus Christ. Oh, this is the tragedy in the world
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:43.800]   this evening. Men and women, I say, intelligent and zealous and honest, who are concerned
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:49.080]   about the problem and are feeling the burden of the times, here they are arguing and rushing
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:59.240]   hither and thither, and they are not looking at the fact, the fact of Christ. Jesus of
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:07.480]   Nazareth, the one who was speaking there to Nicodemus, my friend, you are concerned about
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:14.640]   the problem of life this evening, aren't you? Have you considered the fact of Christ?
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:19.000]   Now I say, don't waste your time with theorizing and argumentation. This is the fact. The light
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:29.200]   has come. He says, "I am the light." And I put it to you again that this is the essence
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.640]   of the tragedy of the world at this moment, that men and women are spending all their
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:47.080]   times with theories and concepts, and are ignoring facts, the fact, above all facts,
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:55.560]   that the light of God himself has already come into this world. That is the first thing.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:23:02.280]   Let me hurry to the second. The second trouble with men is, obviously, not merely that they
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:14.240]   don't face the facts and are immersed in theories, but that they do not realize who he is. That
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:22.480]   is why they are not considering the fact of Christ. They don't know who Christ is. They
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:29.720]   regard all this as an irrelevance. They feel this is a waste of time. I am referring to
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.800]   the people who think that I should be speaking about politics and economics and about the
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:40.320]   atom bomb every Sunday. Why do they want me to do that? Well, because they feel that Christ
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:52.400]   is an irrelevance. And they feel that because they don't know who he is. But what he says
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:24:03.400]   is this, "Light has come into the world." You notice what he is saying there. You notice
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:10.560]   the claim that he is making for himself. Oh, my dear friend, let me invite you to look
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:18.000]   at him. Give a rest for the moment to your clever theorizing and argumentations and all
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.200]   your concepts and all the philosophy and politics and psychology that is so patently failing
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:29.080]   to deal with the situation. I say, come for a moment and look at him, consider him. Look
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:33.600]   at the fact of Christ. What do you see? Well, this is what he says, "I am the light and
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:41.320]   I as the light have come into the world." What is he talking about? Well, what he is
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:48.840]   saying is this, you see, that he is different from everybody else. Here was a man speaking
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:57.360]   to Nicodemus, another man. And yet you notice how he directs Nicodemus's attention to the
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:07.040]   essential difference between the two of them. Jesus of Nazareth was not merely born in Bethlehem.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:15.480]   In Bethlehem he came into the world. Bethlehem is not the beginning of Jesus Christ. You
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:23.040]   are birth and mine is our beginning. It is not his beginning. I take it that there is
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:29.480]   no one whom I need to disabuse of that Platonic conception put by Wordsworth in his great
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:36.480]   poem, trailing clouds of glory, do we come from God who is our home? No, no. You began
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:45.960]   when you first breathed in this world and you were not until then. But here is one who
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:56.280]   can say, "I am come into the world. The light has come into the world." That is who he is.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:00.600]   He has already been putting it to Nicodemus like this. He says, "No man hath ascended
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:07.240]   up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven." That
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:12.720]   is who he is. He is God's only begotten Son. He is Jesus of Nazareth, yes, but he is more.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:19.800]   He is God, God the eternal Son. He has come out of eternity into time. The light has come
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:30.160]   into the world, the incarnation. That is what I am talking about.
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:36.800]   If only the world would look at him and consider the fact of Christ. It is historical, you
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:45.160]   see. Go back and read these four Gospels. Read about the babe that was born in Bethlehem
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:51.680]   and put in a manger. Watch him. Listen to the things people say about him. Listen to
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:59.320]   the ecstasy of the aged Simeon as he holds the infant in his arms. Listen to Anna, the
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:07.000]   prophetess. Look at the little boy aged twelve arguing and confuting the doctors of the law
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:15.360]   in the temple. What is this? Who is this prodigy? What is this precocious child? What is this?
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:22.400]   Then, in spite of that, the silent years of eighteen years' duration. The carpenter
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:32.600]   of Nazareth. And then, suddenly, the beginning of that public ministry. The crowded three
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:40.720]   years with the teaching and the miracles and the crowds and all the amazing utterances
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:45.880]   which make people say, "Never man spake like this man. Who is this? How is this man
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.600]   learning never having learned? This man who comes from nowhere and who is apparently a
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:56.640]   nobody, who can turn the world upside down and knows more than all the learned with all
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:04.360]   their lore and their knowledge. Who is this? What is he?" Have you faced that fact?
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:10.120]   I say you are not a true student of humanity and of life as it is this evening. You are
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:14.960]   not seriously coming to grips with the problem of the world as it is at this moment unless
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:22.240]   you look at this fact. Who is this? What is he? And then, after all, that his death in
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:31.120]   apparent weakness and utter helplessness and his dead body on the cross and the burial
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:37.720]   and the grave and the stone over it. It is the end of false alarm, of false hope again.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:44.880]   He was only a man after all. No, no. The resurrection, the appearances, the transformation
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:49.760]   in these dejected, disconsolate disciples, the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the day of
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:55.800]   Pentecost, the Christian church, the power that even turned pagan Rome upside down and
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:01.760]   made this despised sect the official religion of the great Roman Empire in three centuries.
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:11.440]   Have you faced those facts? Isn't it a tragedy that men are busied with everything but with
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:20.440]   this? In our need, in our awful predicament, isn't it time that we looked at him? The
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:26.360]   light has come. Here is the fact in history. He belongs to history solidly. You call this
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:37.920]   1957 and thereby you say you recognize Jesus Christ as the divider of history. Well, why
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:44.080]   don't you listen to what he has got to say about history? Why do you spend so much time
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:49.160]   in reading philosophy and politics and economics and psychology? Why spend your time with all
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:53.720]   these things and never consider him? Have you ever read the New Testament? Have you
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:30:01.000]   ever tried it? Have you ever given it an opportunity? Here is the fact. This unique person that
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.400]   stands out and cannot be put into any category. Why not start with him? He is a fact, not
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:21.280]   a theory. But come, let me call you to consider my last argument. I say that the world is
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:29.840]   as it is because men are spending their time with theories instead of facts, and that secondly,
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:35.480]   they don't look at the fact of Christ because they don't know and they don't realize who
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:46.640]   and what he is. And the third is this, they do not realize that all that we need and infinitely
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:57.200]   more is to be found in him. This is the condemnation that the light has come. Men and women are
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:01.000]   looking for light. I believe that you are here at this moment because you are looking
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.840]   for light, aren't you? There is something wrong. You are not satisfied. That is why
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:08.640]   you are listening to this gospel. You are looking for light. You say, "Is there no
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:15.160]   hope somewhere? Light! Very well," he says, "I am the light. I am the light of the world."
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:27.680]   He has come to give the light. He has brought the light that we so urgently need on every
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:35.640]   single and every conceivable question. What is it? What is the light that the world is
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:44.880]   desperately in need of this evening? Is it not this? First and foremost, light on God.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:57.640]   Is there a God? Is there a God at the back of the universe? If there is, what is he like?
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:03.200]   The apostle Paul reminds us that the world by wisdom knew not God. Plato and Socrates
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:08.400]   standing on tiptoe and on one another's shoulders cannot arrive there. They cannot
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:14.080]   find him. They have sought him, but they cannot find him. God eludes human search. Here is
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:22.560]   one who has come and reveals him. Light on God. No man hath seen God at any time. That
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:27.640]   is true, isn't it? No, no, not one of us has seen God. No man hath seen God at any
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:34.800]   time. The only begotten that is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. There
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:43.560]   is no light on God in the world tonight except that which you find in Jesus Christ. He has
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:48.840]   already been giving it. Listen to him in verse 11. "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:56.600]   speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen, and ye receive not our witness.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:01.480]   No man hath ascended up into heaven, but I have come down from heaven, and am still there."
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:12.000]   He speaks as an authority. He reveals God. Listen to him again later on. "I am the way,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:25.160]   the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father, but by me." Would you like to
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:31.240]   know what God is like, my friend? Oh, I know there are times when you give the world for
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:36.720]   that, when you are in trouble or in despair, and when you feel there is nothing left but
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:41.560]   prayer to God. You do not know what God is like, and you say, "I wish I knew what God
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:50.160]   is like so that I might speak to him." Well, listen to this one who is speaking to Nicodemus,
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:34:00.920]   and this is what you will hear him saying. "He who hath seen me hath seen the Father."
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:07.120]   What is God like? God is like Jesus Christ. And this is what he tells us about him. He
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:13.640]   tells us that God is holy, that God is infinitely glorious. He talks about the glory that he
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:20.560]   had shared with God before the very foundation of the world. God is glorious. God is infinite.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:26.440]   God is holy. God is of such a pure countenance that he cannot look upon sin. And when he
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:37.560]   prays to him, that is how he addresses him. "Holy Father," he says, "there is your light
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:49.280]   on God. God sees all. God knows all. God is everywhere. And God is light, and in him is
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:57.400]   no darkness at all." That is God. God is not like man. He is eternally, everlastingly
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:10.080]   different. There is the light on God that we so sadly need. But we also need light on
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:18.280]   ourselves, don't we? We need light on men. Why? We must need it, because whenever we
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:26.680]   are honest with ourselves, we must confess that we are problems and enigmas to ourselves.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:31.400]   What is the meaning of remorse? Why does a man kick himself metaphorically for what he
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:36.440]   has done? Why does a man keep on doing a thing that he knows is wrong and that will make
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:41.400]   him miserable when he has done it? Why does he go back to it? Why is man such a fool?
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:46.400]   Why is the world as it is? Why are things as they are? What is man? Do you understand
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:51.880]   man? Does your psychology really explain him? Are you satisfied with the schools and their
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:58.200]   proper explanations? What is man? Where can I find light? I find it here and here alone
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:03.400]   in the same person. Do you remember what he said? I read it to you just now in that eighth
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:13.320]   chapter of this Gospel. "Ye are of your father the devil, and the works of your father ye
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:21.720]   will do." Man? What is the matter with men? He says, "Here is the trouble with men. The
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:28.240]   matter with men is this, that man loves darkness rather than light. He hates the light and
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:33.960]   loves evil. There is that within him that makes him delight in these things." Man? What
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:41.120]   is man? Well, I will tell you. "He that committeth sin is the servant of sin, and that is why
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:47.480]   ye are what ye are. And I am what I am by nature. We are the slaves and the servants
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:53.440]   of sin. There are lusts and evil passions and desires within us, and we are governed
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:58.080]   and controlled by them." Free will? What are you talking about? You have not got it. You
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:08.960]   are the slave of an evil nature within you, and you know you are. "Do not turn to me,"
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:14.600]   said our Lord to those Jews, "and say, 'We be Abram's seed and were never in bondage
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:25.320]   to any man.' He that committeth sin is the servant of sin." You cannot defend sin, can
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:34.160]   you? Is there any defense for drunkenness? Is there any defense for lust and passion?
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:38.940]   Is there any defense for a man that deliberately steps into another man's married life because
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:44.480]   of his own lust and desire, and deliberately wrecks it, and perhaps ruins the lives of
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:54.040]   innocent little children? Can you defend it? Why does he do it? Lust, the servant of sin,
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:38:03.320]   evil mastering and controlling us. That is the light he has brought on man. There is
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:08.760]   nothing else in the world tonight that tells you things like that but the gospel, the new
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:13.600]   newspapers do not speak to you like that, do they? Nor the magazines, nor the books,
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:18.360]   of course not. You would not buy them if they did. They please you. They play up to you.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.480]   They pat you on the back. They say you are marvelous if only you had a chance, and if
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:30.840]   only the politicians did this or that. But that is not the trouble. The trouble is that
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:37.280]   we are of our Father the devil by nature and the works and the lusts. Of our Father we
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:43.960]   will do. We are the servants, the bond slaves of sin. And we are perishing, he says, and
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:50.560]   helpless and we can do nothing about ourselves. Our civilization has been busy for centuries,
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:55.680]   for millennia, and yet the world is as it is. Why, well, man is so much the slave of
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:00.840]   sin. He can never set himself free. There is only one hope for him. He must be born
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:11.640]   again. He is blind, he is ignorant, he is prejudiced, and he is held so captive by the
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:17.840]   world and the flesh and the devil that he can do nothing at all about himself and about
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:24.000]   his emancipation. That is the light he has given us on men. Then what is his light on
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:36.320]   the world? Well, there in a sense it is. Shall I put it to you in just one phrase? Our Lord
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:50.120]   in his last prayer before his death used these words, "O righteous Father, the world hath
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:40:00.560]   not known thee." That is the total explanation. The world is as it is because it does not
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:12.360]   know God. The world hath not known thee. It was made by him and it was paradise and it
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:18.800]   knew him and it was perfect and full of happiness and bliss. But it sinned against him and it
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:24.720]   lost the knowledge and it has been as it is tonight ever since. That is the light that
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:29.400]   he casts upon the state of the world. But let me hurry on. I am coming to something
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:37.440]   that you need very urgently. You want to know, don't you, how to live? You say, "I find
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:42.520]   myself in this world. I never ask to come into it, but here I am. And I am baffled
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:47.600]   and bewildered and I am surrounded by problems. And what I want to know is how to live. How
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.520]   can I live?" You are trying this and that but you still don't know. You say, "What
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:56.280]   is life itself and how can I live it in a worthy manner?" There is no answer except
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:04.680]   the light that comes from him. He puts it like this. He says, "Follow me. I am the
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:12.240]   light of the world. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:25.200]   life." Why did he come into the world? Well, listen to his answer. "I am come that they
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:34.320]   might have life and that they might have it more abundantly." Oh, we need life, don't
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:39.520]   we? We are all tired of life when we are born into it. The young people of today are tired.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:43.960]   I am sorry for them. It is a cruel world they are living in. And they are blase and they
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:48.840]   are tired. And they say, "Let us eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow we die. The atomic
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:57.440]   bomb is going to shorten our lives." They are tired out. They are exhausted and weary.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:06.840]   They haven't got life. And here he is saying, "I am come that they might have life and that
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:12.360]   they might have it more abundantly." And then the terrible problem of this fight against
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:17.160]   the lust and the passion and the evil nature that is within. You have fought it. We have
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:22.160]   all fought it. We have made our resolutions. We have given our pledges and our vows. We
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:26.680]   have hated the sin. We have said to others, "Stop me. Hold me. Restrain me." And yet
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:39.080]   down we go. Is there no hope? There is only one. If the Son shall make you free, you shall
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:51.200]   be free indeed. He can liberate. He really can set us free and give us liberty. Indeed,
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:59.200]   he offers us a life that is full and complete in every respect. You remember how he put
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:04.880]   it to the woman of Samaria. He said, "He that drinketh of this water from that well shall
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:11.860]   thirst again. But he that drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst.
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:17.040]   But the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:23.720]   everlasting life. He that cometh unto me shall never hunger, and he that believeth in me
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:30.360]   shall never thirst." Here is a life that is full and complete, never a lack. Do you want
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:38.480]   joy? He will give it you, not as the world gives. Do you want peace? "My peace," he says,
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:45.720]   "I give unto you, not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled,
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:51.680]   neither let it be afraid." Are you tired? Do you want rest? He says, "Come unto me,
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:59.880]   all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Has not that solved
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:06.320]   the problem of life and of living? Whatever happens to you, wherever you may find yourself,
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:16.920]   whatever shall come against you, he will enable you to conquest all along the line. And then
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:30.720]   the need of light on how to die, because we have not only got to live, we have got to
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:40.920]   die. And it is there, and it is coming, and we cannot avoid it nor evade it. And the world
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:49.840]   does not help us with respect to it, because it does not know. What light have you got
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:45:01.000]   on death? What do you know about how to die? What is death? Is it the end, or isn't it?
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.800]   How can one face that horrid spectre and still not run away frightened and alarmed? What
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:17.920]   is it? The world, I say, does not know. Listen to the poets telling us that. "Sure, it
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:27.840]   is a serious thing to die, my soul. What a strange moment must it be when near the journey's
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:37.320]   end thou hast the gulf in view, that awful gulf no mortal air repast, to tell us what's
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:48.320]   doing on the other side." No mortal has ever passed through that gulf and come back
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:54.360]   to tell us what's on the other side. So we are in darkness and we have no light. Yes,
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:46:07.080]   says Shakespeare, it is death. Is that undiscovered country from whose born no traveller returns?
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:14.440]   And we are left in unutterable and impenetrable darkness. Oh, how can we die? You've got
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:19.680]   to. You've not only got to live, you've got to die. You've got to pass through that.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:29.360]   How can you? Where is there light? There is only the light that comes from him. He has
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:38.240]   told us plainly in his teaching that death is not the end. Read the parable of Divys
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:44.960]   and Lazarus in the sixteenth chapter of Luke. There he tells you that after death one is
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:58.160]   in Abram's bosom and the other in hell. There is life after death. The soul goes on. Not
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:05.280]   only that, he tells us that after death there is a judgment and we stand before God and
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:11.440]   give an account of the life that we have lived in the flesh. How can I meet him? How can
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:18.560]   I stand before him? I've ignored him. I've sinned against him. My sins are hot upon me.
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:30.520]   What can I do? How can I die if I awaken to the dread reality at the end? Thank God he
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:44.000]   has cast eternal light upon this also. God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:55.880]   Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. The
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:00.680]   moment you awaken to the fact that you have sinned against God and that you can do nothing
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:06.920]   about your sin, there is only one thing for you, and that is to believe this message that
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:17.440]   he was delivering to Nicodemus, that as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:24.960]   so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:35.840]   but have eternal life. To believe that God sent his Son into the world to die for the
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:42.160]   sins of men who believe on him. And if you believe it, you are forgiven at that very
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:55.520]   moment, justified by faith there and then. Light on how to die and light on eternity.
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:05.000]   "I," he says, "am the resurrection and the life." Let not your heart be troubled,
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:11.880]   ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions, if it
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:19.880]   were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:28.840]   a place for you, I will come again and receive you. Unto myself, that is his light, for you,
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:44.320]   for me. He is the light through death and into eternity. Whatever the light you need,
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:51.640]   it is in him. He says the light has come. He is the light and there is the light. I
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:59.360]   have displayed it to you. Is this true, says someone? Well, you can go and consult the
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:09.400]   saints of the centuries and they will tell you that when they came to him, they found
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:15.920]   the light they looked for, the light on God, the light on themselves, the light on the
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:22.600]   world, the light on how to live, the light on how to die, the light on eternity. The
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:28.000]   apostle Paul found it. All the saints have found it. They have gloried in it. They have
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:40.400]   rejoiced in it. They have said, "He is enough." "Art thou weary, art thou languid, art thou
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:52.840]   sore distressed? Come to me, saith one, and come, be at rest." Ah, but there is the
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:51:04.200]   question. You must come to him. He says here that "He that doeth evil hateth the light
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:11.920]   and cometh not into the light, lest his deeds be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:25.440]   to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God." The light
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:33.320]   has come. Yes, but you must come to it. You must come to the light. What is that you say?
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:47.880]   It is just this. It is simply to believe this message, that Jesus of Nazareth is the only
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:57.800]   begotten Son of God, the eternal Son of God come down on earth to dwell, that he, the
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:05.520]   Son of God, came. Why? Well, to deliver us from sin, from its punishment by dying for
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:12.280]   our sins, from its thraldom and tyranny by entering into our lives, by setting us free,
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:19.680]   by filling us with his Spirit, to lead us through life, to lead us through death, and
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:31.600]   to present us faultless before the presence of God's glory. Coming to the light means
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:38.760]   turning away from everything and turning to him and saying, "I see it. I believe your
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:45.640]   message. I see myself in sin and hopelessness and shame. I believe you have died for me.
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:59.120]   I leave myself to you. Take me. Possess me." It means confessing your sins to God, repenting,
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:05.560]   believing as a little child this message, surrendering your life to him, leaving all
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:18.440]   and going after him. And if you do so, I am certain and assured that you will be the first
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:26.280]   who will want to hurry to join me in saying and in singing this, "I heard the voice of
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:39.560]   Jesus say, 'I am this dark world's light. Look unto me, thy morn shall rise and all
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:52.800]   thy day be bright.' I looked to Jesus and I found in him my star, my sun. And in this
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:54:04.200]   light of life I'll walk till traveling days be done." Come to the light. Listen to him
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:17.920]   as he speaks. Come to him and you will find the light of life and enjoy it to all eternity.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:27.120]   Come let us sing together that hymn, hymn number 376, "I heard the voice of Jesus say,
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:51.360]   'Come unto me and rest.'" 376.
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:55:10.640]   I heard the voice of Jesus say, "Come unto me and rest." May God now with me continue.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:19.440]   I enter upon my way.
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:23.560]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
