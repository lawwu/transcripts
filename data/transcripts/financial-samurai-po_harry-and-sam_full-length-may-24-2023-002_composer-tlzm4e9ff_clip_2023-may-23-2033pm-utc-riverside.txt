[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.480]   It's Sam from the Financial Samurai Podcast.
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.880]   And in this episode, I have a special guest with me, Harry Campbell from the RideShare
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.880]   guy.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.880]   Say hello.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.880]   Hey, Sam.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.880]   How's it going?
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.880]   Thanks for having me on today.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.880]   No worries.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.920]   So we've known each other probably for almost 10 years from the personal finance space,
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.060]   but you were able to pivot to something new.
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.680]   So do you mind telling the listeners what you're up to, what was your background, and
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.680]   how did you make that pivot?
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.680]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.120]   So, you know, like you mentioned, I got my start working online in the personal finance
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.120]   space.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.360]   I started a few blogs in the personal finance space, several of which still exist today.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.560]   That might be a fun challenge for any listeners.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.360]   See, go out and see if they can find them.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.320]   I'm not going to name them, but they do still exist and still bring in a little bit of revenue.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.160]   But you know, I saw a lot of guys like you and Jim Wang from Bargaineering and some other
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.680]   early bloggers doing this blogging thing.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.840]   And like, seemed like you guys were doing well and making money.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.560]   And I thought to myself, like, why can't I do this?
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.640]   And so, you know, if these guys can do it, why can't I do it?
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.040]   And I think I was a little late to the personal finance space, didn't really quite ever hit
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.560]   my niche, but I saw the potential.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.040]   And you know, all during this time, I guess you would say my former career, I was an aerospace
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.040]   engineer.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.160]   So, you know, I was working for Boeing and United Technologies and companies like that.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.440]   And I was doing a lot of this online work on the side.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.760]   And so in 2014, I started driving for Uber and Lyft on the side just to try it out and
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.760]   check it out.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.160]   And I think like yourself, like you did at one point, trying your Uber driving.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.720]   And pretty quickly realized, you know, it's not rocket science, but it was a little harder
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.720]   than it looks.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.040]   So I started a blog, then a podcast, and a YouTube channel all called The Rideshare Guy
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.000]   and really just detailed my experience as a driver, how much money I was making and
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.320]   what it was like, you know, interviews with people or drivers or people at the companies.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.380]   And you know, that's sort of what, you know, we can get into the details, but I've basically
[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.200]   grown that into my full time income and been doing that, you know, running that business
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.720]   full time, I guess, for about eight years.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.840]   I quit my job pretty quickly into starting The Rideshare Guy and went all in working
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.120]   for myself and haven't looked back since.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:15.680]   So how old were you when you quit your job to focus on your side hustle full time?
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.960]   How old was I?
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.820]   Well, I guess I was, I'm 36 now.
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.580]   And so I was, you know, about nine years, eight years ago.
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.580]   So I was about 28.
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.680]   So I didn't have any kids yet.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.780]   But you know, I was married and or just gotten married.
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.880]   And my wife and I, you know, we were starting to try for kids.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.300]   So that was sort of that I had worked as an engineer for about seven years, I want to
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.300]   say.
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.980]   So you know, it was a job I enjoyed.
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.980]   I liked it.
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.560]   It was like my lifelong passion to be sitting there in a cubicle crunching numbers and looking
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.100]   at you know, 50,000 row Excel spreadsheets.
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.180]   So you know, it was fine for the time.
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.260]   But I sort of always felt like it would be cool to find something bigger and better.
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.820]   Now how did you get the confidence to quit your job?
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.540]   Because in my case, I worked for 13 years and I didn't quit my job.
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.580]   I negotiated severance because I had golden handcuffs, deferred compensation and stock.
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.540]   So what gave you the confidence to say, I'm out of my whatever?
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.540]   How much were you making back then?
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.540]   Yeah, well, I think that might be a big difference.
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.220]   I might have been making a lot less than you were at the time.
[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.860]   You know, I mean, I was a, you know, engineer with whatever, six, seven years experience.
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.500]   So you know, you start off pretty well.
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.980]   I remember my first job out of school, I want to say I made around 60,000 bucks, you know,
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.420]   so going from college to basically a salary of 60,000.
[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.580]   I was like, Whoa, this is an insane amount of money for me.
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.940]   That's actually why I started blogging about personal finance because I was like, Oh, wow,
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.940]   I have all this money.
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.580]   I don't want to screw it up.
[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.260]   And so probably at the time, I might have been close to 80 or 90, 90,000 as an engineer
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.260]   with some experience.
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.120]   And so I mean, you know, it was definitely a lot.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.620]   But I mean, I think relative to, you know, YouTubers, people that are out there making
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.560]   money, I mean, I was making a couple thousand bucks a month off my personal finance blogs
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.660]   at the time, just selling kind of cheesy, you know, sponsored posts for casino sites
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.780]   and stuff like that really totally selling out.
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.780]   Right.
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.860]   And so I'm like, Wow, if I've got, you know, this one site that, you know, is bringing
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.100]   in some income, like imagine the damage I could do with an actual business.
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.900]   And so, you know, when I left my job, my day job at Boeing to go full time on the ride
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.060]   share guy, I wasn't I was making some money, you know, maybe a thousand or two thousand
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.060]   bucks a month.
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.500]   I wasn't at the same level, but the trajectory I was on, you know, I was doing, you know,
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.740]   the site was growing and I was making more and more.
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.620]   And I was also thinking to myself, OK, right now I'm spending 20 to 30 hours a week, you
[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.940]   know, on top of my day job.
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.940]   If I go 40, 50, 60 hours, you know, like 50, 60 hours a week on the ride share guy that
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.100]   should also grow it more and make more traffic.
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.060]   So, you know, I had money saved up.
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.260]   I didn't actually think it was that big of a leap, to be perfectly honest.
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.060]   Literally the day I quit, my boss was like, all right, well, if you want a job when you
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.060]   come back, just let me know.
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.660]   So it wasn't like a huge risk for me in my mind.
[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.140]   OK, well, let me ask you this then.
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.220]   So when you left, were you married then or not married?
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.460]   Yeah, married.
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.460]   OK.
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.260]   And at that time, I know what your wife does.
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.740]   So was she in residency then or she?
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.300]   My wife was in the midst of medical school.
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.220]   And so she was racking up debt.
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.660]   And then she had four years of residency.
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.380]   And then, I mean, she literally only just started her actual, not her actual career,
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.540]   but started making real money in private practice about a year and a half ago.
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.020]   So it sort of shows you like in the third phase of my career and she's just getting
[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.020]   started.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.700]   So it's quite a journey for her.
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.780]   I ask because I think achieving financial independence and building wealth is easier
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.780]   with a partner.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.460]   I think it's one of the most important decisions we can all make having a good life partner.
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:48.500]   And so let's say your wife wasn't going to be a doctor and make doctor money.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.360]   Let's say she was a barista and who made $22 an hour.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.340]   Would your calculus have changed in terms of leaving your job to do this entrepreneurial
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.340]   thing?
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.540]   I don't think so.
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:08.860]   I mean, to be honest, I think since the medical doctor journey is so long and winding, I wasn't
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.820]   even thinking about sort of her experience and sort of how much money she would make.
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.340]   I mean, honestly, it didn't even really until literally a year ago when she started working.
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.060]   That was the first time I ever thought to myself, "Wow, she's making good money.
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.340]   She's starting OB/GYN here in LA."
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.820]   Because if anything, it's the opposite, right?
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.780]   I mean, you're literally racking up debt for so long and then you work as a resident.
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.340]   I mean, she was literally working 70, 80 hours a week and making very little money.
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.060]   So it was like, you're still making some, but it wasn't like I was checking her bank
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.940]   account ever and she was not there a lot.
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.180]   So we had to hire more help and nannies and get family help.
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:52.860]   So it's almost like, not to put it too negatively, but it's tough for sure financially and all
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.860]   that.
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:07:00.980]   But for me, if anything, I would say transitioning into my own business and working for myself
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.780]   made it way easier because with her kind of going for medical school, I mean, there was
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:12.300]   a point where she was taking a medical school interview or residency interview in Albany,
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.300]   New York.
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.300]   I thought we were going to move to Albany.
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.300]   That was her med school.
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.100]   And then at the last second, she got in UC Irvine.
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.220]   So we got to stay in Southern California.
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.620]   And then residency, she had to apply all over again.
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.780]   And so it was kind of, for me, I was just sitting there working for myself.
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.540]   Like I don't want to go to Albany, but I could easily do it and run my business from there
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.540]   if we have to.
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.540]   Right, right, right.
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:40.820]   Yeah, it's always fascinating to bring lifestyle entrepreneurs on the podcast because I think
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:46.460]   most people, they focus on going to school, going to college, joining tech, consulting,
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:52.140]   finance, or any industry that pays and trying to save and invest as aggressively as possible.
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:57.620]   But to be frank, there are so many ways to make money now online.
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:04.580]   And so how do you view the importance of college and major and going into industry since you
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.940]   have two children yourself and you're an entrepreneur?
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:13.220]   Yeah, I mean, I think that since I've had a lot of success as an entrepreneur, it's
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:20.700]   probably no shock that I'm open to non-traditional paths, I guess you would say.
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.700]   To do what I'm doing right now, no one has ever asked me what school I went to as part
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.700]   of the ride share.
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:29.900]   I'm doing like analyst calls with investors that are paying me crazy amounts of money
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.980]   and they're not like, "Harry, where'd you go to college?"
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.580]   They're like, "Oh, Harry, you've been covering the industry day in, day out, talked to tens
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.420]   of thousands of drivers for nine years, interviewed the CEO of Uber.
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.900]   That's why they want to talk to me and pay me."
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.300]   So it's less about the pedigree and more about the body of work and the experience.
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:52.820]   So I kind of always joke that if my kids don't want to go to college, I wouldn't think that's
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.860]   the biggest deal in the world.
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:09:01.060]   But I think that's because I'm in a unique kind of work environment running my own business.
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.180]   I'm pretty sure if you ask my wife, she would probably say the exact opposite.
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.220]   And so we'll have to address that down the road.
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:13.380]   But I think college is a great, fun experience and I would recommend it to my kids.
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.100]   More for that and the relationships.
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.940]   I love visiting with my friends from college.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.100]   I went to UC San Diego, so I didn't go to school.
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.780]   I did play volleyball at UC San Diego, but we didn't have the strong football, basketball,
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:26.780]   like Cal.
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.860]   So I don't meet up with my buddies every year for football.
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.580]   But I have friends that do and it seems really awesome.
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:36.180]   As far as the actual schooling though and the knowledge that's gained there, I'm quite
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.620]   skeptical on that part.
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:42.640]   So if my kids want to go take a gap year or travel the world or even start a business
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.220]   and not go to college, I'd probably be pretty supportive of that.
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:50.140]   I think as long as they're not like dicking around and just drinking and partying for
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.140]   five years.
[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.060]   If they want to be an artist and that's what they're passionate about and I can help facilitate
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:00.100]   some of that, I probably wouldn't pay for everything, but enough to have them a comfortable
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:04.020]   living and they can pursue something they're really passionate about and get similar levels
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.540]   of achievement that I do through business, then I would be all for that.
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:11.580]   It is interesting because how old are your kids now?
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.580]   Three and five.
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.300]   So I have two boys, three and five years old.
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.300]   Right.
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.500]   So in what is that, 13 and 15 years from now.
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.500]   13 and 15 years, yeah.
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.740]   I mean, your wife is probably going to be making more money.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.740]   Yeah.
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.660]   I'm assuming hopefully you'll be making more money.
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:33.740]   Your net worth will grow even greater if you compound that at 7% rate of return, your net
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.820]   worth will more than double.
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:42.660]   And I just wonder how your children, our children, they'll be like, "Well, mom and dad seem to
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.660]   be doing really well.
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:44.660]   Do we have to do anything?"
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.900]   How do you think about that?
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:54.220]   I feel like you've done some good podcasts and blog posts where you've thought about
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.700]   that a lot more.
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.900]   I know it's an issue, but I feel like I'm almost like I'll address it when the time
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:00.900]   comes.
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:01.900]   Right.
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.740]   So I have three and five and my older son kind of jokes like, "Dad, you never work or
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:06.740]   you never do anything."
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:07.740]   Right.
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.020]   Because I don't go to an office and I'm not on call like my wife and I'm kind of always
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.580]   there to pick him up or take him to doctor appointments or whatever it might be.
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.780]   And right now it's kind of funny when he's five, right?
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:20.180]   Because he's not, it doesn't really affect his like how he works at school or how hardworking
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.180]   or lazy he is.
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.660]   But definitely when he gets to maybe middle school or high school, I think that is when
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:30.940]   it will have an impact and I'll kind of have to address it at that point.
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.300]   I feel like to me, I don't know.
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.020]   I haven't thought a ton about it.
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:40.540]   I'm not sure the best way, but it's definitely like something I know I'll have to address.
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:41.540]   Yeah.
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:46.940]   You know, so with your wife's hours, because you sound like you have pretty flexible hours
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:50.140]   and you work less than 30 hours a week, I'm assuming.
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:55.580]   I would say that I work probably 20 to 30 hours a week.
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:59.220]   You know, like when I say work though, like very hard focused work.
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:03.340]   I mean, some of it is, I mean, like even this podcast is probably less like on the work
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.580]   side and more for fun or pleasure, but you know, it sort of revolves around the things
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.580]   I do for business.
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:12.100]   I was just up in SF last week and, you know, kind of for a client of mine, but, you know,
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.620]   met with friends, met with other people.
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:18.420]   And so I try to honestly combine, you know, like in my typical week, I would say I work
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.740]   20 to 30 hours a week, but you know, like I try to find trips, for example, where, you
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.420]   know, like I go to SF, I meet for business reasons, I meet friends, I take meetings,
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:30.340]   you know, I kind of do a mix of, you know, a few different things.
[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.820]   So that's sort of my typical week though might be 20 to 30 hours of actual work.
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.140]   I mean, I try to, you know, be very focused and I'm sure everyone says that, but I feel
[00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.980]   like I, it may be a little atypical.
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.740]   Like I only check my email once a day.
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.220]   I don't have notifications on my phone.
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.180]   I don't take phone calls, you know, stuff like that.
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:53.580]   I don't do many meetings, you know, I'm all async email, you know, stuff like that.
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:57.860]   So I, you know, I think everyone says like, Oh, I'm really efficient when they work, but
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.180]   I try to be pretty damn efficient.
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:06.820]   You know, usually I drop my kids off around 9am, I'm home by 930, work, you know, 930
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.380]   to five ish, but obviously I'm only doing 20 to 30 hours a week.
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:12.780]   So, you know, I might go to the gym once or twice a week, play golf once a week, take
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:17.260]   them, you know, friends, lunch, happy hour, you know, so there's always things that kind
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.260]   of break up the day.
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.580]   So that's sort of my typical week.
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.860]   You know, I spent a lot of time with moms because I'm, I would consider myself a stay
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.220]   at home dad.
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:30.940]   How does your wife feel about you with flexible hours and her in the office?
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.740]   And I'm assuming she works more than 40 hours a week.
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.460]   Is she okay with that?
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:39.540]   I mean, I think she, you know, compared to her residency, she's probably very happy.
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.260]   And I feel like she's around all the time now compared to residency because you legitimately
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.740]   do work 70 to 80 hours a week, if not more.
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.540]   And you know, on call and all that.
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.620]   And so now, I mean, she's at a private practice where they do shared, you know, because babies,
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.580]   she's OBGYNs, the babies come all times of the day and night.
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.940]   So that makes it a little tougher.
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.140]   So she does a shared call.
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:04.260]   So she's basically on call to deliver babies once every six weekends.
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.820]   And then during the week, she might have to go out once a week, for example, like late
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.300]   night to deliver one of her own patients.
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.740]   And she probably works about 40 to 50 hours a week.
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:19.100]   So it's like a normal, probably hard job, but for her, you know, easier than what she
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.100]   used to be.
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.100]   And she's making more money.
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.100]   So yeah, and she's making more money.
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.900]   So it is definitely nice.
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.060]   You know, it's been a long while to get here.
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.500]   But now I think we're in a pretty good spot.
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:34.780]   But to answer your question directly, I mean, yeah, I think, you know, it is tough for her,
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.740]   you know, like, I don't want to put words in her mouth, but I definitely get the feeling
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.260]   that her or someone in her position, you know, she's probably not gonna listen to this podcast.
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:46.860]   So no words there, but you know, her or someone out, you know, someone of her friends is gonna
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.540]   listen and send it to her probably.
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.060]   But you know, her or someone in her position, right?
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:55.860]   Like, you know, tomorrow, I'm playing golf with two co founders of a company that I just
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:56.860]   invested in.
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:57.860]   And you know what I mean?
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.260]   It's like, you know, some of the work that I do, like, quote, unquote, work, you know,
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:06.180]   is pretty loosely defined work, you know, I'm kind of always out and about and have
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.620]   more flexibility.
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:12.140]   But I also think that, like, you know, from her perspective, I'm sure she's a little bit
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.140]   jealous at times.
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.940]   And, you know, I try not to rub it in her face, like, hey, I went out and played golf
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:16.940]   today.
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.820]   You know, if she asked me, of course, I would tell her.
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.340]   But you know, I try not to rub it in her or other people's faces.
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:28.060]   But also, I think it's always like, like certain types of people, this works well for and others,
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.060]   it doesn't.
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.100]   I have friends who work really hard and always have a lot of things going on.
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.700]   And, you know, I always try to convince them to do some of the stuff that I'm doing or,
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:39.260]   you know, work in similar ways as I or take on projects or, you know, when they're done
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:43.260]   with one startup, you know, to go into VC or something chill, you know, go be a product
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.260]   manager at Google.
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.940]   And it's like, I just know, though, deep down, like some people just love the grind.
[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:52.900]   And you know, even though they always say that they may not say, they may say that they
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.460]   don't like I think it really is kind of like your, your, you know, certain people have
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.460]   different personalities.
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:02.780]   And so I don't know that, like, the way she works would work well for me and vice versa.
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:03.780]   Right.
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.700]   Let's talk a little bit more about the ride share guy.
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:07.700]   Sure.
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.060]   It's been going on for a while.
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:14.060]   And you know, you were early in recognizing the ride share movement, and then it went
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.580]   into food delivery and all that.
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:16.580]   And then micro mobility.
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.820]   I remember you were talking about bird and all those guys.
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.300]   Like, what's next?
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:26.140]   Now what's what's the focus of your site and you know, your genre?
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.140]   And what should investors be looking at?
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:34.380]   Yeah, well, I mean, I guess what I would say is I have, you know, spent nine years I mean,
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.220]   as the name of the site might, you know, impute ride share, you know, we cover Uber and Lyft.
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.060]   And that's sort of what we're best known for.
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:45.420]   And, you know, I think that we built a lot of credibility as experts in Uber and Lyft,
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.420]   you know, especially from the driver's perspective.
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.300]   And honestly, like, I don't know, to me, it's kind of enough.
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.540]   Like, I kind of really lean into that.
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:53.540]   Okay.
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:57.100]   And I don't want people to think of me as like, an expert in scooters or an expert in last
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.300]   mile delivery and ride share.
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:03.500]   Like, I want to be literally like the top point 1% when people think about Uber, Lyft
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.500]   and the driver perspective.
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.500]   Okay.
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.500]   Right.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.540]   And that's kind of to me, I think that market is big enough, you know, to be honest, I mean,
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.620]   millions of drivers out there.
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:15.460]   And, you know, there's plenty of opportunity, there's plenty of things we can do better
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:20.780]   within the business to dominate that category, you know, those search topics, those revenue
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:21.780]   streams.
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.920]   And then, you know, there are other opportunities that I think have sort of kind of fallen into
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.920]   my lap.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.140]   Like you mentioned in 2018 and 19, scooters were huge.
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.460]   I started charging scooters here for Bird in Santa Monica, just for fun.
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:39.180]   I grew up in Santa Monica, you know, then in 2018 and 19, scooters was our most popular
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.180]   content.
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:43.620]   We are doing, you know, scooter reviews on YouTube and charging scooters and that kind
[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.380]   of obviously faded.
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:48.300]   But the past three years has been a lot of last mile delivery stuff.
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:54.500]   So Uber Eats, DoorDash, Instacart, Amazon Flex, Walmart Spark, you know, the big ones
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:59.240]   kind of being DoorDash and Uber Eats and Instacart, kind of the big three in the delivery space.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.940]   And so probably a majority of our traffic and revenue now comes from delivery services.
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.300]   But I definitely don't pretend to be, you know, like the number one expert in all things
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.300]   delivery.
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.300]   I know a lot and I know enough to be dangerous.
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.460]   You know, I can talk about it on an investor call or, you know, I definitely know more
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.820]   than the average person.
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:21.600]   But I don't, you know, try to market myself in the same way because I just feel like it
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.660]   might be spreading myself out a little too thin.
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:29.460]   Now, so for listeners who are not entrepreneurs, they're just day job workers.
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.860]   So they see, okay, the ride share guy, he's an entrepreneur, he makes money.
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:38.820]   But how do you make money and well, how would you break down the revenue as a percentage
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.940]   of different line items?
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:41.940]   Sure.
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:46.700]   So probably the number one way that we make money would be off of affiliates.
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:52.240]   So that would be Legion, so signing up new drivers for Uber, Uber Eats, Instacart, DoorDash
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.080]   are probably the top four.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:59.840]   And then we have other affiliates, for example, you know, GetUpside is a cash back gas app.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.520]   So that's a pretty good fit for Uber and Lyft drivers.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.200]   There's other, you know, financial apps, banking apps.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.320]   So that's affiliate is probably one category.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:15.440]   And kind of, I would say not the easiest, but you know, as you know, with your business,
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.140]   like if you find the right affiliate, you can make a lot of money and not have to do
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.500]   a lot of work, I guess you would say.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.800]   And then there's also direct advertising.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.720]   So this would be, you know, we send out four emails every single week, you know, with new
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.720]   blog posts.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.940]   Yeah, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday.
[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.380]   So that includes an email about the blog post.
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:40.020]   So I mean, we're kind of revamping things, but the gist is we've always traditionally
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.340]   for nine years, we've sent out at least four emails a week.
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.060]   And that would be, you know, either one really good blog post or a few blog posts we've done
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:51.980]   over the past couple of days, because I have a number of contributors on the YouTube channel
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:52.980]   and blog.
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.420]   And so we've got multiple contributors.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.900]   And you know, at the top and bottom of each newsletter, we sell an ad spot.
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.140]   So like right now we're advertising a company called Wallet.
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:06.200]   And it's like a financial, you know, app or a banking account or something like that.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.940]   And it's cool one for gig workers.
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.180]   So we're advertising that and you know, that is right above the fold gets clicked a lot.
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:16.980]   And you know, we do sponsored posts, sponsored videos, sponsored podcasts, you know, basically
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:23.220]   anything where someone's paying us more directly and hoping for results versus affiliate is
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.340]   where they pay you solely.
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.060]   You sign up one driver, we'll give you a hundred dollars.
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.060]   Right.
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.660]   So those are kind of the big two.
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.860]   And then, I mean, I also do consulting the past, you know, I think again, right.
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.380]   Because since we've established ourselves as such experts in Uber and Lyft and you know,
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:41.700]   quoted in the media, interviewing executives and all that were pretty visible and easy
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:42.700]   to find.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:48.020]   So, you know, I have done a lot for some reason this month, I've done a lot of GLG expert
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.020]   network type calls.
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.020]   Gerson Lehman?
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.020]   The Gerson Lehman group?
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.020]   Yeah, the GLGs and the Alpha Insights.
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:59.700]   And I mean, I kind of charge kind of crazy amounts for these guys because they're a bit
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.940]   of a, you know, hassle to work with.
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.020]   Like you can book them one hour.
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:08.220]   Do you go directly with GLG and then they take a percentage of your hourly rate?
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.380]   Are you like a GLG person?
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.380]   Like how does that work?
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:16.540]   So basically, on my site, I kind of call this revenue source for us consulting.
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:20.500]   And basically on my site, you can book a one hour call with me for 750 bucks.
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:25.460]   And basically just over time, I started at 50, 100, 250, 500, 750 and just have gone
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.460]   up over time.
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:30.140]   And I mean, it's a lot but I also think it's reasonable if you've ever paid a lawyer, you
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.380]   know, like a decent lawyer costs 500 an hour.
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:36.660]   So I feel like a ride share industry expert can easily charge more than that.
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:42.500]   And then I have a profile on all of the networks like GLG and Alpha Insights.
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.900]   GLG and Alpha Insights and there might be one more probably the big three that I get
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:47.900]   calls from.
[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.260]   And so I've got a profile on there.
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.260]   And I actually do a double rate.
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:55.860]   So I do 1500 an hour on GLG because there's a lot of well, there's two things.
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:59.340]   There's a lot of hassle in booking, you know, they call you, they always want to call you
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.660]   and like talk for five minutes.
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:03.220]   They're like, "Are you a good fit for this project on ride share?"
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:04.700]   I'm like, "Yeah, I wrote the book on ride share.
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:05.940]   I've interviewed Uber CEO three times.
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.500]   I've been covering the industry for 10 years.
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:08.500]   Like, yeah, I'm a good fit for this.
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.500]   I can look at my LinkedIn or do anything."
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:13.940]   You know, so it's like a little BS you have to deal with them.
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:18.700]   And then I also tell them I have a one hour minimum and a 48 hour cancellation policy.
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:22.100]   I always make them agree to that over email or text up front.
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.940]   And then, you know, so I've sort of gotten good at doing these calls.
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:32.820]   And, you know, I really only do Uber, Lyft, you know, expert driver type calls basically.
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.300]   And you know, so I charge them.
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:38.180]   And the other, I actually used to charge 750, but I bumped it up to 1500 when I think I
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:42.980]   saw this report about GLG that said their profit margin was like 70% on these expert
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:43.980]   network calls.
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.900]   And I was like, "Oh, shoot, I better jump better off my plate."
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:47.900]   So, yeah.
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:48.900]   Wait, so, but how does it work exactly?
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.100]   If you charge 1500, how much does GLG get out of the 1500?
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.100]   I don't know.
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:58.780]   I know that their average, most of the people on their network are more in the $200 to $300.
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.540]   Like literally, I think they're slighter.
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.260]   You can only set a 500 or 750.
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:06.260]   I always have to email them and say, "Hey, no, I'm going above your, you know, sort of
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:07.260]   asking rate."
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.540]   But, I mean, it kind of crystallized for me.
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:13.500]   Like I remember I did a call one time with some capital group, you know, and I looked
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.100]   them up and they had $4 billion invested in Uber.
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:20.420]   I'm like, "They'll probably pay a couple thousand bucks for some expert on drivers, right?"
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.060]   And so, you know, probably not everyone.
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:27.060]   Yeah, you know, not everyone can charge, you know, that much.
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.060]   But I think you'd be surprised.
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.860]   And, you know, I've been doing these over time.
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.860]   And I also don't rely on this income.
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.740]   So, you know, if it comes, great.
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:34.740]   If not, no worries.
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:41.300]   But, yeah, nothing easier than taking like a call at home, you know, for $200 for one
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.300]   hour.
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:47.300]   Well, so this is a lesson for listeners because if you can become an authority in a subject
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:51.820]   matter, you can be an expert in a subject matter, and you, the longer you exist and
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:56.020]   the longer you cover and the more you know, the more you can charge.
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:01.900]   People are looking for insights, whether it's competitors or investors.
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.980]   So it's something to think about, you know, when you're doing your day job, okay, you're
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.300]   an expert at whatever you're doing.
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:11.700]   But can that scale and can you earn other income as a consultant?
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.220]   And can you brand yourself online?
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:16.660]   These are things to think about that I've encouraged Financial Samurai listeners to
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.220]   think about and do for a long time.
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:23.220]   Because 10 years later, if you have 10 years on your belt, I would say you're an expert,
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:24.220]   right?
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.740]   I mean, honestly, a lot of the knowledge I feel like I have these days is not because
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:28.740]   I'm some genius.
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.940]   It's just because I've been doing it for 10 years, right?
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:34.660]   Like there have literally been like cycles of people that came through all of these companies,
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:38.340]   you know, the first four or five years came and went, the early employees, and then the
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.220]   next site, like we're in like the third cycle of employees.
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.860]   So a lot of companies are like doing, you know, products that they tested before that
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:45.860]   they just didn't know about.
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.780]   And I'm like, Oh, yeah, I remember Uber tested this product like six years ago.
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:49.780]   You know what I mean?
[00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.620]   It's just like, I'm almost just like, I don't even have that great of a memory.
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.260]   It's just like, Oh, you know, I covered this six years ago, let me go back and look up
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.340]   the article or the video we did.
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:01.140]   And you know that I would honestly say that like in some of these people probably aren't
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:02.460]   hiring me for that.
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:07.300]   But in probably, you know, 30 to 50% of the calls or consulting calls that I do a lot
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:12.100]   of time, it's stuff like that people are asking me, or, you know, I'm connecting with people
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.740]   who have interviewed in the past or whatever it might be.
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:19.180]   So I do think that compounding knowledge is, you know, pretty valuable.
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:23.220]   And also to like going back to the type of personality, like, I'm the type of person
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:26.540]   like I don't really want to do like 500 bucks an hour is great.
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.540]   That's a lot of money, right?
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:32.580]   But like, I don't really want to do like 10 $500 an hour calls, I'd rather do, you know,
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:37.420]   two or three $1,000 an hour, you know, like, I'd rather make less money and do way less
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:38.700]   work if that makes sense.
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:42.700]   So whenever I can kind of find that type of opportunity, where maybe I'm, you know, being
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:47.500]   paid less overall, but I'm working a lot less, like, that's kind of the thing that I enjoy.
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:52.060]   Because also, at the end of the day, too, if I do 10 consulting calls with investors,
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:55.460]   you know, the third, basically the third one on, I'm gonna be talking about all the same
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:56.460]   stuff, right?
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.940]   Like one or two calls is pretty interesting and pretty fun.
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.700]   And, you know, actually, like, sometimes these are pretty valuable, they'll be asking me
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.260]   questions or topics that I haven't thought of yet.
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.260]   And so it sort of makes me think or go do research after the fact.
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:11.260]   But you know, I guess like I have a classic entrepreneur mind, I don't like doing the
[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.660]   same stuff over and over, you know.
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:18.740]   I'm not like you, I can't crank out three blog posts a week for 13 years or however
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:19.740]   long you've done it.
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:22.700]   But it's not the same topic every time.
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:23.700]   That's true.
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.460]   So you're focused on the same topic or very similar topics.
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.700]   I try to increase the breadth.
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.440]   Maybe that's good, maybe that's bad, but that's life.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:39.740]   So in terms of, given, you said Lyft is one of your main clients, what would you assign
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:43.900]   probability that Lyft will be around over the next 24 months?
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:44.900]   And who do you think would acquire them?
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.060]   Well, actually, Lyft isn't one of our clients.
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.900]   I don't think we make any money off of Lyft right now.
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:49.900]   Oh, really?
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:51.940]   We don't have any sort of driver referrals or affiliate.
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:52.940]   They probably should.
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:55.700]   So if anyone's listening from Lyft, they should probably get that signed up.
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.540]   Because in all of our Lyft articles, we tell people that, you know, at the bottom, the
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.820]   call to action is like, "Make sure you're signed up for Uber," right?
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:04.380]   Because we make money off of that.
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:05.500]   And yeah, so we cover them.
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.980]   I mean, so I guess, what was your question?
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.620]   Are we going to be around in 24 months?
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:14.540]   What do you think the probability is they'll be around in the next 24 months?
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:15.940]   I think they'll still be around.
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.860]   I mean, they've obviously, their stock price has been absolutely hammered.
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.180]   They've laid off thousands of people.
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:25.420]   And there's a lot of sort of doom, I don't know, doomsday or doom fearing, whatever the
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.140]   word is, you know, around the company.
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.140]   And you know, when I went to see us, that was probably in January, that was probably
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.800]   the number one question people asked me like, "Oh, is Lyft going to be out of business soon?"
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:39.460]   But if you actually look at the underlying numbers, like they're basically at 95% of
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:43.060]   the ride volume that they were at right before COVID, right?
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.580]   Where all these companies have been trying to recover to pre-COVID numbers.
[00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:48.940]   And so, I mean, they're still doing millions of rides every single day.
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:51.580]   You can still go out and get a Lyft in any major city.
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:56.180]   You know, maybe it's not, you know, five minutes, maybe it takes seven, eight minutes, right?
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:00.020]   And there's always still, there's just so much variability in the gig economy and the
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.900]   ride share industry that there are so many times, you know, the other day I needed a
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:06.180]   ride to the airport and I looked on Uber and it was 100 bucks.
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.180]   On Lyft, it was 50.
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.180]   Boom.
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.180]   Called Lyft, took a Lyft to the airport.
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.180]   It was a good ride.
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.180]   It was a good ride as a customer.
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.180]   As a driver, you probably want that Uber ride, right?
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.180]   Because you make more.
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:17.340]   But as a customer, you know, even at the exact same ride, at the exact same time, to the
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:20.860]   exact same starting and end point, there was a 2X price difference.
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:21.860]   Like, that's nuts.
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:24.540]   Well, that's why we need Lyft to survive.
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:28.540]   But it doesn't look like they're going to survive over the next 24 months.
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:29.540]   I don't know.
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.860]   I mean, I don't know if their profitability looks pretty good.
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.980]   If you look at their income statement and cash flow statement.
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:35.980]   And it's...
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:39.500]   Honestly, I feel like that's sort of beyond my...
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.980]   That's probably more of a question for the analysts, you know, or the sort of people
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:45.340]   that actually like, I barely know how to read a P&L.
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:52.340]   So I think to me, it's just more around like, wow, I think about it like the actual brand
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:55.860]   and the volume of rides and sort of the driver perception.
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.620]   Like right now, like drivers could care less.
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:58.620]   Like drivers have no idea.
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:01.340]   You know, I mean, maybe they know that stock price is in the tank.
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:06.100]   But if you ask them, like, what's their actual experience like now compared to a year ago,
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.860]   for example, on Lyft, like, no one's saying like, oh, my God, this company's in shambles.
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.820]   They're like, maybe I get a few less rides.
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:12.820]   It's about the same.
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:13.820]   You know what I mean?
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:18.460]   Like, I think there is for that individual driver, there's definitely quite a large disconnect
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:23.260]   with, you know, some of the sort of higher level or more macro things like stock price
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.860]   or, you know, balance sheet.
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:28.380]   Obviously if Lyft goes bankrupt, and there's no more rides for them, that would be a big
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.380]   effect.
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:34.180]   But a lot of times, the things that affect the front lines are actually pretty different
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:37.740]   than, you know, what's talked about in regards to Lyft stock price and, you know, internal
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.740]   this and that on CNBC.
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:40.740]   Yeah.
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:46.060]   Uber hasn't seemed to have returned a lot to shareholders since it went public.
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:51.460]   And so do you think the CEO deserves his mega pay as a result?
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:52.860]   I don't know how much he's getting paid.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:56.860]   I think he has some package where he makes 200 million if they hit a certain stock price.
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:57.860]   I don't think they're there.
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:01.020]   But I want to say he makes, you know, I'm sure he makes 5, 10 million bucks a year at
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.740]   least if not more.
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.940]   And I'm sure he's doing quite well financially.
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.100]   You know, I mean, I've interviewed him a few times.
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.180]   Personally, I like him.
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.180]   I think he's very sharp.
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:13.860]   I was always really impressed with, you know, he's got a lot of different things going on.
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:18.420]   And I was always impressed with how well he knew the driver experience.
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:22.020]   Even once all the cameras were off at this in-person event, you know, he was taking driver
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:25.620]   questions and pulling up his product managers who had probably never even talked to him
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:26.620]   before.
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:27.620]   He was like, "I'm not going to do this issue."
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:31.340]   You know, so I think like genuinely I like him and I think he is a great person.
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.620]   I think it's also hard to argue with the performance of the stock price.
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:39.060]   It's done pretty poorly, you know, compared to relatively to tech and, you know, since
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:44.140]   their IPO and, you know, especially too before this latest market crash or whatever you would
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.140]   call it.
[00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.780]   Like, I mean, their stock price was doing terrible, you know, basically compared to
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.580]   tech, which had been booming.
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:52.820]   And so, yeah, I mean, I think if you're judging him based on stock price alone, he hasn't
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:53.820]   done very well.
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:54.820]   Yeah.
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:58.460]   I mean, it is always interesting, you know, I know a couple of CEOs myself.
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:04.980]   It seems like it's more of a job about image, about being an ambassador, being able to speak
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.420]   eloquently and deliver the message.
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.460]   And I do wonder how many of us can do that.
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:15.380]   I feel like many of us can do that job if we are an expert in the field and we can just
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.760]   be a normal people person and manage people.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.580]   We too can make a hundred million a year and just do this and that.
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.580]   Oh, really?
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.580]   I don't think so.
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:29.260]   I think what I described as his skillset, I think is actually pretty unique.
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:32.860]   Like I think the ability to sort of tell that, right.
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:35.460]   Like I think like what you said is the perfect example, right.
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:40.460]   Like there are certain companies where, you know, it's sort of about, you know, I mean,
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:42.820]   obviously the underlying metrics and the numbers always matter.
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:46.380]   But like if you really trust the CEO and the vision and the investments that they're making
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:50.540]   and, you know, they sort of, you know, I mean, all of life is being a good salesperson,
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:51.540]   right.
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.700]   Like, you know, come on to my podcast.
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:54.740]   Here's why you should do it.
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:55.940]   Here's my audience, right.
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:57.660]   Or here, come advertise with us, right.
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:58.940]   Like, you know, come marry me.
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:03.940]   Like everything is sort of, you know, in essence, a form of sales in life, I believe.
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:07.500]   And so I think when it comes to being a CEO, I don't actually think that's a skill that
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.100]   many or most people have.
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:14.700]   Like I think Dara has done a great job despite the stock performance, you know, like I don't
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.900]   think the stock has done that well.
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.580]   I think someone else would have been fired long ago.
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:21.980]   Like I'm surprised that people aren't, you know, banging on the door like, hey, the stock
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:23.780]   price is doing terrible, for example, right.
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:28.900]   You know, there's a few critics, but I think for the most part, and, you know, also talking
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:34.300]   to him, you know, sort of one on one, I did get that sense like, I mean, he's got, you
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:37.060]   know, they've got all these different divisions and this and that.
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.980]   And like, I would say like he wasn't an expert on every little detail of drivers, but you
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:47.780]   could tell he was the type of person who could process a lot of information, remember a lot,
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.820]   considering that that's like a small part of his job.
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:51.820]   Right.
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:54.380]   I think the other, there's been a few people that I've met, you know, not celebrities,
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:58.300]   but, you know, like a few big names, like, I don't know a ton of important people, but
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:03.700]   another person that I met, we had a former LA mayor, Eric Garcetti, come and speak at
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.580]   a conference we put on in LA called CurbAvore.
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.340]   And I used to be a big fan of his.
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.420]   I thought he was really eloquent.
[00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:12.460]   I thought during the pandemic and COVID, he totally botched the whole situation.
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:17.740]   We don't need to get into all that, but just at a personal level, like I really, my feelings
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.820]   about him, like really dropped off a cliff.
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.020]   And then he came and spoke at our conference.
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.460]   I'm like, okay, I like this guy again.
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.700]   He was kind of like a little mini celebrity and everyone kind of mobbed him afterwards.
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:30.580]   And, you know, he obviously talked about transportation and mobility and, you know, dining, because
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:34.500]   this was sort of a conference around delivery and restaurant and retail.
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:38.940]   And I was thinking to myself, like for all the issues that this guy has going on, homeless,
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:42.100]   budget, you know, this, that, like he's got a million things.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:44.180]   Like he was an amazing speaker.
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:48.900]   He was dropping stories and he was talking like with actual knowledge about, you know,
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.820]   like programs the city had done.
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:54.620]   And I'm like, you know, maybe he did a little prep work before this, but like, this is very,
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:59.660]   you know, speaking at CurbAvore conference, no shade to myself, is very low on his priority
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.660]   list, right?
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:05.100]   And I was really impressed actually with the actual speech that he gave.
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.620]   And it just kind of crystallized.
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.860]   Like I don't think many people, like if I was in his position, like I wouldn't have
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.940]   been able to give anything, you know, close to that.
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:16.700]   And you know, not only did it sound good, like the actual substance of the content and
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:19.020]   what he was talking about made sense too.
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:23.220]   And so I feel like there's been very few people in my life, you know, they're sort of in high,
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:27.460]   you know, I haven't met a lot, but you know, the few people in my life that I've met of
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:32.980]   like high, you know, stature or positions or CEOs or whatever, you know, Dara and Mayor
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:35.940]   Garcetti sort of stand out to me.
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:40.500]   I think what you're also telling me is that if more people can connect with other people
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:45.540]   in person and hear their story, I think there would be more harmony and understanding in
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:46.540]   this world.
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:50.820]   I think a lot of people, they'll see what they see on TV, the internet, whatever, and
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:51.860]   they'll just make judgment.
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:55.500]   But as soon as you start meeting someone, talking to them face to face, listening to
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:59.460]   their story and their background, I think it's inevitable that there will be some kind
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:02.260]   of more positive connection.
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:07.700]   I think also that working in the office creates that and working outside of the office at
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:12.580]   home, if you're like a junior person who's not established and all that, I think it's
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:14.220]   much better to go into the office.
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.220]   What do you think?
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:16.220]   Yeah.
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:17.220]   No, I think that, yeah, I don't know.
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.860]   I think it would be hard to argue with that.
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.980]   I think that's pretty obvious and that, you know, like obviously meeting, you know, it's
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:25.820]   a lot harder to talk crap, you know, in person than it is like the things that people say
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:28.980]   online, you know, very few people would say that to your face.
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:32.500]   I remember we actually had this commenter on the Ride Share Guy blog and he used to
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.860]   always be talking crap in the comments, but you could sort of tell he knew what he was
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:36.860]   talking about.
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:40.980]   Like he was like very negative and, you know, kind of a dick, but you know, he had like
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.980]   some really good insights and strategies, but you know, the way he would say it was
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.220]   like, you know, like very, very rude.
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:49.380]   And I actually like, I, a couple of times I was like, let's grab lunch, let's meet up.
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:53.980]   And I eventually met up and I basically tamed him and he's actually one of our top contributors
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:54.980]   now.
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:55.980]   Shout out to Sergio.
[00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:56.980]   He's the dick in the comments.
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:02.700]   He's actually literally like now our top contributor has a really popular weekly live show.
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:06.740]   Does all of our, most of our media, you know, appearances and stuff like that.
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:07.740]   Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:11.460]   He probably too much to be honest, but yeah, I think he will.
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:17.060]   And you know, I think that like he, and you know, even him, he's like probably more, I
[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:20.740]   think of him as like the old grizzled, you know, veteran driver persona.
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:25.260]   Like he's been around, he's, you know, definitely more skeptical or negative than, you know,
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.340]   someone like why fresh dough out off the streets.
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.860]   But still like, I always, I always kind of joke with him.
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:32.900]   Like I think back when he used to comment on our blog, like, wow, who would have ever
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:35.940]   thought that he would end up, you know, being one of our top contributors, like based off
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:36.940]   of those early comments.
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:41.140]   And you know, I think it definitely shows that, you know, you know, I think people are
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:45.540]   more real in person and yeah, you can obviously connect better.
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:51.220]   And I think, you know, just sort of like being more human, I guess you would say in person
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:52.220]   than online.
[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.220]   Like online is, I don't know.
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.940]   That's why I don't, I'm not on social media.
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:59.460]   I don't, you know, I'm on Twitter, you know, but like other than that, I'm not, you know,
[00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.460]   posting on Instagram.
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.460]   I'm not a big social media person.
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:05.300]   I mean, we have all the business profiles set up because I want to make money, but you
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.380]   know, not for my personal enjoyment.
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:11.900]   Twitter is probably the only outlet that I actually enjoy, you know, stories and things
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.340]   people are sharing and stuff.
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:19.180]   Well, kudos to you for reaching out to your belligerent commenter or slash hater and then
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.500]   making lemonade out of it.
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:25.740]   I mean, the funny thing is like for those listening, you know, as a financial samurai
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:28.100]   generates probably around a million page views a month.
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:32.220]   So you know, even a 1% haters, that's a lot of hate for a lot of people.
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.220]   It's a lot of haters.
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:34.220]   0.1%.
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:38.580]   So just be careful because if you want to create something, be careful what you wish
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:42.940]   for because as you grow, you're going to get more hate, even though you're not writing
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:47.740]   something that or saying something that's spiteful, but people will have their say in
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:50.180]   the world, whether you like it or not.
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:56.780]   Well, and also too, I mean, I think the most interesting content is usually somewhat opinionated
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.460]   or controversial, right?
[00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:03.300]   And you know, some people are going to agree, some people are going to disagree.
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:08.900]   And you know, I think for me, I kind of like the spot that I'm at in the, you know, the
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:12.940]   gig, like my sort of overall viewpoint is the gig economy is here to stay.
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:16.080]   There's millions of people driving for Uber and delivering food.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.860]   That's not going to change regardless of what I say.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:22.980]   So my sort of overarching theme has always been like, I want to help them do it better.
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.580]   I want to help them make more money.
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:28.100]   I'm happy, you know, we have the occasional article or sometimes more than the occasional
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.340]   article like, oh, this sucks about driving.
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.260]   Cause you know, like any job, there's like a lot of things.
[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:35.460]   Like I could do an article, like a hundred things that suck about Uber driving.
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:38.900]   But as long, you know, like I think it's hard to argue with the fact that there's millions
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:39.900]   of people doing it.
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:40.900]   Obviously the positives outweigh the negatives.
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:41.900]   Right.
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:44.860]   And at the end of the day, like drivers care most about making money and having a good
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:45.860]   experience.
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:49.140]   So how can we help that while still giving them an outlet to complain or, you know, to
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:52.100]   highlight the things that can be improved or whatever it might be.
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:55.340]   And so I think that's kind of the lens that I've always had.
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:59.060]   And you know, I kind of, I wouldn't say I get hate from all sides, but like we definitely
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.500]   have, you know, Uber or Lyft or whoever will hit me up once in a while, like, oh, why'd
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.500]   you say this about us?
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.500]   Or Harry, you're wrong.
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.060]   We don't agree with that.
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:07.060]   They're pretty good.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.060]   Like honestly, they don't bug me much.
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:11.300]   And then, you know, we get the drivers who are like, oh, Harry, you're such a sellout.
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:12.300]   You're a shill.
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.460]   You're just trying, you know, you just want to sign people up for Uber, you know, and
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:16.460]   this and that.
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:20.460]   And so it's like, to me, as long as I'm getting a little bit of hate from all sides, that's
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.140]   how I think I know I'm doing a good job.
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:27.180]   And you know, and also to balancing that with like my overarching, like it would be a bad
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:31.700]   business to start a blog and a YouTube channel about how much driving for Uber sucks.
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:35.220]   You get a partner come in and they're like, hey, we've got, you know, this great app for
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:38.220]   drivers and you're like, okay, one video, go quit driving for Uber.
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.820]   And the next one, by the way, if you're going to drive for Uber, use this product, you know,
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:41.820]   it just doesn't make sense.
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:42.820]   Right.
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.300]   And so I think those are kind of like the two things that I balance.
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:49.500]   And honestly too, I think is it's really challenging and kind of like that.
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:54.000]   Those are sort of like the fun challenges that I like, like how do we balance keeping
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.380]   advertisers happy while still retaining enough or some of our credibility that, you know,
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.440]   the readers trust us.
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:04.060]   So I think like navigating and walking that fine line is kind of like, that's what I enjoy
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:06.100]   most about this type of business.
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:07.100]   That is tough.
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:10.980]   You've always been very industrious since I've known you.
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:15.480]   And maybe it's because you're younger or just your personality.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:19.220]   And I mean, for example, you reaching out to the guy and then the hater, and then he's
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:22.140]   now your top contributor and you pay him.
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:24.400]   That's impressive because I have no time for that.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:29.200]   I'm like overwhelmed with childcare and I feel like they're going to leave us and they're
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.860]   going to be adults sooner than we know it.
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:38.320]   How many employees and contractors do you manage and is there a limit for how many you
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:39.320]   want to manage?
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.320]   Because that takes work.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.880]   I mean, managing people is tough.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:42.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:48.440]   I mean, I think that there was a pretty big step function change when I hired basically
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:52.400]   my first full time person to kind of handle a lot of that.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:56.120]   We had one QuickBooks self-employed, it was one of our top advertisers and they wanted
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:01.920]   weekly meetings and reports and check-ins and a lot of, in my opinion, boring stuff
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.800]   that wasn't adding much value to signing up users.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.200]   But obviously, they needed that to report or whatever.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.840]   And I basically hired someone to handle that account and a few other advertisers.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:14.200]   And I feel like I remember I was living in Long Beach at the time and I would go into
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.280]   a co-working space most days, didn't have kids yet.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.240]   And when I hired that guy, it would be like 2, 3 p.m.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.320]   I'm like, "Oh, I'm done with my work for the day.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.800]   I don't have much else to do today."
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.520]   It really took a lot off my plate.
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:34.160]   And I really like the sort of team size, like hiring one, two, three, maybe four people.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:39.200]   I really like that because hiring is insanely tough.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:43.600]   But you can still, even like hiring a B player, you can still get a good ROI because it's
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.640]   so obvious if they're doing a good job or not.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:50.160]   You hire someone to do ad sales for you, how much did they sell?
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.160]   That's the easiest KPI.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:56.760]   If they sold $10,000 last month and you got to keep seven of that and they kept three
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:01.400]   and you didn't do anything for that seven, then you're probably pretty happy.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.960]   And so I think certain...
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:07.920]   When you start having to do performance reviews and that, that's where you're starting to
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.320]   actually running a business and that's where it gets really tough.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.240]   But do you do that?
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:16.520]   Well, I did that for a while and then I kind of got over it.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.080]   And so now my team size, we've got a few...
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:24.480]   Well, it's a little different now, but I've sort of...
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:30.920]   Until, let's call it until last year, I usually had around four to five full-time people and
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:36.560]   then a number of contributors, contractors, small to medium, basically any tasks that
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.520]   I didn't want to do, I would try and hire someone.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:44.000]   And so maybe right now I might have 50 people working for me.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.960]   The smallest might be thumbnails on YouTube, a few of them a week, five bucks, 10 bucks
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:54.280]   or whatever each, pretty small, all the way up to editor or COO or whatever it might be.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:58.880]   And then I actually brought on a new business partner last year who I've told you a bit
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.920]   about, but MMG Media.
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:11.840]   And basically they've sort of ended up taking over a lot of the roles and functions that
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.800]   I kind of didn't want to do or have hired people in the past to do.
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:20.080]   So it's sort of now, they're a business partner, so it depends how you qualify them as being
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.600]   on the team or not.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:22.600]   Right.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.600]   Industrious.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:25.600]   I mean, I'm very impressed.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.800]   One of the reasons why I left my day job was because managing people was tough.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:34.160]   If you manage someone, you got to motivate them, be polite, and you have to tell them
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.800]   what to do to get better.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.320]   And then everybody wants to get paid and promoted.
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:39.320]   And so I said, "You know what?
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.920]   I'm going to keep Financial Samurai simple.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.840]   Just my wife and me, and we're just going to...
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:45.840]   That's it.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.480]   No, no, no, no, nobody else."
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.040]   I definitely agree.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:54.560]   I mean, managing people is kind of sucks and isn't that fun.
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:58.400]   I tried it and didn't have that much fun and then hired people to manage my people.
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.400]   Right.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:06.200]   So it's sort of like, I think kind of where I have seen a good balance is where if you
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:12.120]   hire, for example, a full-time virtual assistant or someone who can just provide, who's not
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:16.240]   very expensive, doesn't require managing or full-time salesperson, something where the
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:20.840]   ROI is super clear and you don't need to...
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.680]   It's not like integral to your business.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.520]   It's like you're the business, but they help you with a ton of different things, or you
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:29.040]   have two virtual assistants, so there's a little bit of redundancy.
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:34.280]   I think that's where I think it's kind of a good compromise.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:38.560]   But even then, hiring virtual assistants, hiring people is tough.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:41.560]   It's tough to even find good people.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:51.000]   So speaking of business, in your mind, how much is enough in terms of your income and
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   net worth?
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.320]   Do you have a target net worth you're shooting for?
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:58.040]   You're still in your 30s, so you still got a long way to go.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.880]   You got young kids.
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:06.480]   What is your ideal income range and your target net worth, or do you not have one?
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:07.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:12.680]   I mean, I think probably from reading your articles, that's what's made me think most
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:14.280]   about net worth and the targets.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:16.640]   I know you've got some good content on that.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:23.240]   I don't know if I have a specific target in mind, but I mean, I do have two kids and I
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.240]   do live in LA and I do like nice things.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:30.320]   So I would say that it probably has to be a lot.
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:39.120]   I think that as far as income level, I think if you're in LA, a single dude or a single
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:44.240]   female making $200,000, $300,000 a year, I think you can live a pretty good life.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:49.160]   Once you start to have kids, I think you got to make more.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:54.080]   I think there's sort of the active income, but then there's also investments.
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:55.680]   I've been pretty big into real estate.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:56.680]   I have a condo in San Diego.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:58.680]   I have a little house in Mississippi.
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:03.840]   I have the current house that I live in that's a nice three-bedroom, two-bed house in LA
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:04.840]   and a good neighborhood.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:09.560]   I think I told you, I think we're building a new five-bedroom house in a nice neighborhood
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:12.080]   with a good school district right in the middle of LA.
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:13.360]   And so we're going to rent out this current house.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.520]   So I'll have three rental properties basically.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.080]   So I've been invested in real estate.
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.480]   I've got my business.
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:25.640]   I've been saving basically since I graduated school in 2009, but maxing out my retirement
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:26.640]   account.
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.200]   So I've got pretty good savings, pretty good investments.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:34.080]   And so I feel like if you're making a few hundred thousand bucks income and then you've
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:38.600]   got real estate, you've got a spouse that's bringing in money, I don't know.
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:41.800]   I feel like that's plenty for me right now.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:48.040]   And then as far as net worth goals, I mean, I definitely like nice things, like nice vacations.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.000]   Having a nanny, all of that stuff.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.880]   And so that kind of adds up.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:57.080]   And so I don't know if there's a specific number in mind, but I don't know.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:01.960]   10 million, 20 million, 10 million, 20 million.
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:02.960]   Like those all sound good to me.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:11.680]   - 10 million is the number that a lot of voters voted for 10 million as the ideal number to
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.720]   retire on Financial Samurai.
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:18.200]   - Actually, the number one vote getter was 5 million and then followed by 10 million.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:23.240]   And so you can almost say that 5 million for non-coastal city, 10 million for coastal city.
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.000]   And that was a couple years ago too.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.640]   - It obviously depends on the city you're living in and sort of the job.
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:31.080]   Like I actually really like what I'm doing.
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:32.960]   Like I literally only work on things that I want.
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:39.160]   So if I'm making, let's say, if I was making $300,000 a year right now, I would never retire,
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.160]   for example.
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.160]   I just keep doing what I'm doing.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:45.200]   I'll do different projects and do things every year, but I only work on things that I enjoy
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.200]   anyways.
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:48.760]   So I feel like there's that path.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:54.760]   And then when you get to 5 million, let's call it, if you're maybe a little aggressive,
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:59.600]   but let's say you're making 10% return on your 5 million, that's $500,000 a year.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:03.640]   And especially when you start getting into real estate, like I'm a huge fan of real estate
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:09.160]   just because I think it's very interesting to me how you put, let's say you put 25% down
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.160]   payment.
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.160]   You're now 4X leverage, right?
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.160]   3% return, just inflation.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.720]   That's 12% return a year on real estate alone.
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:19.440]   I mean, the LA real estate, I've owned property in LA state.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:22.720]   I've owned real estate in LA for many years.
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:27.160]   And there were a couple of recent years where it was like 20% appreciation, 10%, right?
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:31.160]   And so able to make kind of a lot of money in real estate.
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:32.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.160]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:38.800]   So it's interesting because you are in the mix right now where you're in the middle of
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:44.200]   the mix right now where you enjoy your job, which is great and you're making good money.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:49.320]   And I always try to challenge listeners and readers to kind of forecast their future,
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.320]   forecast their misery.
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:56.440]   So like at age 45, you know, or whatever, in 10 years from now for you, do you think
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:58.960]   you'll still want to be really doing this?
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:02.320]   Well, what is this?
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:05.720]   Whatever it is you're doing, your ride share, your consultant.
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.440]   Well, it is what it is.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.440]   Yeah, no.
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:09.440]   That's a good question.
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:15.440]   I think that they're one of the things I guess what I, Oh, the easy answer is that I will
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:21.160]   probably be doing something different, but I think the ride share guy, like honestly,
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:26.520]   I think I got so lucky starting the ride share guy in 2014 when Uber and Lyft were, you know,
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.360]   just getting started and just exploded.
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:32.400]   Like I think Uber was literally a once in a lifetime type company opportunity and I
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:36.880]   never worked at the company, but you know, I'm there, I was there covering it and involved
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:41.960]   and you know, new people and, you know, obviously like became like an expert for drivers.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:46.100]   And I think because of that, like, I don't think I'll ever be able to start another ride
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:49.260]   share guy type business on my own.
[00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:52.840]   And so really what I do for the ride share guys, I just leverage it into things I want
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:53.840]   to work on.
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.380]   Like I mentioned my conference, like I'd never, I'd always done digital, never done in person.
[00:49:57.380 --> 00:50:02.380]   And so for the past two years we put on a big event, you know, had 750 registered people
[00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:06.640]   all come out in LA and, you know, put on this like awesome, fun event.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:09.400]   Make a ton of money, made some money, but you know, I did it more because it was like
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:13.640]   a great experience, bring people together, good food, good speakers, good parties, like
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:17.520]   all the stuff I hate about conferences, just do the opposite at mine.
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:21.640]   We do it in an outdoor parking lot in downtown LA and luckily this year we had good weather
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:25.560]   somehow even though it rained all year and we somehow landed one day of good weather
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:28.000]   for the event since it's all outdoors.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.080]   And you know, I've been doing a lot of angel investing over the past three, four years.
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:35.640]   I know you're invested in some VC funds and things like that.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:38.640]   And you know, so obviously like working with all these tech companies, I was like, wow,
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:41.960]   all these people making money off of Uber, it'd be cool for me to, you know, invest in
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:42.960]   the next Uber.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:47.880]   So I've been, you know, I've invested over $600,000 of my own money into startups and
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:51.120]   funds over the past three, four years.
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:52.120]   So kind of a lot.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.440]   It was about double what I wanted to initialize.
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:58.960]   I was like, Oh, I'll do about three, 300 K maybe 10% of my net worth or five, five to
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.040]   10% of my net worth was the goal.
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:05.160]   And then ended up like, before I knew it, I was like, Oh crap, I'm at five, 600 K.
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:09.600]   And before it was like five, 600 K before I realized like, this is a really expensive
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.520]   but fun hobby.
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:15.480]   And luckily I kind of went into, uh, yeah, I mean it could pay out, but it's just tough
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:21.000]   because you know, you don't see any returns for seven to 10 years and it's hard to get
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.280]   into good deals with less than, you know, five, if you're only doing five to $10,000
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:30.160]   per investment that adds up pretty quickly and it's harder to get into deals, you know?
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.520]   So now I actually lucked into a little mini fund.
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:36.040]   So I have one LP that's, I have a $500,000 mini fund.
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:39.960]   So I'm basically investing their money now and now doing $25,000 angel checks.
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:44.880]   So sort of get to keep doing all the fun stuff about angels, angel and get 20% carry if it
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:47.320]   ever makes money and invest in other people's money.
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:52.120]   So I do 10%, I have like kind of a, they call it a 10% general partner commit, right?
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:56.960]   So I'm going to invest 50, they do 500 and you know, I've already written three checks,
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.960]   three 25 K checks from the fund.
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:03.080]   - That's what I love about your story is you're always doing stuff.
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:04.240]   - That's what I'm saying.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:06.680]   Like that is sort of born out of the ride share guy.
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:12.120]   I mean, literally, so my one LP is Bloomberg Beta up in San Francisco and they invested
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:19.480]   in a startup that I was working with, a founder in SF and I ended up, you know, meeting their
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:24.240]   managing partner, Roy, because of this investment, he had heard about me through my work with
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:25.560]   the ride share guy.
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:28.240]   And then, you know, I sort of talked to him about my angel investing and basically the
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:31.640]   TLDR was I love angel investing, don't make enough money to keep doing it.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:34.480]   And he was like, oh, we've got this cool program where we can help you, you know, kind of jump
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.480]   start your first fund.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:37.120]   And I was like, oh, that sounds great.
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.640]   And, you know, obviously it took a while, but we got it all set up.
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:45.480]   And, you know, so I think it's sort of like has allowed me to sort of satiate that interest
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:46.480]   in investing.
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:51.040]   So as you might imagine, you know, I invest in mobility and logistics and, you know, stuff
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:54.800]   that I'm interested in around, you know, kind of like ride share adjacent, you know, like
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:58.560]   right now I'm really into last mile deliveries for companies in that space, maybe a little
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:01.560]   food tech, stuff like that.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.560]   Who manages that fund?
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:06.160]   Like the administration of these funds?
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:10.520]   So that fund, it's funny, I kind of glossed over it, but it took, you know, at first we're
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:14.000]   like, oh, we, you know, we have this fund or this program where we can help you start
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   a mini fund.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.720]   And then when I had to figure it all out, basically the way that I actually structure
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:24.000]   it is that I do, I have a side letter with them where they've committed 500K capital
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.840]   for all of my venture investments going forward.
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:30.360]   And there's a few categories that we can't do the sort of typical alcohol, marijuana
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:33.440]   ones and I have to do 10% into each investment.
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:36.680]   And so it's, you know, I guess a side letter legally binding agreement.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:42.480]   And then for each deal, like I just invested in a cool e-bike company in New York city.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:48.280]   And for that deal, I basically put 25K in from Bloomberg, 2.5K of my own money.
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:53.160]   And then I syndicate it on a sidecar, which is kind of an angel list competitor that has
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.400]   lower fees.
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:58.040]   And so my 27.5K has 4.5K in fees.
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:01.160]   So the actual amount that the company receives is 23,000.
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:05.200]   And then, you know, if I can, you know, convince Sam, Hey, do you want to kick a couple thousand
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.200]   bucks into this investment?
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.720]   You know, I might do that.
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:13.400]   And so, but you know, that's not ideally that does happen, but you know, so it is either
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:15.640]   my money and then maybe someone else's.
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:19.600]   But what's really nice about that is that there's no, you know, updates that I need
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:20.600]   to send them.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:25.600]   So I have all of the fun parts about investing and none of the hassle of running a fund or
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:28.360]   managing a backend or anything like that.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:29.400]   Right, right.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:34.920]   So as an industrious guy, who's very entrepreneurial, what would you do if you were running Financial
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:35.920]   Samurai?
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:36.920]   Hmm.
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:41.160]   Well, you know, I've, I've always joked with you that if I ever have a little free time,
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:44.680]   maybe I'll come and convince you to bring me on as a business partner.
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:50.380]   But I would say, I mean, I think like you seem like the type of person that really enjoys
[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:51.380]   the grind.
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:54.200]   Like you always talk about how you get up early to write blog posts before this and
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:55.560]   your kids and that.
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:59.920]   Like I think kind of like lean into the parts that you enjoy.
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:01.840]   You know, if it's writing, keep writing.
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:06.000]   I don't think you need to necessarily hire people to grow.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.120]   I don't think you need to hire people to cover topics if you're not that passionate or don't
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:11.120]   care about it.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:15.760]   So I would really, I like my impression is that you enjoy the writing aspect.
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:19.300]   So if that's the part that you like, I would lean into that.
[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:22.860]   And I think that also, because that also kind of makes your site stand out with a million
[00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:24.120]   page views a month there.
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:29.960]   I can't think of another site where the owner of a million page view a month site actually
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:34.040]   still writes most of the blog posts, if not all of the blog posts.
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:38.900]   So I think that's kind of what I would lean into is what you enjoy.
[00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:44.480]   Maybe the one area where I think you could do a lot more is leveraging across different
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:45.480]   platforms, right?
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:48.320]   So if you're doing one really big blog post a week, I mean, I think you sort of already
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:49.320]   do this.
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:50.920]   You might do a podcast on it.
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:52.520]   I would also do video.
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:54.840]   I would hire a short form editor.
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:55.840]   I've got a great guy.
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:56.840]   I just tested 10 different video editors.
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:58.400]   I could just send you to him.
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.360]   He's only 40 to 90 bucks a clip.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:05.680]   And then he'll post, he'll watch your one hour interview and pull the however many you
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:07.880]   want, three to eight 60 second clips.
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:13.040]   You post those to TikTok, Instagram, Reels, and YouTube shorts where there's really great,
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:17.600]   we only have one or 2000 followers on Instagram, Reels, and TikTok shorts.
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:22.520]   But some of these videos will easily, most of our videos reach 2000 people and sometimes
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:23.520]   more.
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:24.520]   I mean, they're quick views on Instagram, right?
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:28.080]   People just scrolling through, but that's sort of, to me, I think leveraging, not doing
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:33.960]   more content, but maybe even less content, but leveraging it across different mediums
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:35.280]   might be the one area.
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:37.680]   Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't call it marketing.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:45.240]   I would say you've built up a big presence so you don't have to market like other people
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.240]   might.
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.240]   They're just getting started.
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:49.680]   You've built up a big presence and credibility and following.
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:53.960]   So I think you can leverage it across other, like, you know, the people that are watching
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:59.060]   videos on TikTok about personal finance probably aren't reading, you know, a 1500 word article
[00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:00.060]   on your website.
[00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:04.280]   But the concepts and the principles can apply.
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:05.840]   They just need to be translated.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:06.960]   Right, right.
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:10.160]   Yeah, my philosophy has been, I like to write, so I'll just write.
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:15.000]   It's efficient, it's easy, it's cathartic, it helps me think about things.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.920]   And then I like to get feedback from different people around the world.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:24.080]   And if one day I can no longer write or I have no interest in writing anymore, I'll
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:30.880]   just hire freelancers who embody the philosophy that I have, embrace the philosophy, and will
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:34.480]   write in a way that I deem to be appropriate for my audience.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.360]   So when I burn out, I can always hire someone.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:42.240]   So I figure I might as well just keep on going until I burn out and then do that.
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:44.000]   And that's sort of where I like your model.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.360]   I think you've got enough of a following that you can kind of just do what you like and
[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:49.680]   do what you're good at.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:54.800]   And you could probably make, you know, 25 to 50% more if you hired writers and started
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:58.680]   adding more SEO or reviews of this service or that.
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:04.240]   But I feel like you can also just write three blog posts a week and have such a big following
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:06.440]   and do really well that people find you.
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:11.560]   Maybe you've got one or two or three big affiliates or revenue sources.
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:14.520]   And maybe you could double that, but how much work would it be to onboard?
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:15.520]   What if the company goes bankrupt?
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:20.640]   Just like always, maybe not one, but always have two to three good partners or affiliates
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:21.640]   or whatever it might be.
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:25.480]   And I feel like you could probably do pretty good damage that way and kind of like in a
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:26.480]   high ROI fashion.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:34.680]   I've just gotten to the point at my age and the more you make or the more you have, the
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:37.880]   less interesting it is, at least for me, to make more money.
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:41.040]   And for the podcast, I don't have any sponsors or whatever.
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:44.880]   I'm just doing it for fun and I want my kids to hear what their dad has said during the
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:47.200]   pandemic and stuff.
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:50.360]   So I'm always curious as to how much is enough.
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:54.240]   And maybe it doesn't really matter so long as you're doing what you enjoy doing.
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:55.800]   Everything kind of feels like gravy.
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:56.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:00.720]   It's funny that you mentioned you do the podcast for fun because I don't do anything for fun.
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:07.520]   I always think that there's like, this is fun, but I'm thinking there's always some
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:10.400]   other ... I think of it as like ...
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:13.920]   I think there's like three things that I care about, right?
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:19.320]   Like business return or business opportunity, helping people and then working on something
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:21.920]   interesting, challenging or fun.
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:25.040]   Those are kind of like the three categories that I look to in any project.
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:28.160]   And I would never do anything just for one of those three.
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:33.240]   Like if someone that I absolutely hated wanted to talk about something, the most boring topic
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:37.280]   ever, I mean, for a thousand bucks, I probably wouldn't do that for an hour.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.640]   I mean, obviously, I'll get a million dollars for an hour.
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:40.640]   Like, sure, I'll do that.
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:42.480]   There's probably some point that I would do it.
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:45.160]   But in general, within reason, I wouldn't do that.
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:48.320]   I always look for things like ... I mentioned my angel investing.
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:52.760]   So I started a podcast called Wannabe Angels and we've recorded actually close to 20 or
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:53.760]   30 episodes right now.
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:58.280]   It's a weekly podcast with my co-host, Colin, and we interview up and coming angel investors
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.920]   or experienced or just investors in general.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:05.560]   And the reason why I started that podcast were one, I'm obviously really interested
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.600]   in angel investing.
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.360]   I find it fun, exciting, challenging.
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:09.360]   It's kind of addicting.
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:14.000]   I love working with early stage startups because they're so creative and so optimistic and
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.520]   so hardworking.
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:20.400]   And you don't really have to do all that, but you get like a taste of that as an investor.
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:23.280]   So yeah, it's really addicting in that sense.
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:26.220]   Like intellectually, I find it really stimulating.
[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:29.280]   And then number two, I think there is a good business opportunity.
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:33.440]   I mean, I told Colin, like, let's do this every week for a year and let's see if we
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:37.920]   ... I won't expect to make any money, but if we, after a year, maybe there's more people
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:40.600]   that want to join my syndicate, maybe we can get a sponsor or two.
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.160]   I mean, this is big money.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:46.800]   Like anytime there's large transactions happening and you can interject yourself as a middleman
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:50.360]   into those large transactions, you have the opportunity to make a lot of money.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:56.000]   Real estate agent being the perfect example, get two to 2.5% on a $5 million property for
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   someone who finds it on Redfin.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   Okay, great deal.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   Right?
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.320]   And then the third thing is I think helping people.
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:06.840]   I'm not helping ... this isn't like I'm getting people that are sleeping on the streets into
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:07.840]   houses.
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:08.840]   I'm not like, "Hey, you're an angel.
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:09.840]   You've got to be making good money already.
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:12.240]   These are workers who are already doing pretty well."
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.960]   And so it's not like I'm revolutionizing their lives.
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:19.000]   I'm not that jaded, but I do think that there are a lot of people out there that want to
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.360]   learn about this, that are struggling or whatever, or interested.
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:27.200]   And so I think it's always cool to help people learn a new skill, learn a new topic.
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:31.200]   And it might be more impactful if you're teaching someone coding that's going to get them off
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:36.520]   the streets, but that's not really my area of expertise, or at least with this specific
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:37.520]   opportunity.
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.680]   But I think that that kind of helping people.
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:46.240]   So I think my new podcast, for example, hits all three maybe, I don't know about evenly,
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:50.080]   but maybe a little bit more in the first two categories than the third.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.960]   But I built up Ride Share Guy for the past nine years.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:58.080]   I think that's more so in the third category, helping Uber and Lyft drivers and gig workers
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.000]   who are making 15 to 25 bucks an hour.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:06.560]   I think that's a cool subset of people to help and provide support and work with.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.640]   Okay, that's good.
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.640]   Sounds like you've got a lot on your plate.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:16.320]   You still have, it sounds like max enthusiasm, max energy to keep on grinding and to keep
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.000]   on doing what you love to do, which is great.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.320]   And I think that's awesome.
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.520]   And cherish that feeling because I don't know if it'll last forever.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.360]   Like, I felt like I had that in my 30s.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:29.120]   And then at 40, I was like, "Eh."
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:34.520]   You know what, that might be the one piece of good advice you've given me recently is
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:41.800]   maybe to think about, right, that the feeling I have right now, it may not last.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:47.080]   And sometimes maybe you can kind of pretend or tell yourself that, "Oh, you still enjoy
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.080]   this or that."
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.920]   But I do think it sometimes takes someone like you or a friend or someone who knows
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:56.600]   you really well to sort of reflect and say, "Hey, is this something you really enjoy?"
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:01.240]   And that's why, to me, I always think about what are my most important goals.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:05.560]   My most important goals is not like someone sends me an email and I reply back to them
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.560]   within five minutes.
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:07.560]   Like, I don't care about that.
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:10.160]   Like, it's more about driving value, revenue to the business.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:14.280]   And so it's like that's how I think about really any project or anyone that I'm working
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.960]   with or anyone that I'm helping.
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.160]   Like, what's the most important goal?
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.560]   Everything else in the middle is just noise.
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.400]   Like, how do we help you achieve your kind of ultimate goal?
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:27.960]   And so I think definitely, you know, that's kind of what's fun about an entrepreneur.
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:28.960]   It's good and bad, right?
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:34.840]   Like, I don't get paid to hop on phone calls or, you know, to like let people pick my brain
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.520]   or to go to conferences, right?
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:38.760]   I don't get paid directly, I guess you would say.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:43.680]   So for me, I kind of have to figure out what's a good use of my time based off what I care
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.680]   about business-wise, personally.
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:50.280]   I mean, I spend a lot of time with my kids, you know, family.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:54.200]   I mean, even me time, I like to golf, you know, work out, get a massage once a week,
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.200]   right?
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.200]   Like, I like all these different, you know, sort of things.
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:01.520]   So it's like, how do I prioritize and balance all these things within the context of, you
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.080]   know, like, what do I actually care about?
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:07.160]   Because even, you know, with business, right, like I still want to work on things that I
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.720]   actually, I mean, I like working, right?
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:13.080]   Like when I go on a week vacation and I don't work for a week and I come back on Monday,
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:16.480]   I usually feel pretty juiced and pretty amped, ready to get back to it.
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:20.960]   But I also completely disconnect for a week and, you know, I think you might have gotten
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:21.960]   my way message before.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.520]   I tell people to, if it's urgent, to text or call me.
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:28.160]   You know, if you don't have my phone number, it's probably for a reason, so.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:29.720]   All right, Harry.
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:33.280]   Well, it's been great speaking with you for the past hour.
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:36.840]   Where can listeners check you out if you want to repeat the information?
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:37.840]   All right.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.280]   Well, if they are interested in the rideshare industry, maybe they want to book one of those
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.280]   consultant calls with me.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.280]   Let's see if we can get something out of this podcast.
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:48.000]   They can find me at therideshareguy.com or really any box on the internet.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.760]   If you type anything related to Uber or Lyft drivers, I've got a new podcast that I just
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.160]   launched called Wannabe Angels.
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:55.160]   It's pretty cool.
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:58.920]   We interview, like I mentioned, angel investors or really any kind of up and coming investors,
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:00.240]   especially in the venture world.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:05.040]   And then I also have my Rideshare Guy podcast, which covers a lot of industry topics.
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.600]   So no shortage of content.
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:07.800]   I'm active on Twitter, too.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:09.160]   So those are the best ways to find me.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:12.160]   But the business and the team is all over the internet.
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.960]   So not too hard to find.
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.760]   All right, buddy.
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:20.440]   Well, next time you come up, give me more than a 24-hour heads up and we'll try to
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.240]   figure out some good food and drinks.
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:28.840]   make any guarantees. All right, take care. Thanks for listening.
