[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.740]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.320]   [upbeat music]
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.400]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.400]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.300]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.060]   This podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.880]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.000]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.040]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.180]   about science and science-related tools
[00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.760]   to the general public.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.960]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.880]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.640]   Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.180]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.640]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.220]   to help you better understand your body
[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.160]   and reach your health goals.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.840]   I've long been a fan of getting blood work done
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.440]   for the simple reason that many of the things
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.820]   that impact our immediate and long-term health
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.840]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.800]   And now, with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.320]   we can also get insight into things like metabolic factors
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.420]   that tell us whether or not we metabolize caffeine well
[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.320]   or certain proteins well,
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.640]   what our fat metabolism genes are like.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.540]   Things of that sort can only be analyzed
[00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.240]   from quality blood and DNA tests.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.500]   In addition, many of the factors that impact our hormones,
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.760]   our metabolism, our brain health,
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.240]   those come back in a blood and DNA test,
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.220]   and there are many blood and DNA tests out there,
[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.800]   but with InsideTracker,
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.320]   they give you a lot of clear insight
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.500]   into what those markers mean and how to adjust them.
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.280]   They have this terrific platform
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.240]   that doesn't just give you the numbers back
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.520]   and tell you if you're high or low in some factor,
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.040]   but rather it tells you what your levels are
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.080]   of all those factors
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.080]   and gives you very simple and clear directives
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.360]   of changes you might make in your diet,
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.740]   changes that you might make in your exercise regimen
[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.980]   or sleep, et cetera,
[00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.640]   in order to get those markers where they ought to be
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.920]   and where you would like them to be
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.180]   in order to optimize yourself.
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.320]   So they make everything very easy, start to finish.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.300]   They can even come to your home
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.760]   to take the blood and DNA tests if you like.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.320]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.440]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman,
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.460]   and if you do that,
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.560]   you'll get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans.

[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.760]   Today's podcast is also brought to us
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.920]   by Belcampo Meat Company.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.480]   Belcampo is a regenerative farm in Northern California
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.100]   that raises organic, grass-fed,
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.040]   and finished certified humane meats.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.420]   While I don't eat a lot of meat,
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.300]   when I do, I insist that that meat be of very high quality.
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.820]   How the animals were cared for is extremely important to me,
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.900]   and the life that the animal had and what it consumed
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.300]   is very important to me.
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.280]   So the way that I eat,
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.660]   I've discussed on this podcast before, but very briefly,
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.420]   I basically fast until about noon,
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.580]   then I eat a piece of beef or chicken with lunch
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.620]   and a salad.
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.620]   So that's basically my lunch.
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.740]   That's what optimizes my levels of alertness
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.400]   for work throughout the day.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.380]   Then in the evening,
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.060]   I shift over to eating primarily carbohydrates.
[00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.480]   That's what allows me to sleep very well.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.720]   So I'm not eating huge volumes of meat,
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.540]   but I am eating meat every day.
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.820]   Conventionally raised animals are confined to feedlots
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.620]   and eat a diet of inflammatory grains,
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.540]   which is bad for them,
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.140]   and it's bad for us when we eat their meat.
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.320]   Belcampo's animals graze on open pastures
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.300]   and seasonal grasses,
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.140]   resulting in meat that is higher in nutrients
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.040]   and healthy fats.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.980]   And I've talked before about the importance
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.340]   of omega-3 fatty acids for both brain and body health.
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.880]   And Belcampo meats are high in omega-3 fatty acids.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.940]   The way Belcampo raises its animals
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.140]   isn't just better for your health.
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.660]   It also has a positive impact on the environment.
[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.060]   It's what's called climate positive and carbon negative,
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.460]   which means good for the planet and good for us.
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.020]   My favorite meats from Belcampo
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.180]   are the ribeye and the flank steaks.
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.320]   That's typically what I eat.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.100]   I think I probably eat about three or four of those
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.940]   across the week,
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.140]   and then I'll eat chicken on some other days.
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.100]   They're really delicious.
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.540]   And as I mentioned, they're very good for us.
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.860]   You can order Belcampo sustainably raised meats
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.080]   to be delivered straight to your door
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.860]   using my code Huberman at belcampo.com/huberman.
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.380]   If you do that, you'll get 20% off first time order.
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.100]   That's belcampo.com/huberman for 20% off your first order.
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.260]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.
[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.100]   Headspace is a meditation app backed by 25 published studies
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.780]   and has over 600,000 five-star reviews.
[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.780]   So I've been meditating on and off
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.340]   since I was about 15, 16 years old, mostly off at first.
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.020]   What I've found is that
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.940]   I'll sometimes start a meditation practice,
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.800]   but it's very hard to stay with.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.400]   And then a few years ago, I discovered Headspace
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.140]   and I started meditating more regularly.
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.940]   In fact, very recently,
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.040]   because I've had an exorbitant amount of work on my plate
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.540]   and I've been getting less sleep than I would like
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.740]   in order to complete that work,
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.420]   I've brought back a regular meditation practice twice a day,
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.380]   not just my usual once a day.
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.000]   Headspace makes it really easy.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.100]   They have so many meditations on there
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.940]   and they guide you into the meditation
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.580]   and out of the meditation in a way
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.580]   that just makes it very simple
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.920]   and makes maintaining the practice really straightforward.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.660]   Right now, if you want to try Headspace,
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.740]   you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.860]   And if you do that, you'll get a free one month trial,
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.180]   so that's totally free,
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.180]   with their full library of meditations for every situation.
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.840]   So there's no meditations
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.700]   that you can't get access to with this offer.
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.680]   You can get access to everything they've got.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.680]   You just go to headspace.com/specialoffer.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.300]   You get a free one month trial
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.900]   and hopefully you'll decide to stay with it.
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.780]   I've found that staying with meditation
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.100]   has been immensely beneficial for all aspects of my life.
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.200]   Today's episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.500]   is our fourth and final episode in this month,
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.740]   which is all about skills and athletic performance.
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.360]   Now, in a previous episode,
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.340]   we talked about science-based,
[00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.680]   in particular neuroscience-based tools
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.220]   for accelerating fat loss.
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.060]   Previous to that,
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.900]   we talked about ways to improve skill learning,
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.120]   motor movements, which also included things like music
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.720]   and piano playing, not just athletic performance.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.220]   And we've also been exploring other aspects
[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.140]   of physical performance throughout the entire month.
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.880]   Today, I want to talk about something
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.840]   that is vitally important for not just athletic performance,
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.620]   but for your entire life and indeed for your longevity,
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.440]   and that's muscle.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.240]   Now, many of you, when you hear the word muscle,
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.960]   think muscle growth and building big muscles.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.280]   And while we will touch on muscle hypertrophy,
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.760]   muscle growth today,
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.080]   and science-based protocols to enhance hypertrophy,
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.400]   we will mainly be talking about muscle
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.800]   as it relates to the nervous system.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.440]   And I can't emphasize this enough.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.480]   The whole reason why you have a brain
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.200]   is so that you can move.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.520]   And one of the things that's exquisite
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.240]   and fantastic about the human brain
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.980]   is that it can direct all sorts
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.840]   of different kinds of movement,
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.760]   different speeds of movement,
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.800]   movement of different durations.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.080]   We can train our musculature
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.120]   to lift heavier and heavier objects,
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.800]   or we can train our musculature
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.720]   to take us further and further, so-called endurance.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.700]   We can also build smoothness of movement, excuse me,
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.600]   smoothness of movement,
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.960]   as well as speed of movement, suppleness of movement.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.760]   All of that is governed by the relationship
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.400]   between the nervous system, neurons,
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.040]   and their connections to muscle.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.120]   So when you hear the science of muscle
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.840]   and muscle hypertrophy,
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.800]   you might think, oh, well,
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.720]   I'm not interested in building muscle,
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.600]   but muscle does many critical things.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.560]   It's important for movement.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.800]   It's important for metabolism.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.160]   The more muscle you have, and not just muscle size,
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.480]   but the quality of muscle, that's a real thing,
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.740]   the higher your metabolism is,
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.120]   and indeed the healthier you are.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.860]   It turns out that jumping ability
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.680]   and ability to stand up quickly
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.480]   and to get up off the floor quickly
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.540]   is one of the most predictive markers of aging
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.960]   and biological aging, and no surprise,
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.720]   that is governed by the brain to muscle connection.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.280]   In addition, muscle and musculature is vital for posture,
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.260]   and we don't talk about posture enough.
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.180]   We all have been told we need to sit up straight
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.880]   or stand up straight,
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.860]   but posture is vitally important
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.520]   for how the rest of our body works.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.280]   It's vital to how we breathe.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.440]   It's actually even vital to how alert or sleepy we are.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.440]   So we're going to talk about the musculature for posture.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.340]   We also are going to talk about muscle
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.640]   as it relates to aesthetic things.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.080]   Now, these are all linked.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.120]   Muscle for metabolism, movement, posture, and aesthetics,
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.520]   of course are linked, right?
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.860]   As our posture changes, our aesthetic changes.
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.520]   As our posture and aesthetic changes, how we move changes.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.600]   And as we improve muscle quality,
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.680]   whether or not that's increasing muscle size or not,
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.280]   that changes the way that our entire system,
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.960]   not just our nervous system and our muscular system,
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.640]   but our immune system and the other organs of the body work.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.940]   So today, as always,
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.360]   we're going to talk a little bit of mechanism.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.920]   I'm going to explain how neurons control muscle,
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.120]   and then we're going to look at muscle metabolism,
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.760]   how muscle uses energy.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.700]   I promised to make all of this very simple.
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.040]   I'm actually going to keep it very brief,
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.000]   probably about 10 minutes total.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.380]   And by the end of that 10 minutes,
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.000]   you will understand a lot
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.020]   about the neuromuscular connection,
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.540]   how your brain and nervous system control your muscle,
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.680]   and how those muscles work.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.680]   Then we are going to talk about how muscles use energy
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.200]   and can change how they use energy
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.000]   for sake of getting stronger, if you like,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.800]   for also increasing the size,
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.860]   so-called hypertrophy of muscle,
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.760]   and for improving endurance,
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:45.760]   as well as for improving posture and how you move generally.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.460]   We will touch on some nutritional themes
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.560]   and how that relates to muscle,
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.000]   in particular, a specific amino acid
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.380]   that if it's available in your bloodstream frequently enough
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.740]   and at sufficient levels can help you build
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.740]   and improve the quality of muscle.
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.600]   And we'll talk about specific exercise regimes,
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.580]   as well as, of course, supplementation
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.220]   and things that can enhance neuromuscular performance
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.280]   overall.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.920]   We are also going to talk about recovery.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.820]   Recovery, as everybody knows, is when things improve.
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:23.320]   That's when neurons get better at controlling muscle.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.640]   That's when muscle grows.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.040]   That's when muscle gets more flexible.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.180]   None of that actually happens during training.
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.840]   It happens after training.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.480]   And there is a lot of confusion
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.220]   about how to optimize recovery
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.240]   and how to measure whether or not you are recovered
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.880]   and ready to come back in
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.700]   for another neuromuscular training session.
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.780]   So we'll talk about that as well.
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.360]   Today is going to have a lot of protocols,
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.340]   and you're going to come away with a lot of understanding
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.920]   about how you move, how you work,
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.320]   and these incredible organs that we call the nervous system
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.520]   and the musculature, the so-called neuromuscular system.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.760]   Before we dive into today's topic,
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.120]   I want to just take about three minutes
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.740]   and cover some essential summary of the previous episode.
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.800]   In the previous episode, we talked about fat loss,
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.600]   talked about shiver-induced fat loss.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.080]   We talked about neat non-exercise activity thermogenesis
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.780]   for increasing caloric burn and fat oxidation.
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.200]   And we talked about how to use cold
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.120]   specifically to enhance fat loss.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.360]   I described a protocol involving
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.320]   getting into cold of some sort,
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.940]   whether or not it's ice bath, cold shower,
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.480]   some form of cold, it could even be a river or an ocean
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.960]   if you have access to that,
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.780]   and inducing shiver and then getting out,
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.100]   not crossing your arms or huddling,
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.340]   but allowing that cold to evaporate off you
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.360]   and continuing to shiver
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.780]   and then getting back into the colder environment
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.000]   of water or stream or shower, et cetera.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.880]   All of that is described in a beautifully illustrated
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.840]   protocol that I didn't illustrate,
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.520]   that's why it's beautifully illustrated,
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.440]   at thecoldplunge.com.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.100]   They've made that protocol for you
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.040]   and they've made it available free of charge for you.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.720]   So there's no obligation there of any kind financially.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.980]   You can go to thecoldplunge.com.
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.760]   There's a little tab that says protocols
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.280]   and you can download that protocol.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.960]   There's someone there, I don't know who exactly
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.520]   illustrated it, and you can come away with a PDF
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.280]   of what I described in the previous episode.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.220]   So I just wanted to make sure
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.520]   that you're aware of that resource.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.080]   The other announcement I'd like to make
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.820]   is that many of you have asked
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.520]   how you can help support the podcast,
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.460]   and there's a very straightforward,
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.000]   zero cost way to do that,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.560]   and that's to subscribe to our YouTube channel.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.200]   So if you go to YouTube,
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.400]   if you're not already there watching this now,
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.040]   hit the subscribe button.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.000]   That helps us tremendously to get the word out more broadly
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.500]   about the podcast, and we thank you for your support.
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.660]   Most people, when they hear the word muscle,
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.440]   they just think about strength.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.080]   But of course, muscles are involved in everything that we do.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.260]   They are involved in speaking.
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.280]   They're involved in sitting and standing up.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.140]   They're involved in lifting objects, including ourselves.
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:05.140]   They are absolutely essential for maintaining how we breathe.
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.960]   They're absolutely essential for ambulation, for moving,
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.900]   and for skills of any kind.
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.180]   So when we think about muscle,
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.400]   we don't just want to think about muscle,
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.240]   the meat that is muscle, but what controls that muscle.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.000]   And no surprise, what controls muscle is the nervous system.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.520]   The nervous system does that
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.840]   through three main nodes of control, areas of control,
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.120]   and I've talked about these before on a previous podcast,
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.900]   so I will keep this very brief.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:38.240]   Basically, we have upper motor neurons in our motor cortex,
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.240]   so those are in our skull,
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.260]   and those are involved in deliberate movement.
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.440]   So if I decide that I'm going to pick my pen up
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.500]   and put it down, which is what I'm doing right now,
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.200]   my upper motor neurons were involved
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.920]   in generating that movement.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.940]   Those upper motor neurons send signals
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.300]   down to my spinal cord,
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.040]   where there are two categories of neurons.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.860]   One are the lower motor neurons,
[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:01.880]   and those lower motor neurons send little wires
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.620]   that we call axons out to our muscles
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.360]   and cause those muscles to contract.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.620]   They do that by dumping chemicals onto the muscle.
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:12.100]   In fact, the chemical is acetylcholine.
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.220]   I've talked before about acetylcholine in the brain,
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.620]   which is vitally important for focus
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.940]   and actually can gate neuroplasticity,
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:23.160]   the brain's ability to change in response to experience.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.480]   But in the neuromuscular system,
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.960]   acetylcholine released from motor neurons
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.960]   is the only way that muscles can contract.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.280]   Now, there's another category of neurons in the spinal cord
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.960]   called central pattern generators or CPGs,
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.940]   and those are involved in rhythmic movements.
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.980]   Anytime we're walking or doing something
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.240]   where we don't have to think about it to do it deliberately,
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.840]   it's just happening reflexively,
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.300]   that central pattern generators and motor neurons.
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.460]   Anytime we're doing something deliberately,
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.020]   that the top-down control, as we call it,
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.940]   from the upper motor neurons comes in
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.040]   and takes control of that system.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:00.880]   So it's really simple.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.120]   You've only got three ingredients.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.220]   You've got the upper motor neurons, the lower motor neurons,
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.340]   and for rhythmic movements that are reflexive,
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.800]   you've also got the central pattern generators.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.880]   So it's a terrifically simple system at that level.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.300]   But what we're going to focus on today
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.960]   is how that system can control muscle
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.960]   in ways that make that system better.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.240]   Now, when I say better, I want to be very specific.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.800]   If your goal is to build larger muscles,
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.220]   there's a way to use your nervous system
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.600]   to trigger hypertrophy,
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.100]   to increase the size of those muscles.
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.320]   And it is indeed controlled by the nervous system.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.120]   So you can forget the idea that the muscles have memory
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.820]   or that muscles grow in response to something
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.760]   that's just happening within the muscle.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.500]   It's the nerve to muscle connection
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.080]   that actually creates hypertrophy.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.240]   I'll talk exactly about how to optimize that process.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.580]   In addition, if you want to improve endurance
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:59.440]   or improve flexibility or suppleness or explosiveness,
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.300]   that is all accomplished by the way
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:05.700]   that the nervous system engages muscles specifically.
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.400]   And so what that means is we have to ask ourselves,
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.940]   are we going to take control of the upper motor neurons,
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.520]   the central pattern generators,
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.480]   or the lower motor neurons or all three
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.680]   in order to get to some end point
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.160]   of how the nervous system controls muscle.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.320]   So neurophysiology 101.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.840]   I'll give you one piece of history
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.040]   because it's important to know.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.000]   Sherrington, who won the Nobel Prize,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.300]   called movement the final common path.
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.860]   Why did he say that?
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.040]   Well, the whole reason for having a nervous system,
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.460]   the whole reason for having a brain
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.000]   is so that we can control our movements
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.700]   in very dedicated ways.
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:47.580]   That is one of the reasons, perhaps the predominant reason
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.280]   why the human brain is so large.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.020]   You might think, oh, it's so large for thinking
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.300]   and for creativity.
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.980]   Ah, no, when you look at the amount of real estate
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:59.380]   in the brain that's devoted to different aspects of life,
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.160]   it's mainly vision, our ability to see,
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.800]   and movement, our ability to engage
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.740]   in lots of different kinds of movements,
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.700]   slow movements, fast movements, explosive, et cetera.
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:14.800]   Other animals don't have that ability
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.740]   because they don't have the mental real estate.
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.840]   They don't have the neural real estate in their brain.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.420]   They have neuromuscular junctions.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.700]   They have central pattern generators.
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.700]   What they don't have are these incredible upper motor neurons
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:30.100]   that can direct activity to muscles in very specific ways.
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.700]   So we can all feel blessed that we have this system.
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.620]   And today I'm going to teach you how to use that system
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.700]   toward particular end points.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.020]   So if we decide that we are going to direct our muscles
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.660]   in some particular movement of any kind,
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.780]   whether or not it's a weightlifting exercise
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.380]   or whether or not it's a yoga movement,
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.520]   or simply picking up and putting down a pin,
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.100]   we are engaging flexors and extensors.
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.580]   And our body is covered with flexors and extensors all over.
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.720]   So for instance, our bicep is a flexor
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.100]   and our tricep is an extensor.
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.900]   Those are what are called antagonistic muscles.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.420]   They move the limbs in opposite directions.
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.500]   So if you bring your wrist closer to your shoulder,
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.640]   that's flexion using your bicep.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.140]   If you move your wrist further away from your shoulder,
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.580]   that's extension using your tricep.
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.820]   And without getting into a lot of detail,
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.180]   the way that the nerves and brain are wired up to muscle
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.920]   make it such that when a flexor is activated,
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.020]   when the nerve dumps chemical acetylcholine
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.620]   onto the muscle to activate the biceps,
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.200]   the triceps is inhibited.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.720]   It's prevented from engaging.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.980]   There are ways to bypass this,
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.880]   but that's the typical mode of action.
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.860]   The converse is also true.
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.100]   When our tricep is inactivated, okay?
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.400]   When we move our wrist away from our shoulder,
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.240]   our bicep is inhibited.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.080]   And we have flexors like our abdominal muscles
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.060]   and we have extensors in our lower back.
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.460]   Many of you probably know this,
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.420]   but some of you probably don't that your spine has flexors
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.080]   to move basically your chin toward your waist.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.840]   And it has, those are your abdominal muscles among others.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.660]   And you have extensors that move your chin basically back
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:09.940]   like looking up toward the ceiling
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.460]   and those are your extensors.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.820]   You have other muscles that are stabilizing muscles
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:14.660]   and things of that sort,
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.020]   but those movements of flexion and extension
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.520]   and the fact that they are what we call
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.100]   reciprocally innervated or mutual inhibition,
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.740]   you hear different language around this,
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:28.740]   is characteristic of most of our limb movements, okay?
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.580]   So hamstring and quadricep.
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.580]   The hamstring brings the ankle
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.980]   closer back towards the glutes.
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.660]   Basically it's lifting your heel up, right?
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.780]   Which is almost always done toward the back.
[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.540]   Whereas your quadriceps is the extensor
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:44.780]   opposite to the hamstrings.
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:45.700]   So you get the idea.
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.120]   So there's flexors and extensors
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.220]   and it's the neurons that control those flexors and extensors
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.620]   that allow us to move in particular ways.
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.220]   So now you have heard neuromuscular physiology
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.940]   in its simplest form, but I do want this to be accessible.
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:03.140]   I want to get just briefly, just briefly
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.140]   into some of the underlying metabolism
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:08.620]   of how muscles use and create energy
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:10.900]   because in doing that we will be in a great position
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.100]   to understand all the tools that follow
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.340]   about how to optimize the neuromuscular system
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.820]   for your particular goals.
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.860]   So in the previous episode about fat loss
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.340]   we talked about lipolysis,
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.880]   the breakdown of fat into fatty acids
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.860]   so it can be used as fuel.
[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.840]   And it ended in a step where we got ATP
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.940]   which is the bottleneck and final common path
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:34.960]   for all energy producing functions in the body.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.960]   There are other ways
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.520]   but basically ATP is the key element there.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.780]   Now with muscles, they don't function on fats normally.
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.380]   What they are going to function on,
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:48.460]   their ability to move and their ability to do things
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.420]   and allow us to move in any way that we want to
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.880]   is based on a process of glycolysis,
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.140]   the breakdown of things like glycogen
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.440]   and glucose into energy.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.580]   And it's a very simple process.
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.000]   You don't have to know any chemistry.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   So if I say the words carbon or hydrogen
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.440]   or something like that, don't freak out.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.060]   You don't have to understand any chemistry.
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.180]   But basically what happens is you've got this
[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:17.100]   available sugar resource that's stored in muscle.
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.940]   And that's glucose.
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:23.940]   And that glucose has six carbons and six waters basically.
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:30.620]   That can be broken down into two sets of three carbons.
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:34.400]   So basically you take glucose and you break it
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.100]   into these two little batches of carbons
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.380]   that we call pyruvates.
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:39.900]   So six divided by two is three.
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.660]   So you get three and three pyruvates.
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.540]   And that generates a little bit of ATP of energy,
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.420]   but just a little bit.
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.580]   Now, if there's oxygen available, okay,
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:52.360]   if there's sufficient oxygen there,
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.020]   what can happen is that pyruvate can be brought
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.180]   to the mitochondria and through a whole set of things
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.340]   that you probably don't want to hear about right now,
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:05.140]   like the electron transport chain and citric acid cycle,
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:10.140]   what happens is it's broken down and you get 28 to 30 ATP,
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.060]   which is a lot of ATP.
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.780]   So the only things you need to know,
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.540]   the only things you need to know about this process
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:19.420]   is that glucose and glycogen are broken down into pyruvate.
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.380]   You get a little bit of energy from that.
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.720]   And when I say energy, I mean the ability to move.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.460]   It's fuel, it literally just gets burned up.
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.900]   But if there's oxygen available, and that's key,
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.220]   then within the mitochondria,
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:35.980]   you can create 28 to 30 ATP, which is a lot of ATP.
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.020]   Now, what does this mean?
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:41.760]   This means that movement of muscle is metabolically expensive
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.780]   and indeed compared to other tissues,
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.120]   compared to fat, compared to bone,
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.540]   compared to almost all other tissues except brain tissue,
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.440]   muscle is the most metabolically demanding,
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.920]   which is why people who have more muscle
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.900]   relative to adipose tissue to fat,
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.000]   they can eat more and they're more of a furnace.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.840]   They just kind of burn that up, okay?
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.800]   So even if you didn't understand anything that I just said,
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.800]   what you probably did hear and that I hope you heard
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.000]   is that if you have oxygen around,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.200]   you can create energy from this fuel source
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.220]   that we call glycogen and glucose.
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.940]   But what if there isn't oxygen around?
[00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.240]   And what is that like?
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.520]   Well, you've experienced that.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.400]   I'm not talking about oxygen in the environment,
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.180]   I'm talking about oxygen in the muscle.
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:29.080]   So if you've ever carried a box while moving,
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.240]   or you were carrying heavy groceries to the car,
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.360]   or you were exercising particularly hard
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.200]   and you felt the burn,
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:40.600]   well, that burning, which most people think is lactic acid
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.920]   is actually a process by which pyruvate,
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.680]   which as I said before, normally could be converted into ATP
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:48.640]   if there's oxygen.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.320]   Well, if there's not enough oxygen,
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.220]   'cause that muscle is working too hard or too long,
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:56.240]   what ends up happening is that a hydrogen molecule
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.120]   comes in there and you get something called lactate.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.560]   So believe it or not, humans don't make lactic acid.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.640]   That's in other species.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.520]   We make lactate and we think,
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.640]   and we hear that lactate is bad.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.960]   We need to buffer the burn or avoid the burn,
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.180]   that lactic acid and lactate are what prevent us
[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.600]   for performing as well as we ought to be able to,
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.340]   or for going as far as we possibly could
[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.000]   in an endurance event.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:22.840]   Guess what?
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.200]   That's not true at all.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.960]   Lactate has three functions,
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.520]   all of which are really interesting and really important.
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:32.760]   First of all, it's a buffer against acidity.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.600]   You don't want muscle to get too acidic
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.640]   because it can't function.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.880]   You don't want any body tissue to get too acidic.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.720]   So that burn that you feel is acidity in that environment
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.320]   that, and lactate, what most people call lactic acid,
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.800]   but again, we don't make lactic acid,
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.040]   lactate is there to buffer that
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.920]   to reduce the amount of burn.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.700]   So most people have this exactly backwards.
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.580]   So when you feel that burn, that is not lactic acid.
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:02.080]   That is lactate that's present to suppress the burn,
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.640]   to suppress acidity.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.480]   It's also a fuel.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.120]   When you feel that burn,
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.500]   lactate is shuttled to those areas of the muscle,
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.340]   and there's an actual fuel burning process
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.120]   where in the absence of oxygen,
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.980]   you can continue to generate muscular contractions.
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:19.980]   Now, this is informative
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:21.900]   'cause it also tells us that that burning,
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.200]   that acidity that we feel
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.400]   can inhibit the way that our muscles work,
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.680]   but that lactate comes in
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.760]   and allows our muscles to continue to function.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.100]   So we'll talk a little bit more
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.520]   about what this whole lactate thing and the burn means,
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.000]   but it's a really important process,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.880]   and it's amazing to me that most people understand it
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.840]   in exactly the incorrect way.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.440]   They think, oh, lactic acid is bad and the burn is bad.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.960]   No, it reveals a number of really important things
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.720]   are going on with this vital molecule lactate,
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.660]   which can reduce acidity, reduce the burn,
[00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.960]   as well as act as a fuel.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.200]   Now, here's where it gets really, really cool,
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.800]   and if you don't have enough of an incentive to exercise
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.340]   based on all the information out there
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.100]   about how it'll make you live longer
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.200]   and make your heart better, et cetera,
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.760]   here's a reason that regardless
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.180]   of what kind of exercise you do,
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:15.800]   if it's weight training or running or cycling or swimming,
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.920]   that every once in a while, about 10% of the time,
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.840]   you should exercise to the point of intensity
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.920]   where you start to feel that so-called burn
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:26.840]   right?
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:31.340]   The reason for that is that lactate shows up
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:34.540]   to the site of the burn, so to speak,
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.840]   and it acts as a hormonal signal for other organs
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.200]   of the body in a very positive way, okay?
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.880]   As you may recall from a very early episode
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.040]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.660]   I talked about what a hormone is and how it works.
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.800]   We have lots of different kinds of hormones,
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.900]   but hormones are chemicals that are released
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.400]   in one location in the body and travel have effects
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.540]   on lots of other organs of the body.
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:02.240]   So when I say that lactate acts as a hormonal signal,
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:06.480]   what I mean is that it's in a position to influence tissues
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.620]   that are outside of the muscle.
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:14.240]   And basically it can send signals to the heart,
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.840]   to the liver and to the brain,
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.360]   and it can have effects on the heart,
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.640]   the liver and the brain that are very positive, okay?
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.160]   So just to zoom out for a second,
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.420]   I promise we won't get any more technical than this.
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.200]   We will get into tools and protocols
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.820]   that are really straightforward.
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:33.460]   But what I'm telling you is that if you feel a burn
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.760]   from a particular exercise or movement,
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.240]   that burn is going to be buffered
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.780]   by this molecule we call lactate.
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:44.860]   Lactate will then provide additional fuel
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:45.960]   for additional work.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.720]   So this is a good incentive provided you can do it safely
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.020]   to quote unquote work through the burn.
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:56.020]   That burn acts as a beacon to the lactate,
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.480]   which comes in and allows you to do more work.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.800]   It's not a signal to stop necessarily.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.540]   I mean, stop if you're doing something unsafe,
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.480]   but it's a signal that lactate should come in
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.780]   and allow you to continue to do work.
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.860]   And it can act as a hormonal signal.
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:14.140]   Lactate can then travel to the heart
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.020]   and to the liver and to the brain
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.420]   and can enhance their function in positive ways,
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:21.540]   not just in those moments, but in the period of time
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.740]   that follows.
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.920]   So many people are curious about how they can exercise
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.260]   to make their brain better.
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.780]   That's one of the most common questions I get.
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.620]   What I'm telling you is that provided you can do it safely
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:36.460]   by engaging the so-called burn,
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:39.020]   which is a different threshold for everybody, right?
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.620]   Your hill run will be different than my hill run
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.000]   to generate the burn.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.180]   But provided you can do that for about 10% of your workouts
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:52.140]   or of an individual workout or activity of any kind,
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.160]   you are generating the activity
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.700]   of this lactate-based hormonal signal
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:00.340]   that can improve the function of neurons.
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.740]   And it does that, if you want to know for the aficionados,
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.620]   by improving the function of another cell type
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:07.500]   called the astrocytes, which are a glial cell type, okay?
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.440]   Which are very involved in clearance of debris
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.360]   from the brain.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.580]   They're involved in the formation of synapses,
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.420]   connections between neurons in the brain.
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:18.340]   So put simply, if you're an exerciser,
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.940]   if you're doing movement of any kind,
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:23.040]   and you're interested in allocating some of that movement
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:27.020]   toward enhancing brain, heart, and liver health,
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:30.700]   there is a nice set of scientific data
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.980]   that points to the fact that getting lactate
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:37.060]   shuttled to the muscles by engaging this burning sensation
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:40.940]   is advantageous for the health of those other tissues.
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:44.960]   So as I mentioned, that burn is present from lack of oxygen
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.300]   being present and then the hydrogen comes in
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.160]   and you get this lactate.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:53.420]   But this process of lactate acting as a buffer of fuel
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.980]   and a positive hormonal signal for other tissues
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:59.060]   occurs only if there's oxygen.
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:03.700]   So if you feel the burn, you definitely want to focus
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.280]   on your breathing at that point.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.920]   That would be the time to take deep inhales
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.620]   and try and bring more oxygen into your system.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:12.500]   It's definitely not a time to hold your breath.
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.060]   And if ever you've run to the point of feeling the burn
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.840]   and then you were exercising in any way on the treadmill
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.940]   or on the bike or whatever, and felt that burn,
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.780]   and then you held your breath, it feels much more intense.
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:26.860]   By breathing, you bring lactate to the site
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:31.780]   and you are able to allow lactate to act more as a buffer,
[00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:33.900]   a fuel, and a hormonal signal.
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.540]   And the reason I brought this up today is because,
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.220]   as I mentioned, so many people are interested
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.840]   in using exercise, not just for sake of improving
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.900]   physical health and wellbeing and performance,
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.300]   but also for enhancing their brain.
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:49.260]   And there are a lot of data out there speaking
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:53.660]   to the findings that exercise of various kinds
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:57.600]   can increase neurogenesis, the creation of new neurons.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:01.900]   Well, the unfortunate news is that while that's true in mice,
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:05.620]   there is very little evidence for enhanced neurogenesis
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:08.020]   from exercise or otherwise in humans.
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.740]   There's a little bit, and there are a few sites
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.540]   within the brain, such as the dentate gyrus
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.820]   of the hippocampus, which may be involved
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.660]   in the formation of new memories.
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.860]   To be clear, the dentate gyrus is definitely involved
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:19.180]   in the formation of new memories.
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.340]   Whether or not the new neurons that are added there
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.660]   in humans are involved in new memories is,
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:27.940]   the evidence for that is weak at best, frankly,
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:30.660]   whereas in animals, the data are quite strong.
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.940]   But most of the data point to the fact
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:36.500]   that hormonal signals, things that are transported
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:40.740]   in the blood during exercise are what are beneficial
[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.100]   for the brain, excuse me.
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:46.200]   And that those signals are not causing the increase
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.500]   in the number of neurons in the dentate gyrus or otherwise.
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.440]   That it's more about the health of the connections
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.980]   between the neurons, growth factors of various kinds,
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.840]   things like IGF-1, there's a long list of these things.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.140]   So if you've heard that exercise increases the number
[00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:01.660]   of neurons in your brain, well, that's not true.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.560]   And that probably is a good thing, frankly,
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.580]   because we always hear more neurons,
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.320]   more neurons as if it's a good thing.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.800]   But the brain doesn't do so well
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.240]   with bringing in entirely new elements.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.620]   It has a hard time negotiating that
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.080]   and making use of those new elements.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.300]   We know about this from things like the cochlear implant
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.920]   where deaf people are given a device
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.340]   where they suddenly can hear.
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:24.580]   Some people really like that.
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.700]   Deaf people really like that and can benefit from it.
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.620]   Other deaf people find that it's very intrusive,
[00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:33.900]   that it's hard to take an existing neural circuit
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.840]   in the brain and incorporate a lot
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.100]   of new information into it.
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.000]   So new neurons, as great as that sounds,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.460]   more neurons, more neurons,
[00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.420]   it actually might not be the best way for the nervous system
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:44.900]   to change and modify itself
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.500]   and to promote its own longevity.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:50.260]   So when I tell you not such great evidence
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:52.460]   for new neurons past puberty,
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:55.400]   that's what the data really show in humans.
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.320]   And I sort of knock back the data
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.320]   on exercise and neurogenesis.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.580]   Don't let that depress you.
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:01.920]   If you have dementia in your family,
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:06.680]   don't translate that into necessarily
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.340]   that you will develop dementia.
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.780]   Understand that exercise is still beneficial
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.460]   for the brain and other aspects of the nervous system,
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:14.680]   but that it's going to be doing it
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.840]   through these hormonal signals, things like IGF-1,
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.560]   things like this lactate pathway
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.560]   when you experience the burn from exercise.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.920]   And again, you don't want to try and get this feeling
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:28.600]   of a burn throughout the entire episode of exercise.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.680]   That would be far too intense
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.360]   and would inhibit your recovery.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.200]   I don't think it'd be good for performance either.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.340]   It's only about 10% of your total effort
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:38.120]   in any one exercise bout
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.060]   that's going to give you this positive effect.
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.280]   So now you know how to devote
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.080]   a small portion of your exercise, 10%,
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:48.600]   in order for muscle and lactate to benefit other tissues,
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.660]   namely your heart, your liver, and your brain.
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:53.160]   I'd now like to shift our attention
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:57.320]   to how to use specific aspects of muscular contraction
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.400]   to improve muscle hypertrophy, muscle growth,
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.240]   as well as improving muscle strength.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.480]   There are a lot of reasons to want to get stronger.
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:09.300]   And I should just mention that it's not always the case
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.240]   that getting stronger involves muscles getting bigger.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.280]   There are ways for muscles to get stronger
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.440]   without getting bigger.
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:19.200]   However, increasing the size of a muscle
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.360]   almost inevitably increases the strength of that muscle,
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.140]   at least to some degree.
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:26.160]   Reasons why most everyone
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:28.240]   should want to get their muscles stronger
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:32.020]   is that muscles are generally getting progressively weaker
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:33.620]   across the lifespan.
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:34.860]   So when I say getting stronger,
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.860]   it's not necessarily about being able to move
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.560]   increasing amounts of weight in the gym,
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.920]   although if that's your goal,
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.920]   what I'm about to discuss will be relevant to that,
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:49.080]   but rather to offset some of the normal decline
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:52.720]   in strength and posture and the ability to generate
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:56.540]   a large range of movement safely that occurs as we age.
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:57.880]   As I mentioned at the beginning of the episode,
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.400]   we just tend to lose function in this neuromuscular system
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.860]   as we get older and doing things to offset that
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:07.520]   has been shown again and again to be beneficial
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:11.420]   for the neuromuscular system, for protection of injury,
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.800]   for enhancing the strength of bones and bone density.
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.960]   So there are a lot of reasons to use resistance exercise
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.520]   that extend far beyond
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.320]   just the desire to increase muscle size,
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.400]   because I know many of you
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.720]   are interested in increasing muscle size,
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.820]   but many of you are not.
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.420]   So there's an important principle of muscle physiology
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.760]   called the Henneman size principle.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.380]   And the Henneman size principle essentially says
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:40.060]   that we recruit what are called motor units.
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:41.800]   Motor units are just the connections
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:46.800]   between nerve and muscle in a pattern that staircases
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.220]   from low threshold to high threshold.
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:54.840]   What this means is when you pick up something that is light,
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.780]   you're going to use the minimum amount of nerve to muscle
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.060]   energy in order to move that thing.
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:03.740]   Likewise, when you pick up an object that's heavy,
[00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:05.520]   you're going to use the minimum amount
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.240]   of nerve to muscle connectivity and energy
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.780]   in order to move that object.
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:14.800]   So it's basically a conservation of energy principle.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:19.400]   Now, if you continue to exert effort of movement,
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.720]   what will happen is you will tend to recruit
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.840]   more and more motor units with time.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.620]   And that process of recruiting more neurons,
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:29.720]   more lower motor neurons,
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.440]   as if you recall from the beginning of the episode,
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.200]   these lower motor neurons are in our spinal cord
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.720]   and they actually dump a chemical acetylcholine on muscle,
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.480]   cause the muscles to contract.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.840]   As you recruit more and more of these motor units,
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.940]   these connections between these lower motor neurons
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:47.580]   and muscle, that's when you start to get changes
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:48.720]   in the muscle.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.000]   That's when you open the gate for the potential
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.820]   for the muscles to get stronger and to get larger,
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.400]   if that's what your goal is.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.960]   And so the way this process works
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.700]   has been badly misunderstood
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.160]   in the kind of online literature of weight training
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.060]   and bodybuilding and even in sports physiology.
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.040]   The Henneman size principle is kind of
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:14.440]   a foundational principle within muscle physiology,
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:18.160]   but many people have come to interpret it by saying
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.680]   that the way to recruit high threshold motor units,
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.240]   the ones that are hard to get to
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.760]   is to just use heavy weights.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.960]   And that's actually not the case.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.240]   As we'll talk about, the research supports
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.580]   that weights in a very large range
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:37.800]   of sort of a percentage of your maximum,
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.180]   anywhere from 30 to 80%.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:42.480]   So weights that are not very light,
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.320]   but are moderately light, too heavy,
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.680]   can cause changes in the connections between nerve and muscle
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:52.480]   that lead to muscle strength and muscle hypertrophy.
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:57.260]   Put differently, heavy weights can help build muscle
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.840]   and strength, but they are not required.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.680]   What one has to do is adhere
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.400]   to a certain number of parameters,
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.600]   just a couple of key variables that I'll spell out for you.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.860]   And if you do that,
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:12.160]   you can greatly increase muscle hypertrophy, muscle size,
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.760]   and/or muscle strength if that's what you want to do.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.640]   And you don't necessarily have to use heavy weights
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:19.720]   in order to do that.
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.200]   Now, I'm sure the power lifters
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.300]   and the people that like to move heavy weights around
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.460]   will say, "No, if you want to get strong,
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.580]   you absolutely have to lift heavy weights."
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:31.600]   And that might be true if you want to get very strong,
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.800]   but for most people who are interested
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.400]   in supporting their muscular such
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.920]   that they offset any age-related decline in strength
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:44.160]   or in increasing hypertrophy and strength to some degree,
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.800]   there really isn't a need to lie
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.360]   about the Henneman size principle,
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.040]   which many people out there are doing,
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.220]   and claiming that you absolutely need
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:53.700]   to use the heaviest weights possible
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.400]   in order to build strength and muscle.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.440]   So I'm going to explain how all of this works
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.920]   in simple terms.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.360]   So first of all, let's just talk about what hypertrophy is
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:05.680]   and what strength changes in the muscle are.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.760]   We can make this very simple as well.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.520]   If this were a muscle physiology class,
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:13.240]   we would talk all about myofibrils and sarcomeres
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.080]   and all that stuff.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:14.900]   We're not going to do that.
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:17.080]   That's not the purpose of today's conversation.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.620]   But if you're interested in that,
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:20.580]   as well as a lot of the other information
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:23.480]   that I'm going to discuss in more detail,
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:27.300]   I highly encourage you to check out the YouTube channel
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:30.240]   and the writings of Dr. Andy Galpin.
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:33.520]   He's a PhD and a full professor in exercise physiology.
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.760]   He's extremely knowledgeable in this entire area
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.560]   of science-based tools for hypertrophy,
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.680]   how strength and hypertrophy really work.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.100]   His lab does everything from biopsy on muscles,
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:46.840]   working with athletes and typical folks as well.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.780]   A lot of the information that you're going to hear from me
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.380]   in the next 15 minutes or so
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:53.920]   comes from an extensive exploration of the work
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.620]   that he and his colleagues have done,
[00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:57.840]   as well as folks like Brad Schoenfield,
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:00.400]   another academic who's superb in this whole space
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.560]   of muscle physiology,
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:05.280]   and from a lengthy conversation that I had with Andy,
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.160]   Dr. Galpin, prior to this episode.
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:11.620]   So if we want to think about muscle hypertrophy,
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.400]   we have to ask what is changing
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.220]   when muscles get larger or stronger?
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:17.800]   And there are really just three ways
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.480]   that muscles can be stimulated to change.
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:21.820]   So let's review those three ways
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.320]   and talk about what happens inside the muscle.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.320]   So there are three major stimuli
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:29.400]   for changing the way that muscle works
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:33.560]   and making muscles stronger, larger, or better in some way.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:37.900]   And those are stress, tension, and damage.
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:42.360]   Those three things don't necessarily all have to be present,
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.640]   but stress of some kind has to exist.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.500]   Something has to be different
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.000]   in the way that the nerve communicates with the muscle
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.860]   and the way that the muscle contracts or performs
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:54.980]   that makes the muscle need to change.
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:58.040]   So this is very reminiscent of neuroplasticity in the brain.
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.120]   Something needs to happen.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.760]   Certain chemicals need to be present.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.760]   Certain processes need to happen,
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.560]   or else a tissue simply won't change itself.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:09.660]   But if those processes and events do happen,
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:12.300]   then the tissue has essentially no option
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:14.680]   except but to change.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.920]   So muscles move, as I mentioned,
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.660]   because nerves dump chemical onto the muscles,
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.700]   but they move because they have these things
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:25.540]   called myosin and actin filaments.
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:27.020]   And if you want to read up on this,
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.320]   you can look on the internet.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.180]   You can put the sliding filament theory
[00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:32.220]   of muscle contraction
[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:34.340]   if you really want to go deep down that rabbit hole.
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:35.300]   It's interesting.
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:38.060]   You can learn about this in a muscle physiology class.
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:41.580]   But basically, along the length of the muscle,
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.180]   you have what's called myosin.
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:46.660]   And just think of myosin as kind of like a wire.
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:49.560]   It's like a bunch of beads and wires
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.180]   that extend across the muscle.
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:53.420]   I think that's the simplest way to describe it.
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:55.060]   And the myosin is surrounded
[00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.260]   by these little beads called actin.
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:00.380]   The way muscles get bigger
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:04.740]   is that basically the myosin gets thicker.
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:06.140]   It's a protein, right?
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:07.460]   And it gets thicker.
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.340]   So put this in your mind.
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:10.300]   If you're listening to this,
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.300]   or even if you're watching it on YouTube,
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.480]   the way to think about this whole actin, myosin thing,
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.480]   and muscles getting bigger
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:18.900]   is imagine that you're holding a bouquet of balloons,
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:21.100]   a bunch of balloons by their strings,
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:23.700]   except you're not holding the strings all at their bottom.
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:25.360]   So the bouquet isn't nicely arranged.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.020]   It's not like some balloons that are all up at the top
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.500]   and you're holding the strings down at the bottom.
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.480]   Imagine that one of the balloons
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.620]   is very close to your hand.
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.340]   Another one is a little bit higher up.
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.300]   And so this bouquet is very disorganized.
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.700]   In other words, the string extending out of your hand,
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:41.580]   the strings, rather, extending out of your hand
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.020]   are all different lengths.
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:45.900]   And so the balloons are all over the place.
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:49.260]   That's essentially what myosin looks like in the muscle.
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:51.900]   And those strings are what we call the filaments.
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:56.020]   And then the myosin head is the balloon.
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:58.580]   When you stress a muscle properly,
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:00.900]   or you give it sufficient tension,
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:04.300]   or you damage the muscle just enough,
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:06.620]   there's an adaptive response that takes place
[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:08.420]   where protein is synthesized,
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:11.360]   and it's a very specific protein, it's myosin.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.900]   The myosin gets thicker.
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:16.400]   In other words, the balloons get bigger.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.820]   So the way to think about muscle growth
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:21.960]   and the way to think about muscles getting stronger
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:24.580]   is that those balloons get bigger
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:26.900]   and the muscle gets thicker.
[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:30.180]   Now, the question then should be, as always,
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:31.340]   how does that happen?
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:33.660]   I mean, the muscle doesn't really know anything
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:36.340]   about what's happening in the outside world.
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:38.540]   The way it happens is the nerve,
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:42.180]   the neuron has to tell the muscle to get stronger.
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:45.280]   And it does that through what we call a signaling cascade.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.020]   It talks to the muscle in terms of chemicals.
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:49.600]   It doesn't whisper to it or shout out, "Hey, get bigger."
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.860]   What it does, it releases certain chemicals
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:53.620]   that within the muscle,
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:55.120]   there are certain chemicals released rather
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.900]   that make those balloons, as I'm referring to them,
[00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.520]   the myosin gets thicker.
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.240]   So let's talk about the stimulus for doing that.
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.720]   And if already in your mind, you're imagining,
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.500]   oh my goodness, these balloons of muscle
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:07.920]   are going to get thick, thick, thick, thick, thick,
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:10.720]   and it's just going to spiral out of control.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:11.680]   Don't worry about that.
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.600]   People invest a ton of time and energy
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.660]   into trying to make their muscles larger.
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:17.800]   It's actually much harder for people to do
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.040]   than you might think.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.860]   But I do want to give one exception
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:22.940]   because it illustrates an important principle
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:24.900]   of where we're headed next.
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:29.900]   Everybody has imbalances in how muscles can grow,
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:35.200]   how well muscles can grow or how poorly
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.820]   or how challenging it is for their muscles to grow.
[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:41.720]   Now, many people who are afraid of like getting too bulky,
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.720]   for instance, are afraid of lifting weights.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.680]   But I think the research shows now
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:48.040]   that everyone of pretty much every age
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.140]   should be doing some sort of resistance exercise,
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:52.480]   even if that's body weight exercises
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.560]   in order to offset this age-related decline
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.960]   in muscle contractile ability, muscle strength, et cetera,
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.560]   improve bone density.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:05.060]   There's nothing good about getting frail and weak over time.
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:07.680]   And people who invest the effort
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.920]   into doing resistance exercises of some kind,
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.560]   whether or not it's with bands or with weights
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.780]   or with body weight really benefit tremendously
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:18.220]   at a whole body level, at a systemic level,
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:20.340]   as well as in terms of muscle strength.
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:25.460]   There is a good predictor of how well
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:28.600]   or how efficient you will be in building the strength
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:32.200]   and or if you like the size of a given muscle.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.800]   And it has everything to do with those upper motor neurons
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.240]   that are involved in deliberate control of muscle.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.440]   You can actually do this test right now.
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.640]   You can just kind of march across your body mentally
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:46.400]   and see whether or not you can independently contract
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.320]   any or all of your muscles.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.780]   So for instance, if you are sitting in a chair
[00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:52.600]   or you're standing,
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.600]   see whether or not you can contract your calf muscle
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:57.560]   just using those upper motor neurons,
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:58.520]   sending a signal down
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.740]   and deliberately isolating the calf muscle, okay?
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:05.060]   If you can contract the calf muscle hard
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:06.980]   to the point where that muscle
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:08.340]   almost feels like it's starting to cramp,
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.840]   like it hurts just a little bit,
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:12.240]   it's not going to be extremely painful
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:15.640]   nor is it going to have no sensation whatsoever,
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:18.640]   chances are you have very good upper motor neuron
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.320]   to calf control.
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:23.700]   And chances are, if you can isolate that,
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:26.560]   what they call the brain or mind muscle connection
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:27.720]   and you can contract the muscle
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:29.800]   to the point where it cramps a little bit,
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:33.040]   that you hold a decent to high potential
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.320]   to change the strength and the size of that muscle
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.940]   if you train it properly.
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:39.980]   Now, if you have a hard time doing that,
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:43.300]   chances are you won't be able to do that.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:47.680]   If, for instance, you focus on your back muscle,
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.140]   like we all have these muscles called the lat,
[00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:51.440]   the latissimus dorsi muscles,
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.460]   which basically are involved in chin ups
[00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:54.300]   and things like that,
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:58.200]   the function from more of a kinesiology standpoint
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.500]   is to move the elbow back behind the body, okay?
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:02.860]   So it's not about flexing your bicep,
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:05.300]   it's about moving your elbow back behind your body.
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:08.560]   If you can do that mentally,
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.340]   or you can do that physical movement
[00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:12.220]   of moving your elbow back behind your body
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.120]   and you can contract that muscle hard,
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.700]   chances are that you have the capacity
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:19.540]   to enhance the strength and or size
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:21.260]   of that particular muscle
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:24.540]   because you have the neural control of that muscle.
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:27.740]   This is a key feature of the neuromuscular system
[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:30.260]   to appreciate as we begin to talk more
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:32.500]   about specific protocols,
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:36.180]   because everything about muscle hypertrophy,
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:38.860]   about stimulating muscle growth
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:42.260]   is about generating isolated contractions,
[00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:47.260]   about challenging specific muscles in a very unnatural way.
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:49.620]   Whereas with strength,
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:51.940]   it's about using musculature as a system,
[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:55.640]   moving weights, moving resistance, moving the body.
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:58.800]   The specific goal of hypertrophy
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:02.260]   is to isolate specific nerve to muscle pathways
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.340]   so that you stimulate the chemical
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.500]   and signaling transduction events in muscles
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:09.340]   so that those muscles respond by getting larger.
[00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:11.000]   So there's a critical distinction
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.780]   in terms of getting stronger
[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:15.940]   versus trying to get muscles to be larger,
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:17.820]   hypertrophy per se.
[00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:21.340]   And it has to do with how much you isolate those muscles.
[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:24.460]   Muscle isolation is not a natural phenomenon.
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:25.800]   It's not something that we normally do.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.140]   When we walk, we don't think,
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:29.900]   okay, right calf contract, left calf contract.
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.080]   No, you just generate those rhythmic movements.
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.500]   And of course, there's no reason for them
[00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.700]   to get stronger or larger in response to those movements.
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:39.380]   Let's say you were to do a kind of strange experiment
[00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:41.620]   of attaching 30 pound weights to your ankles
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:43.620]   and you were to do those movements.
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:46.880]   Well, if you weren't specifically contracting your calves
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:49.260]   in each step, there's no reason for the calves
[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.460]   to take on the bulk of the work.
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:54.100]   And you would distribute that work across your hip flexors
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:55.520]   and other aspects of your musculature.
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:58.500]   Your whole nervous system seeks to gain efficiency.
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:01.180]   It seeks to spread out the effort.
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:04.700]   So you can nest this as a principle for yourself,
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:06.760]   which is if you want to get stronger,
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:10.540]   it's really about moving progressively greater loads
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:13.080]   or increasing the amount of weight that you move.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:15.220]   Whereas if you're specifically interested
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.540]   in generating hypertrophy,
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:20.780]   it's all about trying to generate those really hard,
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:24.180]   almost painful localized contractions of muscle.
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:25.780]   Now, of course, how much weight you use
[00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:27.520]   in order to generate those contractions
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.820]   will also impact hypertrophy.
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:31.900]   But I think most people don't really understand
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:33.100]   the mind muscle connection.
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:34.620]   It sounds like a great thing,
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:37.620]   but it's actually one of the things you want to avoid
[00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:40.420]   if your goal is simply to become more supple
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.820]   or to become stronger.
[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:45.900]   You want to do the movements properly and safely, of course,
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:48.820]   but it's the opposite of hypertrophy
[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:49.860]   where with hypertrophy,
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:52.660]   you're really trying to make that particular muscle,
[00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:56.580]   sometimes two muscles, do the majority, if not all the work.
[00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:58.360]   Whereas in moving force loads,
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:02.060]   in trying to generate activity of any kind,
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:04.500]   like lifting a bar or doing a chin up or something,
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:06.020]   those so-called compound movements
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:07.900]   that involve a lot of muscle groups,
[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:10.900]   if your goal is to be better at those,
[00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:14.660]   you want to avoid isolating any one particular muscle.
[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:15.980]   Now, I know this probably comes across
[00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:18.380]   as a kind of a obvious duh,
[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:21.020]   especially to the folks that have spent a lot of time
[00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:24.180]   in the gym aimed at getting hypertrophy,
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:25.720]   but I think most people don't appreciate
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.660]   that it's the nerve to muscle connections
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:28.740]   and the distinction
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:31.220]   between isolating nerve to muscle connections
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:34.740]   versus distributing the work of nerve to muscle connections
[00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:36.280]   that's vital in determining
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:38.180]   whether or not you generate hypertrophy,
[00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:40.280]   isolated nerve to muscle contractions,
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:44.160]   versus strength and offsetting strength loss,
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:47.400]   which would be distributed nerve to muscle connections.
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.820]   If ever there was an area of practical science
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:53.280]   that was very confused, very controversial,
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.540]   and almost combative at times,
[00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:58.240]   it would be this issue of how best to train.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.080]   I suppose the only thing
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:02.100]   that's even more barbed wire of a conversation than that
[00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:04.040]   is how best to eat for health.
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:09.040]   Those seem to be the two most common areas of online battle.
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:12.040]   And the scientific literature has a lot to say
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:13.700]   about both of those things.
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:16.420]   Again, my sources for what I'm about to tell you
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:19.540]   are Professor Andy Galpin and colleagues.
[00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:20.940]   I know there are other excellent people
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:23.580]   out there in the field, but I really trust his work.
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:26.380]   He does very controlled studies.
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:27.760]   He spent a lot of time in this space.
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.140]   And what's really exciting
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:32.380]   is that in just the last three years or so,
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:34.300]   there's been a tremendous amount of information
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:37.060]   to come out about the practical steps that one can take
[00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:40.380]   in order to maximize the benefits
[00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:43.280]   of resistance exercise of any kind.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:44.720]   So I'm going to talk about those,
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:46.300]   and I'm going to talk about the research.
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:48.060]   I will provide some links,
[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:50.960]   both to a couple of the more in-depth tutorials
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:54.160]   from Dr. Galpin, as well as some of the papers
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.820]   that the information I'm about to tell you stems from.
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:52:00.820]   There's a lot of information saying
[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:05.100]   that you need to move weights that are 80 to 90%
[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:07.100]   of your one rep maximum or 70%
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:08.620]   or cycle that for three weeks on
[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:09.800]   and then go to more moderate weights.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.660]   There are a lot of paths, as some people say,
[00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:16.180]   there are a lot of ways to add up numbers to get 100.
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:17.740]   There's a near infinite number of ways
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:20.220]   to add up different numbers to get to 100.
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:22.280]   And what's very clear now
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:24.700]   from all the literature that's transpired,
[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:25.660]   and especially from the literature
[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:27.200]   in this last three years,
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:32.200]   is that once you know roughly your one repetition maximum,
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:36.520]   the maximum amount of weight that you can perform
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:39.720]   and exercise with for one repetition in good form,
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:41.920]   full range of motion,
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:46.340]   that it's very clear that moving weights
[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:51.140]   or using bands or using body weight, for instance,
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:54.740]   in the 30 to 80% of one rep maximum,
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:57.420]   that is going to be the most beneficial range
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:59.640]   in terms of muscle hypertrophy and strength,
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.500]   so muscle growth and strength.
[00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:02.880]   And there will be a bias.
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:07.000]   If you're moving weights that are in the 75%, 80% range,
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.760]   or maybe even going above that 85 and 90%,
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:12.420]   you're going to bias your improvements
[00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:14.960]   towards strength gains, this is true.
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.440]   And if you use weights that are in the 30%
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:20.940]   of your one repetition maximum or 40% or 50%
[00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:23.340]   and doing many more repetitions, of course,
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:25.720]   then you are biasing towards hypertrophy
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:27.940]   and what some people like to call muscle endurance,
[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:29.960]   but that's a little bit of a complicated term
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:32.360]   because endurance we almost always think of
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:34.200]   as relating to running or swimming
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:36.500]   or some long bouts of activity.
[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:39.440]   So 30 to 80% of one repetition maxims,
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:43.320]   it doesn't really seem to matter for sake of hypertrophy,
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.760]   except at the far ends
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:47.340]   when you're really trying to bias for strength.
[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:50.320]   Now, it is clear, however,
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:55.320]   that one needs to perform those sets to failure
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:58.080]   where you can't perform another repetition
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:01.720]   in good form again or near to failure.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:03.680]   And there's all sorts of interesting nomenclature
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.440]   that's popping up all over the internet,
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:06.600]   some of which is scientific,
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:07.940]   some of which is not scientific
[00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:10.660]   about how you are supposed to perceive
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:13.020]   how close you were to failure, et cetera.
[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:15.920]   But there are some very interesting principles
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:18.320]   that relate to how the nerves connect to the muscles
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:20.760]   that strongly predict whether or not this exercise
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:23.480]   that you're performing will be beneficial for you or not.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:24.920]   So here's how it goes.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:27.440]   For individuals that are untrained,
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:30.240]   meaning they have been doing resistance exercise
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:35.100]   for anywhere from zero, probably out to about two years,
[00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:37.880]   although for some people it might be zero to one year,
[00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:39.540]   but those are the so-called beginners.
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:41.320]   They're sort of untrained.
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:43.460]   For those people, the key parameter
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:46.460]   seems to be to perform enough sets
[00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:50.360]   of a given exercise per muscle per week.
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.640]   The same is also true for people that have been training
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.640]   for one or two years or more.
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:57.440]   What differs is how many sets to perform
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:00.080]   depending on whether or not you're trained or untrained.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:00.920]   So let's say you're somebody
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:03.520]   who's been doing some resistance exercise
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:06.440]   kind of on and off over the years,
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.200]   and you decide you want to get serious about that
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:09.720]   for sake of sport or offsetting
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.840]   age-related declines in strength.
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:16.640]   The range of sets to do in order to improve strength,
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:19.300]   to activate these cascades in the muscle
[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:21.960]   ranges anywhere from two, believe it or not,
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:23.560]   to 20 per week.
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:25.080]   Again, these are sets per week
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:27.520]   and they don't necessarily all have to be performed
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:29.100]   in the same weight training session.
[00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:31.240]   I will talk about numbers of sessions.
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:35.660]   So it appears that five sets per week
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:40.320]   in this 30% to 80% of the one repetition maximum range,
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:42.080]   getting close to failure
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:46.800]   or occasionally actually going to full muscular failure,
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:48.380]   which isn't really full muscular failure,
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:51.840]   but the inability to generate a contraction of the muscle
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.520]   or move the weight in good form.
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:54.820]   I'll go deeper into that in a moment.
[00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:56.440]   But about five sets per week
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.920]   is what's required just to maintain your muscles.
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:55:59.840]   So think about that.
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:01.200]   If you're somebody who's kind of averse
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:02.480]   to resistance training,
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:05.320]   you are going to lose muscle size and strength.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:08.080]   Your metabolism will drop, your posture will get worse.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:11.200]   Everything in the context of nerve to muscle connectivity
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.840]   will get worse over time
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:16.680]   unless you are generating five sets
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:22.800]   or more of this 30% to 80% of your one repetition maximum
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:24.100]   per week.
[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.380]   So what this means is for the typical person
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:27.800]   who hasn't done a lot of weight training,
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:31.560]   you need to do at least five sets per muscle group.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:33.440]   Now that's just to maintain.
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:35.080]   And then there's this huge range
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.400]   that goes all the way up to 15
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.660]   and in some case, 20 sets per week.
[00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:41.840]   Now, how many sets you perform is going to depend
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:45.100]   on the intensity of the work that you perform.
[00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:47.160]   This is where it gets a little bit controversial,
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:50.000]   but I think nowadays most people agree
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.220]   and Dr. Galpin confirmed that 10%,
[00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:57.020]   not to be confused with the 10% we discussed earlier,
[00:56:57.020 --> 00:57:01.380]   but 10% of the sets of a given workout
[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:05.320]   or 10% of workouts overall
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:07.520]   should be of the high intensity sort
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:09.740]   where one is actually working to muscular failure.
[00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:12.960]   Now, I say not true muscular failure because in theory,
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:14.460]   you have a concentric movement,
[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:15.920]   which is the kind of lifting of the weight
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:17.360]   and then you have the eccentric portion
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:19.240]   of muscle contraction, which is the lowering.
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:20.640]   And the eccentric movements
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:22.960]   because of the way that muscle fibers lengthen
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:26.520]   and that sliding actin myosin that we talked about before,
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:28.880]   you're always stronger in lowering something
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:31.520]   than you are in lifting it.
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:34.600]   But the point being that most of your training,
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:38.720]   most of your sets should be not to failure.
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.680]   And the reason for that is it allows you
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.640]   to do more volume of work
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:46.080]   without fatiguing the nervous system
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:48.640]   and depleting the nerve to muscle connection
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:50.680]   in ways that are detrimental.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:52.900]   So we can make this simple.
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:56.060]   Perform anywhere from five to 15 sets
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:58.280]   of resistance exercise per week.
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:01.460]   And that's per muscle.
[00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:03.720]   And that's in this 30 to 80%
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:05.480]   of what your one repetition maximum.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:08.800]   That seems to be the most scientifically supported way
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:12.520]   of offsetting any decline in muscle strength.
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:14.520]   If you're working in the kind of five set range
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:17.080]   and in increasing muscle strength
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:21.360]   when you start to get up into the 10 and 15 set range.
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:24.400]   Now, the caveat to that is everyone varies
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:27.480]   and muscles vary in terms of their recoverability.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:31.360]   Depending on how well you can control the contraction
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:33.600]   of muscles deliberately.
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:35.960]   And you can actually figure that out by sort of marching.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:36.960]   You might take five minutes
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.320]   and just kind of march across your body
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:42.280]   and mentally try and control the contractions of muscles
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:43.360]   in a very deliberate way
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:45.600]   to the point where you can generate a hard contraction.
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:46.720]   And you may have to move a limb
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:47.800]   in order to do this by the way.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:50.760]   I'm not talking about just mentally contracting your bicep
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:51.680]   without moving your wrist.
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:54.640]   I'm talking about doing that without any weight in hand
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.800]   or any band or any resistance.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:59.400]   If you can generate a high intensity contraction
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:00.720]   using these upper motor neuron
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:03.800]   to lower motor neuron pathways to muscle,
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:09.320]   you might think, well, I should perform many more sets.
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:11.460]   But actually the opposite is true.
[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:15.480]   If you can generate high intensity muscular contractions
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:17.740]   using your brain, using your neurons,
[00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:22.260]   it will take fewer sets in order to stimulate the muscle
[00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:25.500]   to maintain itself and to stimulate the muscle
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:28.160]   in order to grow or get stronger.
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:32.220]   So the more efficient you are in recruiting motor units,
[00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:33.980]   remember Henneman's size principle,
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.140]   the recruitment of more motor units
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:39.140]   which isn't just muscles, it's nerve to muscle connections.
[00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:40.940]   The better you are at doing that,
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:41.980]   the more you will recruit
[00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:43.900]   these so-called high threshold motor units,
[00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:45.460]   the ones that are hard to get to,
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:47.620]   the more you will kick off the cascades of things
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:52.220]   within muscle that stimulate muscle growth and strength.
[00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:56.280]   So if you have muscles that are challenging to contract,
[00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:00.500]   it's going to take more sets in order to stimulate
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:04.420]   the desired effect in those muscles, not fewer, okay?
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:06.280]   If you have muscles that you are very good
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:09.540]   at generating force within, it's going to take fewer sets.
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:12.580]   Now, how many sets? You are going to have to determine that.
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:13.420]   It's going to depend.
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:15.300]   For those of you that are using like 50%
[01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:17.480]   of your one repetition maximum,
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.300]   because you're doing a lot of repetitions,
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:22.140]   you might find that three or four, five sets
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:24.120]   will maintain the muscle.
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.860]   You might decide to do that once at one point in the week
[01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:28.500]   and then do it again, right?
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.740]   So if you're going for 10 sets a week,
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:31.180]   you can divide that among two sessions.
[01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:32.940]   You can do that all in one session.
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:36.760]   The data really show it doesn't matter.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:40.280]   There are some differences in terms of whether or not
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:43.060]   you're trying to generate maximum intensity within a workout
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.240]   or whether or not you want to spread that out.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.760]   But in general, resistance workouts of any kind
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:50.480]   tend to be best favored by workouts that are somewhere
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:53.720]   between 45 minutes and 60 minutes.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.680]   And generally not longer than 60 minutes,
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.520]   because that's when all the things like cortisol
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.680]   and some of the inflammatory pathways really start
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:04.040]   to create a situation in the muscle and in the body
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.400]   that's not so great for you.
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.460]   So it's not a hard and fast rule, you know,
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:10.120]   that the acts doesn't drop at 60 minutes,
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:13.520]   but it's pretty clear that performing this five to 15 sets
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.660]   per week, whether or not it's in one workout
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:17.980]   or whether that's divided up across multiple workouts
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:19.520]   is really what's going to be most beneficial.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.760]   And please do keep in mind Henneman's size principle
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.060]   and the recruitment of motor units.
[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:26.320]   And remember the better you are at contracting
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.700]   particular muscles and isolating those muscles,
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:30.880]   the fewer sets likely you need to do
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.260]   in order to get the desired effect.
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:35.420]   Now, what about people who have been training for awhile?
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:37.180]   If you're somebody who's been doing weight training
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:40.460]   for awhile, the data points to the fact
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:43.120]   that more volume can be beneficial,
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:47.180]   even for muscles that you are very efficient at contracting.
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:51.280]   Now, the curve on this, the graph on this begins again
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.540]   at about five sets per week for maintaining
[01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:55.820]   a given muscle group and extends all the way out
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:59.140]   to 25 or 30 sets per week.
[01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:03.660]   However, there are individuals who for whatever reason
[01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:05.260]   can generate so much force,
[01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:07.860]   they're so good at training muscles
[01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:09.620]   that they can generate so much force
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:12.700]   in just four or six or eight sets
[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:14.460]   that doing this large volume of work
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:16.640]   is actually going to be counterproductive.
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.180]   So everyone needs to figure out for themselves,
[01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:20.680]   first of all, how often you're willing
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:23.200]   to do resistance exercise of any kind.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:25.180]   And again, it doesn't matter if you're using bands
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:26.500]   or weights or body weight.
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.700]   For instance, if you're doing chin ups,
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:31.100]   chances are, unless you are very strong,
[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:32.500]   that you're not using weights.
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.780]   You're just using something that you can hold onto.
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:37.980]   Or if you're doing pushups, some of you will be working
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:41.660]   in that 30 to 80% of your one repetition maximum range.
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:44.140]   It doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be moving
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:46.220]   weights in a gym, for instance.
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:49.140]   So the purpose here is to figure out
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:50.900]   what muscles you're trying to train.
[01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.140]   That's an issue that we'll talk about in a moment.
[01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:56.580]   And then it does appear that somewhere between five
[01:02:56.580 --> 01:03:00.480]   and 15 sets per week is going to be what's the thing
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:01.860]   that's going to work for most people.
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:03.900]   Now, this is based on a tremendous amount of work
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:05.680]   that was done by Andy Galpin and colleagues,
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.380]   Brad Schoenfield and colleagues and others.
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:14.020]   Mike Roberts, there's a huge group of people out there
[01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:17.300]   doing exercise physiology and a small subset of them
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:20.220]   that are linking them back to real world protocols
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:22.180]   that don't just pertain to athletes.
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:23.980]   So that's mainly what I'm focusing on today.
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:26.160]   And surely there will be exceptions.
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:30.500]   Now, if you're going to divide the sets across the week,
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:32.540]   you're not going to do all 10 sets, for instance,
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:34.540]   for a given muscle group in one session,
[01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:37.320]   then of course it's imperative that the muscles recover
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.200]   in between sessions.
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:40.040]   And we are going to talk about recovery
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:43.240]   both at the systemic level, the whole nervous system,
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.040]   and at the local level, the nerve to muscle
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.780]   and local even muscle level.
[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:49.700]   We'll talk about that in about 10 minutes
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.540]   when we talk about recovery.
[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:53.560]   I do want to mention something very important,
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.700]   which is that everything I'm referring to here,
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:58.780]   it has to do with full range of motion, okay?
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:02.120]   And you might ask, well, what about the speeds of movements?
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:03.060]   This is actually turns out
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:05.180]   to be a really interesting data set.
[01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:08.000]   For generating explosiveness and speed,
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.600]   so for sprinters or throwing sports,
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.640]   or for people that want to generate a lot of jumping power,
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:16.180]   it does appear that learning to move weights
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:18.660]   as fast as you safely can,
[01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:21.460]   especially under moderate to heavy loads,
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:24.860]   can increase explosiveness and speed
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:29.860]   and most of that effect is from changes in the neurons.
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:31.940]   It's not from changes in the muscle,
[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:33.500]   it's from changes in the way
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:35.860]   that the upper motor neurons communicate
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:37.220]   with the lower motor neurons
[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:41.080]   and generating a pathway, a neural circuit as we call it,
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.440]   that is very efficient at generating action potentials,
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.340]   which are the electricity within neurons
[01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:47.280]   to trigger the muscle.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.240]   Now, of course there are events
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:49.880]   that happen from nerve to muscle,
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:53.620]   but the takeaway from that enormous literature frankly,
[01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:56.440]   is that if you want to get faster,
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:59.520]   yes, it can be beneficial to get stronger,
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:02.340]   but if you want to dedicate resistance training
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:07.340]   specifically to jumping higher, to running faster,
[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:10.660]   to throwing further and these sorts of things,
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:13.340]   that learning to generate force
[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:15.820]   with increasing speed is going to be beneficial.
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:17.940]   On the flip side of that,
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:19.660]   for people that want to get stronger,
[01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:21.980]   it appears that the slowing down of the weight
[01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:24.500]   as things get harder is a key parameter
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:27.020]   in recruiting those high threshold motor units.
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:29.420]   So let me phrase that a little bit differently.
[01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:31.000]   Think about a set in the gym
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.580]   or think about a set of pushups or a set of pull-ups.
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:36.740]   Initially, you can move very fast if you like.
[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:38.260]   If you want to generate hypertrophy,
[01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:40.820]   the goal really is not necessarily to move super slow,
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:41.940]   but to isolate the muscle
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:43.360]   and therefore not to use momentum
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:46.860]   rather than lift weights as they say, challenge muscles.
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:48.060]   If you want to get stronger,
[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:49.660]   you're going to be distributing that effort
[01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:52.280]   over more muscles and more of your nervous system.
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:55.680]   For generating explosiveness and speed,
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:59.180]   it's very clear that learning to generate forces quickly
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:03.040]   and to move heavy or moderately heavy loads quickly
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.200]   is going to be beneficial
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:07.220]   because of the way that you train the motor neurons
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:09.280]   and of course changes in the muscle.
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:12.260]   But this could look different for different sports
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:14.260]   and obviously you want to make safety paramount.
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:16.300]   If you're injured, you're not going to be able to train
[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:19.680]   at all for sport or for any purpose that is.
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.580]   And so what this would involve is something like 60 to 75%
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:24.980]   of a one repetition maximum.
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:26.500]   And then in a controlled way,
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:30.280]   moving that as quickly as one can throughout the entire set
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.440]   and certainly not going to failure
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.940]   because as you approach failure,
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:36.140]   the inability to move the weight with good form,
[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:38.220]   the weight inevitably slows down.
[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:41.100]   In fact, there are a lot of new technologies now
[01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:43.840]   that are focused on informing people
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:46.420]   of how quickly the bar or weight is moving.
[01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:48.900]   I saw an advertisement for this the other day.
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:51.420]   There are things that people can attach to bars
[01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:53.560]   that will literally speak to you as you're doing a set
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.840]   and inform you whether or not you're moving
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:58.340]   four times more slowly per rep
[01:06:58.340 --> 01:06:59.480]   than you were at the beginning
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:02.420]   and trying to hone in on the exact speed of movement.
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:05.540]   In talking to these experts prior to this episode,
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:08.520]   it does appear that for sake of hypertrophy,
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:11.360]   as long as you're not moving the muscle so quickly
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.940]   that you start to distribute the effort
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:16.760]   to lots of other muscles, it doesn't really matter
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:20.280]   because as the set gets harder,
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:23.380]   the motor units that you recruit will increase.
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:24.960]   The number of neurons that you recruit
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.080]   and the number of muscle fibers
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.800]   and particularly these high threshold muscle fibers
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:28.640]   will increase.
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:31.780]   And so it's really only for purposes of hypertrophy
[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:34.420]   that you really need to be concerned about
[01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:37.080]   how quickly the weight is slowing down.
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:39.860]   However, if you're trying to get faster, more explosive
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:44.280]   and generate more speed and jumping power, throwing power,
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.720]   things of that sort,
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:47.480]   you never really want to use a weight
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.180]   or get to a portion of the set
[01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:51.360]   where you're moving the bar very, very slowly.
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.760]   And I'm sure as I say that some of the exercise physiologists
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.320]   and advanced trainers out there
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.280]   will come after me with pitchforks, which is fine.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.760]   I'd love to see the literature that shows that low gear,
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:01.840]   slow movements with very heavy weights
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:04.720]   can indeed improve explosiveness.
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:06.440]   And that may in fact be the case,
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.620]   but the data that I was able to access
[01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:10.960]   was essentially as I described just a moment ago.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.480]   So as you're probably starting to realize,
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:16.280]   you need to customize a resistance practice
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:18.320]   for your particular needs and goals.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.040]   And I certainly am not the first to suggest
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:23.100]   that people periodize their training,
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.000]   that they do things from anywhere from one month
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.120]   to six months and to see how it goes
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.360]   and to make modifications as they go.
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:30.760]   Because the nervous system,
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.800]   in particular the neuromuscular system,
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:35.340]   changes very quickly at the beginning of training.
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:37.880]   In fact, some of the changes that one can see
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:42.880]   when they first embrace or start resistance training
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:46.400]   can be very remarkable, but they tend to slow over time.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:47.860]   So we've talked about a few principles.
[01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:49.780]   The fact that you need to get sufficient volume,
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:51.400]   you need at least five sets to maintain,
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:53.540]   and you probably need about 10 sets per muscle group
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:55.360]   in order to improve muscle.
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:58.660]   That moving weights of moderate to moderately heavy weight
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:00.600]   quickly is going to be best for explosiveness.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:04.380]   That isolating muscles and really contracting muscles hard,
[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:05.560]   something that you can test
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:08.160]   by just when you're outside the training session,
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.600]   seeing whether or not you can cramp the muscle hard
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:14.600]   will tell you your capacity to improve hypertrophy
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:18.040]   or to engage strength changes in that muscle.
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:20.800]   That your ability to contract a muscle hard
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:23.180]   is inversely related to the number of sets
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:25.300]   that you should do in order to isolate
[01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:27.600]   and stimulate that muscle.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.480]   And there are some other things
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:31.520]   that can enhance the whole process
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:34.220]   of building nerve to muscle connections,
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:36.760]   making them more efficient and generating, if you like,
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:39.080]   more strength and hypertrophy.
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:42.680]   One of them, I loathe to say,
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:46.580]   I was told is in-between set contractions.
[01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:49.540]   The other name for this is the people in the gym
[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:52.260]   does typically seem to be guys in the gym
[01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:54.420]   flexing their muscles in between sets.
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:57.620]   And indeed, the research supports the fact
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:00.220]   that contractions of about 30 seconds
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:02.240]   in between the actual work sets,
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.280]   they're not going to favor better performance
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.120]   on the work sets.
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.840]   If anything, they're going to compromise them,
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.780]   but those hard contractions in between sets
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:14.400]   for a variety of reasons related to local muscle metabolism,
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.060]   as well as what we talked about before,
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:18.040]   which are stress, tension, and damage,
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.880]   they seem to improve stress, tension, and damage
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.440]   and the nerve to muscle contraction
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.440]   in ways that facilitate hypertrophy.
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.980]   In other words, you see that person flexing
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:28.680]   in between sets in the gym,
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:31.440]   provided that they're really isolating that muscle
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:35.220]   and provided it's one that they ought to be improving.
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:36.340]   Not one of these people
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:38.020]   that always skips leg day type of people.
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:41.140]   These people are highly asymmetric,
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.500]   although that's up to them.
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:45.380]   That process of flexing in between sets
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:48.860]   does seem to improve the nerve to muscle connection
[01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:51.020]   and enhance hypertrophy.
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:52.420]   And I say I was loathe to say it
[01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:54.020]   because nowadays with phones,
[01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:58.280]   it seems like the end of every set includes a selfie.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:00.300]   And that's sort of like the 11th rep of every set.
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:03.000]   I like to joke, it seems like very few people are capable
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.860]   of actually going into the gym and doing a workout
[01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:07.100]   without taking a picture of themselves,
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:10.000]   which I think is fine if that's your thing.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.960]   Although I must say that the athletes that I know,
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:15.220]   and even the recreational athletes that I know
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:17.500]   who seem to get the most out of their training
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:18.900]   and who also seem to get the most
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:20.280]   out of other aspects of their life
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:22.140]   seem to be able to control their phone behavior
[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:24.100]   both in the gym and outside of the gym.
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.880]   But that's more of an editorial point there.
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:28.000]   In an earlier episode,
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.720]   I talked about estrogen and testosterone.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.840]   And during that discussion,
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:34.220]   I talked about the use of resistance exercise
[01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:37.360]   specifically for increasing testosterone
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.440]   both in men and in women.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:44.080]   And indeed that is a powerful effect of resistance exercise.
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:48.640]   And indeed it's mediated by the nerve to muscle connections.
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:51.220]   We talked about that in that earlier episode.
[01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:53.100]   I just want to briefly mention that protocol
[01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:54.600]   since it's distinctly different
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:57.000]   from the other protocols I've talked about today.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.820]   The protocols I've talked about today thus far
[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:04.440]   of explosive movements or of hypertrophy-based training
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:07.480]   provided the training is 60 minutes or less
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:10.400]   will cause increases in serum testosterone
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.960]   that's been shown over and over again.
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:16.560]   And if the session extends too long past 75 minutes
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.620]   and is of sufficiently high intensity,
[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:21.960]   chances are testosterone levels will start to drop
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:24.400]   and cortisol levels will go up
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.460]   in ways that can be detrimental to recovery
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:28.680]   and the goals of the training.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.100]   But that's different than training
[01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:34.760]   that's specifically geared toward increasing testosterone.
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.780]   Duncan French, who's one of the directors
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:38.720]   of the UFC Performance Center,
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:40.220]   when he was a graduate student
[01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:42.020]   at University of Connecticut stores,
[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:43.060]   did some beautiful work.
[01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:46.640]   He and his colleagues found the ideal training protocols
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:48.780]   for stimulating testosterone release,
[01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:50.880]   which is something that many people want to do
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:52.580]   for a variety of reasons.
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:57.580]   And that involved doing six sets of 10 repetitions,
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:13:02.240]   even if it requires lightening the weight
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:04.880]   on one set to the next,
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.260]   with about two minutes, 120 seconds rest in between sets,
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:12.540]   which if you think about it is pretty short rest
[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:15.480]   and is pretty darn hard work.
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:16.800]   Now what's interesting is that
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:20.120]   there's a very limited threshold for increasing testosterone.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:24.840]   That protocol of six sets of 10 repetitions
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:27.980]   led to these big increases in serum testosterone.
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:29.880]   But if people did 10 sets of 10,
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:32.260]   so just four more repetitions per set,
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:34.440]   then testosterone did not increase.
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:35.280]   In fact, you got more
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.280]   of this catabolic cortisol-like pathway.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.440]   You get other benefits
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.160]   from the so-called 10 sets of 10 protocol,
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.040]   but not the testosterone increase
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:45.960]   and maybe even reductions in testosterone.
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:48.040]   Now it's important to point out that that six sets of 10
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:50.320]   was done with big compound movements.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.040]   So things like squats or deadlifts or chin ups
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:54.080]   or things of that sort.
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:56.360]   And those were done as single sessions,
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:59.720]   not in concert with a bunch of other exercise.
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:02.400]   Although if athletes are doing that,
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:03.960]   there's no reason why they couldn't also do
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.740]   other types of training elsewhere in the week.
[01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:07.740]   I asked Duncan about this,
[01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:09.820]   and he mentioned that that done twice a week
[01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:14.160]   is probably the maximum amount that anyone could do that
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:16.520]   and still maintain this increase in testosterone.
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:18.600]   It's a very interesting protocol
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:21.800]   because as a neuroscientist,
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:24.840]   it's amazing to me that six sets of 10 repetitions
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.880]   with something causes a distinctly, excuse me,
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.320]   causes a distinctly different result
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.000]   in terms of hormone output than 10 sets of 10
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.900]   of the exact same movement.
[01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:37.840]   And it speaks to the exquisite way
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:40.140]   in which nerve to muscle connections
[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:43.960]   dictate the whole physiology of your entire system.
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:46.520]   If there's a theme that I really want to bring forward today
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:50.360]   is that weight training or resistance training of any kind
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:53.720]   is really used for either systemic effects, right?
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:56.140]   10% of training done where you're feeling that burn,
[01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:57.800]   which means lactate will be present
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.400]   and sending signals to your brain
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.960]   and to your heart and to your liver that are beneficial
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.880]   or isolating muscles,
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:07.380]   which may also generate a kind of a lactate
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:10.520]   or which is associated with the burn result,
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:13.040]   but that isolation of muscles is distinctly different.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:15.240]   So systemic versus isolated.
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:17.000]   Those are the two general ways
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.560]   in which resistance training can be applied.
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:21.460]   So I just wanted to mention that earlier protocol
[01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:24.340]   because it's well supported by the literature.
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:26.680]   If you were to incorporate that protocol,
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:28.000]   you might ask, well then can you do
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.620]   any other weight training during the week?
[01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:32.360]   And sure, of course you can provided you're recovering.
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:35.320]   So let's talk about how you know if you're recovering,
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:36.960]   how you know if a muscle is recovered
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:39.480]   and how you know if your whole system is recovered
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.320]   because recovery is what dictates
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.040]   whether or not you can come back
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:44.760]   and do more work of a different kind,
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:48.380]   meaning, I don't know, you do leg training one day,
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:49.900]   can you and should you come back
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:52.320]   and do upper body training the next day?
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:55.100]   And it dictates whether or not you'll see any improvement
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:57.000]   from session to session at all.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.280]   Before I talk about recovery,
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:00.440]   I just want to make sure I nail down the details
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:03.160]   that I was able to extract from the literature
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:05.560]   and from my conversation with Dr. Galpin.
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:08.900]   If you're wondering how quickly to perform repetitions
[01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:11.480]   for sake of hypertrophy or strength gains,
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:14.080]   anywhere from a half a second per repetition
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:16.140]   all the way up to eight seconds per repetition,
[01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:18.220]   it doesn't seem to matter.
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:20.140]   Again, if you're thinking about explosiveness
[01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:21.360]   or building speed,
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.280]   or you're specifically using resistance training
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.380]   to build endurance, that's a separate matter.
[01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:27.180]   We talked about explosiveness and speed,
[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:29.380]   I'll talk about endurance in a few moments.
[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:32.700]   We also talked about in-between set contractions,
[01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:34.760]   the so-called selfie effect
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:36.920]   of people flexing a particular muscle,
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:39.240]   isolating a particular muscle between sets.
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:42.000]   Just want to mention that would be a terrible thing to do
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.200]   if your goal is performance on sets.
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.900]   So moving a particular amount of weight,
[01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:49.020]   that's actually going to diminish the amount of weight
[01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:49.960]   that you can move.
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:51.980]   It's going to enhance muscle growth
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:55.500]   and it's going to enhance the nerve to muscle isolation
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.040]   of that particular pathway.
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:59.640]   So again, that flexing between sets
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:03.780]   is going to favor hypertrophy, not performance.
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:06.200]   If you're trying to get stronger,
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:07.560]   you're trying to move more weights,
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:09.100]   you're trying to distribute work
[01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:11.040]   and you're trying to do maybe skill training
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:13.560]   with resistance, then flexing between sets
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:16.500]   is absolutely the wrong thing to do for obvious reasons,
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:18.160]   you're fatiguing the muscle further.
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:21.100]   Just remaining still or walking around a little bit
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:23.060]   has been shown to be beneficial
[01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:25.860]   in terms of moving some of the lactate out of the muscle
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:28.100]   as well as just recovering between sets.
[01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:30.060]   Now, how long to recover between sets?
[01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:32.580]   There's a question for the testosterone protocol,
[01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:33.900]   Duncan French and colleagues found
[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:35.060]   that it was about two minutes,
[01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:38.540]   keeping that really on the clock, two minutes, not longer.
[01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:41.080]   For hypertrophy and for strength gains,
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:43.780]   it does seem that resting anywhere from two minutes
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:47.140]   or even three or four, even five or six minutes
[01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:48.160]   can be beneficial.
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:51.460]   And if you're interested in expanding the volume of work
[01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:53.860]   that you can do in a given session
[01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:57.220]   at high capacity, at high intensity with a given weight,
[01:17:57.220 --> 01:18:00.720]   please see the episode that I did on cold and performance
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:02.080]   about supercharging performance,
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:04.540]   which is based on the work of my colleague Craig Heller
[01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:06.180]   in the biology department at Stanford,
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:07.820]   which talks about palmer cooling,
[01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:10.140]   about how you can cool the core of the body
[01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:11.480]   best through the palms
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:14.120]   using these particular venous portals
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:16.680]   that are only present in your hands.
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:20.020]   People are now doing this with ice packs or with gel packs.
[01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:21.460]   There are a number of different ways one can do this.
[01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:23.220]   I talk all about that in that episode.
[01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:27.380]   It allows you to do more repetitions and more work
[01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:29.100]   at a given weight over time.
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:31.540]   So rather than getting 10 repetitions
[01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.780]   and then eight and then seven and then six
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:35.820]   through proper use of palmer cooling,
[01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:39.300]   one can do 10, 10, 10, 10, and even add sets.
[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:41.340]   And that's one way that one can accomplish
[01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:43.040]   higher volume work
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:45.500]   without having to drop the weight considerably.
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:48.020]   So that's where you can hit that really sweet spot
[01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:50.220]   if that's your goal of getting strong
[01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:52.180]   and generating some hypertrophy.
[01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:55.380]   Because as soon as you have to drop to lighter weights,
[01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:58.500]   excuse me, then you're shifting more towards hypertrophy
[01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:01.420]   and endurance and less toward strength in a given muscle.
[01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:03.240]   So check out that episode.
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:06.660]   The last thing besides between set contractions
[01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:08.740]   and whether or not you're distributing work
[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:11.320]   or whether or not you're really trying to isolate muscles
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:14.340]   is this notion of pre-exhausting muscles.
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:17.580]   It's been shown over and over again that for instance,
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:21.020]   if you want to generate force in a given muscle
[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:22.460]   and really isolate that,
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:25.140]   doing the isolation work before a compound movement.
[01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:28.060]   So this would be leg extensions,
[01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:28.880]   the thing where you sit
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:31.360]   and you extend your toes up toward the ceiling,
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:35.060]   leg extensions before squats will allow the squats
[01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:37.460]   to target that muscle group more effectively.
[01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:39.260]   And that makes perfectly good sense
[01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:41.620]   based on the Henneman size principle
[01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:43.040]   and fatiguing motor units.
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:44.780]   It should be obvious why that's the case.
[01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:48.300]   But of course that's going to be anti-performance
[01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:50.020]   in terms of how much weight you can lift
[01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:51.720]   and maybe even the form that you can maintain
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.780]   when you move to the bigger compound movement.
[01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:56.140]   So you really have to ask yourself a number of questions.
[01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:58.980]   How good are you at isolating a given muscle?
[01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:01.140]   Therefore, how many sets do you want to do?
[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:03.700]   How often are you willing to train?
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:05.500]   Therefore, how many sets are you going to do
[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.700]   in a given session versus how many are you going
[01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:09.460]   to distribute across the week?
[01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:10.860]   Are you aiming for performance?
[01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:12.440]   Are you going to distribute that work
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.500]   across the nervous system and musculature?
[01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:15.680]   Are you trying to move weights
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:17.160]   or are you trying to challenge muscles?
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.800]   If you're trying to challenge muscles,
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.620]   then you really want to focus on things
[01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:22.960]   like this pre-exhausting, the isolation of a muscle
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:24.540]   before the compound movement.
[01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:26.360]   Your performance on compound movements
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:28.500]   will absolutely suffer,
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.540]   but your ability to isolate that muscle
[01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:32.980]   and generate hypertrophy through the accumulation
[01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:36.900]   of larger myosin, those bigger balloons, will benefit.
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:39.500]   And once again, if you're trying to get faster,
[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:42.440]   then the speed of the movement really matters.
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:43.940]   So how do we know if we've recovered?
[01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:45.560]   How can we test recovery?
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:47.900]   And this is not just recovery from resistance training.
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:51.260]   This is recovery from running, recovery from swimming.
[01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:53.180]   Up until now, I've been talking about resistance training
[01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:54.680]   more or less in a vacuum.
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:56.740]   I haven't even touched on the fact
[01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:57.940]   that many people are running
[01:20:57.940 --> 01:20:59.400]   and they're doing resistance training
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:02.520]   or they're swimming and they're doing resistance training.
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:06.060]   It's not simply the case that if a given muscle is fatigued,
[01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:07.580]   you can just work other muscles
[01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:11.400]   because even if you've beautifully isolated a muscle,
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.380]   let's say you have incredible abilities
[01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:16.980]   to isolate just your quadriceps, for instance,
[01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:19.300]   and you do a workout where you isolate your quadriceps,
[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:21.020]   you do your six sets of intense work,
[01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:22.240]   or maybe use palmar cooling
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:24.800]   and you're able to do 12 sets of intense work
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:28.660]   and you're done, and that muscle group,
[01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:30.640]   the next day is certainly not going to be recovered
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:33.220]   unless you're somebody who's extraordinary at recovery
[01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:36.020]   or you're enhancing your recovery through chemical means,
[01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:38.040]   which we'll talk about at the end.
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:41.580]   Well, you can assess systemic recovery,
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:43.660]   meaning your nervous system
[01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:46.940]   and your nervous system's ability to generate force,
[01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:51.260]   both distributed and isolated, through three main tests.
[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:54.260]   And fortunately, these tests are very simple
[01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:57.420]   and two of them are essentially zero cost,
[01:21:57.420 --> 01:21:58.700]   require no equipment.
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:02.460]   HRV, heart rate variability,
[01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:05.900]   has made its way finally into the forefront
[01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:09.380]   of exercise physiology and even into the popular discussion.
[01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:11.280]   I've talked about HRV before,
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:13.420]   how when we exhale, our heart rate slows down
[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:14.660]   because of the way that our diaphragm
[01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:16.460]   is connected to our heart and to our brain
[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:18.380]   and the way our brain is connected to our heart.
[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:21.380]   Excuse me, when we inhale, our heart rate speeds up
[01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:23.980]   and that is the basis of heart rate variability.
[01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:26.180]   Heart rate variability is good.
[01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:28.480]   It means that you're breathing properly.
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:29.900]   And when I say it's good,
[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:32.300]   it means you want a lot of heart rate variability.
[01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:34.060]   You don't want a heart rate
[01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:37.240]   that is high or low consistently over time.
[01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:38.820]   That might come as a bit of a surprise
[01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:40.320]   for you endurance athletes
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:43.100]   who probably are trying to accomplish your endurance work
[01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:45.660]   at a steady cadence and really hit that nice sweet spot
[01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:47.060]   where you're breathing rhythmically,
[01:22:47.060 --> 01:22:48.300]   your heart rate's going rhythmically,
[01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:49.820]   you're in that steady heart rate,
[01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:50.980]   and then away from exercise,
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:53.220]   you have a nice low heart rate, as they say.
[01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:54.780]   Well, nice low heart rate
[01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:56.880]   isn't necessarily always so nice.
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.540]   Turns out that introducing bouts
[01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:00.540]   of increasing your heart rate during exercise
[01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:02.360]   and even through your waking day,
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:05.260]   through stressful events even is provided they're brief,
[01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:06.420]   is beneficial.
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:10.160]   A good nerve to heart system
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:12.480]   benefits from being able to increase heart rate
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:13.440]   and decrease heart rate.
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.780]   Heart rate variability is good.
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:16.980]   So you don't want high heart rate,
[01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:19.940]   you don't want low heart rate all the time.
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:21.260]   But heart rate variability
[01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:23.260]   is difficult for a lot of people to measure.
[01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:25.380]   There are some devices that will allow you to do that,
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:27.940]   various watches and devices.
[01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:31.100]   There are more devices becoming available all the time.
[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:33.500]   Hopefully soon, some that are integrated with your phone
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:36.660]   that involve no contact or anything on your body.
[01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:41.280]   But those do carry some costs and they are not perfect yet.
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:42.780]   The measures of heart rate variability
[01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:45.080]   that one can use while in movement
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:48.220]   are still in the phase, I would say,
[01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:50.980]   of technology development where everyone isn't using them.
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:52.320]   Let's leave it at that.
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:53.580]   There are two measures, however,
[01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:55.480]   whether or not you recovered that you can use
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.660]   first thing in the morning when you wake up,
[01:23:57.660 --> 01:23:59.640]   maybe after five, 10 minutes if you like,
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:02.020]   but ideally right when you wake up
[01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:04.720]   in order to assess how well recovered you are
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:06.680]   and therefore whether or not you should train
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:09.000]   your whole system at all that day.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.440]   The first one is grip strength.
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:15.460]   Grip strength, the ability to generate force
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:17.220]   at the level of squeezing the fist
[01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:19.480]   or squeezing down on something
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:22.540]   might seem like kind of a trivial way to assess recovery,
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:25.140]   but it's not because it relates to your ability
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:26.700]   to use your upper motor neurons
[01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:28.260]   to control your lower motor neurons
[01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:30.700]   and to generate isolated force.
[01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:33.520]   And so that's really what you're assessing when you do that.
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:37.620]   Some people will use one of these grip tools
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:39.940]   or there's a Costello has this toy
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:43.720]   that shaped like a donut and it's this hard rubber.
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:45.100]   And I've tried this before.
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:47.660]   If I've been working really hard, not sleeping very well,
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:49.800]   or I've been training a lot, any one or combination
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:51.540]   of those things, my grip suffers.
[01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:53.280]   I can't actually squeeze that thing down
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.120]   as much as I can.
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:57.360]   Costello, because he was born with like a 24 inch neck
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.260]   and even though he's never touched a weight,
[01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:01.340]   somehow he can just clamp down on that thing
[01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:03.680]   and he can turn it into a pancake with ease
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:06.040]   and he likes to chuckle while I struggle with this thing.
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:07.640]   But on a good day, I can squeeze this thing
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:10.240]   so that I eliminate the hole in the donut, so to speak.
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:13.700]   You can also take a floor weight and, excuse me,
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:16.360]   a floor scale and squeeze the scale
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:18.460]   and see how much force you can generate.
[01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:20.780]   I would do that as a baseline to establish
[01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:22.980]   what you can do when you're well rested.
[01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:24.180]   And then if you do that in the morning,
[01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:26.100]   you can see whether or not you're able to generate
[01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:27.400]   the same amount of force,
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:29.360]   or you could use the rubber donut or something.
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:30.780]   A lot of this is very subjective.
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:32.760]   With the scale, you're really trying to assess
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:35.080]   whether or not you can generate the same amount of force.
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:37.320]   If you start seeing a 10% or 20%,
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:39.840]   certainly reduction in that, that's concerning.
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:43.200]   It means that your system, your nervous system as a whole,
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:45.420]   it's not necessarily fatigued.
[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:48.500]   It's that the pathways from nerve to muscle
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:51.160]   are still in the process of rewiring themselves
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.700]   in order to generate force.
[01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:55.120]   And you might think, well, I trained one muscle group one day
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:56.580]   why am I having a hard time doing this
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:58.160]   for a completely different muscle group?
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:59.340]   It doesn't make any sense.
[01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:01.440]   But there's something about the upper motor neuron
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:04.020]   to lower motor neuron pathway generally
[01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:06.380]   that allows you to use something like grip strength
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:09.780]   as a kind of a thermometer, if you will,
[01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:11.100]   of your ability to recover.
[01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:13.540]   So look for your ability to generate force in grip
[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:14.820]   when you first wake up.
[01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:17.340]   It's not going to be as good as it is at 3 p.m.
[01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:19.720]   after a cup of coffee and a couple meals,
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:22.640]   but the point isn't performance overall.
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:24.060]   The point is to assess whether or not
[01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:27.180]   you're getting better, worse, or the same from day to day.
[01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:28.520]   The other one that's really terrific
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:30.620]   and that Andy Galpin's group is using,
[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:31.820]   and I'm delighted about this
[01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:33.420]   because it relates to something that my lab
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:36.900]   is very excited about as well, is carbon dioxide tolerance.
[01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:38.680]   So this is a really interesting tool
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:41.700]   that endurance athletes, strength athletes,
[01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:43.140]   I think can all benefit from.
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:45.460]   In fact, athletes and people of all kinds,
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:46.580]   even if you're not an athlete,
[01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:48.340]   even if you're not exercising at all,
[01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:49.600]   there's a good question of whether or not
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:53.500]   your system as a whole is doing okay or not.
[01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:54.820]   We rely on the thermometer.
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:56.060]   Do we have a fever or not?
[01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:58.000]   We rely on subjective things.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.380]   Do I feel good or not?
[01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:00.700]   Am I digesting well or not?
[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:02.880]   Those are all subjective.
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:07.880]   The carbon dioxide tolerance test is it's objective
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:10.680]   in that it measures your capacity to engage
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:13.000]   the so-called parasympathetic arm of your nervous system,
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.440]   which is the calming aspect of your nervous system,
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:18.720]   and it measures your ability to consciously control
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:21.840]   a particular skeletal muscle, which is your diaphragm.
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:24.520]   So here's how you do the carbon dioxide tolerance test.
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:25.740]   You wake up in the morning.
[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.800]   If you have to use the restroom first, do that,
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:30.240]   but try and stay away from your phone.
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:32.380]   If you have your phone, put it on airplane mode,
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:34.760]   go to the timer or use a handwatch
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:37.760]   or some other way of measuring time.
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:40.500]   Stay off social media for just a few seconds.
[01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:41.760]   It'll be okay.
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:43.960]   And what you're going to do is you're going to inhale
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:45.860]   through your nose as deeply as you can.
[01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:49.320]   You can do this lying down, sitting, whatever.
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:52.700]   Inhale through your nose and then exhale all the way.
[01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:54.900]   So that's one.
[01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:57.280]   You're going to repeat that four times, okay?
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:02.280]   So inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:05.100]   inhale, exhale, four times.
[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:07.520]   And ideally you're inhaling through the nose
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:09.040]   and you're exhaling through the mouth.
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.640]   That's just the beginning of this carbon dioxide
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:13.340]   tolerance test.
[01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:16.560]   Then you take a fifth inhale as deep as you can
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:17.400]   through your nose.
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:19.400]   Fill your lungs as much as you can.
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:22.280]   And if you can try and expand your,
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:23.880]   make your stomach go out while you do that,
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:26.000]   that means that your diaphragm is really engaged.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.060]   So you're inhaling as much as you possibly can.
[01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:33.440]   Then hit the timer and your goal is to release that air
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:36.880]   as slowly as possible through your mouth.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:39.520]   So it looks like you have a tiny, tiny little straw
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:41.320]   in your mouth and you're letting it go
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:46.960]   as slowly as you possibly can.
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:50.680]   Measure what we call the carbon dioxide blow off time
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:52.020]   or discard rate.
[01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:55.680]   I know you can all sit with lungs empty
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:59.860]   after you eliminate all that air, but don't lie to yourself.
[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:02.560]   Don't stop the timer when you've been sitting
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:04.060]   with your lungs empty for a while.
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:07.780]   Stop the timer when you are finally no longer able
[01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:09.860]   to exhale any more air.
[01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:13.300]   Okay, so you do inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
[01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:15.980]   inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale slowly.
[01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:17.960]   I just said it quickly for sake of time.
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:20.600]   Then you do this fifth big inhale through your mouth
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.440]   and then,
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:28.400]   and I'm not going to do it for the full duration.
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.500]   And then you're measuring that time.
[01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:34.840]   Your carbon dioxide discard rate will be somewhere
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:39.320]   between one second and presumably two minutes.
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:42.520]   Two minutes would be a heroic carbon dioxide discard time.
[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:45.400]   30 seconds would be more typical.
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:47.760]   20 seconds would be fast.
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:51.200]   If your carbon dioxide discard time
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:55.520]   is 20 or 25 seconds or less,
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:58.600]   you are not necessarily recovered
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:01.520]   from your previous day's activities, okay?
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:02.860]   There's ways to push through this,
[01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:05.140]   but hold onto that thought for a moment.
[01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:07.860]   If your carbon dioxide discard time is somewhere
[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:12.020]   between about 30 seconds and 60 seconds,
[01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:16.800]   you are in what we would call kind of the green zone
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:21.200]   where you are in a position to do more physical work.
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:24.560]   And if your carbon dioxide discard time is somewhere
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:28.480]   between 65 and 120 seconds,
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:31.080]   well then you have almost certainly
[01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:33.160]   recovered your nervous system.
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:34.600]   I'm not talking about the individual muscles,
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:37.680]   but your nervous system is prepared to do more work.
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:40.080]   And Andy's lab has great data on this
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:41.880]   as it relates to exercise physiology.
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:43.040]   I think that story should be out
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:44.800]   in the not too distant future.
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:47.360]   My lab has been using carbon dioxide discard time
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:50.640]   to look at anxiety and recovery from bouts of anxiety.
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:52.920]   So two totally independent projects,
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:54.680]   but using the same measure.
[01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:58.080]   So you've got HRV, which requires some technology usually.
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:30:59.680]   You've got grip strength,
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:02.520]   which you can assess subjectively,
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:04.560]   or you can use a floor scale.
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:06.760]   And now you have carbon dioxide tolerance.
[01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:09.880]   You want to do this in the morning when you wake up
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:12.420]   and keep track, just write down in a little book,
[01:31:12.420 --> 01:31:13.860]   or maybe just keep track in your mind
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:15.840]   of your carbon dioxide discard time.
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:19.120]   If you find that your discard times are dropping,
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:22.760]   even if they're in the 40 second range or 50 second range,
[01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:26.380]   but normally you can do 75 seconds or 120 seconds,
[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:30.840]   if they're starting to drop by anywhere from 15 to 20%,
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:33.420]   you're veering in the direction of not recovering.
[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:35.660]   And I'm really keen on this tool
[01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:38.820]   because everybody has different recovery abilities.
[01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:41.240]   Some people are eating really well and sleeping really well.
[01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:42.560]   Some people have minimal stress
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:44.820]   or can buffer stress really well.
[01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:48.840]   Other people, they dissolve into a puddle of tears
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:53.520]   if they read one text message that's troubling or whatever.
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:55.440]   And I realize, and I say that with sympathy,
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:57.220]   I realize people have varying levels of stress
[01:31:57.220 --> 01:31:58.520]   and demand in their life.
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:02.380]   It's just impossible to prescribe an entire protocol
[01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:04.200]   that says, okay, yes, you should train today
[01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:05.460]   and this is exactly what you should do.
[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:06.300]   No, you shouldn't.
[01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:08.160]   Use carbon dioxide discard rate
[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:10.900]   because A, it's valuable, it's informative.
[01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:14.140]   B, it's zero cost.
[01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:17.420]   And C, it's something you can track objectively over time.
[01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:18.740]   And that's really the key.
[01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:21.780]   And I just should, I'd be remiss if I didn't say
[01:32:21.780 --> 01:32:25.000]   that what carbon dioxide discard rate is tapping into
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.980]   is your ability to mechanically control your diaphragm.
[01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:30.100]   Certainly that's one aspect of it.
[01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:32.340]   But that relates in a very direct way
[01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:36.700]   to your ability to put the brake on your stress system,
[01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:40.060]   to engage the so-called parasympathetic or calming arm
[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:41.900]   of your autonomic nervous system.
[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:45.500]   And another thing that Andy Galpin's group is testing
[01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:48.980]   is at the offset of training, after your run,
[01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:50.840]   after your weight training session,
[01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:53.540]   maybe even after your plyometrics session,
[01:32:53.540 --> 01:32:55.900]   we didn't really talk about jumping and throwing
[01:32:55.900 --> 01:32:57.180]   and that sort of thing.
[01:32:57.180 --> 01:32:59.620]   Maybe we'll talk about it in a future episode.
[01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:04.620]   But they and other groups, including some elite athletes
[01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:06.640]   and other groups that are very interested
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:10.180]   in physical performance are using a tool
[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:13.560]   where they deliberately disengage for five minutes
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:14.740]   at the end of training.
[01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:17.300]   They deliberately engage this calming
[01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:19.620]   or parasympathetic arm of the nervous system.
[01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:22.040]   And you can do that through any number of different tools.
[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:24.460]   I'm a big fan of respiration tools
[01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:25.740]   'cause they're always available to you.
[01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:27.480]   Your breathing is always there.
[01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:29.820]   I talk about some of these tools in previous episodes
[01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:32.800]   but you could use things like non-sleep deep rest and SDR
[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:34.240]   at the end of a training session.
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:37.260]   You could do 10 physiological size,
[01:33:37.260 --> 01:33:40.180]   double inhales through the nose, followed by long exhales.
[01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:41.340]   That will definitely engage
[01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:44.660]   the parasympathetic nervous system at the end of training.
[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:46.580]   So rather than finish your training session
[01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:48.600]   and then just hop onto your phone,
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:51.680]   serious athletes and people who are serious
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:54.660]   about recovery initiate that recovery
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:56.660]   at the very end of their training.
[01:33:56.660 --> 01:34:00.500]   And they start to kickstart that recovery process rather
[01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:02.420]   and they measure CO2 tolerance in the morning.
[01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:04.160]   So there are several groups that are doing that.
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:07.740]   In fact, I know several groups because I'm working with them
[01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:10.980]   that are using physiological size between sets
[01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:12.860]   in order to recover their nervous system
[01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:16.340]   and maintain nerve to muscle contractibility,
[01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:18.900]   maintain focus throughout their training session,
[01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:22.200]   enhance their focus by doing a few physiological size.
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:25.140]   So double inhale, exhale in between sets.
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:27.760]   So they're getting very focused and very intense
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:29.640]   about their strength work or explosiveness work
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:31.400]   or muscle isolation work during their sets.
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:32.960]   And then in between sets,
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:35.280]   they're deliberately disengaging the nervous system
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:37.600]   and then they're re-engaging it again.
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:39.480]   So I just wanted to emphasize that.
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:41.520]   So recovery is a complex process.
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:42.960]   It's got a lot of things
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:46.120]   but the CO2 tolerance test should be a valuable tool.
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:48.960]   Now, another tool for recovery that people are very excited
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:51.540]   about is the use of cold and the ice bath.
[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:52.980]   And this is important.
[01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:56.460]   If you are somebody who uses cold through cold shower
[01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:59.300]   or ice bath or jumping in a lake or a river,
[01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:01.260]   whatever it is that you use to generate cold
[01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:03.620]   as a recovery tool, you should be aware
[01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:05.540]   that there are data starting to emerge
[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:09.040]   that if your goal is recovery or strength improvements,
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:13.500]   using cold within the four hours following a workout.
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:14.620]   I'm not talking about polymer cooling.
[01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:16.220]   I'm talking about whole body cooling or cooling
[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:17.940]   from the neck down.
[01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:19.840]   Yes, it will reduce inflammation.
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:21.700]   Yes, it will reduce the amount
[01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:23.680]   of delayed onset muscle soreness.
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:27.060]   One readout of how intense or damaging a given workout was,
[01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:30.580]   not the only readout, but it does seem to interfere
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:32.640]   with some of the things like mTOR pathways,
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:34.760]   the mammalian targeted rapamycin pathway
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:38.060]   and other pathways related to inflammation
[01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:41.440]   that promote muscle repair, remember, and muscle growth.
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:44.780]   Remember, stress, tension, and damage are the stimulus
[01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:46.760]   for nerve to muscle connections to change
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:49.180]   and for muscles to get bigger, stronger, and better.
[01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:52.140]   And so if you're getting into the ice bath after training
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:53.560]   or taking a really cold shower
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:55.320]   after doing resistance training,
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:58.020]   you are likely short circuiting the improvements
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:35:59.580]   that you're trying to create.
[01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:03.160]   Now, athletes who are trying to recover quickly
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:06.100]   so that they can get back into more training sessions,
[01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:08.840]   or let's say you're somebody who doesn't really want
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:12.040]   to gain much strength or hypertrophy,
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:13.860]   and you're mainly focused on endurance,
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:15.300]   and you want to do more endurance work,
[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:16.180]   and you've been weight training,
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:19.020]   well, then exposing yourself to cold can be beneficial,
[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:21.700]   but you're not going to get as great of benefits
[01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:23.480]   from the resistance training.
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:25.660]   In other words, cold after resistance training
[01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:27.540]   seems to short circuit some of the benefits
[01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:29.080]   of that resistance training.
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:31.060]   There are some other things that can short circuit
[01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:33.260]   the benefits of resistance training as well.
[01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:36.980]   One of those is antihistamines.
[01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:39.260]   Some interesting data were published recently,
[01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:41.900]   I believe it was in Scientific Reports, yes,
[01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:45.900]   that showed that antihistamines can prevent
[01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:48.860]   some of the benefits of cardiovascular exercise
[01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:50.000]   of endurance type work,
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.620]   so running, swimming, fairly long duration,
[01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:53.860]   or even sprint type work,
[01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:55.960]   as well as inhibit some of the processes
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:59.180]   associated with resistance training.
[01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:01.840]   Remember, resistance training or endurance training,
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:04.240]   that's a stimulus for stress,
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:06.200]   and the adaptation to that stress
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:07.380]   is how you get better,
[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:11.300]   that you can run further, faster, lift more weight,
[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:12.700]   hypertrophy the muscle, et cetera.
[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:14.320]   So antihistamines can be a problem.
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:16.020]   Obviously, don't compromise your ability
[01:37:16.020 --> 01:37:17.340]   to breathe completely,
[01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:19.820]   but antihistamines generally work
[01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:22.920]   by blocking what are called mast cells, M-A-S-T.
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:24.580]   Mast cells are really interesting cells
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:27.900]   that we'll talk about in our month on neuroimmune function.
[01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:29.180]   They travel in the bloodstream
[01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:30.260]   and they're these little packets
[01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:32.440]   that burst open at sites of inflammation.
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:35.020]   Muscle damage and inflammation
[01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:37.620]   is a signal that something needs to change.
[01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:40.160]   And so taking antihistamines, it appears,
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:42.620]   can disrupt some of that inflammatory process.
[01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:44.140]   So you actually want inflammation
[01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:46.060]   during and immediately after a workout,
[01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:48.900]   then you want to bring inflammation down later,
[01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:50.260]   and I'll mention how to do that.
[01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:52.940]   The other thing are non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs.
[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:54.220]   You know their trade names.
[01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:56.460]   These are painkillers that many people take.
[01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:58.320]   Those, as I've mentioned in a previous episode,
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:01.940]   can interfere with the benefits of endurance training
[01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:03.960]   and the benefits of resistance training.
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:06.180]   In addition to that, they block pain signals,
[01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:09.040]   and pain is a very good signal
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:11.140]   that you might be doing something wrong.
[01:38:11.140 --> 01:38:13.500]   And so while nobody likes to be in pain,
[01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:14.840]   I suppose there are probably a few people out there
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:16.560]   like to be in pain, but that's a different story,
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:18.380]   but nobody likes to be in pain,
[01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:20.300]   the non-steroid anti-inflammatories,
[01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:22.220]   the NSAIDs as they're called,
[01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:25.360]   and the antihistamines seem to prevent a lot of the gains,
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:28.320]   the improvements in endurance, strength, and size
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:31.620]   that people are specifically using exercise for.
[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:34.320]   So be cautious about your use of non-steroid
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:35.920]   anti-inflammatory drugs,
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:38.480]   especially within the four hours preceding
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:41.520]   or the four hours following exercise.
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:43.300]   So I hope you're starting to get the picture.
[01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:46.020]   In order to change the nerve to muscle connectivity
[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:48.160]   in ways that will better serve you,
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:51.820]   you need a stressor during the actual training.
[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:54.740]   Which particular stressor depends on your training goals,
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:58.520]   but that stressor is almost always going to be associated
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:00.740]   with inflammation, and then after the training,
[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:03.600]   you want to try and get into a state of reduced inflammation.
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:06.980]   And that's why you would do some sort of protocol,
[01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:09.760]   non-sleep deep rest, which we will link to in our caption,
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:12.300]   or perhaps you would use the hypnosis app
[01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:16.800]   that we've talked about before, Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I.com.
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:20.460]   There's a great app for accessing deep rest states
[01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:23.440]   or the physiological side to try and get the system,
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:27.080]   your system to calm down after training.
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:29.440]   There are also tools that one can use
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:32.620]   to reduce inflammation at a kind of foundational level
[01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:33.820]   away from training.
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:35.780]   And these are tools that I've talked about
[01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:39.520]   many times before, but I'll just restate them again.
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:42.120]   The kind of golden three, according to Andy Galpin
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:45.160]   and the ones that he recommends are sufficient omega-3s.
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:47.560]   Again, that can be accomplished through diet,
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:48.540]   through whole food intake,
[01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:50.360]   or through supplementation or both.
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:52.860]   So in general, getting above a thousand milligrams
[01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:57.580]   of EPA per day to keep inflammation low or relatively low.
[01:39:57.580 --> 01:40:01.940]   Vitamin D, and in some cases, magnesium malate.
[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:04.320]   Magnesium malate seems to be particularly effective
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:07.580]   in offsetting delayed onset muscle soreness.
[01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:10.060]   Soreness itself is not required
[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:12.240]   for improvements in strength,
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:13.840]   improvements in explosiveness,
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:15.680]   improvements in hypertrophy.
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:16.520]   That's a myth.
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:19.240]   Now, if you do experience delayed onset muscle soreness,
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:23.240]   chances are you stressed that particular muscle pretty well,
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:26.240]   or even maybe too well, maybe you stressed it too much
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:28.420]   and you need longer recovery.
[01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:30.860]   There's a total debate out there
[01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:32.240]   about whether or not you should train again
[01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:33.380]   when a muscle is still sore.
[01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:34.900]   I think the general takeaway is no,
[01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:36.180]   that means it's not recovered.
[01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:38.680]   And there are things of course, like massage,
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:42.720]   like fascial release and things of that sort, sauna, cold,
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:47.080]   that can perhaps accelerate the movement
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:49.360]   from soreness to not sore.
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:51.620]   But in general, the omega-3 vitamin D
[01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:54.740]   and magnesium malate, excuse me, trio
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:57.000]   seem to be an effective way to reduce inflammation
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.500]   at kind of a systemic level.
[01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:00.120]   But remember you want inflammation
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:01.520]   provided you're not damaging the muscle
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:04.160]   so much that you're injured during the training session
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:08.320]   because that's the stimulus for change in those muscles.
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:10.200]   I want to talk about a few other things
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:13.580]   that support the process of nerve to muscle communication
[01:41:13.580 --> 01:41:15.440]   and touch on some of the things
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:16.800]   that a lot of people are doing
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:19.200]   to try and quote unquote enhance their workouts
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:21.200]   and evaluate whether or not those are in fact
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:23.440]   enhancing workouts or not,
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:25.440]   because weight training,
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:28.500]   unlike a lot of other forms of exercise,
[01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:30.920]   has a unique aspect to it,
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:32.940]   which is this feature that I guess
[01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:34.040]   some people call it the pump,
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:36.520]   which is the fact that blood goes into the muscle
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:37.560]   when you train.
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:38.760]   It's the only kind of training
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:39.980]   where you actually get a window
[01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:42.720]   into what the result might actually look like
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:44.520]   before you actually accomplish that result.
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:46.680]   So if you think about when you go out for a hard run
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:49.240]   and let's say you go out for a two mile run,
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:50.920]   let's say your goal is to break,
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:52.480]   you want to do a sub 10 two mile.
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:54.720]   Actually, when I went to university,
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:57.900]   I was running cross country my senior year of high school,
[01:41:57.900 --> 01:42:01.400]   and I wanted to walk on for the cross country team.
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:02.840]   And so I went out there
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:06.400]   and it turned out you had to do a sub 10 two mile.
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:09.360]   And I think the best mile I ever ran in high school
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:11.320]   was a 457, which isn't terrible.
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:12.640]   I can't do that now.
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:15.120]   It's not even close to what high school athletes,
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:17.120]   the best high school athletes can do now,
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:19.680]   but that would have meant doing it back to back.
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:21.800]   So sub 10 minute two mile.
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:22.900]   They even come close.
[01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:24.540]   I told Costello this story the other day
[01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:25.960]   and he just kind of laughed at me.
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:28.840]   He was like, why would you even want to run two miles?
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:31.560]   Because Costello is built almost exclusively
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:33.420]   of these type two fast twitch muscles
[01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:35.000]   that are designed for moving objects.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.560]   He's incredibly strong.
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:38.580]   He has been since he was a puppy.
[01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:41.080]   I mean, that dog could probably drag a tractor
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:45.320]   if he wanted to, but he can't really go far.
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:47.000]   Whereas a greyhound or a whippet
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.760]   or some of these other site hounds or scent hounds
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:49.600]   can go, go, go.
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:52.120]   They have a higher percentage of the so-called slow twitch
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:52.940]   muscle fibers.
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:54.980]   They are much better at endurance.
[01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:58.800]   So a sub 10 two mile would have been very, very challenging.
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:01.920]   No chance I could have done that, I don't think,
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:03.320]   even with a lot of training.
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:08.240]   But let's say that you want to improve your performance
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:09.740]   in a given type of exercise.
[01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:12.320]   Let's talk about some of the things that seem to work
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:17.000]   across the board to improve strength, improve hypertrophy,
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.680]   and improve nerve to muscle communication and performance.
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:23.660]   The first thing that's absolutely key for nerve to muscle
[01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:27.100]   communication and physical performance of any kind
[01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:28.600]   might not sound that exciting to you,
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:32.480]   but it is very exciting and that's salt.
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:36.520]   Nerves, nerve cells, neurons communicate with each other
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:39.800]   and communicate with muscle by electricity.
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:43.120]   But that electricity is generated by particular ions
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:45.120]   moving into and out of the neuron.
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:50.120]   And the rushing in of a particular ion, sodium, salt,
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:52.840]   is what allows nerve cells to fire.
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:55.860]   If you don't have enough salt in your system,
[01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:58.280]   your neurons and your brain and your nerve to muscle
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:00.580]   communication will be terrible.
[01:44:00.580 --> 01:44:03.680]   If you have sufficient salt, it will be excellent.
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:06.280]   How much salt will depend on how much water you're drinking,
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:07.580]   how much caffeine you're drinking,
[01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:09.820]   and how much food you're ingesting.
[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:11.920]   So, and whether or not you're taking any diuretics,
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:14.240]   how hot it is, et cetera, how much you're sweating.
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:16.000]   So you want to make sure that you have enough salt,
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.120]   potassium, and magnesium in your system
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:19.660]   if you want to perform well.
[01:44:19.660 --> 01:44:23.340]   I realize that salt isn't a very glamorous performance tool,
[01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:24.760]   but it is vital.
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:26.000]   It is absolutely vital.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.960]   And the endurance athletes and the people that train
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:31.500]   in high heat can speak to the fact that when your
[01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:34.320]   electrolytes are low, your brain doesn't function,
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:36.040]   your body doesn't function nearly as well.
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:40.240]   In fact, even for mental work, for studying and for writing
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:42.480]   and for doing math and coding,
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:43.840]   doing analytic work of any kind,
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:46.840]   even a hard conversation that's important to you,
[01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:48.800]   having sufficient electrolytes is really going to help
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:51.000]   and being low on electrolytes won't help.
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.320]   And just drinking water won't help
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:54.600]   because you need electrolytes.
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:57.760]   The other thing that's been shown over and over again,
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:00.960]   numerous well-controlled studies to improve
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:03.320]   muscle performance is creatine.
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:06.100]   Early on, there was a lot of controversy about creatine,
[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:07.600]   but there are many studies.
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:09.500]   If you want, you can go to this website
[01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:10.880]   that everyone now knows I love,
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:13.860]   which is this free website, examine.com,
[01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:18.860]   that there are no fewer than 18 studies there, 66 studies.
[01:45:18.860 --> 01:45:22.240]   So 18 studies supporting that muscle creatine content
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:24.240]   can be increased by ingesting creatine.
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:25.200]   How much creatine?
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:28.400]   Well, I asked the experts and they tell me
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:31.760]   that for somebody who's about 180 pounds,
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:35.120]   five grams a day should be sufficient or so.
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:36.840]   Heavier than 180, so if you've got like,
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:39.700]   if you're a 220 pound or 230 pound person,
[01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:43.060]   10 to 15 grams of creatine, people lighter than 180 pounds,
[01:45:43.060 --> 01:45:45.860]   maybe three to five grams of protein, excuse me, creatine,
[01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:47.320]   or even one to three grams.
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:52.320]   Creatine is a fuel source for early in bouts of activity,
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:54.760]   for high intensity activity.
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:57.940]   It is also a fuel source for neurons in the brain
[01:45:57.940 --> 01:46:01.560]   and it can have some cognitive enhancing effects.
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:03.320]   So creatine is a very interesting molecule.
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:06.220]   Early on, when it was released as a supplement,
[01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:10.520]   it was thought that you had to load it in higher dosages
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:14.160]   for a few days and then maintain it at lower dosages.
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:16.000]   So you'd take 20 or 30 grams a day,
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.880]   then back off to five or 10.
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:19.380]   It doesn't seem to be the case that you can get
[01:46:19.380 --> 01:46:22.920]   all the benefits from taking the dosages at the low level.
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:24.920]   I just mentioned a few moments ago
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:26.960]   as they relate to body weight throughout.
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:30.260]   So salt and electrolytes, absolutely key.
[01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:33.420]   You need those present, you need to be well hydrated.
[01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:36.520]   Creatine seems to have a performance enhancing effect.
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:39.340]   There are 66 studies, 66,
[01:46:39.340 --> 01:46:42.840]   showing that power output is greatly increased
[01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:46.160]   anywhere from 12 to 20%.
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:48.080]   And this is sprinting and running and jumping
[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:50.620]   as well as weightlifting by creatine.
[01:46:50.620 --> 01:46:55.060]   The ability to hydrate your body is improved by creatine
[01:46:55.060 --> 01:46:58.080]   because of the way that it brings more water
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:00.380]   into cells of various kinds.
[01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:03.560]   As an indirect effect, it can help increase lean mass
[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:05.560]   because of the way that it brings more water into muscle
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:08.000]   and probably also because of the way that if you get
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.820]   stronger, you can generate more force
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:11.500]   and generate more hypertrophy.
[01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:12.980]   It reduces fatigue.
[01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:15.560]   Seven studies have shown that it reduces fatigue.
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:18.460]   There are even some interesting effects
[01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:20.600]   on improving cognition after traumatic brain injury.
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:23.000]   Although that's a serious medical condition in situations,
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.820]   you absolutely should talk to a board certified physician
[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:28.840]   before adding anything or taking anything out
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:30.960]   of your current regimen.
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:31.840]   There are a few other effects
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:34.460]   that are interesting and notable,
[01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:36.600]   but the big ones are the ones that I referred to before
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:39.080]   about increased power output, et cetera.
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:41.660]   And I just want to emphasize that creatine
[01:47:41.660 --> 01:47:43.800]   can increase this hormone that we talked about
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:46.760]   in the testosterone episode, dihydrotestosterone,
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:50.960]   which is testosterone converted by 5-alpha reductase
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:52.660]   into dihydrotestosterone.
[01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:56.200]   It's the more dominant androgen in humans,
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:59.240]   leads to increases in strength and libido and so forth.
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:01.640]   It also can increase male pattern baldness.
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:04.820]   Some people, not everybody, experience some hair loss
[01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:06.480]   with creatine, other people don't.
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:08.560]   Some people experience accelerated beard growth
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:11.440]   because basically DHT has the opposite effect
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:13.880]   on hair follicles on the face as it does on the scalp.
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:15.380]   Some people don't.
[01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:19.880]   Women who ingest creatine, there are essentially no data
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:23.880]   showing that it increases hair loss or facial hair growth,
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:25.520]   but of course everyone is different.
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:28.360]   So you can go to examine.com, you can explore those studies.
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:30.500]   So creatine, definitely a powerful
[01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:32.240]   performance enhancing molecule.
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:35.080]   The other one, one that personally I've never tried,
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:37.800]   but that seems to have a very strong
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:41.180]   and well-supported effects is beta-alanine.
[01:48:41.180 --> 01:48:43.560]   Now, beta-alanine is interesting
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:45.160]   because when you hear about weight training,
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:47.160]   you think about heavy deadlifts and bench presses,
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:49.080]   all that kind of stuff that people are doing,
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:53.000]   but beta-alanine seems to support exercise
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.040]   that is of slightly longer duration.
[01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:59.960]   So a mix of anaerobic and aerobic type movement.
[01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:01.680]   So things, these are physical performance
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:04.300]   in the 60 to 240 second range.
[01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:06.800]   So you can use your mind and kind of figure out
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:09.240]   like things that weights of the,
[01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:11.940]   that limit you to eight to 15 repetitions.
[01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:16.080]   Cardiovascular exercise of the sort like rowing or sprinting.
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:18.900]   So interval work, it seems to help with that kind of work.
[01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:20.060]   So we're not talking about long runs,
[01:49:20.060 --> 01:49:21.840]   we're not talking about heavy deadlifts.
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:24.200]   The standard dose is somewhere between two and five grams.
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:26.340]   Again, as always, check with a doctor,
[01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:28.260]   make sure these things are safe for you.
[01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:29.520]   I'm not responsible for your health.
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:31.440]   You are, I don't say that just to protect me,
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:34.240]   I'd say that also to protect you.
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:38.120]   But it really seems to improve muscular endurance,
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:41.940]   improve anaerobic running capacity, reduce fatigue.
[01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:43.040]   There are even some interesting effects
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:45.980]   on reduction of body fat and improvements in lean mass.
[01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:49.320]   So creatine, beta-alanine, electrolytes,
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:51.920]   these are kind of the core three things
[01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:54.800]   that seem to improve performance and are well supported
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:56.880]   by the scientific literature.
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:49:59.720]   And in the earlier episode on supercharging performance,
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:01.180]   we talked about palmar cooling.
[01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:03.860]   That's certainly a performance enhancing tool.
[01:50:03.860 --> 01:50:04.720]   It's nothing you ingest,
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:06.960]   you're cooling your palms in a very specific way.
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:07.920]   That's very powerful.
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:10.420]   Now, what about for longer duration bouts of exercise?
[01:50:10.420 --> 01:50:12.600]   We've mainly been focusing on resistance training,
[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:14.900]   but what about for long runs, long swims,
[01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:16.040]   these kinds of things?
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:18.200]   Well, it does seem that beet juice
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:21.280]   and ingesting things like arginine and citrulline
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:25.280]   can improve performance for those long bouts of exercise.
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:27.360]   That's mainly going to be due to effects
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:29.680]   of those compounds on vasodilation.
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:31.280]   It's going to open up the vasculature
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:33.700]   and allow more blood flow.
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:36.200]   Do note that things like citrulline and arginine
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:39.920]   can have some side effects, if you will.
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:42.080]   They can increase the likelihood
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:45.800]   of having herpes cold sore outbreaks on the mouth.
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:48.360]   The arginine is in the pathway by which,
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:49.200]   I don't know if people know this,
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:52.460]   but the herpes virus lives on neurons of the trigeminal nerve
[01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:55.200]   that innervate the lips and the eyes
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:57.540]   and the mucous membranes of the face.
[01:50:57.540 --> 01:51:00.040]   So this is the herpes type one simplex virus.
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:03.280]   The virus lives on those neurons
[01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:05.880]   and then periodically inflames those neurons
[01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:07.080]   and that's what leads to the cold sore.
[01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:09.480]   It seems like arginine and citrulline
[01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:13.600]   can lead to increases in cold sores and canker sores
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:15.640]   and outbreaks of those kinds.
[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:17.440]   So you want to be aware of that.
[01:51:18.700 --> 01:51:23.700]   That's not everybody, and not everybody is carrying HSV-1.
[01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:28.320]   Just be aware that I think it's now 80 or 90% of people,
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:31.800]   by time they are 12 years old, they've contracted HSV-1.
[01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:35.060]   It's very contagious and typically people will get
[01:51:35.060 --> 01:51:37.900]   one outbreak and then only under conditions of stress
[01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:39.920]   or heightened arginine or citrulline ingestion
[01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:41.380]   will have them later.
[01:51:41.380 --> 01:51:46.380]   Again, this is not necessarily a sexually an STI.
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:49.820]   This is a sexually transmitted infection.
[01:51:49.820 --> 01:51:52.800]   This is an infection that is passed very easily
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:55.100]   from mucous membranes, just in terms of touching objects
[01:51:55.100 --> 01:51:56.100]   and things of that sort.
[01:51:56.100 --> 01:51:58.960]   Very common in the general population.
[01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:03.160]   Any discussion about muscle and muscle performance
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:05.280]   would not be adequate if we didn't mention something
[01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:07.820]   about nutrition, but rather than have a whole discussion
[01:52:07.820 --> 01:52:09.640]   about nutrition, 'cause there's lots of information
[01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:11.020]   about that online.
[01:52:11.020 --> 01:52:12.740]   Like for instance, if you want to gain muscle
[01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:15.180]   that you need to have a caloric surplus
[01:52:15.180 --> 01:52:19.180]   of about 10 to 15%, you could have a caloric surplus
[01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:22.120]   of more if you want to avoid gaining weight,
[01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:24.680]   then you would not create a caloric surplus, et cetera.
[01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:26.260]   You can find all that information online.
[01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:28.740]   That's not what this podcast is really about.
[01:52:28.740 --> 01:52:32.160]   We had a month where we talked a lot about hormones
[01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:33.380]   and food and moods.
[01:52:33.380 --> 01:52:35.660]   We talked about foods, but more as they relate
[01:52:35.660 --> 01:52:36.780]   to the nervous system.
[01:52:36.780 --> 01:52:40.080]   When it comes to supporting muscle,
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:43.340]   to supporting the synthesis of larger,
[01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:45.260]   what I call myosin balloons,
[01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:50.080]   it does seem that ingesting 700 to 3000 milligrams
[01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:52.340]   of the essential amino acid leucine
[01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:53.620]   with each meal is important.
[01:52:53.620 --> 01:52:56.820]   Now that does not necessarily mean from supplements.
[01:52:56.820 --> 01:53:01.620]   In fact, most people recommend that you get your protein,
[01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:04.520]   you get your amino acids, including your essential amino
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:06.620]   acids and your leucine from whole foods.
[01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:10.220]   High quality proteins, high density proteins.
[01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:11.060]   What do you mean by that?
[01:53:11.060 --> 01:53:14.200]   Well, it is true that a lot of sources of protein
[01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:17.060]   are found in things like beans and nuts
[01:53:17.060 --> 01:53:19.060]   and things like that, that all the essential amino acids
[01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:20.780]   can be found there.
[01:53:20.780 --> 01:53:25.440]   But per unit calorie, if it's in your practice,
[01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:28.100]   if it's in your ethics to ingest animal proteins,
[01:53:28.100 --> 01:53:32.180]   it's true that for instance, 200 calories of steak
[01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:35.840]   or chicken or fish or eggs will have a higher density
[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:38.240]   of essential amino acids than the equivalent amount
[01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:40.840]   of calories from nuts or plants.
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:42.500]   That's just simply the way it works.
[01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:44.280]   So I'm not, for the vegans and vegetarians,
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:46.480]   I'm certainly not saying there's no way
[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:48.140]   that you can support muscle growth.
[01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:49.380]   You absolutely can.
[01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:51.680]   Some of them might want to supplement leucine,
[01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:55.900]   but this 700 to 3000 milligrams of leucine per meal
[01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:57.800]   is one of the best ways that's been shown
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:00.960]   to support the synthesis of more myosin
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:02.900]   if your goal is hypertrophy.
[01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:05.700]   And it's also the way that you would support muscle repair
[01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:07.320]   if your goal is strength.
[01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:10.020]   So that's specifically geared towards muscle hypertrophy
[01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:10.940]   and strength.
[01:54:10.940 --> 01:54:12.340]   And I encourage you to think
[01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:15.400]   about this protein density issue
[01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:19.460]   and whether or not you ingest animal proteins
[01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:21.740]   or you don't to think about whether
[01:54:21.740 --> 01:54:25.560]   or not you're getting sufficient essential amino acids,
[01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:27.000]   especially leucine.
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:30.400]   Now, many people have addressed the question
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:33.380]   of whether or not you need to eat six or seven times a day.
[01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:34.580]   It turns out that you don't.
[01:54:34.580 --> 01:54:35.920]   That's kind of the old school thinking
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:37.340]   that you need to eat very frequently.
[01:54:37.340 --> 01:54:40.560]   I think for certain athletes who are very active
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:41.900]   for drug assisted,
[01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:44.380]   meaning people that are enhancing their testosterone levels
[01:54:44.380 --> 01:54:45.780]   to super physiological levels
[01:54:45.780 --> 01:54:48.040]   where they are experiencing very heightened levels
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:50.340]   of protein synthesis and they can utilize all that,
[01:54:50.340 --> 01:54:51.220]   that might make sense.
[01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:52.620]   Again, I'm not supporting the use
[01:54:52.620 --> 01:54:54.220]   of those performance enhancing drugs,
[01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:55.500]   but there are people doing that.
[01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:59.000]   And that's one of the reasons why they eat so frequently
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:00.340]   and so much protein.
[01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:02.200]   For typical people who are not doing that,
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:04.300]   I imagine most of you are not,
[01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:08.000]   then it does appear that you need to eat,
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.380]   but you don't need to eat six or seven times a day.
[01:55:10.380 --> 01:55:13.200]   It does seem like not eating once a day is also important.
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:16.300]   So somewhere between one meal a day and six meals a day
[01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:18.260]   lies the more reasonable two or three
[01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:20.520]   or maybe four times a day.
[01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:23.820]   I think that a whole discussion about this is warranted
[01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:25.940]   and we'll have this discussion with Dr. Galpin
[01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:29.600]   at a future time of whether or not eating protein
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:33.020]   more frequently can enhance this myosin synthesis.
[01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:35.380]   But I think the simple takeaway from the literature
[01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:37.700]   that I was able to extract and from my discussion
[01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:39.960]   with him is eating two to four times a day,
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:42.980]   making sure you're getting sufficient amino acids
[01:55:42.980 --> 01:55:45.100]   in a way that's compatible with your ethics
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:46.660]   and with your nutritional regimen
[01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:50.460]   is going to support muscle repair, muscle growth,
[01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:53.520]   strength improvements, et cetera, just fine.
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:55.640]   There's one more thing that I'd like to cover,
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:58.160]   which is the relationship between particular kinds
[01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:00.660]   of exercise and our ability to think
[01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:03.480]   and perform cognitive functions.
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:06.660]   We all hear that exercise is so vital for our brain
[01:56:06.660 --> 01:56:08.620]   that it supports our brain health and our body health.
[01:56:08.620 --> 01:56:12.380]   And indeed that's true provided it's done correctly.
[01:56:12.380 --> 01:56:16.020]   However, many of us are familiar with the experience
[01:56:16.020 --> 01:56:18.220]   of going for a run or going for a swim
[01:56:18.220 --> 01:56:19.780]   or working out hard in the gym
[01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:21.620]   and then not being able to use our brain
[01:56:21.620 --> 01:56:24.240]   to be essentially useless for cognitive functions
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:26.220]   for the rest of the day.
[01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:29.420]   I discussed this with Dr. Galpin this morning
[01:56:29.420 --> 01:56:30.780]   and I learned something very interesting,
[01:56:30.780 --> 01:56:34.220]   which is that hard bouts of exercise of the sort
[01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:35.740]   where you're training near failure
[01:56:35.740 --> 01:56:39.580]   or you're generating focused muscular contractions
[01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:42.340]   for obsession that lasts anywhere from,
[01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:44.940]   I don't know, 30, 45 minutes, maybe 60 minutes
[01:56:44.940 --> 01:56:46.860]   or a long run where you're engaging
[01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:49.540]   in some interval training during that run.
[01:56:49.540 --> 01:56:52.440]   After exercise, there's a reduction
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:54.340]   in oxygenation of the brain.
[01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:56.140]   So there's actually a quite significant dip
[01:56:56.140 --> 01:56:58.600]   in the amount of oxygen that your neurons are getting
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:00.420]   and therefore your ability to think.
[01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:03.080]   So it's important that you control the intensity
[01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:05.040]   and the duration of your training sessions
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:07.600]   so that you're still able to do well in life
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:09.880]   and lean in to life the way you need to,
[01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:12.580]   because I'm guessing most of you are not in a position
[01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:14.340]   to just prioritize your physical training.
[01:57:14.340 --> 01:57:16.740]   You also need to use your minds.
[01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:19.060]   I'm certainly familiar with wanting to get exercise
[01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:20.460]   but also the requirement of needing
[01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:23.580]   to perform cognitive work throughout the day.
[01:57:23.580 --> 01:57:27.220]   It also turns out that you can leverage something
[01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:30.480]   interesting about exercise and nerve to muscle work
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:33.880]   in ways that can benefit cognitive function and focus.
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:36.280]   And it has to do with the way that your body
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:38.540]   and your nervous system predict bouts
[01:57:38.540 --> 01:57:40.320]   of intense focused effort.
[01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:42.640]   So let's say you're doing resistance training two
[01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:44.740]   or three times a week, maybe even four times a week,
[01:57:44.740 --> 01:57:47.240]   and you're doing it consistently at a given time.
[01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:51.800]   There are clocks, literally biological clocks
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:54.020]   within the liver and within the brain
[01:57:54.020 --> 01:57:57.920]   that learn to predict that focus and that intense work.
[01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:02.800]   If you are trying to get intense cognitive work done,
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:06.440]   you might try scheduling that cognitive work
[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:09.320]   on the days when you don't do physical training
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:11.600]   at the same time when you normally would do
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:14.700]   that intense focused physical training.
[01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:16.520]   Because the systems of the body
[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:18.120]   that generate acetylcholine release
[01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:19.560]   and other neuromodulators,
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:21.000]   the systems of the body and brain
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.680]   that generate focused effort,
[01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:26.200]   those are on this sort of clock mechanism
[01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:28.760]   in a way that you likely will find
[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:31.120]   that after just a week of training at regular times,
[01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:34.740]   you will be able to focus readily on other things
[01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:35.960]   when you're not training,
[01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:38.960]   provided you do it during the period of time of day
[01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:40.880]   when you normally would train.
[01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:43.400]   So this is kind of an indirect positive effect.
[01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:46.360]   You're harnessing the focus and the expectation of focus
[01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:48.920]   in your nervous system for that particular time of day.
[01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:50.720]   And of course, we'd be remiss
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:53.200]   if we didn't talk about time of day for training.
[01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:56.760]   Turns out that whether or not you train in the morning
[01:58:56.760 --> 01:58:59.420]   or in the afternoon doesn't really seem to matter
[01:58:59.420 --> 01:59:02.740]   for sake of things like hypertrophy and strength, et cetera.
[01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:04.160]   Everyone seems to have a time of day
[01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:05.980]   that they prefer to train.
[01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:07.780]   I've said before, and there are reasons
[01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:12.260]   based on body temperature rhythms and cortisol release
[01:59:12.260 --> 01:59:16.500]   that training 30 minutes, three hours or 11 hours
[01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:18.980]   after your normal waking time can be very beneficial
[01:59:18.980 --> 01:59:21.840]   and can provide a sort of predictability or regularity
[01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:25.280]   to when your body will be ready to train
[01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:27.800]   and best apt to train well.
[01:59:27.800 --> 01:59:30.080]   There is some evidence that training in the afternoon
[01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:31.400]   is better for performance,
[01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:33.920]   whereas training for body composition changes
[01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:35.600]   and strength changes, et cetera,
[01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:37.120]   doesn't really matter when you train.
[01:59:37.120 --> 01:59:38.880]   So you also want to make it compatible with sleep,
[01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:39.960]   compatible with work.
[01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:42.560]   That really gets down into the weeds of optimization.
[01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:44.080]   But I think it's interesting to note
[01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:47.160]   that if you're going to train at a regular time,
[01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:50.220]   you can take the days when you don't train
[01:59:50.220 --> 01:59:52.880]   and use that to enhance your cognitive focus
[01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:55.340]   for things that have nothing to do with exercise.
[01:59:55.340 --> 01:59:57.500]   So this might be writing or reading or music or math,
[01:59:57.500 --> 01:59:58.720]   et cetera.
[01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:01.280]   Typically, I restrict these podcast episodes
[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:02.700]   to about 90 minutes,
[02:00:02.700 --> 02:00:04.620]   so-called ultradian cycle for learning.
[02:00:04.620 --> 02:00:06.240]   Today was a bit longer,
[02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:09.540]   and I admit that I tried to pack a lot into this.
[02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:12.860]   It is the last episode in this month on physical performance.
[02:00:12.860 --> 02:00:15.340]   I figured in this case, more is better,
[02:00:15.340 --> 02:00:18.180]   especially since everything is timestamped for you.
[02:00:18.180 --> 02:00:20.400]   You certainly don't have to watch it all at once,
[02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:22.440]   and you can come back to it over and over again
[02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:25.120]   into the precise locations in the episode that you like
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:26.640]   in order to take notes
[02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:29.220]   or extract the information that you need.
[02:00:29.220 --> 02:00:32.760]   I'd like to point you to Dr. Andy Galpin's page.
[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:36.100]   I highly recommend looking into the work that he's doing
[02:00:36.100 --> 02:00:37.680]   if you want more details.
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:40.280]   He's very, very skilled, excellent communicator.
[02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:41.440]   He's superb at what he does.
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:42.280]   He's a professor.
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:43.280]   He works with athletes.
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:44.960]   He works with typical folks
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:47.320]   in the exercise and muscle physiology world.
[02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:49.580]   Brad Schoenfield's work, I also have a lot of respect for.
[02:00:49.580 --> 02:00:50.420]   I've never met him.
[02:00:50.420 --> 02:00:51.240]   I don't know him.
[02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:52.520]   There's no paid endorsement here.
[02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:55.240]   They're not sponsors or related to the podcast in any way.
[02:00:55.240 --> 02:00:57.780]   I just think the work is of very high quality,
[02:00:57.780 --> 02:00:59.240]   and they are both on the academic side
[02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:00.360]   and the practical side,
[02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:02.740]   and of course, there are other people out there
[02:01:02.740 --> 02:01:04.960]   doing fabulous work in this area as well.
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:07.380]   If you like this podcast
[02:01:07.380 --> 02:01:08.860]   and you're benefiting from the information
[02:01:08.860 --> 02:01:11.060]   that you're learning and you want to support us,
[02:01:11.060 --> 02:01:13.180]   the simplest and most straightforward way to do that
[02:01:13.180 --> 02:01:16.020]   is a zero-cost way, which is subscribe to,
[02:01:16.020 --> 02:01:18.880]   excuse me, subscribe to the podcast on YouTube,
[02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:20.680]   click the subscribe button,
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:23.820]   and to subscribe on Apple and Spotify as well.
[02:01:23.820 --> 02:01:24.780]   That really helps us.
[02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:26.720]   It helps us get the message about the podcast out
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:28.320]   more broadly generally,
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:30.920]   and it ensures that you don't miss any episodes.
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:34.060]   We release episodes every Monday, but starting soon
[02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:35.320]   and from time to time,
[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:37.740]   we release shorter episodes in between.
[02:01:37.740 --> 02:01:40.300]   So you're sure to hear about those episodes.
[02:01:40.300 --> 02:01:42.360]   In addition, check out the sponsors that we mentioned
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:44.340]   at the beginning of the podcast.
[02:01:44.340 --> 02:01:45.860]   If you like, and if you're able to,
[02:01:45.860 --> 02:01:47.500]   supporting us through those sponsors
[02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:49.460]   is a terrific way to support our production staff
[02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:51.400]   and the podcast generally.
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:53.140]   A zero-cost way to support the podcast
[02:01:53.140 --> 02:01:55.020]   is to tell your friends, tell your neighbors,
[02:01:55.020 --> 02:01:56.780]   tell anyone that you think might benefit
[02:01:56.780 --> 02:01:57.800]   from the information.
[02:01:57.800 --> 02:01:59.860]   The way this podcast is set up,
[02:01:59.860 --> 02:02:03.500]   the information is batched into four or five episodes,
[02:02:03.500 --> 02:02:06.060]   all centered around a given theme or topic,
[02:02:06.060 --> 02:02:07.840]   like hormones, like sleep.
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:09.480]   So the episodes on sleep, for instance,
[02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:11.940]   that were way back in January,
[02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:13.420]   what seems like way back,
[02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:16.460]   are still every bit as relevant today as they were
[02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:19.560]   back in January for somebody that has challenges with sleep
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:21.700]   and wants to understand sleep and get better at sleep
[02:02:21.700 --> 02:02:22.980]   or wants to understand their dreams
[02:02:22.980 --> 02:02:25.140]   or how to use sleep and dreaming
[02:02:25.140 --> 02:02:27.920]   to leverage neuroplasticity and learning.
[02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:30.180]   So if you pass information along about the podcast,
[02:02:30.180 --> 02:02:31.020]   that's great.
[02:02:31.020 --> 02:02:31.920]   We also have a Patreon.
[02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:35.300]   You can go to patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
[02:02:35.300 --> 02:02:36.840]   There, you can support the podcast
[02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:38.780]   at any level that you like.
[02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:41.880]   And as always, please put your questions
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:44.780]   about the podcast episodes and suggestions
[02:02:44.780 --> 02:02:46.860]   for future episodes in the comment section.
[02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:49.520]   I really do read through all those comments.
[02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:51.520]   It takes me some time, but I do read through those.
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:53.780]   I reply to as many of them as I can,
[02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:54.620]   but I do read them
[02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:56.940]   and they're a great way for us to get feedback.
[02:02:56.940 --> 02:02:59.000]   On Apple, you can give us a five-star review
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:00.680]   if you think we deserve that.
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:02.900]   And if you want to do all these things, you're welcome to.
[02:03:02.900 --> 02:03:05.260]   If you want to do just one of them, we understand.
[02:03:05.260 --> 02:03:06.420]   And if you do none of them,
[02:03:06.420 --> 02:03:08.060]   we still appreciate that you come here
[02:03:08.060 --> 02:03:10.020]   to digest the information about science
[02:03:10.020 --> 02:03:11.580]   and science-related tools.
[02:03:11.580 --> 02:03:15.020]   In today's episode, I mentioned various supplements,
[02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:19.520]   various compounds that if you deem it right and safe for you
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:21.700]   can benefit athletic performance
[02:03:21.700 --> 02:03:24.740]   and muscle physiology, et cetera.
[02:03:24.740 --> 02:03:27.520]   We've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:29.500]   because Thorne supplements, we believe,
[02:03:29.500 --> 02:03:32.620]   are of the highest possible stringency in quality.
[02:03:32.620 --> 02:03:35.020]   What you see on the bottle is what's in the bottle,
[02:03:35.020 --> 02:03:37.240]   and the quality of ingredients that they include
[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:39.820]   are excellent, so much so that they partnered
[02:03:39.820 --> 02:03:42.420]   with the Mayo Clinic and all the major sports teams.
[02:03:42.420 --> 02:03:45.260]   If you go to Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[02:03:45.260 --> 02:03:50.260]   .com/u/huberman, you can see all the supplements that I take
[02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:53.140]   and you can get 20% off any of those supplements,
[02:03:53.140 --> 02:03:56.340]   as well as 20% off any of the other supplements
[02:03:56.340 --> 02:03:57.540]   that Thorne sells.
[02:03:57.540 --> 02:04:02.540]   So if you go to thorne.com/u/huberman,
[02:04:02.540 --> 02:04:04.400]   any of those supplements listed there,
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:05.860]   and then if you navigate through their site
[02:04:05.860 --> 02:04:07.340]   and you find something else that you like,
[02:04:07.340 --> 02:04:09.360]   will be 20% off at checkout.
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:10.320]   Last but not least,
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:12.540]   I want to thank you for your time and attention today,
[02:04:12.540 --> 02:04:15.440]   and as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:18.020]   [upbeat music]
[02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:20.080]   you
