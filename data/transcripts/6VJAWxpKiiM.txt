[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Alright, we got a question here from Jules.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Jules says, "My favorite nugget of wisdom from your book was something to the effect of
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   if you begin craving distraction, the next 30 minutes of resistance can become a training session of concentration calisthenics.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   I love this idea of strengthening your power to resist. What more can you tell us about this training?
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Do you have a few stories from people who view the moment of resistance as training and how it slowly developed?"
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   So Jules, the relevant piece of advice here comes from deep work, and it's where I recommend that you embrace boredom.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   And here is the whole argument. By embracing boredom, I mean expose yourself to boredom on a regular basis.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   So at least once or twice a day, have a period in which your mind is craving novel stimuli and you do not give it to it.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   It wants to look at your phone and you don't.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   I do not mean embrace boredom in the sense of think of boredom as an unalloyed good, something that's going to generate lots of good things.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   We should be bored. Bored is a good state. Boredom feels bad and we should take that seriously.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Our body makes things feel really bad if there's a real reason it wants it to feel bad.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   So I don't think we should be bored all the time.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   The reason why I think you should be periodically, temporarily bored, however, is that it breaks the Pavlovian connection that so many of us have developed between boredom and distraction.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   If at the slightest hint of boredom, you always take out your phone and relieve it, your brain learns boredom means shiny treat.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Boredom means shiny treat.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   So then what happens when you want to do something that's cognitively demanding, you want to focus deeply to write a chapter of a book or come up with a new strategy for your business, your brain will say this is boring because there's no novel stimuli.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   We're just thinking about the same thing again and again.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Where's our shiny treat?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   And it won't tolerate it.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   It won't tolerate it. Your brain will go on strike and say, give me a phone.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Come on, we don't do this.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And then you can't actually produce things of value with your brain.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   So if on the other hand, on a semi-regular basis, you expose yourself to boredom, your brain gets comfortable with that option.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And when it comes time to think deeply about something and you're lacking novel stimuli, your brain is not going to go on strike.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   It's like, okay, this is one of those times where we don't get the stimuli.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I get it. Okay, great.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Let's go back to writing this chapter and thinking through this strategy.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   So, yeah, it is like training.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Your brain hates it.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   You want to get it to the point where your brain hates it less.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   That is going to give you a lot more flexibility to do things of real value with that brain.
