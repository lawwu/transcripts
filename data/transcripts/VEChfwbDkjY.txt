[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   [Music]
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.560]   I love strong women.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.120]   That's a classic Piper quote from T4G 2008 in a panel discussion, and it was
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.920]   not the only famous Piper quote from the conference either.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.040]   In your message there you said, "Bethlehem is a church
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.560]   teeming with strong women," and something about polygamy or something, I forget all
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.200]   the details now. Okay, so explain this, Pastor John,
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.720]   because strength is often considered to be a masculine
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.400]   trait. Of course, the Proverbs 31 woman has strong arms, verse 17. So how would
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.240]   you define strong feminine womanhood?
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.080]   Yes, good question, and if I were a polygamist,
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.320]   that's the kind of woman I'd want, or the kind of women I'd want. I've got one,
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.080]   she's great, she's strong, and she's... I don't want any more. She's just perfect.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.240]   Now here's what I mean, and I really do mean it. I feel very strong,
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.240]   strongly, about the strength of women. In Proverbs 31, it's not just her
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.360]   arms that are strong. Verse 25, "Strength
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.440]   and dignity are her clothing. She laughs at the time to come." That's got to be one
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.280]   of my favorite verses in all the Bible. A woman laughing at the time to come is
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.440]   not a woman who is looking at her biceps and getting
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.280]   encouragement. She's looking at her God and getting
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.440]   encouragement, because the time to come is a time of
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.840]   trouble. It's a time of unknown. Her biceps are not going to help her,
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.680]   you know, she may be carrying kindling or carrying the pots or doing whatever they
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.000]   did in that culture, but she knows that if the the Amorites
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.640]   sweep across, or if a flood comes,
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:56.800]   or if a horrible plague comes, it's only her great God laid hold on by
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.880]   faith and becoming strong in Him that's going to make the difference.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.920]   In the New Testament, the text that says that
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.000]   so powerfully for me, and is one of my favorite ones, if I were going to preach
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.280]   on the strong woman in a conference, I'd go
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.120]   to 1 Peter 3, where it says that this
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.960]   woman who's got this unbelieving husband, who wants
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.320]   so much, and rightly so, for her husband to be converted,
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.720]   and Peter's trying to help her know how she might be used of God to bring that
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.240]   about, and he talks about the imperishable
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.960]   beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit. Now if you read
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.120]   those phrases, the beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit,
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.800]   and you didn't know better, you might start to think weak,
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.000]   especially since in verse 7 she's called the weaker vessel. I don't think
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.200]   weaker vessel in any way implies spiritually weak, or mentally weak, or
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.040]   psychologically weak. It's talking about we have
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.240]   different teams for NBA men and basketball for women.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.280]   Right across the board, everybody recognizes
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.880]   that there are physical traits about men and women that put men in a category
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.880]   that shouldn't compete with women. But here
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.000]   in chapter 3, verse 5 or so, the strength of that gentle
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.920]   and quiet spirit is described this way, "Holy women who hoped in
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:33.760]   God used to adorn themselves that way, and you are her children,
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.800]   you women, if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening."
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.400]   That takes you back to laughing at the future, right? You got the woman in
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.080]   Proverbs who's laughing at the time to come, and here in
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.120]   verse 6 of 1 Peter 3, you've got the woman who is
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.240]   not fearing anything that is frightening. Now that is
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.280]   what I mean by a strong woman. I mean a woman who can lose a child,
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.920]   lose a husband, lose her health, face a family crisis,
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.120]   see the world becoming anti-christian all around her, and
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.560]   wonder about raising children in this world.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.320]   Women who go to a dangerous place on the mission field, women who return
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.600]   good for evil over and over again, women who get up a thousand times with a
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.240]   sick or disabled child at night, all of it in the strength that God
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.960]   supplies because God is her hope, God is her rock.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.320]   That's what I mean. And frankly, I should make clear, Tony,
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.200]   you know this, there's a difference between a strong
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.040]   woman, strong in her womanhood, and a woman who's trying to be a man,
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.360]   and thus trying to be strong. And the movies, I hardly go to any movies
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.400]   because of all kinds of reasons, but I see enough clips on the internet
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.760]   and it looks to me like women are constantly being portrayed,
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.200]   not as strong women, but as imitation men.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.960]   And it's absolutely hopeless. They're killing as many as men,
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.800]   they're fighting, they're kicking as many as men, they're punching
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.960]   and doing everything to show that there is no difference in that kind of
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.680]   strength. Frankly, I think that's hopeless for
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.160]   women. It's going to backfire in the long run.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.000]   They do not want to tango. A wife and a husband don't want to get into a
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.960]   sparring match. It should never, ever, ever come to that. So a truly strong woman
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.360]   is not a desperate want-to-be-a-man woman. She is a woman who is assured of her
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.640]   feminine identity in such a deep and powerful
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.000]   way that she knows she's a man's equal in the kingdom of God. She knows she's a
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.520]   man's equal in the sight of God. She knows she's a man's equal in the
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.560]   inheritance of joy, and she is poised and free
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.440]   to affirm the manhood of the men around her and come alongside them
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.640]   and help them in every way they can in their unique
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:12.000]   calling so that the dance and the rhythm and the choreography of male and female
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.280]   becomes a beautiful partnership. Beautiful picture.

[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.600]   listening, here's that clip from his T4G 2008 message.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.720]   Where is the joab today? Where are the women?
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.480]   The single women and the married women and the pastor's
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.640]   wives who say with Esther when Mordecai came to her and said, "You gotta do this
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:54.720]   because your people are perishing." And she says,
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:01.200]   "Tell them to fast and I will go into the king, though it is against the law.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.720]   And if I perish, I perish." Where are those women?
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.680]   Our church is crawling with them. I love them.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.200]   I'd like to marry all of them.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:20.320]   I'm too old.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:29.200]   And I'm married. And I married one of them.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.160]   you
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:42.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
