[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:13.120]   the Gospel according to St. Luke in the first chapter, verses 51, 52 and 53.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:20.440]   Verses 51 to 53 in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:27.200]   He hath showed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:34.120]   their hearts; he hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.600]   degree.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.720]   He hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he hath sent empty away.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.040]   Now these words come, as you will recall, in what is commonly known as the Magnificat.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.240]   These words uttered by Mary, to whom was given the privilege of bearing the Son of God in
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:04.480]   the flesh, after she had heard the salutation addressed to her by her cousin Elizabeth,
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.800]   the mother of John the Baptist.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.200]   And I call your attention to these particular words, this particular section in Mary's
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:23.160]   great statement, in this Magnificat, because I want to try to show you that it helps us
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:31.320]   to see and to realize what are, after all, some of the central principles in connection
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:39.040]   with this Gospel of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.120]   Now the kind of person whom I find it very difficult to understand at all is the person
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:57.560]   who doesn't believe in the devil, in the prince of the power of the earth, in the controller
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.640]   of the forces of evil and of sin.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.800]   I say I find it difficult to understand such a person were it merely for this reason, that
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:21.280]   his activity is so obvious, his working surely should be quite self-evident to everybody.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.480]   And there is no point, perhaps, that during the whole of the year there is no aspect of
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.680]   the Christian Gospel in which one sees so clearly the working, the efforts, and the
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.680]   evil results of such efforts on the part of the devil as in connection with this season
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:51.360]   of Advent, this time of Christmas, when the Church throughout the world thinks in particular
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:59.120]   of the coming of the Son of God into this world, of the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.920]   in Bethlehem.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.560]   Because is it not obvious to us that the real meaning of this great event, this momentous,
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.280]   this central event in many ways in the whole history of the human race, is it not obvious,
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.320]   I say, that the real meaning of this is so largely obscured?
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.760]   Men think of it in one of two main ways.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.520]   We see it already this year, we shall see more of it during these next days, it happens
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.840]   year after year.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.360]   Some evaporate this great event into just some vague general feeling of goodwill, good
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:49.680]   cheer, happiness, an occasion for drink, and a spirit of friendliness.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.240]   That I suppose, as regards the world in general, is the main notion and idea concerning the
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.840]   meaning of Christmas.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.960]   It's just that and no more.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:11.280]   But then there are others, and this is a large group also, who seem to think that the central
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:21.360]   purpose of this event is just to exhort men and women to do something, to put into operation
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.880]   this spirit of goodwill.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.640]   They regard it primarily as an occasion when one can be talking about war and peace, and
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:37.440]   one makes use of this in order to plead with people to strive, to put an end to war, to
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.160]   abolish armaments, and to get the nations to be friendly, and so on.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.160]   Now there is no question at all, but that looking at the position in the main, one is
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:55.520]   entitled to say that the prevailing opinion is divided more or less into those two groups.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.000]   It's just the one or the other of those two.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.760]   Well, I say I'm calling your attention to this tremendous statement here in the Magnificat
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.000]   in order that we may see together this evening how utterly and completely false all that
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   is.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.760]   If ever there was a subject which needed thought primarily, it is this whole question of the
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.760]   birth of the Son of God.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:26.440]   That is why I preach this evening, and do not have a carol service.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.120]   You must think before you sing, otherwise your singing is going to be of no value.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.640]   This is an occasion demanding sober, serious, vital thinking.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.320]   There is no season of the year, I say, that the devil would so rob us of in the way that
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.120]   I've indicated of this particular season in connection with the birth of our blessed
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.120]   Lord.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.320]   Very well, then, let us consider what we are told here about these fundamental principles
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.380]   concerning the nature of the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.960]   What is the real message of Christmas?
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.160]   The first thing that stands out, obviously, is this.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.840]   It is good news.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.760]   It is meant to be a proclamation.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.320]   Everything about it suggests that.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.620]   Don't you remember the beginnings?
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.720]   If you go home tonight and read the whole of this first chapter of the gospel according
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.680]   to St. Luke, you'll find that from the beginning it was like that.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.080]   There is Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist, doing his duty, taking his turn,
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.600]   as it were, according to the course of the priests, doing his ordinary duty, anticipating
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.680]   and expecting nothing.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.800]   Suddenly an angel appears to him.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.500]   And the angel doesn't ask him so much to do something as to make an announcement to
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.040]   him, telling him what God is going to do.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.560]   Elizabeth, his wife, who had been barren, and they'd agreed that they'd never have
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.320]   any children, the announcement is she's going to bear a son, a child, who's going
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.000]   to be the forerunner of the Messiah who is about to come.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.240]   That's how it begins.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.760]   And then in the case of Mary you get exactly the same thing.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:13.840]   Here is this simple maiden, obviously anticipating nothing.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.200]   Suddenly the archangel Gabriel appears to her, begins to address her and says, "Hail
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.520]   thou that art blessed!"
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.600]   It's an announcement.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.680]   And so it continues.
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:31.000]   And Mary makes it perfectly clear in her song, even as Elizabeth has already done, that she
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.440]   grasps this.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.320]   The gospel, my dear friends, is good news.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.360]   It can't be, therefore, primarily an exhortation.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.880]   It isn't some vague nebulous spirit.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.900]   It's a mighty proclamation.
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:52.880]   You must think of this in terms of a town crier, in terms of an announcement made upon
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.320]   the wireless or anywhere else.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.920]   That's the way to approach it.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.440]   But the world isn't approaching it like that.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.440]   It's taking it, I say, at the instigation of the devil and twisting it into something
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.440]   that belongs to its own philosophy.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.800]   And it's a denial of this.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.280]   You see, you can look at the Bible like this, if you like, for me to put it in the modern
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.760]   form.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:23.840]   You know how from time to time when something really remarkable is going to be announced,
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.040]   preliminary intimations are given, that at such and such an hour a great statement is
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.020]   going to be made, an announcement is going to be made.
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.920]   We had it especially during the war.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.920]   It still happens in a sense.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:39.280]   Hours before the thing happens, we are told, "Listen, at such and such a time you'll hear
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.920]   a most marvellous thing."
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.800]   And we're all expectant and waiting.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.360]   Then comes the announcement.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.880]   Now, that's the sort of thing, you know, we've got in the New Testament.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.680]   In the Old Testament you've got the preliminary announcements.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.600]   That's the prophets.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.000]   They began to say a long way back, "Look here, something's going to happen.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   God's going to do something.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.520]   A proclamation, an announcement's going to be made."
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.800]   And everybody was waiting.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.320]   Oh, the years had passed, many had forgotten.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.080]   But at last it came.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:17.240]   Good news, proclamation, announcement, something that leads to rejoicing.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:23.000]   Now here I say is the thing that stands out on the very surface of these preliminary portions
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.480]   in these Gospels.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:32.160]   The second thing I would make as a point, which should be surely self-evident, is this,
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.000]   that it is something entirely of God.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.200]   It's an announcement of what God is doing, is going to do.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.240]   An announcement of what God has done.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.480]   That's the essence of it all.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.240]   It stands out in this magnificat.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.760]   God has done this.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.720]   God is going to manifest his power.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.040]   That's what Christmas is about.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.440]   Not what men are going to do, not what men should do.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.200]   No, no, what God has done.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.840]   We are asked to stand back and to look and listen.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.920]   I say everything in these early chapters should make us see that.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.600]   Look at those shepherds about whom we've been singing.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.400]   There they were in the field at night watching their flocks.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.800]   They'd done the same thing hundreds, thousands of times before.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.800]   They were expecting nothing at all.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:28.720]   Suddenly they hear this singing, this announcement, and they're arrested, and they look up.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.760]   That's how Christmas comes.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.240]   You see, God has done something.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.280]   Indeed, it's all of God.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:43.680]   The gospel is a great record, I say, of God's mighty activity.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.440]   It is the showing forth of his power.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:53.760]   As Zacharias gives it subsequently so perfectly, the essence of the message is this.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.160]   God hath visited and redeemed his people.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:04.720]   Now, if we don't start with our thinking about Christmas in those terms, we are already
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.720]   wrong.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.720]   We've gone astray.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.960]   You see, this is something that comes to us and should make us stand and look and lift
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.520]   up our heads and say, "Well, now then, we're listening.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.520]   What has God done?"
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.520]   That's the thing.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.520]   God has done something.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:28.480]   God's action, a manifestation of the power of the right hand of God's power.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:39.000]   And indeed, I want to emphasize the fact that it is entirely of God, exclusively of God.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.800]   In other words, let me put it to you like this once more.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:50.120]   The gospel is not in the first instance a call upon us to do anything at all.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:55.000]   That is where this travesty of the gospel comes in.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.080]   As if the whole message of Christmas was this appeal to us to say, "Now then, be at your
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.760]   best during this season.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.040]   Let's make use of this season.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:08.520]   Now, can't you conspire together and act together and try and get rid of war, bring in peace?"
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.680]   As if it were something primarily political, something we are going to do, a spirit that
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:18.440]   we are going to put into operation and into manifestation.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.360]   But my dear friend, it isn't that at all.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.360]   What is it?
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.400]   It is this.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:28.040]   It is an announcement of one of the wonderful works of God.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.600]   You know, the whole Bible is a record of the activity of God.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.920]   God creating, God coming down to men after he'd fallen nation, God giving it kings, God
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.240]   sending prophets.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:44.200]   And when the fullness of the times was come, God sending forth his own son, made of a woman
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.560]   made under the law.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.960]   The wonderful works of God.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:55.000]   I protest in the name of the Bible, in the name of God, at this twisting, this perverting
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.640]   of the gospel into something which is an appeal to us to do something primarily.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.400]   It isn't that.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:10.160]   It is a proclamation and an announcement of what God has done in the person of his only
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.160]   begotten son.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:16.960]   Now, this becomes particularly clear and evident, I would have thought, in the words that are
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:25.360]   used here by Mary and to which I am calling attention, in this way.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.680]   That this is not only God's action, but it is a complete reversal of everything that
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.160]   men have ever thought or still think.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:39.000]   Not only is this not a record of what men have done or are supposed to do, it is the
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.040]   exact opposite of all men's thinking.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.640]   It cuts right across it.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.280]   It turns it upside down.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:54.080]   And that is the thing which I want to unfold to you now.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.040]   The most surprising thing that's ever happened in this world is the coming of the Son of
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.960]   God into it.
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:04.520]   The most revolutionary thing in the world tonight is the Christian gospel.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.520]   Why?
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:10.280]   Well, because it is the exact opposite, almost, of anything that you and I would ever have
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.600]   imagined or thought of.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.160]   Let me show you what I mean.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.080]   Look at it like this in the first place.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.640]   Look at the way in which God has done this thing.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.360]   That's what we are reminded of so forcibly in this particular section we are looking
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.640]   at.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:37.200]   When God comes to take the action that is to save mankind, how does he do it?
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:43.640]   Who would ever have anticipated or imagined that he would do it by the birth of a helpless
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.640]   babe?
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.800]   Yet that's exactly how he did it.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:58.240]   Who would have thought that when this babe was to be born, if that was the way, that
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:07.360]   the woman selected would be some unknown entity, some ordinary handmaiden, poor?
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.360]   You and I wouldn't do it like that, would we?
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.940]   The world wouldn't do it like that.
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.160]   We wouldn't start by doing it through a babe.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:23.200]   We'd have somebody suddenly coming out of heaven, great apparition, great display.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:29.000]   We are fond of drama, we are fond of propaganda, we are fond of doing things in a big way,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.880]   a blowing of trumpets, some great announcement.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.440]   That's our way, it wasn't God's way.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.040]   He did it like this.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:40.440]   And of course if we had decided that it should happen through a babe like this, well at least
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.800]   we'd have chosen a queen.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.400]   Some great person must be the mother.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.800]   When the Son of God comes into the world, why it must be from the most dignified to
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:56.040]   the most glorious person we can find anywhere in the world.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:01.000]   But it's a lowly handmaiden that nobody had ever heard of.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.360]   Was the one chosen by God?
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:09.600]   You see this is something that cuts across all our ideas and all our notions.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.400]   And then you notice the other thing.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.040]   There are dozens of these points, I'm simply briefly glancing at one or two of them in
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.040]   passing this evening.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.880]   And look where he was born.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.880]   Where do you think the Son of God is going to be born when he comes into this world?
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:30.680]   Well I suppose it's in the most marvelous, most fabulous palace that's ever been built,
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:34.080]   ever conceived of, costing millions, billions of pounds.
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:40.120]   All of gold and all of marble, everything that's wonderful.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:45.560]   Well I mustn't waste your time.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:55.600]   He was born in a stable with the cattle by his side and the straw and the manger.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.400]   My dear friends, this is Christmas.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.240]   Get rid of your human notions.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.360]   Christmas isn't the acme of human thinking.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.040]   Christmas isn't an extension of all men propose us to do.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.880]   It's the exact opposite of it all.
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.680]   It's God.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:19.120]   And the thing that is emphasized is the antithesis, the surprise, the amazement of it all.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:24.080]   But come let us look at it more in detail.
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:29.960]   Notice the way in which God's action for the salvation of men condemns and indeed demolishes
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:37.800]   all in which man trusts or has ever trusted.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.720]   Did you notice that?
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.960]   He hath showed strength with his arm.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.960]   How?
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.960]   Well he hath scattered.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.040]   It's a very strong word there.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.120]   It means that he has scattered completely until nothing's left.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:56.440]   He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.480]   He hath put down the mighty.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:06.360]   He hath the rich, he hath sent empty away.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.680]   Isn't it almost incredible that anybody could misread this gospel?
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:15.720]   It is as I'm saying a complete reversal of everything men have ever thought or said or
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.720]   proposed.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.000]   I show you that.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.840]   I say by the way in which it condemns, it demolishes, it scatters everything in which
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.280]   man by nature trusts.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.280]   What are these?
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:33.520]   Well you notice the first is his own wisdom.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:38.960]   It's important we should read that second half of verse 51 correctly.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.960]   He hath scattered.
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.960]   Who?
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:47.960]   Well those who are proud in the imagination of their hearts.
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:55.520]   And that means of course this, those who are haughty with respect to the reasoning or the
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.240]   understanding power of their hearts.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:05.120]   The proud, the haughty are those, and this is the meaning of the word that is used, are
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.360]   those who put themselves above others.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:14.280]   You know, the brainy people, the experts.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:20.160]   The gospel of Jesus Christ you see is always contemporary.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.040]   It was contemporary and up to date nearly two thousand years ago.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.160]   When it first came it is equally contemporary tonight.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.520]   There were haughty, proud people in the imagination of their hearts then.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.760]   We've still got them.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:36.520]   The picture is of those who are very proud of their ability and their knowledge, their
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:41.360]   understanding, their brains, their capacity to think.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:48.680]   The proud or the haughty in the understanding of their hearts.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:54.080]   Here we are referred to people who are proud of their intellect, proud of their understanding,
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.680]   proud of their knowledge.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.200]   The world has always had many such people.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:05.840]   You'll find many such described in your Old Testament and at the time when the Lord Jesus
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.360]   Christ came into the world, the world was even then full of them.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.360]   Who are they?
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.920]   Well, primarily the great Greek philosophers.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:18.000]   There had been a mighty succession of them.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:27.480]   Plato, Socrates, Aristotle and their schools, thinking, genius at its very highest and ecumeny,
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:32.280]   trying to understand life and proud of it, proud of their learning, proud of their knowledge,
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:37.360]   proud of their understanding.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:41.160]   And what we are told here out of the mouth of Mary about the gospel and its effect is
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:48.840]   this, that the coming of the Son of God into the world scattered, dismisses them, demolishes
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:53.280]   them and does so completely.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.640]   How does he do so?
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:59.200]   Well fortunately we have many answers to the questions supplied by the New Testament itself.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.280]   Our Lord himself supplies one notable answer.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:06.960]   You'll find it at the end of the eleventh chapter of the gospel according to Saint Matthew.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.560]   The Lord one day uttered these words to his father.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:19.280]   He said, "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:27.280]   things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:33.280]   Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight."
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.280]   What does he mean?
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:40.360]   He says, "Well, it's obvious that the wise and prudent, the philosophers, the teachers,
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.920]   the great men, the great intellects are confounded by me.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.360]   They're confused by me.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.160]   They're questioning me, trying to catch me, trying to trap me.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.560]   They're not believing in me.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.200]   They're remaining where they were.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:59.000]   And it's the babes, the ignoramuses, as it were, are crowding into the kingdom.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.320]   They were made to look foolish.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:07.160]   It was hid from the wise and prudent.
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:12.480]   The great minds, the great brains were left where they were."
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.840]   But it doesn't even stop at that.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.040]   It goes further.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.200]   The apostle Paul has a very interesting commentary on this.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:26.840]   "Indeed, it's obvious, isn't it, that in this magnificat we have in a kind of natural
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:32.040]   what is the very essence of the gospel as worked out in greater detail by our Lord himself
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.400]   and by his servant the apostle Paul."
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.760]   Paul puts it like this.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.080]   "The world by wisdom knew not God.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:44.000]   And when the world by wisdom, by philosophy, by reason and understanding, failed to arrive
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.800]   at God, it pleased God by the foolishness of the thing preached to save such as believe."
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.880]   The Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.840]   Here they are.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.080]   These are the men who are seeking after wisdom.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.200]   The men were proud in the imagination of their hearts.
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.800]   The men were proud of their intellect, their knowledge, their science, their understanding.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:12.080]   These men who can give a rational explanation, they pit their minds against it all.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.680]   Well, what we are told is that the effect of the coming of the Son of God into the world
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:22.120]   scatters them, dismisses them, makes them look silly.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.320]   And you know it now.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.280]   And it's still doing so.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:32.080]   There has never perhaps been a time when the philosophers have been made to look quite
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:36.400]   so silly as they are today.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.400]   What do I mean?
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.280]   I mean this.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:45.120]   It is the philosophers and the scientists and others who have been teaching us for a
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:51.200]   hundred years and more that man is evolving and developing and adventuring and that by
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.200]   his own efforts he can make a perfect world.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:59.080]   And they believed it and they've been preaching it and driving it home to us.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.480]   And yet the whole world is making them look utterly ridiculous.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:06.800]   They're being scattered in the imaginations of their hearts.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:12.800]   Yes, you know, but there is something that scatters them much more than the contemporary
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.720]   history does.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:19.920]   And that is this message concerning Christmas.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:24.880]   And it does it like this.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:33.720]   This is the final proof of their failure to find God.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:38.240]   Do you listen to them sometimes on these programs?
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.160]   Brainstrust.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.160]   Any questions?
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:48.240]   Do you hear them talking their folly about immortality and about various other things?
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.240]   How foolish they seem.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.240]   They don't know, you see.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.240]   They have no knowledge.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.240]   They have no understanding.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:57.240]   They have been trying to understand the mystery and they can't, of course.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.900]   They fail completely.
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.820]   And they have their ideas about God but they're not satisfied.
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.000]   How can they be?
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.900]   How can they define God?
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:09.560]   How can a man with a finite mind encompass the eternal, the infinite, and the absolute?
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.640]   They're made to look silly, aren't they?
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.160]   Well that's exactly what Mary says.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:18.400]   He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.160]   The world by wisdom knew not God.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.120]   Don't misunderstand me.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.920]   I'm not here to denounce intellect.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.520]   I'm not here to denounce ability.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.360]   I'm not here even to denounce philosophy.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.560]   But what I am here to denounce is this.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.960]   Is pride of intellect.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.200]   Pride of knowledge.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.440]   Pride of understanding.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.760]   The attitude of the modern man who says, "I am sufficient and complete.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.640]   God," he says, "very well, put him on the table.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.640]   Let me examine him.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.440]   I'll tell you what I think about God."
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.280]   That's what I'm denouncing.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.920]   And that is what the coming of Christ spoils.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:50.920]   Makes it look idiotic.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.920]   Why?
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:57.800]   Well, with all its wisdom and ability and learning, he hasn't arrived at God.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.240]   He has failed completely.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:08.080]   They never get further than saying, "Perhaps, what if, perchance, it is possible."
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.240]   And no more.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.840]   The world by wisdom knew not God.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.520]   He exposes them.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:19.080]   But he doesn't stop at doing it like that, of course.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:27.840]   The proud in the imagination of their hearts are scattered in another way, and it's this.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:35.600]   When the true wisdom confronted them, they couldn't see it.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:40.480]   The apostle Paul, of course, is very eloquent on this.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.920]   This is where the intellectually proud have been made to look ridiculous.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:49.040]   They say they are men of wisdom, and when they see truth, they'll grasp it.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:53.800]   They like to call themselves "seekers after truth."
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:59.320]   My dear friend, if you call yourself a seeker after truth, you're denying the gospel.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.760]   Truth can never be found by you, nor by any other man.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:03.760]   Truth is revealed.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.520]   But here are the seekers after truth.
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.880]   They say, "We want nothing but truth.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:08.880]   Give us truth.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.880]   Show us truth.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.880]   Help us to arrive at truth.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.560]   It's all we want."
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:20.520]   Suddenly, truth stands before them in the person of a man, and they didn't recognize
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.400]   him.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:31.560]   The apostle Paul puts it like this, "Whom the princes of this world didn't know, for
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:36.280]   had they known him, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.040]   Monstrous, they said.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.080]   Son of God, a carpenter?
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.080]   Ridiculous.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.480]   Son of God, an ignoramus, an artisan?
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.480]   Impossible.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.560]   Wisdom must always be in a philosopher, must belong to the schools.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.400]   Who is this fellow?
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:55.280]   They ridiculed him.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:59.200]   The Jews require a sign.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.880]   The Greeks seek after wisdom.
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:12.760]   We preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness.
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:17.240]   And by saying that it was foolishness, they were displaying their own folly.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:20.920]   They were being scattered in the imagination of their hearts.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:29.480]   They didn't recognize truth when it was standing incarnate before their eyes.
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:35.840]   Though Mary is perfectly right, he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:43.640]   And as I have already anticipated, he does it supremely, of course, by the way in which
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.560]   God chose to do it.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:55.360]   When he chose to send wisdom to men, he sends it thus in the form of a babe and a carpenter,
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:03.080]   an ordinary man, as it were.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:10.880]   And so what the Greeks and the wisdom and the wise and the proud of intellect have been
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:21.440]   totally and utterly incapable of doing, God does it in this extraordinary manner.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:28.960]   And the wise and the proud are the laughingstock of the universe at this moment.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:35.560]   They are the people above all others who in their pride of intellect are rejecting God's
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:40.040]   wisdom, God's power, God's way of salvation.
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:45.360]   He does indeed scatter the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:50.720]   The second thing is that he puts down the mighty from their seats.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.720]   What does this mean?
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.480]   Well, of course, this is a great theme in the Bible.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:59.360]   You get a great deal of this in the Old Testament.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.920]   God is always doing this.
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:08.080]   He knows that the final sin in the heart of men is the sin of pride, proud of intellect,
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:12.120]   proud of position, proud of power, proud of status.
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:16.680]   And so you see, God is always fighting that and always demolishing it, always throwing
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.680]   it down.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:24.560]   Look at how he has done it in the whole case of the nation of the Jew.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:29.320]   There were the nations of the world, proud of their might and their prowess and their
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.320]   armies.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:35.320]   God made a nation for himself out of one man called Abram, and a very weak nation it was,
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:41.320]   and just a little country, Palestine, what a small bit of earth it is, this little nation
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:48.200]   amidst the mighty dynasties of Assyria and Babylon and Nineveh and all the rest of them.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:54.120]   You see, that's God's way, and then, of course, he's always ridiculing and bringing down these
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:31:00.300]   mighty through his own people.
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:04.640]   You see it typified to perfection in the great story about David and Goliath.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:12.800]   Here is the mighty, on their seats, the Goliath, the great power that is irresistible and is
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.680]   threatening to demolish the whole world.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:21.920]   And a stripling of a lead comes along, who hasn't a sword and who hasn't armor, he's
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:28.680]   only got a sling and five stones, and he just flings one of them, strikes the forehead,
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.600]   brings to earth, demolishes this mighty tyrant.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.760]   That's God's way of dealing with the world, you know.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:38.520]   That's what God has always been doing.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.320]   That's what he's doing in his son.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:44.720]   He doesn't send a great chieftain, a great prince, he sends a babe.
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.080]   And so it has continued.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.000]   Look at it in the case of a man like Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.240]   He'd conquered so much when he was so wealthy, he sets himself up as a god, tells people
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.080]   to worship him.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.520]   And you know what happened to him?
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:02.360]   You look at him in a few months, you'll find him like an ox, eating grass in a field.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:08.160]   His nail had grown like talons, and hair had covered his body, and the dew falls upon him.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.400]   A maniac, a raving maniac.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.400]   What's happening?
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:18.240]   Oh, God is putting down the mighty from their seats.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:25.360]   But he has done it finally in the supreme manner.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:39.440]   When the king of kings and the lord of lords came into this world, he came into a stable.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:43.880]   If you don't feel a sense of holy laughter within you, I don't see that you have a right
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.880]   to think that you're a Christian.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.680]   Thank God, this is gospel.
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.960]   This is salvation.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:54.440]   God, turning upside down, reversing everything we've ever thought, everything we've taken
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.440]   pride in.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.480]   The mighty, why he will pull them down from their seats.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.560]   He's been doing so.
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.400]   He's still doing so.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:06.400]   You let any man arise and say he's going to govern the whole world, he's going to be the
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:10.640]   god of this world, you needn't be afraid, he'll be put down.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.040]   Every dictator has gone down.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.800]   They'll all go down.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:18.800]   Finally the devil and all that belong to him will go down to the lake of fire and will
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.560]   be destroyed forever.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.120]   The son of God has come into the world to do that.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.800]   But then take the third thing.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:30.640]   The rich, I am told, he hath sent empty away.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:40.960]   Now this isn't to be taken in a material sense primarily, but in a moral sense.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:44.120]   What is the effect of the coming of the son of God into this world?
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:51.200]   It is to send the rich empty away.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.680]   That's the great story that I see in the four gospels.
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.080]   What are you talking about, says someone?
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.080]   Well, look at it in the rich young ruler.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:05.440]   Here's a rich man, rich in money, yes, but priding himself on his richness in morality.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:09.440]   All these have I kept from my youth upwards.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:17.840]   How rich he is in morals and in ethics and in righteousness.
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:23.540]   But you know when he stands before this son of God, this babe of Bethlehem who's now become
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:27.800]   a man and is beginning to teach at the age of thirty, when the rich young ruler who's
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:33.200]   done all this and kept the commandments of God and is full and overflowing with righteousness,
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:37.680]   he looks into the face of the son of God, he listens to his words, and what is the end
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:38.680]   of the story?
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:42.880]   He went away sorrowful.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:49.600]   He came with pride, he went away sorrowful.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.200]   His riches were made to look very tawdry.
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:55.240]   Oh, but he's only one of many instances.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:58.840]   You know, this was the whole trouble with the Pharisees, and that is why they hated
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:34:59.840]   our Lord.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.520]   That's why they finally conspired to crucify him and to kill him.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:07.120]   You know, the effect of the coming of the son of God upon the Pharisees was to send
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:10.760]   them empty away, and they were so rich.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.000]   What do you mean, says someone?
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.800]   I mean this, that when they listened to the preaching of the son of God, they could see
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.800]   their righteousness disappearing.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:26.440]   All they'd bursted of, all they'd gloated in, all they'd prided themselves on, their
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.880]   exceptional righteousness.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.040]   They had never committed adultery.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:34.320]   "Wait a minute," says the son of God, "have you ever looked on a woman to lust?
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.240]   If you have, you've committed adultery with her, in your heart."
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.240]   That's the thing that matters.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.200]   And their righteousness is gone.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.200]   They're all guilty.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.200]   They thought they were innocent.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.200]   They're not.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:48.840]   He takes them through point by point in the sermon on the mount.
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:52.360]   He shows to them the spiritual character of God's law.
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.920]   And these men who thought they'd kept the law of God to perfection find they're guilty
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:56.920]   at every point.
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.560]   And they hated him.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.560]   Why?
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.560]   He sent them away empty.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:01.560]   They thought they were rich.
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:10.280]   Oh, that is what he's always done.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:14.480]   Men are very satisfied with themselves and their own lives until they look into the face
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:19.000]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.960]   But the moment they look at him and listen to his interpretation of God's law, they begin
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:27.200]   to see this, that there is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.480]   A man says, "I'm a good fellow.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.480]   I've got my code.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.480]   I'm better than this man.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.480]   I'm much better than that man.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.480]   I do a lot of good.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:38.680]   I'm wonderful," as the Pharisee said it in the temple.
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:43.960]   And then he finds that God's law is that thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:49.240]   and all thy soul and all thy mind and all thy strength and thy neighbor as thyself.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.240]   And he hasn't started.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.240]   He's nowhere.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.480]   He listens to Christ saying, "Blessed are the poor in spirit."
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.840]   And he's full of pride.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:56.840]   He's damned already.
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.840]   He goes away empty.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:02.840]   "Blessed are the meek," and he's the opposite of meekness.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.040]   "Blessed are they that who hunger and thirst after righteousness."
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.960]   He's boasting of his righteousness.
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:11.440]   He's sent away empty.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:22.440]   Oh, this Son of God who always sends the rich empty away, rarely to know him and to understand
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.440]   his teaching brings a man to see this.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:28.400]   The whole world lieth guilty before God.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.800]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:34.840]   All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:41.280]   Only one of us, the best of us, our righteousness is but us filthy rags.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:49.480]   But see it supremely in the case of that great man, the apostle Paul, a Saul of Tarsus.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.040]   What a wonderful man he was.
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:59.720]   Israelite of the Israelites, Hebrew of the Hebrews of the tribe of Benjamin and so on,
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:04.480]   knowing the law better than most other people, yet he suddenly meets Christ and this is what
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.480]   he finds.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.960]   He says, "I counted all but done."
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:15.360]   The wealth he boasted of, the riches in which he gloated, it becomes manure, refuse, vile,
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.360]   it's hopeless.
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.360]   He's gone away empty.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.360]   He's nothing.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.360]   He's been stripped.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.360]   He's naked.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.360]   He walks away empty-handed.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:31.440]   "I was alive once," he says, "without the law, but when the commandment came, sin revived
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.440]   and I died."
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.040]   He's got nothing at all.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:39.400]   The riches sent empty away.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.160]   And so it is, I say, right through this gospel.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.160]   Mary's seen it.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.120]   She's had a glimpse, a flash of it.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.600]   He always does these things.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:52.680]   Can't you see that he denounces and destroys and demolishes everything that man bursts
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:53.680]   in?
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.960]   Man bursts of his intellect, his understanding.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:59.240]   He bursts of his power, his social status, his influence.
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:03.800]   He bursts of his righteousness, his morality, his ethics, his code.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:07.640]   And every one of them is utterly demolished by this Son of God.
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:11.640]   Mary saw it.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:17.480]   You see, this is the exact opposite of everything man thinks and bursts of.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:21.160]   Look at it when you see it in the people whom he blesses.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.320]   Who are those who are to be blessed?
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:28.840]   Well, the answer is the babes.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:33.480]   Them were of low degree.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:41.600]   You see your calling, brethren, says Paul to the Corinthians, "Thou that not many
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:46.320]   mighty, not many noble are called, but God hath chosen the weak things of the world to
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:52.440]   confound them that are mighty, base things, things that are not to bring to naught, things
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:59.000]   that are that no flesh should glory in his presence."
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   Who are the blessed?
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   Here they are.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.120]   Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.800]   Blessed are they who are poor of spirit.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.440]   Blessed are they that mourn.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.440]   Blessed are the meek.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.040]   These are the people, the nobodies.
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.240]   He blesses them.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.800]   The world doesn't look at it like that.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.800]   It's the great.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:18.800]   It's the influential.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.800]   It's the able.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:20.800]   It's the wonderful.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:27.440]   It's all God's acting, and God does it in entire reverse.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:35.560]   But notice finally the way in which he gives the blessing, and this is the special glory
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:40.240]   of this Christmas message.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:53.200]   The world by wisdom knew not God, but suddenly God sends his wisdom and his revelation.
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:41:01.360]   These things a man can't arrive at by searching, but God hath revealed them unto us by his
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.360]   spirit.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:10.000]   For the spirit searches all things, yea, the deep things of God.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.440]   We have the mind of Christ.
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:17.720]   We are made wise.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:23.400]   Here is a way whereby a man can know God, what Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, and all the
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:29.680]   succession of mighty secular philosophers have failed to find, is given as a free gift
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:34.680]   to the babes, those who admit that they cannot.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:42.280]   A man who believes on the Lord Jesus Christ as a knowledge of God, he has an understanding
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:49.440]   of life, an understanding of himself, which the ablest, wisest man in the world in a natural
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.720]   sense is entirely lacking in.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.240]   I invite you all most to listen to them.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:59.160]   I know of no preparation, better preparation for the preaching of the gospel, than to ask
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:03.360]   people to listen to Bertrand Russell and Julian Huxley and the rest.
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:08.600]   Ask them for an explanation of man and of life and of death and of God, and they've
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.200]   got nothing to tell you.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.120]   They don't know.
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.840]   They're bankrupt completely.
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:23.440]   The simplest and the most ignorant Christian has a knowledge and an understanding that
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:27.800]   is completely denied to such people.
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:32.320]   I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:38.960]   the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:44.000]   Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight, the people who are wisest in the
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.280]   world tonight are these simple Christian people.
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.040]   They're not afraid of tomorrow.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.960]   They're not afraid of death.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.720]   They know they're in the right relationship to God.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.160]   They're not surprised that the world is as it is.
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:58.640]   It's your great men who are surprised, but they say, "We can't understand this.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.560]   This is twentieth century, and we're more learned, and we're meeting one another, and
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:03.560]   we're having conflict."
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.840]   Why is the world, they don't understand it.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:06.840]   Why?
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:07.840]   Because they know nothing about sin.
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:08.840]   It's in them.
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.600]   They're full of it, but they don't understand it.
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:16.240]   They haven't the wisdom that God gives, the revelation that has come in Christ.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.960]   Secondly, look at the way in which he exalts us.
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:27.360]   He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and the other side, and exalted them of low
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.360]   degree.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:31.360]   What does it mean?
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:40.080]   Well, it means this, that it doesn't matter who you are nor what you are as a Christian.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:50.440]   If you are a Christian, you are a child of God.
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:51.440]   You're a son of God.
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:53.800]   You won't appear in the New Year's honors list.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.800]   They've never heard of you.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:44:00.760]   And the Times knows nothing about you, but thank God you're in the court circular of
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:01.760]   heaven.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:02.760]   Sons of God.
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:10.360]   Members of the heavenly royal family.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:15.160]   He hath made us, says John, kings and priests unto God.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:19.480]   Or if you prefer it, a kingdom of priests.
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:30.200]   Children of God, heirs of God, giant heirs with Christ, exalted us.
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:40.400]   And of the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:42.200]   You are not in any great man's will.
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:43.200]   It's all right.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.200]   You're a poor person.
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:45.200]   You're an ignoramus.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.200]   The world doesn't know of you.
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:52.080]   But you know, my friend, if you're a Christian, you're in God's will.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:55.880]   You're in the will of God.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.600]   And you are a giant heir with Christ.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.120]   And you're going to enter into that inheritance with him.
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:02.760]   You're going to reign with him.
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.040]   You're going to judge the world.
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:07.720]   You're going to judge angels with the Son of God.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.440]   Here's the exaltation.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:15.040]   He hath put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree.
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:18.120]   Blessed be the name of God.
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:24.880]   And lastly, what a phrase is this?
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:34.240]   He hath filled the hungry with good things.
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:38.360]   Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness.
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:39.360]   Why?
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:44.120]   Oh, they shall be filled.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.040]   The rich he hath sent empty away.
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.080]   We've seen that.
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:51.360]   But look at the opposite, the hungry.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:55.200]   The man who feels is a sinner vile.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.960]   The man who feels is a cad.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.720]   The man who can't understand himself.
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.360]   The man who feels is rotten.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:08.720]   The man who says unto himself, in me, that is to say in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:16.520]   The man who says, oh, wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.200]   this death?
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:23.640]   The man who says everything I do is wrong, it's tarnished, it's sinful, my best actions
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:29.200]   are ignoble, there's nothing right about me at all, I hate myself, I cannot deliver myself,
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:32.240]   what can be done with such a wretch as I am?
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.240]   What about him?
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:36.000]   He shall be filled with good things.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   What are they?
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   Well, righteousness.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.440]   He is hungering and thirsting after righteousness.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:50.280]   He is poor of spirit, he is mourning because of his sinfulness and the sins he has committed.
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:51.680]   He doesn't know what to do.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:56.720]   Blessed is such a man, says Christ, he shall be filled with what?
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:57.720]   With righteousness.
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:00.520]   What does it mean?
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:05.520]   It means this.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:12.160]   God sent his Son into this world in order that we might be made righteous.
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:15.040]   We can't make ourselves righteous.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.360]   The whole world had failed.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:22.040]   Man, as it were, in his blind manner, tries to seek it in a sense, but he cannot, he is
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:25.560]   wrong in his very notions, but suddenly he is awakened and convicted.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.880]   He wants it, suddenly he is given it.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.400]   It's all in Christ.
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:34.440]   Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believes it.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:38.720]   Now, I say this sounds incredible, that's why people don't believe it, but this is the
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:39.720]   gospel.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:44.960]   It means this, "Here am I, born in sin, shapen in iniquity, I have sinned myself, my nature
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:49.480]   is violent, rotten, I am a hopeless mass of perdition."
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:51.120]   What does the gospel tell me?
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:56.200]   That if I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, truly entrust myself to him, do you know what
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:57.200]   he tells me?
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:05.600]   He tells me this, "His righteousness is put upon me.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:11.600]   My sins are all blotted out, as if I'd never committed a single sin in my life.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:14.600]   God pronounces me to be righteous.
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:17.440]   He has put to my account the righteousness of Christ.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:22.320]   I'm a pauper, my books are empty, I've got nothing, not a farthing to pay, nothing to
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:28.680]   offer, my creditors are pressing, I'm damned, I'm doomed.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:33.720]   Truly the wealth of the Son of God is put into my account.
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:41.000]   He has filled, filled the hungry with good things."
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:46.300]   I mustn't keep you, my dear friends, but the message of Christmas is this, that whatever
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:50.820]   you are, you may have come into this service a pauper in rags, in a spiritual and in a
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:52.000]   moral sense.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.240]   The message is this, you know, that you can go out of this service tonight filled with
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:05.240]   good things, clothed with the righteousness of Christ, held with a sense of peace toward
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:08.040]   God, being justified by faith.
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:15.400]   We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, peace in your breast, no longer afraid
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:21.120]   of death, no longer afraid of the grave, no longer afraid of the judgment, filled with
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:25.920]   peace within and towards God.
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:41.520]   Contentment, content to let the world go by, to know no pain nor loss.
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:50.920]   My sinful self, my only shame, my glory, all the cross.
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:56.520]   In contentment of wonderful things, not forever striving at what you can't get, seeking what
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:50:00.560]   will never come to you, but a satisfaction.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:06.080]   Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:15.080]   also we have access into this grace wherein we stand God as Father, the eternal giver,
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:20.600]   to end to his largesse and his capacity to bless and more.
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:31.680]   We rejoice in hope of the glory of God, the hungry he hath filled with good things, fruit
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:43.000]   of the Spirit, his love, joy, peace, long-suffering, goodness, meekness, temperance, faith, filled
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   with rhythm.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.280]   "Oh," says Paul to the Ephesians, "I am praying for you that you may be filled with all the
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:54.520]   fullness of God, that the love of Christ may come into your hearts, that you may know its
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:59.400]   breadth and length and depth and height, and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge,
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:03.680]   that he may be filled with all the fullness of God."
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:05.120]   What a Christmas gift!
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:08.600]   That's what's offered.
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:14.360]   This gospel is not just an exhortation to you to join a peace society or to start organising
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:16.840]   for peace in industry, or here or there.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:17.840]   You may do that later.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.960]   But I say, have you started here?
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:22.920]   Are you filled?
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:25.120]   Are you filled with the knowledge of God?
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:27.400]   Are you filled with the righteousness of Christ?
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:29.000]   Have you got peace in your heart?
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.080]   Have you lost the fear of life and death and the grave and judgment and hell?
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.440]   Have you the joy of the Lord?
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:41.320]   Are you able to rejoice even in tribulations and in spite of circumstance and accident
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:42.320]   and chance?
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:54.480]   "He hath filled the hungry with good things related to the Father eternal, the giver of
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:52:00.320]   every good and every perfect gift, his children, his heirs."
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:06.160]   That, my dear friend, is the message of salvation.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.920]   That's the good news of the gospel.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:09.720]   Mary saw it in a flash.
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:10.720]   She spoke it.
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:11.720]   She uttered it.
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:12.720]   This is the gospel.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:16.280]   What God has done, what God is going to offer, this one that's going to be born out of me,
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:19.920]   I don't understand it, but he's going to be the benefactor of mankind.
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:20.920]   That's what he's going to give.
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:22.840]   He's going to reverse everything.
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:29.720]   He'll bring down the intellectually proud, the mighty men, the self-satisfied, the morally
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.120]   rich.
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:36.280]   But the common people are going to hear him gladly.
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:45.000]   He'll give us a wisdom and knowledge and an understanding that will baffle us to all eternity.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.880]   He will make us children of God and joint heirs with himself.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:56.160]   He will fill us even with himself.
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:01.320]   And finally, with God.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:05.600]   Beloved friends, beloved people, have you heard this message?
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:15.960]   Are you surprised now that the angel sang, that everybody sings, when they rarely know
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:25.920]   who he is and why he came into this world?
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:31.160]   Are you too wise for these things?
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:36.520]   If you are, you have nothing to look forward to except to be scattered.
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:42.280]   Are you too big, too great, to humble yourself?
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:45.200]   You'll be brought down.
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:51.400]   You'll lie on your deathbed in helplessness and hopelessness, in despair, realizing that
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:52.880]   you have nothing.
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:56.400]   Are you rich?
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:54:06.240]   The day will come when you'll realize that you're empty-handed and have nothing at all.
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.560]   Humble yourself.
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.720]   See your need.
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:23.760]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, the Babe of Bethlehem, the Christ of Calvary, the glorious
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:31.640]   one that rose in the resurrection, the King of kings, the Lord of lords, seated at the
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:37.160]   right hand of God at this minute, the King who's coming back to reign.
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:41.320]   Fall at his feet.
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:44.440]   Believe in him.
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:54.880]   Give yourself to him, and he will fill you till you're overflowing with his own glorious
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:56.880]   riches.
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.880]   Amen.
