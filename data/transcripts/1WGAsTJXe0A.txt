[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320]   Today's question is from an international listener.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.880]   Dear Pastor John, I am Jera from the Philippines.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.880]   I always wonder if minding people's opinion about me is a good or bad thing.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.200]   The more I think about it, the more confused I get.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.600]   On one hand, I want to be thought of well by outsiders (1 Timothy 3.7).
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.200]   At the same time, I do not want to be paralyzed if others think I am a fool for following
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.100]   Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 1-3).
[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.600]   And even to the extent of being considered, like Paul, the scum of the world (1 Corinthians
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.600]   4.13).
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.980]   So, how do we think about our self-image in the eyes of the world?
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:56.780]   I think the answer is that we should not go out of our way to offend the world unnecessarily,
[00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:06.100]   and we should not be afraid of offending the world when necessary, and we should put the
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:14.660]   emphasis on proactive good deeds that in general the world will find it hard to disapprove
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.900]   of.
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:24.260]   That's my general answer, but far more important than my general answer are the specificities
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.620]   of the Bible.
[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.620]   So let me do a quick little Bible avalanche.
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:37.520]   First, concerning the importance of not giving offense to the world, but wanting rightly
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:45.740]   to be respected by the world, and then texts concerning the importance of believing and
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.100]   saying and doing things that do in fact offend the world, and we know they will offend the
[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.940]   world because the Bible says they will, and not wanting their godless approval.
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.820]   Who needs the godless approval of the world?
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.940]   So those two groups of texts are very much in tension, so here they are, and we need
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.580]   to hear them both.
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.260]   Proverbs 22.1, "A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches, and favor is better
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.180]   than silver or gold."
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.860]   We should want a good name in the community.
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.460]   Matthew 5.16, "Let your light so shine before others that they may see your good works and
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.580]   give glory to your Father in heaven."
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.200]   First Corinthians 14.23, "If therefore the whole church comes together and all speak
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.020]   in tongues, and an outsider, an unbeliever, enters in, won't they say, 'You're out of
[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.020]   your mind?'"
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.020]   The Bible is quite concerned that they not think you're out of your mind, so that relates.
[00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.340]   First Peter 2.12, "Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable so that when they speak
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.300]   against you as evil doers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation."
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.500]   First Peter 2.15, "For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.060]   silence the ignorance of foolish people."
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.340]   First Corinthians 10.32, "Give no offense to Jews or Greeks or the church of God, just
[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.180]   as I try to please everyone in everything I do, not seeking my own advantage, but that
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.300]   of many that they may be saved."
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.580]   First Timothy 3.7, about the elders, "The candidate for elder must be well thought of
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.540]   by outsiders so that he may not fall into disgrace or into the snare of the devil."
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:36.260]   One more, "Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to what is honorable in the sight
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.260]   of all."
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:47.140]   So, I infer from that little avalanche of texts that those passages do not want us to
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.260]   relish giving offense to people outside.
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.180]   We should seek to avoid giving offense if we can.
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.980]   We're trying to win people, for goodness sakes, not drive them away.
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.020]   We want people to be saved, not just offended at how right we are.
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.780]   However, then we read these, another little avalanche here.
[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:20.000]   This is Galatians 1.10, "For am I now seeking the approval of man or of God?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.600]   Or am I trying to please men?
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:28.240]   If I were trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ."
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.680]   Never rank the approval of man above the truth and righteousness of the gospels.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.520]   Acts 4, Acts 4.19, "But Peter and John answered them, 'Whether it is right in the sight of
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:48.560]   God to listen to you rather than to God, you judge, for we cannot but speak what we have
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.080]   seen and heard.'"
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.320]   In other words, what you will think of us for preaching and living the gospel does not
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.200]   guide our decisions.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.080]   Matthew 10.25, "It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher and the servant like
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.080]   his master.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.080]   If they called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.080]   household?"
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.300]   In other words, expect it.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.000]   If you follow me, you're going to be maligned, not respected.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.640]   Matthew 10.22, "You will be hated by all for my name's sake, but the one who endures
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.320]   to the end will be saved."
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.000]   Expect hatred, vast hatred, for your following me.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.320]   First Peter 4.4, "With respect to this, they are surprised when you do not join them in
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.520]   the same flood of debauchery, and they malign you."
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.960]   It's especially interesting because Peter is writing this book to try to help wives
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.760]   win husbands and people win neighbors.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.880]   Here he says, "There are behaviors you're not going to do anymore.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.480]   When you don't do them anymore, they're going to make big-time fun of you and malign you,
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.920]   and you don't do them anyway."
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:10.320]   He didn't compromise the holiness of life, even though holiness of life made unbelievers
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.400]   very offended and made them malign Christians.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.540]   A lot of people don't get that today.
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.200]   They think if somebody is criticizing your lifestyle, then you better adjust your lifestyle
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.040]   so you don't create criticism.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.000]   That's not going to fit First Peter 4.4.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.760]   Or one more, 1 Corinthians 1.22, "Jews demand signs.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:38.640]   Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews, folly to Gentiles,
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.400]   but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.400]   of God."
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:49.360]   In other words, we know that when we preach the gospel, Paul says Jews are going to stumble
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.040]   over it and Gentiles are going to think it's stupid, and so preach it.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.520]   So preach it.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.640]   Of course, when the Holy Spirit's at work and revival is happening, God overcomes those
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.520]   kind of reactions.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.840]   So my conclusion is this.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.760]   We do care about what outsiders think.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.720]   We own up to that first little avalanche of text.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.680]   We would like to find favor when we speak with them.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.360]   We have words of life, words of joy, words of everlasting satisfaction.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.480]   We would like for them to believe and be with us in the age to come, no matter how bad they've
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.800]   ever been or what they've ever done to us.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.680]   Christians want people to be saved, to become brothers and sisters.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:39.840]   But clearly, from the Scriptures, we do not compromise the truth of Scripture in order
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:45.280]   to curry the favor of the world, nor do we compromise the holiness of life that we're
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.680]   called upon to live in order to get the favor of the world.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.640]   Rather, we put all of the emphasisâ€”and I think this is the note that probably needs
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.240]   to be struck today, when people wonder, "Well, what are you supposed to do then?"
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:08.800]   Put all the emphasis on aggressively positive doing of good deeds that, in general, the
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.040]   world has a hard time disapproving of.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:19.280]   And if the Holy Spirit is pleased to move them, they will see our good deeds and give
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.080]   glory to our Father in heaven.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.080]   Amen.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.080]   Amen.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.200]   That is wise and balanced counsel, Pastor John.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.200]   Thank you.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   And thank you for the perceptive question, Jarrah.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.200]   Appreciate it.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.840]   Well, the refugee crisis is in the news right now, and a listener wants to know, "How should
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.040]   we map this crisis onto what we read in the Bible?"
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.000]   John Piper will be back to explain on Monday.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.

[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.560]   Have a wonderful, restful, and worship-filled weekend.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.080]   See you on Monday.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:54.580]   Amen.
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.580]   Amen.
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:56.080]   Amen.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.080]   Amen.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.080]   Amen.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:58.580]   Amen.
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.580]   Amen.
[00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.080]   Amen.
