[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.220]   In this Holy Week, we take time to rivet our gaze on the cross of Christ and we have several
[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.740]   questions about the crucifixion, two of which we will address this week.
[00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.860]   On Friday, we'll look more closely at why Simon of Cyrene carried Christ's cross, a
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.660]   curious little story we've all read but have likely never spent much time thinking about
[00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.100]   with its many interesting implications for us and for our lives.
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.460]   Don't miss that episode next time on Friday, but today we address the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.200]   On the cross, the triune God is at work, Father, Son, and Spirit.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.140]   But how is the Spirit at work there?
[00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.860]   It's a question today from a podcast listener named James.
[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.020]   "Dear Pastor John, I praise God for your faithful preaching of the Word.
[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.740]   You have had a profound impact on my life and understanding of Jesus and His cross.
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.780]   I have a question regarding the crucifixion.
[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.760]   Romans 8:11 says that it was the role of the Spirit to raise Jesus from the dead, but what
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.480]   role did the Holy Spirit play specifically in the crucifixion?"
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:10.160]   As far as I can see, the biblical writers did not describe the activity of the Holy
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:17.040]   Spirit directly in relationship to the crucifixion in the hour of Jesus' death.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.680]   If there's a text that does that, it has slipped my attention.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.400]   I'd be happy for someone to correct me.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:33.360]   Therefore, if I'm right about that, in answering this question, we are coming at it in an indirect
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.480]   way from things that He said about the Holy Spirit, that God in His Word said about the
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:46.200]   Holy Spirit, in relationship to Jesus, in relationship to His Father, in other connections.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:54.720]   So let me begin with making explicit an assumption that I bring that is maybe different from
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.800]   what some people have said, especially recently I'm hearing it.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:08.280]   Some people are saying that since Jesus was authentically human, His deity was not the
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:16.680]   means by which He did any of His miracles, but only by the Holy Spirit as a man like
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.080]   us, a real man, a man of faith.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.800]   Now I think this is a partial truth taken to an unbiblical extreme.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.760]   The New Testament makes it plain that the works of Jesus were not only done through
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.800]   the Holy Spirit, but were done as evidence of His deity.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.480]   Just to take one example, John 13, 19.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.800]   Jesus says, "I am telling you this now, before it takes place, so that when it does take
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.640]   place you may believe that I am."
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:01.560]   And I think that "I am" is an allusion to His deity, and so His foreknowledge is given
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.360]   here as something from which we should infer, "Oh my goodness, this man is claiming to
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.100]   be very God of very God and warranting it with His works."
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.000]   So that's what "I am" means, and Jesus expected those who watched Him, including
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:29.400]   us when we watch Him in the Gospels, He expects us to be able to discern divine glory.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.000]   We have beheld His glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.240]   They saw something in Jesus in the combination of His works and words and ways, His whole
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.880]   demeanor, including His works, were communicating, "This man is more than just an ordinary
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.120]   man," even though it's true that He did trust in God's help and the Holy Spirit
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.400]   as He did His works.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.160]   By the Holy Spirit I'm casting out demons.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:06.280]   Now having said that, it's not wrong to emphasize He was a perfect model of what humans
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   should be like, including His reliance on the Spirit.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.440]   He says explicitly that He casts out demons by the power of the Holy Spirit, Matthew 12:28.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.960]   He was led into the wilderness by the Spirit, He was full of the Holy Spirit, He was anointed
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.520]   by the Spirit, Acts 10:38.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.600]   He was commissioned by the Spirit, Matthew 4:18.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.040]   He was vindicated by the Spirit at His baptism, according to 2 Timothy.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.600]   He did all of this by the Spirit.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.280]   He was the perfect model man for us in that regard.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.400]   We are to live by the Spirit also.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:51.480]   So with that assumption behind me, let me try to say maybe three things with regard
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.640]   to James's question, namely how the Spirit relates specifically to the crucifixion of
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.640]   Jesus.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:06.240]   Number one, Jesus could not have died for sinners unless He was sinless.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:15.160]   In view of what we just saw about how He lived by the Spirit, I assume that the Holy Spirit
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:22.400]   was at work in the life of Jesus, enabling Him to walk in holiness and preserving Him
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.000]   in purity and holiness as the Lamb of God, without which there could be no substitutionary
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.320]   atonement.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:36.760]   And I assume that some of the greatest temptations for Jesus to be disobedient to the vision,
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.600]   to the mission, happened in the hours just before He breathed His last.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.800]   Those were the worst moments of suffering.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.960]   And if there was any time when He was going to make shipwreck of His faith and fail in
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.240]   His mission, it would be then, and if there was any time where the Holy Spirit was active,
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:03.720]   surely He was active in strengthening and helping Jesus persevere to the end in holiness
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.720]   and faith.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:12.240]   And so I would say our very salvation hangs on the involvement of the Holy Spirit in the
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.240]   moment of the crucifixion.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:22.080]   Number two, the Holy Spirit's reality in the life of the God-man, Jesus Christ, was
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:33.760]   essential to His very identity as God on the cross, essential to His deity.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:42.880]   He was conceived in Mary's womb, Luke tells us, Luke 1:35, by the Holy Spirit, so that
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.440]   He could be called the Son of God.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:57.560]   The virgin birth by the Spirit, conception by the Spirit, is the key to His deity in
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.600]   His God-man existence.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:11.080]   So as He hung on the cross, He was hanging there owing to the Spirit having caused Him
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:18.880]   to be conceived in the womb as the God-man, and He could not have done His work on the
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:30.320]   cross in any other way than as very God of very God in union with the Father by the Spirit.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:41.360]   So His very existence as the God-man who died in our place was owing to the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:51.400]   Thirdly, and lastly, I admit that this one is more speculative than the other two, but
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.200]   let me go ahead and venture it anyway.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:08:01.720]   There's a profound sense in which the delight that the Father had in the obedience of His
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:11.520]   Son as He was being crucified was a delight or a love that consisted in the Holy Spirit
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.040]   Himself.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:19.920]   Now, your first reaction to that statement might be, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:28.200]   His Father was pouring out wrath on His Son on the cross so that it wouldn't have to be
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.040]   poured out on us.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.160]   What's this talk about delighting in the Son as He hung there?"
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.360]   Well, it's just not that simple.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:45.920]   He definitely was under the curse of God as He died, Galatians 3:13, Romans 8-3.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.880]   Yes, He was.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.200]   He was being condemned.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.320]   He bore our condemnation.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.160]   He bore our curse.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:04.920]   But He was also, from another angle, approved by God and pleasing to God.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:14.840]   Ephesians 5-2, Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.320]   to God.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:24.240]   In the moment of His greatest suffering and His perfect obedience, He was a fragrance
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.680]   to God.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:31.920]   God smelled the obedience of His Son and delighted in it.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:38.240]   So God the Father was experiencing the death of Christ in more ways than one.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:45.920]   He was experiencing the obedience of His Son as a fragrant offering, and I'm suggesting
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:55.200]   that the Holy Spirit was the mediator of that delight in the Father, in the sense that the
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:05.120]   Holy Spirit in union with the Son and the Holy Spirit in union with the Father was experienced
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.080]   by the Father as the union of delight.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.520]   I know that's heavy.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.360]   If you wonder, "Where are you getting that idea?"
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.240]   That's the way to understand the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.160]   I would send you to Jonathan Edwards' essay on the Trinity.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.240]   You can find it online free.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.040]   Jonathan Edwards' essay on the Trinity if you want to see the biblical foundations for
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.960]   that way of thinking.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:36.440]   But let this much be said for our worship of Christ in this precious season.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:45.000]   One, our sins would not be forgiven if the Son of God were not sinless and it was the
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.880]   Holy Spirit who sustained His faith and preserved Him in His sinless perfection.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:11:01.120]   Two, our sins would not be forgiven if the Son of God were not very God of very God as
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.400]   He hung on the cross.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:14.360]   And that deity depended on His being conceived 33 years earlier by the Holy Spirit.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.360]   That's profound.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:21.640]   And to Ephesians 5 too, maybe we could also add Isaiah 53 10, that the Lord was pleased
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.640]   to crush Him.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.640]   Oh, that's true.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.640]   I didn't even think of that.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.640]   You're right.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:26.640]   Absolutely.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.960]   No sadistic love of harm, but a profound delight in the atoning sacrifice of the Son.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.720]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.000]   And listeners, thank you for listening.
