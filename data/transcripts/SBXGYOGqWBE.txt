[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500]   All right, let's end with a deeper question here.
[00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.560]   This comes from Kevin.
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.520]   Kevin said, I've recently been reading the classic seven habits, a highly
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.140]   effective people and are wondering what the seven or choose the appropriate
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.180]   number principles of deep life are of the deep life are a, what are the
[00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.860]   fundamental truths that have universal application to cultivating the deep life?
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.680]   Well, Kevin, I don't have a full, fully developed answer to that yet.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.580]   I will, by the time I'm done writing my deep life book, but I'm writing
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.960]   my slow productivity book first.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.540]   So for now, I'm just playing with ideas in the background, but let me give you
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.360]   three right now, extracted from some of the notes I've been taking as I, as I
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.780]   look ahead to the process of writing my deep life book in the future, right?
[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.040]   Idea number one, this is my current tentative formulation for
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.420]   what the deep life requires.
[00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.260]   The deep life requires the radical alignment of your daily existence
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.360]   towards things you value and away from things you don't.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.940]   All right.
[00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.700]   There's three pieces to that formulation.
[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.240]   All right.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:10.240]   One, you have to shift your life, where you live, what you do for work, how you
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.440]   work, how you fill your time, whatever.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.760]   You have to shift major elements of your life towards
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.880]   things you really care about.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.260]   So there's this intentional shaping of your life towards things you care about.
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.840]   Two, the shift should be radical.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.320]   So there's something deep and meaning generating about making big shifts.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.240]   So it's not just, I'm trying not to work on weekends.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.040]   It's you radically changed your job so that you're working
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.340]   half days, four days a week.
[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.460]   It's the radical shift.
[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.340]   It's not just, I want to hike more.
[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.180]   It's I moved the Vancouver Island where I live among the woods, right?
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.960]   The something about the radicality helps unlock depth.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.840]   And the third piece of this formulation is to focus more on the things that
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.640]   value, you have to pretty severely reduce all the things that don't.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.680]   So there's a simplification that seems to come with the deep life.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.960]   The, the, the focus on one thing, you have to excise more of the other things and
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.200]   not just getting rid of the things that are bad, but also being willing to step
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.400]   away from the things that are fine.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.280]   Just not as good as the things you really care about.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.040]   So you can't have all the different things.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.640]   All right.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.200]   Idea two, that transformation requires practice.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.840]   So it's hard to make big changes in your life.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.780]   It's hard in two ways.
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.160]   One, just building up the muscle and the discipline of controlling.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.840]   Being very efficacious about directing your life.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.620]   That's why on this podcast, I often talk about the deep life bucket exercise.
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.000]   You identify the buckets of the deep life and you do the keystone habit in each.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.080]   And then you spend six to eight weeks dedicated to each bucket, doing a
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.480]   transformation of that piece of your life.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.880]   A big part of that is practice.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.800]   Getting used to intentionality and discipline in the shaping of your life.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.120]   That actually does take some work.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.600]   The other thing that benefits from practice is insight.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   Insight on what matters to you and what doesn't and the nuances of how something
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.880]   matters is often extracted as a side effect of action in doing something,
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.380]   trying something, making this change, taking this month off, putting on this
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.740]   routine, praying five times a day, whatever it is to change you make it's in the
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.680]   actual friction generated by taking that action that you gain, oh, our timer went
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.060]   off, Jesse, that you actually gain insight.
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.700]   And by the way, for those who are watching at home, you hear me reference a timer.
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.020]   I'll hold it up to the camera here.
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.540]   A reader or a listener sent us this.
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.140]   Dave Z.
[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.580]   Dave Z sent us this, what's it called, Jesse?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   A focus timer.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.880]   Focus timer.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.600]   So free plug.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.960]   Uh, for those who are listening, it is a plastic hourglass.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.380]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.560]   It's basically to avoid using your phone for a timer.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.820]   Yeah.
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.440]   And it has, I haven't quite figured it out.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.520]   We just opened the box before the episode, but it has led lights to
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.360]   indicate how full it is or not full it is.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.160]   And when you twist it, it does something and you turn it over and it anyways,
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.720]   once you learn how to use it, you can basically set a timer and run it and
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.540]   just watch led sand move down to a, to a hourglass so you can time yourself.
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.420]   Without having to look at digital numbers on a, on a phone.
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.740]   So was it Dave Z?
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.460]   Dave Z.
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.880]   Dave Z.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.500]   Thank you very much.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.900]   That's what went off for those who are listening, uh, just
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.060]   went off during our recording here.
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.620]   Uh, but the point I was making before the, the focus timer went
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.740]   off is through action, you gain insight.
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.760]   In fact, action is often a better route to insight than mere reflection.
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.200]   It's why a lot of the great wisdom traditions of the world
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.840]   have so much ritual involved.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.320]   You can't just sit, you can't just sit and think about Torah.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.680]   You actually have to do the five time daily or whatever it's three
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.440]   time daily prayer, you have to go through the rituals of the days of
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.960]   awe that do ritual through activity, through commitment, you gain insight.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.500]   That applies to life transformation too.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.180]   So you're not just going to sit here and watch documentaries and read books
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.900]   and get inspired and figure out, you actually have to take action at a
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.740]   smaller scale to get the insight needed to take successful action at the larger.
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:13.360]   Third idea, Kevin, uh, career capital theory is often the fuel of the deep life.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.240]   So the universe doesn't care about your values and dreams.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.320]   And so if your radical change is not practical or sustainable, the stress
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.840]   and uncertainty that it creates, let's say financially or otherwise is going
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.040]   to counteract the potential benefits.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.920]   So deep life transitions are most successful when they're made with a.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:39.780]   Foundation of confidence, financially speaking, I don't healthcare, education,
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.900]   connection, whatever the things are you worry about that you're able to make
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.140]   this with confidence, career capital is going to be your buddy in this mission.
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.900]   Becoming so good.
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.520]   You can't be ignored at skills gives you leverage.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.900]   You can use that leverage to shape your career towards things that
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.620]   resonate and away from things that don't.
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.860]   Shifting towards a deep life is the ultimate example of shifting your
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.940]   life towards things that resonate.
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.700]   You might need to build up a pretty big pool of career capital to make that ha ha
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.260]   happen.
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.880]   So this goes contrary.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.140]   A lot of times when people think about something like the deep life, it's all
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.620]   about the inspiration and the boldness, but it's actually often the, the, the
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.740]   focus of getting really good at something valuable, that's most important.
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.380]   That's what opens up the options for you to sustainably try something different.
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.700]   All right, Kevin, that's tentative, but that's some of my recent thoughts on.
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.500]   Successfully identifying and transitioning to a deep life.
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.180]   Now, if only my book will sell as many as Stephen Covey, seven habits, I
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.300]   think we will all be happy.
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.100]   That might be one of the best selling advice books of all time.
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.380]   Yeah, probably.
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.820]   I think so.
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.540]   It's like 30 million copies or something.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.940]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.580]   I mean, look, I don't want to be greedy.
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.340]   I'd be okay with a half that.
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.380]   It's a good title.
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.180]   Yeah, it's a good title, but I think people give too much credit to titles.
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.060]   It sells more books, right?
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.260]   Yeah.
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.460]   But if the book is not, I've been in the business long enough to know books sell a
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.420]   lot of copies because they, they hit a chord with people.
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.500]   They just hit the right chord and they, people pass them on to other
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.540]   people, pass them on to other people.
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:16.900]   The titles can help, but this idea that, you know, Mark Manson sold 18 million
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.820]   copies of the subtle art of not giving an F word because the F word was in it.
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:21.580]   It's crazy.
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.820]   It's because the book was the perfect tone on the perfect topic to
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.780]   reach a perfectly large audience.
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.620]   Seven habits is great, but everyone wrote books with
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.900]   seven in the title after that.
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.220]   It's not the title.
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.380]   It was a values driven approach to productivity, which is as
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.780]   relevant today as it was back then.
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.580]   And it's, it's, it's a really good book.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.900]   Deep work sold a lot of copies.
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.300]   I mean, I think the phrase deep work is good, but it's also just hit the
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:52.140]   zeitgeist at a time where people were intuiting something negative about the
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.300]   distraction and the freneticism of their, of their working life, and they couldn't
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.180]   quite put their finger on it and the book put their finger on it in a way they could
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:03.460]   then articulate to others and, you know, million copies later that thing spread.
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:08.060]   So I'm a believer titles kind of matter, but a title cannot make
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.420]   a book into a massive seller.
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.060]   That makes sense.
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:10.260]   Yeah.
[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.180]   That's my theory.
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:16.380]   [music]
