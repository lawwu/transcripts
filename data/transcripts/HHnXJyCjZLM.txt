[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   We continue this evening our study of the words that are to be found in Paul's epistle
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.920]   to the Romans in chapter 10, verses 9 and 10.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.480]   Verses 9 and 10 in the 10th chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans, that if thou shalt
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.520]   confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.560]   raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved; for with the heart men believeth unto righteousness,
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.840]   and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.760]   Now we've defined these two verses as the Apostle's statement or definition of what
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.760]   is meant by saving faith.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.360]   It comes as an explanation of what he's been saying in the preceding verses.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.960]   Now we have divided up the matter like this.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.320]   First of all, the Apostle gets us to consider the content of saving faith.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.320]   What is the content?
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.880]   What does it say?
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.800]   And then we'll have to consider, as he puts it before us here, the nature or the character
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.800]   of saving faith.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.520]   And then thirdly, the proof of saving faith.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.360]   But we are at the moment considering the content of saving faith.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.720]   It's very important that we should realize the richness of the content of this definition.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.760]   What he says is this, "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, that Jesus
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.760]   is Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.920]   shalt be saved."
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.680]   Now there are two divisions, therefore, in this matter of the content of saving faith.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.320]   The first is the Lord Jesus, which means that Jesus is Lord.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.200]   We've considered that in something of the richness of its content.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.640]   It's a great declaration that he is none less than the eternal Son of God, the Lord of glory.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.600]   And all that we've seen involved in that, and we've seen how that is the claim that
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.360]   is made for him everywhere in the New Testament.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.960]   The first thing we must be clear about is the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.680]   There is no such thing as Christianity apart from that.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:28.200]   Christianity is based entirely and utterly upon this person and this great truth concerning
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.640]   him.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.400]   So we have seen that what the apostle is saying here is not that we, to use a phrase that's
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.040]   far too often used, have taken him on as our Lord, or that we regard him as our Lord and
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.040]   Master.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.400]   It includes that, but it means much more than that.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.360]   It is not so much a statement of what we do about him as to who he is.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.480]   And he is the Lord of glory.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.400]   He is Jehovah, the third person in the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.680]   Then we began last Friday night considering the second half of this great confession,
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.460]   the second half, if you like, of the content of saving faith.
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.920]   And it is this, that God hath raised him from the dead.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.960]   Now that's what we are considering at the moment.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.680]   Now in putting this before you last Friday night, I indicated that it has often seemed
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.760]   strange to people that the death of our Lord is not mentioned here.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.760]   But I suggested that we should soon see why that is the case and the significance of that
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.800]   fact.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:46.120]   The apostle is primarily concerned to emphasize the fact of the resurrection, because it is
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:53.560]   in the light of this alone that we are able to understand other aspects of the truth.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.060]   So we put it like this.
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:04.960]   We must believe and confess the fact of the resurrection, that our Lord literally rose
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.640]   in the body from the grave, and that he was seen by chosen witnesses, all that we've
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.000]   just been reminded of in that section of 1 Corinthians 15 that we read just now.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.520]   Paul says there is no gospel apart from that, and it's quite clear that there never would
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.520]   have been.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.160]   The church is the result of the great fact of the resurrection.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.200]   That doesn't mean that his influence continues only.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:37.600]   It means that he literally did rise from the grave and appear to these chosen witnesses.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.600]   Now then, we've looked at that, and then we are now beginning to draw the deduction,
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.000]   the significance of this fact of the resurrection.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.320]   And the one we dealt with last Friday night was this.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.920]   The resurrection proves who he is.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:00.680]   It is the final proof that he is the Lord, declared to be the Son of God with power according
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.080]   to the Spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.520]   That's the statement we've already had in the first chapter of this epistle and in the
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.440]   fourth verse.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.560]   And we gave other scriptural evidence to show the same thing.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:21.200]   The resurrection is the ultimate proof of the fact that Jesus is the Lord.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.860]   But now we must go on from there.
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.920]   The second point about the resurrection, the second significance of the fact of the resurrection
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:36.800]   is this, that it explains to us why he died.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.840]   Now this is, you see, where the death comes in.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.920]   And that is why it was unnecessary that the apostle should mention the death of our Lord
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.520]   in particular.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.120]   By asserting that he is the Lord and that he has been raised from the dead, he is including
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.320]   everything that happened from the incarnation to the ascension.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.640]   And therefore you've got the beginning and the end here.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.000]   And the beginning and the end include everything that comes in between.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.160]   But it is interesting that we approach it in this particular way.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.440]   Now the problem that arises is this.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:19.480]   If we are told that Jesus of Nazareth is the second person in the Blessed Holy Trinity,
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:25.760]   is Jehovah the Eternal Son, and that this is proved by the resurrection, well then the
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:32.320]   question that immediately arises is, in that case, why did he ever die?
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.640]   It's the obvious question.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:41.960]   If this person who lived in this earth was the Son of God, why then did he ever die?
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.040]   Now that's the right question to ask at this particular point.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:52.960]   And it is, of course, the best way of all of approaching the whole doctrine of the death
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.560]   of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:01.040]   Now, one of the greatest classics ever written on this subject of the doctrine of the death
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.640]   of the Lord Jesus Christ was written by a man who lived in this country of the name
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.800]   of Ansel, called by the Roman Catholic Church Saint Ansel.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.480]   And he gave a very interesting title to his book.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:23.560]   In Latin he wrote it, and this was the title, Cur Deus Homo, Why God-Men.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.760]   Now this book is a book, as I say, on the atonement, on the death of our Lord.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.920]   But that's the title he gave to it.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.920]   Why God-Men?
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:39.160]   Now I'm simply putting the question in a different form tonight by asking, if he is
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.000]   the God-Man, why did he die?
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.200]   Anselm takes it a stage further back than one we've already considered.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:53.120]   Why is it that the Son of God has ever become man?
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.640]   He approached the doctrine of the atonement in that way.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.400]   We are really doing the same thing, only that we are asking it more directly.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:05.360]   If he is the Lord of glory, if Jesus is the Lord, why then did he ever die?
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.160]   Now that brings us at once, you see, to the very heart of this question.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:18.880]   Now it's a very good way, I say, of approaching this, because we have evidence in the Gospels
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:25.560]   themselves that this was a great stumbling block to the disciples, the men who ultimately
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.680]   became the apostles.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.080]   They found this a very great difficulty.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:37.040]   Now the classical passage, of course, on this is found in Matthew 16, the famous incident
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.480]   that happened at Caesarea Philippi.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.080]   Our Lord asks that question, "Whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?"
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.760]   Peter steps forward and makes his great confession, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.760]   God."
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.680]   And our Lord commends him and says, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.960]   doth not reveal this unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven."
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:05.880]   Peter has made the great confession that Jesus is the Lord, the Christ, the Son of God.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:10.000]   And our Lord tells him, "You haven't worked this out, this is a matter of revelation."
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.640]   But then the record goes on to tell us that our Lord proceeded immediately to tell them
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.680]   something about his approaching death.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.400]   And immediately Peter and the rest get into trouble.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:29.000]   From that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go unto Jerusalem
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.080]   and suffer many things of the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.920]   and be raised again the third day.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:43.000]   Then Peter took him and began to rebuke him, saying, "Be it far from thee, Lord, this shall
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   not be unto thee."
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.960]   You see the difficulty.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.960]   Having made the confession that he is the Christ, the Son of the living God, the idea
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.640]   of his dying seems an utter contradiction.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:00.240]   You would expect that the Lord from glory would escape death, because he is the Lord
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.240]   of glory.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:07.880]   And Peter stumbled, and our Lord had to rebuke him, saying, "Get thee behind me, Satan,
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:13.640]   thou art an offence unto me, for thou sayest not the things that be of God, but those that
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.640]   be of men."
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:20.600]   Now it wasn't only Peter, they all stumbled, and we've got repetitions of that in different
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.600]   form.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.280]   So that this is a very good way of approaching this whole matter.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.240]   And it was the thing, of course, that was held at the early Christians.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.040]   You claim that this was the Lord of glory.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.640]   Well, if so, why did he die on that cross?
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.440]   You remember the people at the foot of the cross.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.760]   "Ha, ha, ha," they said, "thou who savest others, come down and save thyself."
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:46.480]   If you are, they said, who you claim to be, what are you dying like that for in weakness?
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.180]   It's the right question to ask.
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:54.660]   They display their ignorance in asking it, as the disciples had exposed their own ignorance
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.360]   in stumbling at the information.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:02.520]   But it is the right way always to approach this whole doctrine of the death of our Lord.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.720]   Here he is, proved to be the Son of God by the resurrection from the dead.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.040]   Very well, that raises very acutely, why did he ever die then?
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.640]   It's inevitable.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:18.400]   So you see, in this confession that God has raised him from the dead, there is implicitly
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.480]   involved at once the whole matter of the death of our Lord.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.760]   Very well.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:31.140]   And the answer, of course, is given to us quite plainly in the Gospel and in the remainder
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.760]   of the New Testament.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.820]   This is the apostolic preaching.
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:39.520]   You see, what we are looking at in these two verses, and indeed in verse 9 alone, in a
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:45.520]   sense, we have a complete synopsis of the first Christian preaching.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:51.800]   This is what the apostles themselves preached, and this alone is the Gospel.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.720]   And it is the only Gospel tonight.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:00.120]   And all this philosophic talk which is so rampant today in the name of Christianity
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.320]   has nothing to do with this at all.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.840]   This is Christianity, according to the New Testament.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.520]   And we have no other standard, we have no other authority whatsoever.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.880]   Very well, then let's look at it.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.800]   Well, now the evidence is this.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.000]   Why did he die, I say, if he is the Lord of Glory?
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.360]   Our Lord himself answers the question.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:27.400]   He says quite deliberately and plainly that he could have avoided death.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:33.240]   He could easily commend twelve legions of angels, he says, and avoid it all.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.440]   If he wanted to, he could have.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:41.360]   Nevertheless, we are told that he set his face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.560]   He knew exactly what was going to happen.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:50.040]   His followers of his and others tried to dissuade him from doing so on more than one occasion.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:55.840]   There are plenty of illustrations and examples of this.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:02.440]   Take, for instance, what we read in Luke 13, at verse 31.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.680]   The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto them, Get thee out, and depart
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.480]   hence, for Herod will kill thee.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:14.400]   And he said unto them, Go ye and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:19.840]   killers to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:26.000]   Nevertheless I must walk to-day and to-morrow, and the day following, for it cannot be that
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.880]   a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:34.600]   O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.600]   thee!
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.720]   How often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.720]   her wings, and ye would not.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:47.440]   Behold, your house is left unto you desolate, and verily I say unto you, You shall not see
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:53.800]   me until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.800]   Lord.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:06.200]   Now then, the question is, if he thus deliberately went to the death of the cross, which he could
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.400]   have avoided, why did he do so?
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.320]   Why did he deliberately set his face to go to Jerusalem?
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.960]   Why does he tell his followers when they pull out a sword to defend him, to put it back
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.960]   in the scabbard?
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:24.200]   And again, there is no difficulty about the answer.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:29.760]   You see, people get into trouble because they will not believe the Scriptures.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.380]   If you believe the Scriptures, there's no difficulty.
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.920]   But if you begin to say that you don't accept this, that these are just symbols, that it
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.720]   was just people writing at that time with their primitive notions and ideas, and that
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.400]   we now know so much more and have our great philosophy and so on, well then you're going
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.400]   to be in great trouble.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.560]   You're going to have a Christianity, if it is Christianity, and it really isn't, which
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.340]   has nothing to do with the New Testament at all.
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:56.880]   But if you come with a simplicity and a childlike faith, knowing that you know nothing, and
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.520]   regarding this as the revelation of God, there is no problem.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.360]   Listen, he gives his own answer.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.640]   Why does he set his face steadfastly?
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.640]   Why does he take no notice of the warnings about Herod and what he's going to do to him
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.640]   and so on?
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.200]   And this is his answer.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:25.320]   The Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.320]   for many.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:33.600]   Now he says that quite explicitly, and it's recorded very carefully here for us in Matthew's
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:40.920]   Gospel in chapter 20, and in the Gospel according to Mark in chapter 10.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.560]   It's here for us everywhere.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:47.020]   His own specific statement.
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.840]   Not only that, he's made other statements.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.920]   You remember how in that high priestly prayer which is recorded in the seventeenth chapter
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.120]   of John's Gospel, he makes it quite plain.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.200]   There's no difficulty at all.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:04.520]   Here it is at the very beginning.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:10.600]   Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, "Father, the hour has come."
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.280]   He'd already referred to this hour.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:17.320]   The great statement with respect to it in the twelfth chapter of John's Gospel.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:22.920]   I don't want to spend too much time with this, but in view of the present confusion
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.280]   about the meaning of our Lord's death, I feel we can take nothing for granted.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:33.280]   I feel a sense of responsibility in warning you against these false teachings that deny
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:39.720]   all this glorious teaching, and leave you with nothing but philosophy and human suppositions
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.720]   and theories.
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.480]   Listen to it in John 12.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.480]   27.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:48.680]   "Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say?
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.680]   Father, save me from this hour?
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.120]   But for this cause came I unto this hour.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.720]   Father, glorify thy name.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.680]   Then there came a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it and will glorify
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.680]   it again.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.400]   And then later on, now is the judgment of this world.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:12.680]   Now shall the prince of this world be cast out, and I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.560]   will draw all men unto me."
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.760]   This he said, signifying what death he should die.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.400]   Could anything be plainer?
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:26.880]   He was constantly teaching them about this and preparing them for it, in spite of their
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.400]   incapacity to receive it.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.400]   He goes on telling them.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.160]   And there it is, I say again, in the seventh chapter.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.600]   "Father, the hour has come.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.360]   Glorify thy son, that thy son also may glorify thee."
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.120]   And then he goes on to say, "I have glorified thee on the earth.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.720]   I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do."
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:53.480]   And later on in that same chapter, you find that he says this, that he sanctifies himself
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.480]   for them.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.600]   And that is again a reference to his death.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.600]   The 19th verse.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:05.840]   "For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified through the truth."
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:12.680]   And then of course, above and beyond everything else, there he is, dying on the cross.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.240]   This is his word.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.520]   It is finished.
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.320]   It is finished.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.440]   He there has finished this work which he came to do.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.200]   And it's on the cross, by dying, that he finishes it.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.600]   Very well, here are his own statements.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.600]   What does it all mean?
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:35.640]   Well, very fortunately, he himself has given us an exposition of this.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.840]   And he did so after his resurrection.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.680]   Now this is most interesting and important from the standpoint of this statement in Romans
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.360]   10, 9.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:49.720]   The disciples, as I have explained to you, simply could not take this teaching about
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.960]   his death.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.000]   They could take his teaching about his being the Lord and the Christ, but they couldn't
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.980]   see that that was compatible with his death and his dying, and apparently defeated by
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.280]   his enemies.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:09.360]   So that after the resurrection, when they realize the new and the fresh who he is, our
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.200]   Lord explains it and expounds it to them.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.040]   Indeed, he even did it to two of them before they realized who he was.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.320]   I'm referring to the two men on the road to Emers.
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:24.560]   You remember how pressful they were, how dejected, disappointed, and unhappy.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.760]   The death of our Lord, they put it like this.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.920]   They said, "We trusted that it had been he which would have redeemed Israel."
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:37.080]   They said, "That's what we believed when we saw him and listened to him and saw his
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.080]   miracles.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.760]   We trusted that it had been he which would have redeemed Israel."
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.400]   But what they're saying is this, "We realize now we were wrong.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.560]   If he had really been the Messiah, he wouldn't have been killed.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.280]   He would have conquered all his enemies, and we'd be the greatest people on the face of
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.280]   the earth.
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.040]   We trusted, we had hoped, we were quite sure in fact, but we've been all wrong.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.520]   He died and they buried him in a grave."
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:04.480]   Then our Lord begins to speak to them, and he says, "O fools, and slow of heart to believe
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.880]   all that the prophets have spoken.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:12.400]   Ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory?"
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.760]   And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.520]   the things concerning himself.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.800]   That's the two men on the road to Emer.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:27.320]   But then he did the same thing with the assembled disciples back in Jerusalem.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:33.040]   Verse 44 in Luke 24, "He said unto them, 'These are the words which I have spoken to you while
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:38.400]   I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.240]   Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me.'
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:50.560]   Then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and said unto
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:57.800]   them, 'Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:05.440]   the third day, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.440]   all nations beginning at Jerusalem.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.680]   And ye are witnesses of these things.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:17.440]   And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you, but carry ye in the city of Jerusalem
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.800]   until ye be imbued with power from on high.'"
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:26.840]   Now there is our Lord's own exposition and explanation of the reason why he sets his
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:33.200]   face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem, why he was determined to die.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:38.880]   The answer is that he had come into the world in order to die.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:39.880]   Very well.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:44.060]   It's not surprising, therefore, that when you come to the book of the Acts of the Apostles
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:49.280]   and there begin to listen to the preaching of the Apostles themselves, you find that
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:54.160]   they did exactly the same thing as he had taught them to do there after his resurrection
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.760]   and before his ascension.
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:02.000]   So Peter does it on the day of Pentecost in the sermon recorded in the second chapter
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   of Acts.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.800]   But perhaps one of the plainest statements of it all is again concerning this Apostle
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:08.800]   Paul.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.160]   And here it is at the beginning of Acts 17.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:16.800]   "Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica,
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.720]   where was the synagogue of the Jews.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:25.160]   And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three Sabbath days reasoned with
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:33.120]   them out of the Scriptures, opening and alleging that Christ must needs of suffer, and risen
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:38.680]   again from the dead, and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ."
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:43.000]   Now, that's only a synopsis of a sermon.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.040]   That's not the whole sermon.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.560]   That's where people constantly surprise me.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:52.840]   They fail to realize that we have nothing here but synopsis.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.840]   That's not a sermon.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.720]   The Apostle took a long, long time to say that.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:01.720]   The Apostle, as you remember, we are told in Acts 20, was capable of preaching for hours,
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.080]   starting in the afternoon and going on until midnight and even beyond that.
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.360]   We only get summaries here.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:12.960]   The tragedy today is, it seems to me, that modern Christians are not only not realizing
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.280]   that these are summaries, but they're even making summaries of the summaries.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.960]   And instead of expanding them and seeing the content and the riches of the content, which
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.880]   is what we are trying to do these Friday nights.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.040]   Now then, you see what the Apostle did?
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.840]   He reasoned and alleged and proved and demonstrated.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.920]   He said before we could be saved, the Messiah must die.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.840]   The Christ must needs of suffer.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:42.640]   This Jesus whom I preach unto you is the Christ.
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.680]   The two things we are dealing with here.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:50.960]   You understand this doctrine of the death of our Lord in the light of the resurrection.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.000]   But of course, it's not confined to the book of Acts.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.120]   It was for this reason that the Apostle says he determined not to know anything among them,
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:04.800]   save Jesus Christ and him crucified in Corinth, 1 Corinthians 2.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:09.600]   He gives them the teaching concerning the Lord's Supper in the 11th chapter of 1 Corinthians
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.080]   and then that mighty passage which we read at the beginning.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.040]   There it is again.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:20.000]   And I feel that it wouldn't be a bad thing if we all got these typed out or printed them
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.280]   in large letters and put them on the wall and learnt them by heart and told everybody
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.280]   about them.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.840]   When people say to you, "What is Christianity?"
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.320]   Well, say, "This is the answer."
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:35.200]   The Apostle Paul gives a synopsis of it at the beginning of 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:41.680]   "Brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:48.160]   received and wherein ye stand, by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.560]   preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain."
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.560]   What is it?
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.560]   Well, here is another synopsis.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:59.360]   "I delivered unto you first of all."
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:03.480]   Some say that means at the beginning, the first thing I said.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.160]   Others say chief in importance.
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.000]   I believe it means both.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.480]   "I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received."
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.160]   It wasn't his own theory or idea.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.840]   It wasn't his own philosophical speculation.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.840]   He received it.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.280]   He was given it by the Lord himself on the road to Damascus.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.280]   What is it?
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.280]   Here it is.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:29.560]   "How that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures, as the scriptures said
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.440]   he would do and as the scriptures said he must do."
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.440]   What else?
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:38.880]   "And that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.000]   again and that he was seen of Cephas and the twelve and so on."
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.840]   But you see, the essence of the gospel is those two things, that Christ died for our
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:52.400]   sins, was buried, rose again from the dead.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.800]   All this is a fulfillment of all the prophecies of the Old Testament.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:01.320]   Now there you again have nothing but a brief summary and synopsis.
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.760]   It took the apostle great time to expound all this.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.600]   This he says is the thing in its essence.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:12.320]   In other words, if a man doesn't believe that Jesus is the Lord, if he doesn't believe
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.240]   that he had to die before we could be saved, he's not a Christian.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.720]   If he doesn't believe in the resurrection, he cannot be a Christian.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:26.240]   These are the first principles without which there is no such thing as Christianity at
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.000]   all.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.600]   To me it's nothing short of tragic that one has to go on saying these things.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.480]   But you see, scarcely a day passes but that I either read a book or read a review of a
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:43.720]   book in which I find all this completely denied in the name of the Christian church.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:49.240]   My friends, we should thank God that we happen to be dealing with Romans 10, verse 9 and
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.240]   10.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.640]   We are reminded here of the things without which we can't be saved.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:27:00.120]   Listen, you've got to keep these in memory, says the apostle, by which also ye are saved,
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:05.800]   if you keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:10.400]   If you've gone back on this, he says, there was no value in your belief, so called.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.400]   This is the thing which is absolutely essential.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.400]   Very well, notice that according to the scriptures it's most important.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.400]   The Bible is one.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:23.160]   The whole of the Old Testament predicts and prophesies what happened in the New.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:28.240]   Here's a unity and you can't shed your Old Testament, we need it all.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.840]   Very well, then of course you've got other great statements of it.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:37.040]   2 Corinthians 5, 19-21, the ministry of reconciliation.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.040]   What is it?
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:44.360]   Well it's this, to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.960]   their trespasses unto them.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:52.800]   For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.440]   of God in him.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.160]   There's the apostle Paul, his typical preaching.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:02.080]   Ephesians 1, 7, in whom you have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.120]   according to the riches of his grace.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.520]   It's everywhere.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.040]   Peter says it.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:12.800]   You were redeemed from your vain conversation, inherited by tradition from your fathers,
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:18.240]   not with silver or gold or things like that, but with the precious blood of Christ as of
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:22.280]   a lamb without spot and without blemish.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:30.480]   John reminds us that it is the blood of Christ that cleanseth us from all sin and all unrighteousness.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:37.840]   The book of Revelation reminds us of the same thing, washed in his blood.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.320]   Hebrews 2, 9 is a glorious statement of it.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:46.600]   We see Jesus, who has made a little earth and the angels for the suffering of death,
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:53.760]   crowned with glory and honor, that he, by the grace of God, might taste death for every
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.480]   man.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.200]   Nothing could be simpler, nothing could be plainer.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.720]   Very well, what I'm trying to demonstrate is this.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:07.520]   That when the apostle tells us here that the second great section in the content of saving
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:15.480]   faith is the belief that God has raised him from the dead, you are being held face to
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:24.040]   face with the doctrine of the atonement, directly.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:29.120]   Now that's the important thing for us to realize.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:34.000]   You don't simply believe that Jesus is Lord and that his influence is still persisting.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.080]   It includes the death and the meaning of the death.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:43.800]   So you see, this which looks such a simple statement on the surface, the moment you begin
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:50.520]   to examine it, you see that it contains the essence of all Christian doctrine.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:56.240]   And at the very heart and center is this tremendous, crucial doctrine of the death of Christ, the
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:01.440]   doctrine of the atonement, the doctrine that he is our substitute, that he is the Lamb
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.440]   of God that taketh away the sin of the world.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.280]   All that is involved in this great doctrine.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:12.960]   We've been putting in our own form Anselm's doctrine, "Cur Deus Homo."
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.760]   That's why God became man, as it were.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.920]   That's why the God-men died.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:24.440]   It is the fulfillment of everything that God had promised throughout the whole of the Old
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.720]   Testament period.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:31.720]   So you see, you are subscribing here to the doctrine of the atonement.
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:38.080]   You say that you believe that, but that in turn involves you in another doctrine.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:47.120]   And the other doctrine is this, the doctrine of sin, and the doctrine of the fall of man,
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:51.720]   and the doctrine of the wrath of God upon sin.
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:59.400]   I say this so often, I am constrained to say it again, I cannot understand the type of
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:04.400]   Christian who dislikes doctrine.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.400]   How do you live?
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.400]   What do you do with yourself?
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.400]   Don't you ever ask any questions?
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:13.120]   You say, "But I'm a simple person, all I believe is this, that I'm told if you
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.040]   believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, you're saved.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:18.040]   I've said I believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, I'm saved.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.040]   Is anything more necessary?"
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:25.160]   But my dear friend, don't you want to ask questions?
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:30.920]   Don't you want to ask, "Who is this Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.280]   What does it mean that I need to be saved?
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.120]   How does he save me?
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.160]   What does it mean to be saved?"
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:42.760]   Now the moment you ask those questions, you are asking for doctrine.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:48.760]   You are asking for an explanation, and doctrine is nothing but the biblical answer to our
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:49.760]   questions.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:54.120]   Here we have the explanations given to us by the Spirit of God through these servants
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:58.680]   of his, so that you are given an understanding, and we are meant to have it.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:02.680]   You have no right to say, "I'm just a simple person, I'm not interested in doctrine."
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:09.400]   You are thereby saying that you're not interested in the Bible, for the Bible is full of doctrine.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.480]   The Bible answers our questions.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.320]   God is so gracious that he even asks them for us.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.080]   He asks the questions even, and then answers them.
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:22.240]   And if you are not interested in these mighty questions, I don't know what sort of a Christian
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.840]   you are.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:29.520]   The Christian is a man who longs to know everything that he can possibly know about this blessed
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.720]   person and what he's done for him.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.240]   You'll never love him truly unless you do.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:38.720]   And it is only as we have an understanding of these things that we realize what he's
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.680]   done for us, and why he did it.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:45.600]   So I say, you can't come face to face with this doctrine of his death upon the cross
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:50.680]   as a substitution for our sins, without saying, "Well then, what does that tell me about
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.680]   myself?"
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:56.360]   You see, the moment you say that Jesus is the Lord, and that God has raised him from
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:00.160]   the dead, you say, "But why was he ever in this world, and did all this happen to
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.160]   him?"
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.200]   And the Bible says, "Well, because of what's true about you."
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.880]   And that brings you to this question, "What is true about me then?"
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:13.640]   And the Bible answers your question, and it's the Bible alone that answers it.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.640]   What is true about us?
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:20.360]   Well, what is true about us is that we are all fallen creatures.
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.720]   Then that raises another question, "Well, how are we fallen?
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.360]   How did we ever become fallen?
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.560]   Have we always been fallen?"
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.920]   That sends you back to the beginning of Genesis.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:33.560]   Because you've got to ask, "Well, what is man altogether?
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:37.240]   Are we struggling warily to go upwards?
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.240]   Is that it?
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.240]   Are we as we are?
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.480]   Are we living as we are?
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:44.880]   Is the world in the moral muddle and mess that it's in because we're just at this
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.520]   particular stage in the process of evolution, and we haven't gone on as far as we should
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.520]   have gone?
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.520]   Is it that, or is there another explanation?"
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:56.760]   And you see, there is another explanation.
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:01.080]   Man's gone down, man's fallen, and everybody's fallen.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.480]   It's true of the whole of the human race.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:08.640]   So you come immediately to the biblical doctrine of man, the biblical doctrine of the fall
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:18.680]   of man, and the biblical doctrine of man in a state of sin, man alienated from God, man
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:26.280]   under the condemnation of God's holy law, and man, as I say, under the wrath of God.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:31.360]   Now, those of us who've been following this from the beginning will remember how the apostle
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.880]   put this before us at the very announcement of his doctrine.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:40.800]   Do you remember, way back in chapter one, when he really comes to grips after his preliminary
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:45.520]   salutations, he says in verse 16, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ."
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.840]   Indeed, he says, "I glory in it, I exult in it."
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.840]   Why?
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:55.280]   Well, because it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.280]   This is the thing I'm preaching.
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:00.960]   He says that God has intervened and that God is saving, and God's got the power to save.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.080]   Nobody else has, but God has.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:08.200]   And my message is God's power unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew first
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.840]   and also to the Greek.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:16.840]   "For," he says, "therein is the righteousness of God revealed from heaven, from face to
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:20.520]   face, as it is written, 'The just shall live by faith.'
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.520]   For."
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:24.600]   Now, here's the explanation.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:30.960]   The apostle exults in this and is delighted about it for this reason, that the wrath of
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:40.680]   God has already been revealed from heaven on all or against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:46.200]   of men who hold down the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:54.560]   You cannot really believe truly in the resurrection without believing in the doctrine of the wrath
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.880]   of God upon all sin.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:08.800]   So it's not surprising that these modern, notorious writers do not believe in the resurrection.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:12.320]   And at the same time and for the same reason, they don't believe in the doctrine of the
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.200]   wrath of God upon sin.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.200]   They don't believe it.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.300]   They say it's impossible in a God of love.
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.600]   They don't understand it, therefore it's impossible.
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:25.760]   You see, you deny one of these doctrines and fairly soon you'll be denying them all.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.000]   If you're logical and consistent, you'll have to.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.360]   Every one of these doctrines belongs together, every single one of them.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.600]   It's a complete body of doctrine.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:39.480]   Drop out at any one point, you're bound to be in trouble with all the rest.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.800]   Here is the perfect illustration of it.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:47.160]   Very well, then.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:50.960]   All these things, you see, are implicit in the statement that God hath raised him from
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:54.000]   the dead.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   He had to die?
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   Why?
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   Well, there are your answers.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.920]   So you're committed to all those biblical doctrines with regard to man and his condition,
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:06.040]   how he ever got into it, and what his most desperate need is.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:10.120]   So you see, it leads in turn to the other doctrines which the apostles already put before
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.120]   us.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:14.960]   He had to spend the remainder of chapter 1, the whole of chapter 2, and the whole of chapter
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:22.200]   3 up until verse 20 in proving that this fallen state and condition is universally true, that
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.720]   it's as true of the Jew as it is of the Gentile.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:28.480]   We are committed to that.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:36.440]   And then, of course, in chapter 5, verses 12 to 21, he has that tremendous paragraph
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.520]   about our relationship to Adam.
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:43.480]   There was the cause of the whole trouble, and everybody's gone down with Adam.
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:48.760]   Sin, death passed upon all men, for that all sin.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.320]   Very well.
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:56.520]   Now, all I'm trying to show you is that in this confession, that we believe that God
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.800]   hath raised him from the dead.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.920]   All that is involved.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:07.200]   And you are asserting all that at the same time.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:13.640]   Very well, then, there we've looked in general and in very summary manner at these great
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:19.240]   biblical doctrines which constitute the very essence of salvation.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.720]   But there is a further deduction.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:25.600]   There is something else implicit in this statement.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:30.320]   There is another significance to the fact that he has risen from the dead, that God
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.860]   raised him from the dead, and it is this.
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:36.700]   And with this we close this evening.
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:41.080]   The apostle doesn't put it that he has risen from the dead.
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.000]   It's often put like that in the Scriptures.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.520]   But here he puts it in this form, that God hath raised him from the dead.
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.440]   There's no contradiction.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.760]   The Father and the Son act in cooperation.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:39:00.120]   But here he puts this emphasis, and he does so for a very definite reason.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:08.780]   The resurrection in a very peculiar manner asserts the sufficiency of Christ's death,
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:11.000]   that it was sufficient.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.140]   He had said on the cross, "It is finished."
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:15.940]   But is it finished?
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:16.940]   How can we know?
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.660]   He died, he expired.
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:23.440]   They took down his body, they buried it in a grave.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.500]   Has he triumphed?
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.780]   Has he done what he had come to do?
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:33.200]   The answer is, if he had remained in the grave, the answer would have been no.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:36.620]   But the resurrection turns the no into yes.
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:41.060]   So you see, this same apostle at the end of chapter 4 was very careful to put it to us
[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:44.100]   like this.
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:48.700]   He says in verse 23, "Now it was not written for his sake alone," that's to say Abraham,
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:55.220]   "that it was imputed to him, but for us also to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:40:01.740]   on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, who was delivered unto death for
[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:08.940]   our offenses, and was raised again for our justification."
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:14.500]   The resurrection, as we emphasized when we were dealing with that great statement, is
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:21.340]   God's public proclamation to the whole universe that he is satisfied with the work of his
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:29.540]   son, that he has honored the law absolutely, that he has borne the most ultimate penalty
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:32.700]   of the law and its demands.
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:40.540]   In raising him from the dead, God is proclaiming that he and his law are absolutely satisfied
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:45.620]   and that the work of salvation is complete.
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:50.180]   Not only that, we get the apostle repeating the same thing really as we saw in chapter
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:52.740]   6.
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:57.780]   In verses 8, 9, and 10, "Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:04.180]   live with him, knowing that Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more.
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:10.020]   Death hath no more dominion over him, for in that he died, he died unto sin once and
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:15.420]   for all, but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God."
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:19.340]   There is a wonderful and categorical statement.
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:24.620]   He has died unto sin, he has died in this matter of dealing with sin once and forever,
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:25.620]   never to be repeated.
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:28.740]   It will never be necessary again.
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:33.780]   So he told us again in chapter 8, in verse 3, that what the law could not do, in that
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:38.140]   it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:43.700]   and for sin, condemned, has dealt with sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the
[00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:46.820]   law might be fulfilled in us.
[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:52.140]   And again, a very wonderful and beautiful statement of this particular point is the
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:42:01.140]   way in which we found it in Romans chapter 8 and in verse 34, especially in two words.
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.140]   Listen.
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:05.100]   "Who is he that condemneth?
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:12.580]   It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:18.020]   of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:22.020]   And the truth is in the little words, yea rather."
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:24.140]   Christ that died, yea rather?
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:25.140]   This is my certainty.
[00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:28.340]   If he had stopped at that, I would have no certainty.
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:29.920]   But I have a certainty, says Paul.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:30.920]   It is Christ that died.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.820]   Ah yes, that is where the work was done, but how can I be sure of it?
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:38.460]   "Yea rather, risen from the dead."
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:46.100]   And it is there that I have my absolute certainty and assurance that the work was complete,
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:51.900]   that it was utterly finished, that he has paid my debt in full, that there is no condemnation
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.660]   to me, there never can be.
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.500]   He has finished the work.
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:43:02.380]   "Yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:03.580]   intercession for us."
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:06.740]   Very well, we will have to leave it at that for this evening.
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:17.620]   We are still, remember, drawing out the implications of the statement that God hath raised him
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:18.620]   from the dead.
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:22.180]   You are not just saying, "I believe that he rose from the dead."
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:24.060]   You see how much you are saying in addition?
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:27.060]   You see what you are including?
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:35.220]   The whole business and object of biblical study is to draw out the meaning that is given
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:39.020]   us here in summary form.
[00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:43.100]   So don't make synopses of the synopses.
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:48.340]   Your business and mine is to draw them out, is to expand them, is to get the full content
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:51.060]   of them and to realize what that is.
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:57.300]   As we pointed out when we began these studies, the Apostle had intended visiting Rome.
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:01.540]   He tells them that in verses 11 and following.
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:06.860]   He had been unable to do so, and he wrote this letter to the Romans simply as it were
[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.980]   to give them something to get on with until he could come.
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:14.820]   He simply sends a brief summary of what he is going to say.
[00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:22.220]   When he arrived, he spoke for hour upon hour upon hour as he showed them the content of
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:26.140]   these brief summary statements.
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:29.940]   And that is what you and I are supposed to do.
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:36.500]   We declare that Jesus is Lord, that God hath raised him again from the dead.
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:42.880]   And in saying that, we see already some of the things which we are claiming and to which
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.620]   we are committed.
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:47.020]   And there are yet more to follow.
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:51.660]   But God willing, we will continue with that next Friday night.
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:52.660]   Let us pray.
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:45:00.940]   O Lord, our God, we humbly thank thee once more for thy loving kindness to us.
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:04.900]   Lord, thou hast made this provision for us.
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:10.820]   We see our constant tendency to limit the glory of thy grace and of the gospel.
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:16.860]   O God, wilt thou enlarge our hearts, enlarge our minds and understandings.
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:22.740]   O reveal these things to us, we pray thee, in all their fulness, that we may rejoice
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:26.180]   in them and revel in them as we should.
[00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:28.940]   We thank thee for all who have gone before us.
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:32.580]   We thank thee for all who help us to enter into these riches.
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:36.860]   O God, receive our humble prayers.
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:43.980]   And now, may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the love of God, the fellowship
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:50.220]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:57.900]   the remainder of this hour's short and sudden earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore.
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:01.140]   Amen.
[00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:05.060]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
