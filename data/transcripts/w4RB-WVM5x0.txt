[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.460]   - Well, happy Friday and welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.400]   Pastor John is back in the studio with us,
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.540]   back to talk with us about Christian unity today.
[00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.900]   We love Christian unity.
[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.580]   We aspire for more Christian unity,
[00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.140]   but Christian unity is not uniformity.
[00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.660]   Differences exist among believers.
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.740]   So Christian unity gets pretty complex,
[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.980]   leading to a question like this one today
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.760]   on 1 Peter 3, verse eight.
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.540]   Here is the email.
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.220]   Hello, Pastor John, my name is Charlotte
[00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.980]   and I live in Yorkshire, England.
[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.260]   My question for you has puzzled me for years.
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.740]   In 1 Peter 3, eight, Peter urges the exiled Christians
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.660]   to have unity of mind.
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.500]   That's Peter's exact phrase, unity of mind.
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.340]   I once heard a preacher say that this unity of mind
[00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.980]   does not, however, mean uniformity.
[00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.300]   Since then, I've struggled to understand the difference.
[00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.220]   We have basic creeds and confessions
[00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.740]   that we must all agree on
[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.340]   as the very foundations of Christianity.
[00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.460]   Beliefs otherwise would be heretical.
[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.520]   How then can we not have uniformity?
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.060]   What is this unity of mind?
[00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.820]   Peter didn't insert a clause that left this
[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.420]   just to church leaders only to pursue.
[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.860]   So how does the individual Christian pursue this?
[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.940]   - I've often shared this perplexity
[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.940]   about how unified our convictions and our preferences
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.220]   and our opinions as Christians should be.
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.940]   But I've gotten help, especially in recent years,
[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.060]   by distinguishing between passages
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.900]   that deal with unified convictions or views of God
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.780]   or Christ or salvation on the one hand,
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.780]   and passages that deal with a unified mindset,
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.660]   or what we might call,
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.180]   because we don't have a better English word
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.180]   for this Greek idea of attitude set or disposition.
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.460]   And I feel warranted in making that distinction
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.380]   not only because there are some peculiar Greek words
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.940]   that Paul uses for mindset that are different,
[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.820]   say, from theological convictions,
[00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.000]   but also because, for example, in Romans 14,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.660]   he actually deals with differences of conviction
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.780]   that Christians have without pushing them
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.120]   toward unanimity of conviction,
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.220]   but rather pushing them toward unanimity
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.100]   in a certain mindset about how to handle the differences.
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.220]   So let me try to illustrate what I mean
[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.020]   about the difference between theological convictions
[00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.460]   on the one hand and unified mindset on the other hand.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.440]   So here, for example, in Ephesians 4, 12, and 13,
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.240]   it says, "Christ gave pastors and teachers to the church
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.380]   "to equip the saints for the work of the ministry,
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.700]   "for the building up of the body of Christ,
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.300]   "until," well, this is where it's all supposed to be moving,
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.300]   "until we all attain to the unity of the faith
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.200]   "and of the knowledge of the Son of God."
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.780]   So that's what I'm referring to when I say
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.280]   that the Bible really does urge us
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.280]   toward seeking theological, biblical unity,
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.800]   a unified understanding of God and Christ and man
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.400]   and salvation and how to live the Christian life.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   And I think the best strategy for moving toward that goal
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.720]   is to humbly and faithfully immerse ourselves in the Bible
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.240]   seeking to understand it with all the resources,
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.240]   historically, devotionally, academically, that we can.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.200]   And then as we grow and speak and preach
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.200]   and teach and write and live that truth, as we see it,
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.320]   we pray, we pray earnestly that God would bring more
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.360]   and more people into a true understanding of His word.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.280]   But I don't think that's what Peter is talking about
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.280]   in 1 Peter 3, 8, which is what Charlotte is asking about.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.840]   So here in 1 Peter 3, 8,
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.120]   and in most places in the New Testament
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.120]   where being of one mind is referred to,
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.080]   the idea is not mainly to urge us
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.960]   toward identical convictions, as good as that is,
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.960]   but toward a common unified mindset or attitude.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.960]   And here we bump into those peculiar Greek words
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.200]   that I mentioned earlier.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.820]   There's this amazing Greek word
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.360]   that takes on lots of meanings
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.680]   when it combines with different prefixes.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.960]   The word I'm talking about,
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.440]   for the few Greek readers who listen to us,
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.160]   the stem is phron, like phron-o or phron-es.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.200]   And the basic idea is mindset,
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.960]   or a meaning that we don't have in English.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.640]   We could say attitude set, not just a way of thinking,
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.480]   but a combined way of thinking and feeling
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.160]   or a combination of conviction and disposition.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.840]   So for example, here's some of those combinations
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.600]   where you put the prefix on the front
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.240]   and it changes the meaning.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.960]   Homophron-es, oneness of mindset.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.600]   Topinophron-es, lowly mindset.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.760]   Cataphron-es, contrary mindset.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.360]   Aphron-es, foolish mindset.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.800]   Cuperphron-es, self-exalting mindset.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.040]   Paraphron-es, insane mindset.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.880]   Cupsilophron-es, a haughty mindset.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.360]   It's amazing, that word,
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.360]   with the service it does in the New Testament
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.200]   when it talks about how we think and feel.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.040]   Now the point is simply to say that this stem,
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.240]   phron-es or phron-o, is used not mainly
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.360]   referring to ideas or viewpoints.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.720]   It's mainly referring to particular dispositions
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.240]   or mindsets or attitudes.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.680]   So now here we are in 1 Peter 3.8, which reads like this.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.880]   "Finally, all of you have unity of mind."
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.800]   Homophron-es, one mindset.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.120]   Unified, similar mindset.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.200]   And then he goes on.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.760]   "Sympathy, brotherly love, tender heart."
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.040]   And then he ends, "Humble mind."
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.600]   Topinophron-es.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.240]   So homophron-es, unity of mindset at the beginning.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.360]   Topinophron-es, humble mindset at the end.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.240]   So Peter is giving a list of five things
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.280]   that Christians are to have.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.080]   And the list begins with unified mindset
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.280]   and it ends with humble mindset.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.240]   So my understanding is that the humble mindset
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.240]   defines what the unified mindset is supposed to be.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.400]   Be unified in the humble mindset
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.280]   that all Christians should have.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.240]   And I feel especially confirmed
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.640]   in putting those two together,
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.360]   the word at the front, the word at the back of those lists,
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.360]   because we find an amazingly similar combination of words
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.480]   in Romans 12, 16.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.160]   The ESV says, "Live in harmony with one another."
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.720]   Now, literally, it's be of the same mindset.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.640]   Ta'autafronuntes.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.640]   Be of the same mindset toward each other.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.440]   And then he explains, "Don't be haughty."
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.720]   That is, don't have a self-exalting mindset.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.400]   Kypse lafronuntes.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.320]   But associate with the lowly.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.560]   Never be wise in your own sight.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.840]   Fronimo parha atois.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.880]   In other words, here's another way of saying
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.480]   don't have a self-exalting mindset.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.800]   Have a humble mindset.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.160]   Same cluster of thoughts that we had in 1 Peter 3.8.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.480]   So the call to unity of mind
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.840]   is defined by Paul and by Peter
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.840]   as a humble mindset, not a self-exalting mindset.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:39.080]   Then, probably the most important passage of all
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.440]   in the New Testament on the unity of mind or mindset
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.480]   is Philippians 2, 2 through 5.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.760]   And it's a remarkable sequence of thought.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.000]   It goes like this.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.200]   Paul says, "Complete my joy,
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.200]   complete my joy by being of the same mind."
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.800]   That is, having the same mindset.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.560]   To autofronete.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.000]   Having the same love,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.440]   which defines the mindset as a loving one.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.040]   Being in full accord.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.800]   That is, I'm with you, heart and soul.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.600]   Sumsukhoi.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.120]   Just like in Acts 4:32,
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:23.080]   where it says the church was of one heart and one soul.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:27.640]   And then he says, "And of one mind."
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.160]   That is, one mindset.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.840]   Henfronuntes.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.640]   Now he lays out.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:38.200]   So having called them to one mindset, one mindset, one love,
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:43.200]   he calls out the nature of the mindset in three steps.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.640]   And this just goes right to the heart of the Christian life
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.760]   and what it means to be unified in this way.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.120]   Number one, verse three,
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.400]   "Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit,
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:02.400]   but in humility count others more significant
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.240]   than yourselves."
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.080]   I think that means count them worthy
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.640]   of your sacrificial service.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.320]   Second, verse four,
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.920]   "Let each of you look not only to his own interests,
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.960]   but also to the interests of others."
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.760]   Third, verse five, and it's the biggest,
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.680]   "Have this mind," tuta fronete,
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.880]   "Have this mindset among yourselves,
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.600]   which is yours in Christ Jesus."
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.360]   And then he unfolds that glorious display of service
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.480]   and sacrifice and self-emptying and humility
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.120]   that Jesus did when he left his father's throne
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.960]   and became man.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.960]   So the unity Paul and Peter are calling for in these texts,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.640]   including 1 Peter 3, 8.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.000]   Namely, Peter, what he's calling for
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.360]   is focused not on having the same opinions,
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.640]   though there's a level at which that really matters,
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.880]   but rather what's being stressed in these texts
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.160]   is the same mindset, the same disposition of heart,
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.520]   the same attitude,
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.520]   namely a lowly, sacrificial, servant heart for others.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:20.240]   Maybe one last quick glance at Romans 14
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.600]   to draw out the difference between the way Paul handles
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.440]   when you can't agree.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.960]   So Romans 14, there are real differences of opinion, right?
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.640]   Real differences of conviction among the Christians.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:36.120]   So verse two says, "One person believes he may eat anything
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.360]   while the weak person eats only vegetables."
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.360]   They just can't get it.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.000]   They can't get it together in Romans.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.520]   They don't agree.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.920]   And verse five says, "One person esteems one day
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.640]   above another while another esteems all days alike."
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.840]   They're just stuck.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.120]   It's a disagreement and it's not going away.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.880]   And I'm sure Paul really would prefer
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.400]   that they all agree on these things.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.840]   That would make life a lot easier, but they don't.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.480]   And his primary approach to that problem is not,
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:10.480]   at least not in Romans 14, not to get them all to agree.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.880]   Well, what does he do?
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.440]   And I only mentioned one thing.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.640]   He does several unusual things.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.040]   And you need to read the whole chapter
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.160]   to see all the ways he approaches this,
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.800]   but here's goes right to the heart of the matter.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.800]   He penetrates to a common mindset
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.600]   that knits their souls together.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.480]   He says this, this is verse two and six.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.520]   "The one who observes the day,
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:43.000]   observes it in honor of the Lord."
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.080]   The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord,
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.560]   since he gives thanks to God.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.600]   While the one who abstains,
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.600]   abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.280]   In other words, he's showing them how to lay hold
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:05.280]   on a unified mindset of doing all to the honor of the Lord
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.400]   and not despising each other.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.560]   That's what's gonna hold them together,
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.560]   that radical God-centeredness that puts the Lord first.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.640]   However, you may disagree on the application.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:24.000]   So my conclusion for Charlotte's question that she asked us
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.600]   is that while theological biblical unity of conviction
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.640]   is important and we should pursue it,
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.520]   as Paul and Peter did often in their writings,
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.360]   even the very existence of their writings
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.960]   is a pursuit of that kind of unity.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.840]   Nevertheless, just as often
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.660]   as they explicitly said things about that,
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:50.080]   Peter and Paul press us toward unity of mindset,
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:55.080]   unity of attitude set or disposition or attitude
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:00.280]   that is marked by humility and service and sacrifice
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:07.120]   and a Christ-exalting motive for all we do.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.760]   That's the unity that he's talking about
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.080]   in 1 Peter 3:8.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.760]   - Yeah, God-centered mindset or attitude
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.360]   or dispositional unity marked by love.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.680]   That's a humble way to shape
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.200]   this entire conversation on unity.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.680]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.440]   And speaking of love and unity,
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.240]   love covers a multitude of sins.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.760]   Peter makes that point also in 1 Peter,
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.320]   a little later, a chapter later in 1 Peter 4, verse eight.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.920]   So what does that mean when love covers a multitude of sins?
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.960]   How does that work?
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.240]   Whose sins do we cover?
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.040]   How do we cover them?
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.040]   We'll find out next time on the other side of the weekend.
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.360]   Great question coming up.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.520]   I'm your host, Tommy Ranke,
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.240]   and we'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.240]   Have a great weekend.
