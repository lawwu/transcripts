[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.400]   Okay. So we have a bunch of questions that have come in.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.600]   Alan, Mike, and Christine will be answering them.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.600]   And we're going to try and go through them fairly quickly
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.600]   because there's quite a bit.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.800]   So starting off, we have a question
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.500]   as to why ETFs are considered more tax efficient
[00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.800]   than mutual funds.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.400]   And I guess I would add to that,
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.100]   are there particular asset classes or types of assets
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.400]   where that difference is significant or not significant?
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.700]   >> The reason gets pretty technical.
[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.300]   Also, this reason, by the way, doesn't apply to Vanguard.
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.400]   You can ignore it for Vanguard.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.200]   Because with Vanguard specifically,
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.500]   and this might change in the near future,
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.700]   as Vanguard had a patent on a way of creating their funds.
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.700]   That patent expired, so now other companies are copying it.
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.500]   And so at Vanguard, the ETFs
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.700]   and mutual funds are literally the same fund.
[00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.100]   They're just different share classes.
[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.700]   So the taxes are going to be the same.
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.900]   So at Vanguard, it's not true
[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.200]   that ETFs are more tax efficient than mutual funds.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.200]   At other companies, it often is.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.300]   And the reason for that is when a mutual fund needs
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.000]   to raise cash, it has to sell stuff often.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.100]   And the mutual fund often has to raise cash
[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.600]   whenever investors sell shares of the fund.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.200]   So investors sell shares of the fund, which happens sometimes.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.700]   So the fund has to sell stuff.
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.400]   So you've got capital gains.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.700]   And then the remaining shareholders are stuck
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.300]   with the tax bill for those capital gains.
[00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.000]   With an ETF, that's not how it works.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.600]   With an ETF, we have what we call authorized participants
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.500]   who are huge, like investment banks, Goldman Sachs, Chase,
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.000]   things like that, and the fund company can basically swap giant
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.600]   shares of the ETF -- so this is a bit of a simplification --
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.000]   giant shares of the ETF for securities with one
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.800]   of those other companies.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.100]   And when they do that, that's a way to --
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.900]   they can raise cash without having to sell something.
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.000]   They can hand over the securities to another company,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.600]   and that's not considered a taxable event, essentially.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.700]   And they can, in fact, pick the securities
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.600]   that have the lowest cost basis.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.900]   So those would be the ones
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.400]   that if they sold them they would have the highest gains.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.100]   So they can just kind of periodically get rid of those
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.700]   without actually having to pay tax.
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.000]   And so it's just like a neat trick that ETFs have
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.100]   that mutual funds don't, although we're probably going
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.300]   to see that change as other companies copy the thing
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.600]   that Vanguard's doing.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.900]   >> Okay. I think that was a great way
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.000]   of dealing with a complicated topic.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.700]   Alan, you spoke about selling high and buying low.
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.600]   The question is how do you know when to rebalance a portfolio?
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.300]   >> You know, as long as you rebalance, it's a good thing.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.500]   Some people say every six months, every year, whatever.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.800]   My personal opinion is to set a tolerance.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.800]   So, for instance, if you set a 60% stock portfolio,
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.400]   you might want to set a tolerance
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.800]   of six percentage points.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.300]   Below 54, you have to buy.
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.400]   Above 66, you have to sell.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.100]   Now, the main reason to do that is
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.800]   so that you're keeping your risk level relatively constant.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.000]   Now, it happened to work out brilliantly
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.400]   because of the March 2020.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.400]   Between February 19th and March 23rd,
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.000]   33 days in 2020, stocks fell 35%.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.500]   As I mentioned, I was out of tolerance.
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.000]   I had to buy.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.200]   I'd be lying through my teeth if I said it was easy.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.100]   So, as long as you rebalance, I think it's a good thing.
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.900]   I personally believe in setting a tolerance
[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.600]   so that on average, it's once or twice a year.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.400]   >> Okay. We had a question talking about index funds.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.300]   But we know, we all see, that there are always some funds
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.500]   that beat the market in any given year and sometimes for longer.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.600]   So, why not choose the funds that beat the market?
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.400]   >> If I had a crystal ball, I would.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.400]   I would also be a billionaire.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.900]   There's no persistence.
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.500]   And Bill Miller's value trust beat the S&P 500 for 25 years
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.500]   in a row and he ended up losing more people
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.400]   than he ever made for others.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.000]   >> I can just add a little bit of color to that.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.600]   We have a ton of data at Morningstar.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.500]   And when we mine that data to look at the factors
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.900]   that contribute to good or bad fund performance,
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.400]   it comes back to costs much more than performance.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.700]   And so, index funds have that built-in advantage
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.200]   of very low costs.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.100]   Costs also tend to be persistent.
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.100]   If a fund has low costs, it tends to continue to have low costs.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.500]   And so, the benefits accrue to index funds for that reason.
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.200]   I would also say as a caveat, when we slice and dice our data,
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.400]   what we see when we look at the subset of active funds
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.700]   that have very low costs,
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.700]   so I would add Vanguard's active funds into the mix,
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.600]   we start to see a much more competitive universe.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.300]   So, if you do want to own some active funds around the margins
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.200]   or, you know, even as core holdings,
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.800]   I would just do yourself the favor of starting
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.500]   with the very inexpensive subset.
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.600]   Because that is-- at least that group has a fighting shot
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.300]   at performing reasonably well relative to an index fund.
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.700]   >> This one is for Mike Piper.
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.900]   Can you talk about when you should consider converting funds
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.300]   from a traditional IRA to a Roth,
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.000]   given that you'll need to pay taxes when you do that?
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.600]   Should it be during the accumulation years
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.700]   or during retirement years?
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.700]   >> Yeah. So, a Roth conversion is when you take money
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.900]   from a tax-deferred account and you move it to a Roth account.
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.200]   And when you do that, you have to pay tax on the money
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.600]   that you move over.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.400]   And the general idea is that you would do
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.400]   that whenever your income is unusually low,
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.200]   because an unusually low income typically means an unusually
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.500]   low tax rate.
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.100]   And so, the idea is you're taking advantage now
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.400]   of this temporarily low tax rate that you have.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.900]   Pay tax now at this low tax rate on a part
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.800]   of the tax-deferred money.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.300]   Then it's in a Roth account going forward
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.700]   and you don't have to pay taxes on it later.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.100]   So, most of the time, the times
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.900]   that we have an unusually low tax rate
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.700]   in our lives are we've retired
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.100]   and Social Security hasn't started yet.
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.400]   That's the typical window.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.700]   There are some years during the accumulation stage
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.500]   where you might have an unusually low tax rate,
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.500]   like if you take a sabbatical or something like that.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.600]   But typically, Roth conversions are more likely
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.900]   to be a retirement tax planning tool.
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.600]   >> We had a question about something
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.800]   that was mentioned almost in passing at the session.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.400]   What is factor investing?
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:05.900]   >> Can you hear me?
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.100]   Okay. It's active investing.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.700]   It's picking certain stocks that you think will outperform.
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.900]   So, for instance, small companies
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.900]   and value-beaten-up companies had a very long history
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.200]   of beating the market.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.600]   Again, that was backward-looking.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.800]   And it did not work going forward.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.200]   And by the way, it was never billed by Eugene Fahm
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.300]   and Ken French as a free lunch.
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.200]   It was compensation for taking on more risk.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.600]   And that risk has really shown up.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.500]   And the only way to guarantee that you're going
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.000]   to get the full return of the market
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.900]   and beat most investors is to have every factor.
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.100]   So, in other words, not tilt, own every stock,
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.900]   taking all the knowledge of the investors
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.000]   and buying a total stock index fund or total international.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   >> I would just add a quick point on that front.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.400]   I agree with everything Alan just said.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.300]   One subset that I'm interested in from the standpoint
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.300]   of factor investing would be kind
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.300]   of a dividend growth strategy.
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.000]   So, Vanguard has a couple of great funds in this realm,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.200]   Vanguard Dividend Appreciation, which is the pure index fund,
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.700]   and Vanguard Dividend Growth, which is an active fund.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.200]   And the reason why I find them intriguing,
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.600]   especially for retirees or people who are moving
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.900]   into draw-down mode, is that they have a pattern
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.100]   of much lower volatility, not much,
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.800]   but meaningfully lower volatility than the total market.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.300]   So, I feel like if they help a retiree make peace
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.500]   with the equities that they should have
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.600]   to outrun inflation over time, I feel like, you know,
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.200]   maybe adding a bit of that
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.800]   to a total market index is not a bad factor to tilt toward
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.300]   because it is a way to bring down the volatility
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.000]   in the portfolio.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.700]   This tends to be a higher quality subset
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.800]   of the whole market.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.600]   So, that would be one factor that I would be like,
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:05.200]   "Eh, that kind of makes sense to me."
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.900]   >> And a somewhat related question,
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.100]   what are your thoughts on market-weighted
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.100]   versus equal-weighted indexes?
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.800]   >> It's active investing.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.900]   It was really hot a long time ago.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.200]   It is really underperformed.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.000]   Guess what?
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.200]   It's something like well over a quarter
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.100]   of the US stock market are now in the fantastic seven.
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.500]   The conventional wisdom was
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.700]   as large cap growth companies were way overvalued.
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.600]   Guess what had just about all of the return
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.400]   of the global stock market this year?
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.800]   Those seven.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.500]   >> So, just to be clear, you're saying
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.200]   that an equal-weighted index is active management
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.400]   because it's not following the market weight.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.300]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:57.100]   Because you're underweighting the Apple and Alphabets
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:02.500]   and NVIDIA and underweighting those that are at the bottom.
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.800]   I'm sorry, overweighting those that are at the bottom.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.000]   So, in other words, passive investing is taking all
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   of the knowledge of millions of investors around the world
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.700]   and harnessing that knowledge and guaranteeing
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:20.000]   that you're going to beat most people in that stock market.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.400]   I'm not opinionated.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.200]   >> A question for Mike on 529 plans.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.400]   Can you invest in what you want in a 529 or is it only
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.800]   in predefined portfolios?
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.400]   >> It's generally going to be predefined portfolios.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.600]   So, firstly, there's state-specific plans
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:46.100]   and sometimes you might have some state tax benefit
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.600]   for contributing to the plan that is run by your state.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.400]   Like maybe you get a state tax credit.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.200]   And so, then you're kind of just stuck
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.800]   with whatever investment options that they provide.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.400]   Otherwise, you can, if there isn't a state tax benefit
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.100]   that you're trying to get, then you can pick any 529 plan.
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.100]   And so, while you can't literally invest in anything
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.500]   in the plan because you're still limited
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.900]   to whatever options they make available, the fact
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.400]   that you can pick from so many different plans sort of means
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.400]   that you could pick whatever you want.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.500]   >> Thank you.
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.100]   Here's a sort of a specific scenario,
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.500]   but I think maybe it has broader implications as well.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.400]   The question is my husband and I will have two kids
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.000]   in college for a two-year overlap.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.900]   We have stocks that have done well over time.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.900]   If push comes to shove and we need dollars for tuition,
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:40.900]   do we sell the stocks or do we take out a loan?
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.400]   >> I would say evaluate the tax consequences,
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.900]   but my bias would be to, especially
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.800]   with interest rates going up and loans getting more,
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:55.400]   much more expensive than they were, my bias would be to use
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.600]   that appreciation to help pay for school.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.400]   >> I would concur.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.800]   I mean, it does depend.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.500]   Investing is simple, taxes aren't.
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.400]   It depends on a whole lot of things.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.400]   But, in general, you would not want
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.800]   to take out a loan, in my opinion.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.000]   >> Okay.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.100]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.100]   >> Yeah, there are some tax strategies
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:23.900]   like gifting if the kids aren't on your tax return.
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:27.100]   And they may be in a 0% long-term capital gains rate,
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.300]   and that's a wonderful strategy.
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.600]   But there are just zillions of permutations
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.500]   and combinations of tax strategies.
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.100]   >> One thing, it wasn't super clear from the phrasing,
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.800]   but it sounded like maybe the stocks there are individual
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.300]   stocks, in which case, if that is the case,
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.500]   I'd be extra inclined to say, hey, this is a great excuse
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.100]   to diversify away from that,
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.600]   to eliminate that risk in our portfolio.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.100]   >> Or an expensive active fund.
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.900]   >> Which relates to the next question, is if someone wants
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:04.600]   to lighten up on their high-fee funds and move the money
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.000]   into low-cost funds, such as Vanguard index funds,
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   how do you manage a transition like that?
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.100]   >> Carefully.
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.500]   You want to look at marginal tax brackets.
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.600]   You want to look at how expensive those active funds
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.500]   are, you want to look at, you know, all the details
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.900]   of the taxes that you're going to pay.
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.700]   Now, and it's really a timing issue,
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.100]   because eventually you're going to pay taxes unless you die,
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.400]   and step up basis.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.800]   So, it's a security by security analysis.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.800]   And a lot of what I do are the, you know,
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.000]   trying to deal with the complexities
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.200]   of moving towards simplicities and lower costs.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.300]   >> Can I just jump in, too?
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.500]   I would say, you know, obviously, if it's,
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.300]   or maybe not obviously, if it's in some sort
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.400]   of tax-sheltered account, just prune away
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.700]   at that high-cost investment and not worry about it,
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.400]   because you won't pay taxes to make that trade.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.600]   The other thing I would say about high-cost active funds is
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.500]   that many of them have been serial capital gains
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.300]   distributors, especially active funds.
[00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:14.000]   And so, if you've been receiving those distributions and having
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.700]   to pay taxes on them, you're able to step
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.900]   up your cost basis to reflect that.
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:23.000]   So, you may have sort of, it's not ideal, but you may have kind
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.600]   of prepaid your tax bill that would be due
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.800]   on making those changes.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:33.300]   So, check your cost basis to see where you are, and you may find
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:38.200]   that you're fairly close to the fund's current NAV, and selling
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.600]   and getting into a lower-cost investment portfolio might also
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.900]   be tax-efficient going forward,
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.900]   and it will also potentially not cost you
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.700]   that much in terms of a tax bill.
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.400]   >> Okay. I want to thank the three of you very much
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.500]   and give us a few minutes to wrap
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.600]   up with a few final remarks from Christine.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.400]   [ Applause ]
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.400]   >> Well, thanks, Karen.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.400]   I want to thank all of you for being here for day one
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.700]   of Bogleheads University.
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.800]   I want to thank all of our instructors,
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.300]   and just have a couple of parting comments.
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.900]   One is that we have a cocktail reception in an hour,
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.000]   so starting at 5 o'clock, it'll be in this room,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.500]   but the hotel staff will get it all changed
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.700]   out to suit a cocktail reception.
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.100]   We'll have someone at the door handing out tickets.
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.100]   Each person will get one drink ticket
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.500]   that you can use however you see fit or give it away
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:34.000]   if you don't want it, and then we will switch to a cash bar
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.600]   if you want additional drinks beyond that one drink ticket.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.900]   So just grab your ticket when you come in,
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.400]   and I think that's all I had.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.200]   Thank you all for being here today.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.800]   We really appreciate it.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.800]   [ Applause ]
