[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   I should like to read to you the words found in Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.680]   in the third chapter, beginning at the first verse.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.040]   The third chapter of Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians, beginning at the first
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.040]   verse.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.840]   "And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.720]   as unto babes in Christ.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.960]   I have fed you with milk, and not with meat; for hitherto ye were not able to bear it,
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.280]   neither yet now are ye able.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.720]   For ye are yet carnal.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.920]   For whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal,
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.000]   and walk as men?
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.520]   For while one saith, I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollos, are ye not carnal?
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.680]   Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos?
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.000]   But ministers, by whom he believed, even as the Lord gave to every man.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.280]   I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.400]   So then, neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.400]   the increase.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.920]   Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one, and every man shall receive his own
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.240]   reward according to his own labour.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.600]   For we are labourers together with God.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.720]   Ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.520]   According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise master builder, I have
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.960]   laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.960]   But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:55.240]   For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:02.680]   Now if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay,
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.560]   stubble, every man's work shall be made manifest.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.360]   For the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.940]   And the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.900]   If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.480]   If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:36.000]   But he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.120]   Now I want to call attention particularly to that eleventh verse in which the apostle
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:52.880]   says, "For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.600]   Now these words come here at the beginning of this long epistle, this long first epistle
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.760]   of Paul to the Corinthians.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.500]   Why did he ever write this letter?
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.200]   Well we can be quite certain that he didn't write it merely because he was fond of writing.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.280]   The apostle Paul was not a literary man, and he didn't write merely to interest people
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.960]   or to relieve his own feelings.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.720]   He was primarily an evangelist, a preacher, a teacher.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.120]   And whenever he does write, there is generally some reason for it.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.920]   There has always been something that has called forth his letter, and that is particularly
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.000]   true in this case.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.040]   It was he who had founded and established this church at Corinth, but after his departure
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.400]   certain other teachings, this man Apollos amongst them, had been there preaching.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.000]   And the result of this was that the church at Corinth was tending to divide itself up
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   into factions which had formed themselves and gathered themselves around certain persons.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.160]   He deals with this in the first chapter.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.160]   Some said, "I am of Paul."
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.840]   Others said, "I am of Apollos."
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.640]   Others said, "I am of Cephas."
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.800]   And others said, "We are of Christ."
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.000]   The church was dividing in terms of these human personalities.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.320]   But in addition to that, there was false teaching creeping into the church, and it took the
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:26.480]   form of philosophy, what he calls earthly or worldly wisdom, human wisdom.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.240]   And that led to a denial of the literal, physical fact of the resurrection and various other
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.240]   things.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.920]   It was a church that was in trouble, and it was for that reason that the apostle writes
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.600]   his letter to them.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.200]   Why does he do so?
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.640]   Is it merely that he is jealous of his own reputation?
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.240]   No, that was never the case with him.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.240]   He writes because he is concerned about these people.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.560]   He feels that these developments in the life of the church are threatening the whole life
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.320]   of the church.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.320]   It isn't merely that they are wrong on certain incidental matters, matters which are more
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.960]   or less indifferent.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:13.040]   He feels that the trouble lies down at the very foundation itself, and that the whole
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.560]   life of the church, therefore, is in danger.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.080]   That's the reason why he writes the letter.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.920]   It's exactly the same reason, of course, that had led him to go around preaching as he had
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.280]   done, suffering indignities and persecutions and trials.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.280]   It was, as he says to the Romans, "I am a debtor to all men, debtor both to the Greeks
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.800]   and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise."
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.360]   These men had a burden for the souls of men, and so he traveled around and preached.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.680]   And here it is this same concern that leads him to write his letter.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.440]   And as I say, he does so because he feels that the thing that is afflicting the life
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:04.520]   of this church is a fundamental matter.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.560]   And it is to that I want to call your attention tonight.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.440]   In this interesting manner, the great apostle reminds us of one of the great, if not the
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.040]   greatest, central verity of our Christian faith.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.920]   Let me put it to you like this.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:29.080]   The first thing he lays down is this, the absolute necessity of having a foundation
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.440]   to our lives.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.560]   That's his first proposition.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.400]   A foundation is the most important thing of all.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:45.600]   Now this is something that scarcely needs a demonstration in a way.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.600]   And yet as you look at modern men and as you look at the modern world, I think it becomes
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:57.040]   increasingly clear that this is the thing of all others that needs to be emphasized.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:03.360]   It is something that is emphasized constantly in the Bible itself.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.880]   Our Lord has established this once and forever in that well-known parable that he spoke at
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.840]   the end of the Sermon on the Mount of the two men who built their houses.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.560]   One built his house upon a rock, the other built his house upon the sand.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:25.640]   And you remember the consequences that happened in both cases when the trials and the troubles
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.840]   and the tribulations came.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:34.040]   The house on the rock stood, the house on the sand collapsed and fell, and great was
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.360]   the fall thereof.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.840]   The Bible is a book that is constantly telling us that what we need above everything else
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.600]   is a foundation to the whole of our life and living.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:54.280]   Now this is something which I think we are ready to recognize, most of us, in the ordinary
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.440]   realms of life.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:01.600]   For instance, when you are building a house, what is more important than the foundation?
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:09.480]   Building these great buildings, these skyscrapers, how important it is to have an adequate foundation.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:16.040]   But somehow or another, mankind doesn't realize that this is equally necessary with regard
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.680]   to the whole of life.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:24.000]   And it seems to me that this is the central trouble with this present generation to which
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.420]   you and I belong.
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.440]   It is the absence of a foundation.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.320]   Now the world is very well aware of many problems.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:39.800]   You can scarcely pick up a newspaper without seeing some problem or another dealt with
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.120]   somewhere or another.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:47.120]   The governments of the world are aware of particular problems.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.200]   The educationists are aware of them, the sociologists are aware of them.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:57.560]   Indeed our generation, our century, has been characterized above everything else by the
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:05.440]   multiplicity of new institutions and organizations which have been set up to deal with the various
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.560]   particular problems connected with life and living.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.680]   There are new organizations which some of us are old enough to remember coming into
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:19.520]   existence I think at random, something like the Marriage Guidance Council.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.520]   This is something new.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:27.080]   It has arisen because of the terrible problem of separation and divorce and so on.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:33.040]   Many institutions and organizations have arisen to try to deal with the problem of youth,
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:38.000]   hostels, established lectureships, books written.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.560]   Well I needn't waste your time with this.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.560]   You are familiar with all this.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.880]   The world recognizes that there are many, many problems.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:51.280]   You get them in industry, the problem of slackness and indolence, the problem of dishonesty,
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:59.080]   theft and pilfering, the difficulty between masters and workers and so on, and the whole
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:03.000]   state of the world, the iron curtains and the divisions.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.120]   The world is well aware of all these problems and the world is very busy in trying to deal
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.120]   with them.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:16.120]   But the great message of the Bible is this, that the world very largely is wasting its
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.680]   time in doing this.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.680]   Why?
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:27.280]   Well, for the simple reason that it has ignored the most essential problem of all, and that
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.920]   is the problem of the foundation.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:36.200]   Now this thing was brought very freshly to my mind not long ago by a case that was given
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.480]   great prominence in Britain.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.680]   A man had bought a house from another man, it seemed a very nice and attractive house,
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:49.920]   and the man had gone into it with his family, but after but a few weeks he began to observe
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.800]   cracks in the wall and the floor began to slope.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.560]   And he tried to get men to patch them up and they tried to plaster over the cracks and
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:05.640]   readjust here and there, but the condition continued and indeed got worse and worse.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.080]   And at last he called in an expert architect and he had no difficulty in diagnosing the
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.080]   condition.
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:17.960]   It was entirely due to the fact that the foundation of the house from the beginning had been totally
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.960]   inadequate.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:24.560]   Now that seems to me to be a parable and a picture of the world in which you and I are
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.120]   living at the present time.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.760]   The world has forgotten foundations.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:38.920]   It has forgotten these absolutes without which life can never be successful at all.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.680]   In other words, the tragedy of the modern world is its uncertainty.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.200]   It's become uncertain about everything.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:53.160]   There are no foundation principles at the bottom of the life of most people.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.960]   Take it for instance in the matter of truth itself.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.320]   The world doesn't seem to know where it is.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.640]   The old categories seem to have gone.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:08.080]   There was a time when men recognised certain divisions and distinctions in the realm of
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.080]   thought.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.680]   They no longer do so.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:18.240]   There was a time when they thought that matter was more or less solid and you could talk
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.680]   about the solidity of substance and so on, and then there was the spiritual realm, but
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.900]   by now they know that matter is a mass of activity.
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:31.640]   And so there is this great confusion in the realm of thought.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:37.360]   The modern man asks the old question of Pilate, "What is truth?"
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.360]   He doesn't know.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.940]   He is confused.
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.040]   Everything is moving and is changing.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.840]   A kind of doctrine of relativity has come in, in the realm of thought as well as in
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.480]   the realm of science.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.160]   People say, "Well, you can't be sure of anything.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:13:00.520]   New truth may dawn, new insights may arrive," and thus mankind is utterly bewildered, even
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.840]   in the matter of thought and thinking.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:10.080]   And no less when you come to the realm of conduct and behaviour and of morals, it is
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.680]   even worse.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:18.000]   You are familiar with this, the tragic story of these years in which we are living.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.680]   There are so many today who don't even recognize the category of morality at all.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:31.000]   The problem today is not so much immorality as amorality, non-morality, the refusal to
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.920]   recognize that there is such a thing as morality at all.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.160]   Now I think you'll agree with this.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.240]   We've lost our standards again.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.200]   There's no foundation.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.320]   Things that everybody would have agreed about even twenty or thirty years ago as being utterly,
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.120]   highly immoral are being defended today.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:58.240]   Even in the country from which I come, they've recently legalized certain homosexual practices
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.760]   between consenting adults.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:05.560]   Now that would have been unthinkable, I say, about twenty or thirty years ago.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.560]   What's the cause of this?
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:11.960]   Well, it is that people no longer recognize any standards.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.680]   There's no foundation.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.800]   The argument is, anything I want to do is right and legitimate for me.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.800]   I mustn't lay down these absolutes.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.800]   That's dismissed as Victorianism.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.800]   What a man wants to do is surely right.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.120]   It's a part of his self-expression.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:34.080]   Well now, the result of all this is that life today is full of uncertainty.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:39.320]   The clever people, the intellectuals, are more and more approximating to the condition
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:44.840]   of those Athenians of whom we read of in Act 17, who spent their time in nothing else but
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.200]   either to tell or to hear some new thing.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:53.960]   The dilettante attitude towards life, reading something new, always after the novel.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:57.120]   No standards, no certainty, no knowledge.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.680]   And exactly the same, as I say, in the realm of morals.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:07.440]   And so, the world today is living an aimless kind of life.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.760]   People say you can't be sure of anything.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.720]   You can't have any certainty.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.440]   So what's the point of worrying?
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.880]   Let us eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:23.760]   And here is mankind, being tossed about, thrown hither and thither, the victims of circumstance
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:30.520]   and chance, afraid of what the moral may bring forth, and having no certainty whatsoever
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.840]   about anything.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:37.400]   Just in television, being entertained, turning to drink and drugs.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.040]   Now I'm not saying all this to condemn the modern men.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.160]   I'm simply describing the condition.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.000]   I am sorry for the modern men.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.520]   You remember how we are told about our Lord.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:55.200]   He looked out upon mankind and he saw it as sheep without a shepherd.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.080]   He was sorry for them.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:02.160]   There they were, like sheep, the victims of marauding dogs.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.000]   No one to care for them, no one to provide pasture.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.560]   Just victims of anything that might happen at any moment.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.520]   Now that is the state and the condition, surely, of the world.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.040]   It is without a foundation.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:21.160]   Men and women don't know where they are, what they stand for, what they believe, nor
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.600]   what they've got, nor what their outlook is.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.120]   Their life is entirely without a foundation.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:35.840]   Now I'm here to remind you that this is the thing with which the Bible always starts.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:40.480]   The Bible is not just a textbook to tell us how to live in detail.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:45.780]   The Bible is not merely a collection of moral or ethical maxims.
[00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.800]   So many people regard it as that.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.040]   The governments often regard it as that, and ask the church to help them as it were to
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.480]   keep the people in order.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.440]   But that's not the message of the Bible.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:05.200]   The Bible is a message that deals with the great whole question of life and living, the
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.760]   foundation of life.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:15.560]   It is interested in particulars, but primarily it is interested in the whole foundation itself.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:23.520]   And what it says is that men in sin, men out of relationship with God, is just drifting
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:28.780]   helplessly and is without a foundation to his life.
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:34.520]   So his first great need is to find a foundation.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:38.720]   Well then having said that, you notice the apostle goes on to a second proposition, is
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.680]   this.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:52.040]   He asserts that man himself, and left to himself, is completely incapable of providing an adequate
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.200]   foundation for himself.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:18:05.040]   Other foundation, he says, can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.920]   Now this is a most important principle.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:14.760]   This is what the Christian church should be proclaiming, that she and she alone can teach
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.480]   men and women about the only foundation.
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:24.520]   It is the first basic fundamental claim of the gospel.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:35.440]   It is, I say, a negative one, that man himself is totally incapable of providing the necessary
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.440]   foundation.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.880]   Our Lord put this in a very well-known word.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.040]   You remember the story of the rich young ruler who came to him?
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.520]   There was a good young man, an excellent man, a moral man, a religious man.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:56.000]   But he'd been listening to our Lord and watching him, and he'd been drawn and attracted.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.280]   And he ran to him saying, "Good master, what must I do that I may inherit eternal life?"
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.400]   And our Lord said, "Why callest thou me good?
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.640]   There is but one good and that is God.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.160]   Thou knowest the commandments, do not kill, do not steal, etc."
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:16.280]   And the young man said, "All these have I observed from my youth upwards."
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.240]   Then our Lord turned to him and said, "One thing thou lackest.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:25.080]   Go sell all that thou hast and come and give to the poor and come take up thy cross and
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.080]   follow me."
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:30.360]   And we are told that the young man went away sorrowful.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:37.080]   And then the disciples seeing this, perhaps they knew this young man, such a noble, fine
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:41.840]   character, such an upright man, they see him going away.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.880]   So they turn to our Lord in amazement and they say, "Who then can be saved?
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.320]   If a man like this isn't saved, if a man like this who's kept the commandments, lived
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:57.840]   such a clean, pure, moral, good, philanthropic life, if this man isn't saved, who then can
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.840]   be saved?"
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:09.360]   And our Lord looked at them and said, "With men it is impossible, but not with God, for
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.680]   with God all things are possible."
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:19.680]   But you see, the basic postulate is this, "With men it is impossible."
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:24.800]   Now my friends, I have to emphasize this for this good reason.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.760]   Why do you think the vast majority of people in the world today are outside the Christian
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:29.760]   church?
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:34.000]   And there's really only one answer to that.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.640]   It is that they think they can get along without her.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.800]   Why do people reject the Christian message?
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.880]   They've never seen the need of a Christian message.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.280]   Why is it that people don't come to Christ?
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.280]   It's the same.
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.280]   They've never seen any need of Christ.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.640]   This is always the difficulty.
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:57.120]   Man still believes that he can solve his problems.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:03.000]   So we have to challenge him at the outset by telling him quite plainly that he never
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.640]   will be able to find the foundation.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.560]   That is why our Lord came into the world.
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.160]   Why did he ever come if man could save himself?
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.720]   Well, he gave the answer.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:20.400]   The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:28.080]   He came because he had to come, because men had failed, because men was impotent.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:33.760]   Now this I see is the most amazing thing, that the human race seems so reluctant to
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:41.480]   recognize this obvious fact, because surely it is a fact.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.480]   Take the great history of civilization.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.000]   You can read many books about this.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.600]   You can read of the great civilizations of the past.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:57.560]   The civilization of Greece, famous for its philosophy, famous for its learning with its
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:04.920]   mighty list of mighty philosophers, Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and the rest.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:11.920]   The maker of philosophy, trying to understand and to solve the problem of mankind, trying
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.560]   to find some sort of utopia.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:19.240]   Now all that was before the Lord Jesus Christ ever came into this world.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.080]   Then take the great culture of Rome.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.360]   Rome was famous for her law.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:30.840]   The legal system of most countries is based in a measure upon Roman law, most of them
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.840]   almost entirely.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.200]   They were famous for it.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.280]   Not only that, the Romans were very famous as government officials.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.520]   They were great planners.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:46.320]   Whenever they conquered a country, they always made great arterial roads.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.960]   They got their system of local government.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:54.160]   Talking about devolution of government, why the Romans were the greatest experts the world
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.600]   has ever known on this.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.800]   You had your central authority in Rome, but they'd learned how to delegate.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.380]   And they appointed their pro consuls like Pontius Pilate and others.
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:09.440]   This was the way in which Rome showed her amazing skill in the art of government.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.440]   What were they trying to do?
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.200]   Well, they were trying to bring some order into life.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:19.080]   They were trying to make the life of men easier and better and more harmonious.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:23.840]   Now there are two great civilizations that have come and gone.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:29.160]   Similar civilizations arose in Egypt, in Persia, in China, and in various other parts of the
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.160]   world.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.800]   But what has it all come to?
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:39.920]   Has all this tremendous effort of men succeeded in finding the foundation?
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:45.240]   And I ask you to answer the question by looking at the world as it is this evening.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:49.960]   Look at the last 2,000 years since Greece and Rome flourished.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:56.160]   Look at this last 100 years in particular, with all our gigantic efforts in education
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:00.920]   and culture and knowledge and our endless devices.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:06.440]   But have we succeeded in solving the problems of the human race?
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.880]   Have we found a foundation for life?
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:13.200]   Well, look at your world this evening and there's the answer.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:18.160]   All the efforts of civilization have led to nothing.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:24.360]   Life is as troubled and as full of trials and of tribulations tonight as it has ever
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.360]   been.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.920]   Now here is the question we've got to face.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:36.120]   Why is it that men, with all his astounding ability and understanding and knowledge,
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:42.560]   have so completely failed to solve this basic problem of life and living?
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:48.960]   Why have we got these teeming problems in the realm of morals at the present time?
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:53.040]   It seems to me there are certain answers to that question which are quite clear.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.720]   Here's the first.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:00.560]   Man's main trouble is that his whole approach is wrong.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:07.480]   And what I mean by that is this, that he's invariably in too much of a hurry.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.680]   He hasn't got time to be bothered about foundations.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.240]   He wants a house.
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.760]   He's like that man who built his house upon the sand.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:18.880]   "Why waste your time," he says, "in digging deep for a foundation and putting in material
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.880]   there?
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:20.880]   I want a house to live in.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.200]   I'm not going to be bothered with all this."
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.040]   He's a man in a hurry, and that's modern men, isn't it?
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.160]   We haven't got time to read.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.520]   We haven't got time to think.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.680]   We must be doing things.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.940]   We're bustling, full of business, and we don't stop and think.
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.340]   We dislike doing that.
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:44.940]   And the result is that we are in so much of a hurry, I say, that all our efforts and endeavours
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.680]   must of necessity come to nothing.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.320]   I think I once put it like this.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.840]   I'm not sure whether I put it in print or not.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:58.920]   But the way I feel today in attempting to deal with these problems reminds me very forcibly
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:06.120]   of men who find that their water supply is polluted and who spend all their time in pouring
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:12.200]   chemicals into the river or into the streams and fail to realise that the source of the
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.600]   pollution is in the lake out of which the supply comes.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:22.040]   You can be so busy and active in tinkering with various aspects of the problem, but if
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:28.320]   the source of pollution is in the source, well then, all your efforts are in vain.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.320]   But that's modern men.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.480]   He's in a hurry.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.320]   He multiplies his institutions.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.440]   He deals with segments on the perimeter of the wheel of life.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:41.280]   He doesn't realise that it's the hub that's wrong and that the collapse is due to this
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.880]   wrongness at the very centre.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.880]   That's one reason.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.880]   But you know something?
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:50.600]   Well, there is something much more serious than that.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:27:00.240]   One that is best can never provide a foundation that is big enough and strong enough to support
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.720]   the necessary superstructure.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.480]   What do I mean?
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.200]   What are the needs of men?
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:11.480]   Well, here is one of the first great needs.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.800]   Man needs to know himself.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.120]   You know, this is the basic question.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.960]   What is man?
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.600]   But the world doesn't stop to ask this.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.920]   It's got its assumptions about this.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.240]   But this is the first question.
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:29.440]   Now those Greek philosophers to whom I've referred, they had a slogan.
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:33.280]   They said, "Know thyself."
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.600]   And there's nothing more important than that.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.840]   But does man know himself?
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:44.840]   You see, while we're tackling all these problems, we haven't stopped to consider what is man?
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:51.640]   Because if man is only an animal, as so many believe today, well then it's not surprising
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.440]   that he should behave like an animal.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:59.040]   If man is an animal like all the beasts of the field, well, it's not surprising that
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:04.220]   you've got promiscuity and that you've got infidelity and that you've got these separations
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.800]   and fights and quarrels.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:10.360]   If man is only an animal and nothing more, well then we shouldn't complain if he behaves
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.360]   like an animal.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.540]   But you see, the world doesn't stop to ask that question.
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.080]   It assumes these things.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:22.200]   And it has these various theories with regard to man himself.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:27.400]   And the trouble is that man, with all his seeking and his searching, still has not been
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.960]   able to find the truth about himself.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:36.200]   In the last century, the influence of biology came in and that led to this view that man
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.680]   is only an animal.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:43.360]   And then in this century, psychoanalysis has come in and all this Freudianism, and it's
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:49.320]   revealed something that the Victorians would never have accepted, that man was not the
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:54.960]   paragon of the virtues that they intended to believe, but that he's a mass of corruption
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:00.760]   with evil drives and lusts and passions and nothing but that.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:07.400]   And so you see, man with all his effort and all his striving, has been completely unable
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.160]   even to discover the truth about himself.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.960]   And then there's another problem.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:21.320]   Man has always had a sense and a feeling that there is something, someone, greater than
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.320]   himself.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:26.840]   Now, you know, this is often described in the Bible.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:32.400]   You get it again in that great scene described in Acts 17, the apostle Paul paying his visit
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.040]   to Athens.
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:36.160]   You remember what we are told.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:41.040]   He was amazed to find that the great city of Athens, famous for its philosophy, was
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:46.560]   nevertheless full of temples, temples to the various gods.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:51.440]   Temple to the god of peace, temple to the god of war, temple to the god of love, and
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.680]   these various gods.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:56.560]   The whole place was literally cluttered up with temples.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.200]   And the apostle was amazed at this.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.200]   But what interested him above all was this.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:08.200]   He found a temple there with this inscription over it, "To the unknown god."
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.200]   What did this mean?
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.920]   Oh, this was the explanation.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:17.440]   With all their genius and all their ability in the realm of thought, those Greeks had
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:22.960]   come to the realization that man doesn't control life in this world.
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:27.700]   There are other powers, there are other forces, there are other factors.
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.600]   They believed in these various gods.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:34.200]   And having built their temples to them, they said to themselves, "Yes, but there's still
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.200]   another.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.280]   There's a god who seems to be at the back of all the gods.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.040]   He's the greatest of them all.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.040]   Who is he?"
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.440]   And they were seeking after him, if happily they could find him.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.020]   But they couldn't.
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:52.800]   So they erected a temple to him and put up that inscription, "To the unknown god."
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:57.640]   This god that seems to be influencing us and guiding us and manipulating us.
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:01.380]   "There is a divinity that shapes our ends.
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.340]   Rough hew them how we may."
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:08.620]   Now they'd come to that conclusion, but they couldn't get any further.
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:16.820]   And as the apostle has reminded these Corinthians in the first chapter, the world by wisdom
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:19.220]   knew not God.
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.660]   And precisely the same is true this evening.
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:26.740]   In spite of the fact that 1900 years have passed, in spite of all the seeking and the
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:29.100]   searching, men cannot find him.
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.980]   Can a man by searching find out God?
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:35.740]   And the answer of the ages is, no, he cannot.
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:41.020]   But this is essential to a man's view of life, to a foundation in life.
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:46.940]   I myself, this relationship that I'm dimly aware of, but I can't find it.
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:50.140]   I can't provide the foundation.
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:53.340]   And then, what is the meaning of life?
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.340]   What is the purpose of life?
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:57.460]   What is man in this world for?
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:01.760]   Are we here just to eat and drink and indulge sex and then die like animals?
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.900]   Is that life?
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.940]   Modern man doesn't know the meaning of life and the purpose of life.
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:14.460]   And then beyond that, how can one live in a clean and in a decent and in an upright
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.460]   manner?
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:19.560]   Here are the temptations of life and of the world.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.220]   We have a feeling that things are right and others wrong.
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.820]   But how to do the right, how to avoid the wrong?
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:29.220]   Paul puts that, you remember, in Romans 7, "To will is present with me, but how to perform
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.060]   that which is good I find not."
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:35.940]   This whole problem of life, the apostle in the sixth chapter of this first epistle to
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.900]   the Corinthians describes it so perfectly.
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:45.580]   "Be not deceived," he says, "neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate,
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:52.300]   nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:57.860]   revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God, and such were some of
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:58.860]   you."
[00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:01.240]   There's a problem.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.420]   That was the moral condition of Corinth.
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.940]   It's the moral condition of Toronto tonight.
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:09.740]   It's the moral condition of the whole universe tonight.
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:11.340]   And man is powerless.
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:13.980]   He can't find the answer.
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.300]   And then what about the storms of life?
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.540]   They come so inevitably.
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:25.180]   Old age creeps on, illness, accident, disappointment.
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:30.460]   What does one do face to face with these storms of life?
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:34.820]   The high and stormy gale that is so certain to come.
[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:40.900]   Or as our Lord puts it in the parable of the two men, "The rain descended and the wind
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:45.380]   blew and the flood came and beat upon that house."
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.980]   My dear friend, these are the things that are bound to happen.
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:51.420]   And the modern man is utterly helpless.
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.620]   He refuses to think.
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.100]   He switches on the television.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.100]   He goes and has a drink.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.180]   He takes a drug.
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.180]   He doesn't face it.
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:58.380]   He says it's intolerable.
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.460]   He can't stand this.
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.060]   And yet these things are there.
[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.340]   They're bound to come.
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:09.820]   And a foundation for men and for life and living must have something adequate to meet
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:12.260]   all these questions and these tests.
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:17.140]   And last of all, the question of death itself.
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:18.140]   What is it?
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:19.820]   Is it the end?
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:21.700]   Is there anything beyond?
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:27.220]   Now all human thinking and reasoning hasn't helped at all with respect to this question.
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:30.740]   Man completely fails to find the answer.
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:36.820]   Indeed, it's all summed up in that famous story about the death of one of the greatest
[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:40.460]   of all German philosophers, the philosopher Goethe.
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:45.500]   Here is a man who had spent his life in thinking, trying to solve these problems.
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:48.220]   He was a great poet to boot.
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:53.940]   But there he is on his deathbed and this is his cry, "More light!
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.100]   More light!"
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:59.060]   He was going into an impenetrable darkness.
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.980]   He didn't know.
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.780]   And so it is.
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:07.100]   The cry of mankind is, "Lead kindly, light!
[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:08.940]   Amid the encircling gloom!"
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:14.340]   He doesn't know what the light is, but he needs it in this encircling gloom.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:22.420]   Well, now there you see are some obvious and adequate reasons for saying that man himself
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:29.620]   is totally incapable of providing this adequate foundation.
[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:33.220]   But I've got to add something even to that.
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:39.060]   Even if man does succeed in erecting a building and a foundation that he regards as adequate
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:44.620]   and others may regard as adequate during his lifetime, even if you have a good man who
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:53.660]   really is concerned and applies himself to all this, still his foundation is not adequate.
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:54.660]   What do I mean?
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.220]   Well, I mean this.
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:01.700]   There is another who decides as to the adequacy of the foundation.
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:04.940]   The apostle makes this perfectly clear.
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:08.340]   The day he says shall declare it.
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:12.300]   You see the men I was telling you about in Britain whose house began to crack and so
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:20.140]   on, it was discovered that the whole cause of the trouble there was this, that the inspector
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:26.460]   appointed by the particular local authority in that area had neglected his duty.
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:30.620]   The local authorities have their inspectors and when a man's going to build a house,
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:34.380]   the inspector's business is to be there to examine the foundation and to keep his
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.380]   eye upon the building as it goes up.
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:40.860]   These men had been negligent and had failed and so the jerry-builder had been able to
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:44.740]   build this house on an inadequate foundation.
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:50.540]   Human inspectors can fail and are fallible.
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:57.500]   But there is an inspector that never fails, that knows everything.
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:58.500]   Listen to these words.
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:05.780]   If any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious metals, wood, hay, stubble,
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:10.700]   you see different men are putting these materials onto this foundation.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:16.940]   Every man's work shall be made manifest for the day he shall declare it because it
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:23.980]   shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work.
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:33.820]   Of what sort it is, you can none of us evade the great inspector.
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:39.500]   For what is adequate with men is not adequate in the sight of God.
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:45.740]   You know this same Apostle Paul, in writing to the Romans in chapter 10, he says the most
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:48.420]   amazing thing.
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:52.500]   He says that his heart is full of sorrow for his fellow countrymen, the Jews.
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:57.500]   Brethren, he says, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is this, that they
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:58.500]   might be saved.
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:06.060]   For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
[00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:13.020]   For they, being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness,
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:16.620]   have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.
[00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:17.620]   What does that mean?
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:19.260]   Well, being interpreted it means this.
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:25.580]   Paul says, I admit that these Pharisees, these Jews, these religious leaders, I admit they're
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:26.580]   very zealous.
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:31.460]   They're very good men, they're religious men, they're moral men, and they build up
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:34.660]   great mounds of righteousness.
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.980]   But it's absolutely useless, says Paul.
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:37.980]   Why?
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:39.860]   Well, it's their righteousness.
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:42.340]   It isn't what God demands.
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:45.860]   And this is true, you see, of the whole of our building of life.
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:49.460]   You may erect you a little villa, you may say it's very wonderful, you may think it's
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:50.460]   very adequate.
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.780]   You say, I've never done harm to anybody, I've always paid my twenty shillings in the
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:57.660]   pound, I've never got drunk, I've never committed adultery, I'm a good man, I'm
[00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:00.380]   surely satisfactory.
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.640]   But that is your righteousness.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.900]   It isn't God's righteousness.
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:09.780]   You see, there's going to be this great inspection, and it will not be in terms of what you and
[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:11.780]   I think is adequate.
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:15.980]   It will be in terms of what God thinks is adequate.
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.060]   And he's made that perfectly clear.
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.300]   This is what God asks of us.
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:23.820]   Not merely that we should be good and decent and clean and moral.
[00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:24.820]   It is this.
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:30.060]   Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy mind
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:31.060]   and all thy strength.
[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:34.360]   Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.780]   What is the chief end of men?
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:40.920]   What does God demand and expect of men in this world?
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.660]   What is the chief end of men?
[00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:45.740]   You remember the famous answer of the Shorter Catechism.
[00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:54.340]   The chief end of men is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever.
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:58.660]   So my dear friend, if you stand before God and point to your morality and your kindness
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:02.460]   and your philanthropy, God will say that's all right, but that isn't what I've asked
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:03.460]   of you.
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:10.900]   I made you in my own image, that you might live to my glory, that you might glorify me.
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:17.460]   And show something of my glory in that world of time into which I've put you.
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:24.660]   They going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves to the righteousness
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:25.660]   of God.
[00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:34.260]   So for these various reasons, the apostle says very solemnly, "Other foundation can
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:39.460]   no man lay than that which is laid."
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:46.020]   Judge the world and judge men as he is without God on his own results.
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:50.420]   And you see that he is a total failure.
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:53.820]   But thank God we don't stop at that.
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:56.900]   There is a foundation.
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:08.020]   Christ and he alone, and the truth concerning him, provides the only adequate foundation.
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:17.100]   Other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:21.460]   Now my dear friend, let's be clear about this.
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:26.700]   He and he alone can solve the problem of men.
[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:30.340]   He and he alone can save any one of us.
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.140]   I want to emphasize this.
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:38.020]   We are living in such terrible days, with the world on fire, as it were, aflame, with
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:40.500]   calamity round the corner, as it were.
[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:44.580]   What is more important than this?
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:49.740]   The gospel of Jesus Christ is an exclusive gospel.
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.100]   It's an intolerant gospel.
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:56.540]   I want to assert this with all the authority that I can commend.
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:00.220]   This great apostle has already said this in the second chapter.
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:06.980]   He says, "I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.620]   He puts it yet stronger in writing to the Galatians.
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:14.820]   He says, "Though we are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:16.540]   which we have preached unto you?
[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:18.340]   Let him be a curser."
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:25.700]   Peter joins in and says, "Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:32.380]   other name unto him given amongst men, whereby we must be saved."
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:37.060]   We are living in this loose, lax age.
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:39.540]   When people say, "You mustn't be intolerant.
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:44.820]   Surely Mohammedanism has something to recommend it, and Hinduism, and Confucianism, and Judaism,
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:45.820]   and so on.
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:46.820]   Haven't they all got their insights?
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:48.780]   Don't they all bring us to the final goal?"
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:50.300]   There's only one answer to that.
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:52.480]   They do not.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.180]   This is the only gospel.
[00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:57.780]   Christ is the only Savior.
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:00.100]   He's not one of a series.
[00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:01.320]   He is unique.
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:02.320]   He stands alone.
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:08.900]   A year last June, alas, a service was held on a Saturday night in the month of June in
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.980]   St. Martin's in the Fields in London.
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:17.940]   In this service in a Christian church, men took part representing these various so-called
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:23.020]   world religions in the presence of Her Majesty the Queen.
[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:25.580]   What a travesty of the gospel!
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:28.220]   What a denial of this truth!
[00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:32.240]   There is only one foundation, and he needs no help.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.680]   He needs no aid.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:37.740]   He needs no help even from his mother, Mary's nautical redemptress.
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:40.060]   He needs no help from the saints.
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:44.420]   He needs no help from the church, from popes, nor priests, nor anyone else.
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:52.220]   He is alone the Savior, and he is adequate and sufficient and complete in and of himself.
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:56.740]   What other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid?
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:59.460]   It's an exclusive foundation.
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:05.680]   But I want to emphasize also that it is a very definite foundation.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:11.420]   What would you think of a man who went up to build a house and laid a foundation of
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:17.640]   jelly, or a foundation of a collection of jellyfishes?
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:21.720]   What would you think of a man who tried to build a house on a mist or on fog?
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:24.460]   The thing is monstrous, it's ridiculous.
[00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:28.900]   A foundation, by definition, is something that is definite.
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:32.340]   It has length and breadth and depth and height.
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:37.420]   You know what it is, you can plan it out, you know exactly what you're doing.
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:43.540]   And my dear friends, this is precisely the truth about this glorious gospel which I'm
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:45.900]   privileged to remind you of.
[00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:50.580]   It is not something nebulous, it's not something vague.
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:55.260]   It is the faith once and forever delivered to the saints.
[00:44:55.260 --> 00:45:01.860]   This is not a matter of opinion, this is not a matter which has uncertainties about it.
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:06.760]   Now I'm emphasizing all this because I read even in this morning's paper that the bishops
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:10.980]   of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America have decided to abolish the word
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:11.980]   heresy.
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:16.740]   They say you mustn't do this, you must give liberty to people, you must allow room for
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:19.360]   the developing insights of the modern man.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:23.460]   But this is a contradiction of the whole of the apostles' case, the whole of the teaching
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.560]   of the entire New Testament.
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:35.160]   This is something which is definite, it can be known, it is clear, and it doesn't change.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.160]   It is absolute.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:41.620]   Now I know that in saying all this I am saying something that is contrary to the prevailing
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:43.120]   opinion.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:48.640]   The modern idea is that Christianity is something that can't be defined.
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:52.820]   Some say it's just a wonderful feeling, a feeling of fellowship and of friendship, of
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:53.820]   good cheer.
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:58.660]   Others say it's some kind of mystical experience that you can't put into words.
[00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:06.540]   They object to definitions, to precision, to proclamations, to propositions.
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:11.380]   But this is to deny not only the teaching of the New Testament, but the teaching of
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:15.220]   the Church in all her great periods and eras.
[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:19.620]   In the New Testament the apostle warns these Christian people not to listen to certain
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:20.620]   teachers.
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:25.540]   What's the meaning of the great creeds of the Church, their definitions?
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:30.700]   False teachers abounded then, as they do now, and the Church met together in its great councils,
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:36.580]   prayed to God, and under the guidance of the Spirit they drew up their great creeds.
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:41.740]   And there they said this is right and that's wrong, in order to help the people, to save
[00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:44.540]   them from making shipwreck of their faith.
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:48.660]   And when the great Protestant Reformation came, the first thing they did was to draw
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:52.300]   up their great confessions of faith.
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:56.660]   If you can't define your gospel, you haven't got a gospel.
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:47:00.180]   The gospel is not merely good cheer, goodwill, fellowship, friendship.
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.140]   You can have all that out in the world.
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:05.820]   No, no, this is specific, this is definite.
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:10.340]   And in addition I say it is something that never changes.
[00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:15.380]   This idea that the modern man has some new insights is a denial of the gospel.
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:21.100]   It has been laid, and it has been laid once and forever.
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:24.140]   But let me show you why this is so important.
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:27.300]   Who has laid this foundation?
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:30.020]   Is this the mere arrogance of men?
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:33.740]   Is Paul merely saying I alone am right and everybody else is wrong?
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:39.300]   No, no, he goes out of his way, as you noticed, to say that he's nobody, Apollos is nobody.
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:42.380]   He says we are only servants.
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:44.740]   He's been used of God, he says.
[00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:48.820]   Who is it that has laid this foundation?
[00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:54.220]   And the answer is it is none other than God himself.
[00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:56.580]   That's the message of your Old Testament.
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:59.100]   God made the world and men perfect.
[00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:04.460]   Men disobeyed and fell, became miserable and unhappy, and dragged creation down with him.
[00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:06.180]   And it's been like that ever since.
[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:11.580]   But God came to men in his kindness and said I'm going to provide a way of deliverance.
[00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:14.900]   The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.100]   The great promise of salvation.
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:22.540]   God was going to do it, and he keeps on repeating it throughout the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:24.220]   Listen to him in Isaiah.
[00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:33.660]   "Behold, I lay in Zion, the chief cornerstone, elect, precious, and he that believeth in
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:37.060]   him shall not be confounded."
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:42.100]   God kept the ancient people going by telling them that he was going to do it.
[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:48.100]   He was going to lay the foundation for the salvation of men and of the world.
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:56.060]   And when the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his son, made of a woman, made
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:59.380]   under the law, to redeem them that are under the law.
[00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:00.380]   It's always God.
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:06.580]   "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth
[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:12.180]   in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:15.420]   This is not the word of men, it's the word of God.
[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:17.940]   The word of the living God.
[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:20.980]   It is God who has sent his son.
[00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:26.420]   Christ has been laid as a foundation by God himself.
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:31.900]   The foundation of God standeth sure.
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:38.980]   And because it is a foundation that has been laid by God himself, it is a foundation that
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:42.540]   satisfies our every need.
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:44.580]   What are the things you ask of a foundation?
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:46.020]   Well here's the first, isn't it?
[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:48.700]   What material is it made of?
[00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:49.700]   Is it sand?
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:50.700]   No, no.
[00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:51.700]   Reinforced concrete.
[00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:55.760]   The higher you're building, the firmer must be the foundation.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:59.180]   And the material is all important.
[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:03.880]   And as that is true in the material realm, it is infinitely more true in the spiritual
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:04.880]   realm.
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:08.880]   How can I get a foundation for my little life?
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:13.840]   What foundation can mankind find for itself and its world?
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:16.200]   And there's only one answer.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:21.420]   There is only one material, if I may so put it with reverence, that is adequate to meet
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:24.160]   this need.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:30.240]   Man alone is totally inadequate.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:33.520]   Adam was a man, he was a perfect man.
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.600]   But he fell, he failed.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:39.600]   He wasn't great enough, he wasn't strong enough to stand up to the temptations of the
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:40.600]   devil.
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:44.720]   So if God had created another perfect man, he would likewise have fallen.
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:47.020]   You'd never have a more perfect being than Adam.
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:48.840]   But even Adam fell.
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:52.120]   That man fell in a perfect environment.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.520]   Man can never save himself.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:58.880]   Man alone is never adequate as a foundation.
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:02.080]   We need more than men.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:09.880]   And yet, if God himself had come, as it were, our needs would not be met with, for we are
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:12.200]   men after all.
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:13.680]   We are flesh and blood.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.480]   We are human beings.
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:20.800]   So some kind of apparition or manifestation of the Godhead is not adequate to save us
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:21.800]   and to redeem us.
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:22.800]   No, no, our needs are dual.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:31.200]   Whosoever is going to save us must be a man, and yet he must be more than a man.
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:34.120]   And there is only one of which this is true.
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:38.320]   It is the God-man, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:42.240]   The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.560]   Two natures in one person.
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:46.560]   Here is the material.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:52.000]   Here is the foundation that can bear the weight of the superstructure.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.800]   God in the flesh.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.840]   The man Christ Jesus.
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:00.360]   Jesus, the Son of God.
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:07.560]   Are you surprised now that the apostle says that he and he alone is the only foundation?
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:15.480]   Oh yes, he'll save us to the uttermost, as Jude puts it in his great doxology, "Now
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:22.440]   unto him who is able to keep us from falling and to present us faultless for the presence
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:26.560]   of God's glory with exceeding joy."
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:31.920]   Unfortunately the original Master Tate ran out at this point just shortly before Dr.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.480]   Lloyd-Jones concluded his sermon.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:38.400]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
