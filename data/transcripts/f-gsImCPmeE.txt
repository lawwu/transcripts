[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:12.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.860]   - Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue,
[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.780]   a show where we take questions straight from you,
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.760]   the viewer, from all of our different content we produce.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.980]   Duncan, we took a week off because I was in Disney.
[00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.740]   I learned a valuable lesson about the difference
[00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.900]   between a trip and a vacation.
[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.000]   A family trip is one where everyone goes to bed at 9 p.m.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.840]   'cause you're all tired
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.240]   from all the activities during the day,
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.620]   and a vacation is where you stay up late
[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.840]   and party and have fun,
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.580]   and that was not what we were on.
[00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.200]   - I'm kind of surprised you're not wearing Mickey ears,
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.260]   you know?
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.780]   Thought you might come back with some of those.
[00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.080]   - I was the only crank in the family
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.460]   who didn't have, like, head-to-toe Mickey Mouse
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.660]   or Disney gear.
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.860]   Anyway, right before the show,
[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.700]   I actually got a,
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.980]   I've given some book recommendations before.
[00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.340]   Poor Charlie's Almanac.
[00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.800]   This is something I read early on in my career.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.220]   We actually had a relative of the person
[00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.660]   who worked on editing this book,
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.420]   and it's all of Charlie Munger's different speeches
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.460]   he's given over the years,
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.580]   sent me a signed copy.
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.300]   I think he sent a signed copy to the office, too,
[00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.660]   for Josh and Barry and Michael and some other people,
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.860]   which I thought was very cool.
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.380]   It's a very good book,
[00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.900]   and this guy is 98 years old now,
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.260]   and he was out there spitting fire yesterday
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.460]   calling Bitcoin a venereal disease,
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.980]   and I just hope I make it someday to that age
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.660]   where I think it's basically 80 plus
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.660]   where you just stop caring at all
[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.500]   what you say and what people think of you.
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.380]   It's wonderful, so I would like that.
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.220]   I just want to say real quick,
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.100]   so remember, if you have a question,
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.060]   email us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com,
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.800]   and you can also leave some feedback there as well.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.640]   So we got a feedback.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.820]   Last time, someone asked,
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.180]   "Hey, I want to YOLO into a rental property
[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.340]   "in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.840]   "I want to cash out my 401(k)."
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.820]   We think he was cashing it out and not doing a loan,
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.660]   didn't really specify,
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.440]   but someone said, "Hey, I'm surprised you guys
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.440]   "didn't talk about the fact that there's a tax issue here,
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.160]   "so if you cash out your 401(k),
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.000]   "you're paying taxes on it,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.180]   "and then a 10% penalty for early withdrawal."
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.780]   Now, this person who wrote us in
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.860]   may have been taking that into account, right?
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.180]   They may have thought about that ahead of time
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.140]   and netted that out,
[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.100]   but that's a good thing to think about.
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.460]   It's something that we didn't mention,
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.560]   so thanks to the audience for pointing it out.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.740]   Always, again, send your feedback
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.620]   or leave them in the YouTube comments.
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.580]   All right, what do we got this week?
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.560]   - Okay, so first up, we have a question from Victor.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.540]   "I'm saving to build a house in early 2023.
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.500]   "I have around $18,000 saved
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.840]   "and anticipate saving at least an additional $9,000
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.020]   "before I build.
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.520]   "Gemini offers a yield of 8% APY on its stable coin
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.780]   "and is considered one of the safest
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.640]   "crypto exchanges or platforms.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.420]   "Should one consider using stable coins
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.120]   "to generate greater savings for things like a down payment
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.760]   "or other non-emergency savings?"
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.920]   - Get a lot of questions about this,
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.960]   because you're seeing 8%,
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.520]   and then even for an online savings account,
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.200]   you're earning 50 basis points, maybe, right?
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.840]   Half a percent, and the finance people look at this
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.280]   and say, "This doesn't make any sense.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.120]   "How could you earn 8%?
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.480]   "This doesn't, it just doesn't compute."
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.120]   Actually, I wrote a piece last year
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.880]   comparing stable coins to MoneyMarkt,
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.800]   and I actually think this is kind of off-topic.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.680]   Stable coins could be the gateway drug
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.480]   for a lot of people into crypto.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.800]   I think stable coins could be huge,
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.520]   especially since it's a global asset
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.760]   and people could use it as dollars, potentially,
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.200]   and earn a lot of money on that.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.040]   Separate topic.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.680]   So, first of all, why do stable coins
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.920]   earn such high rates of interest?
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.240]   So, we talked to Zach Prince from BlockFi
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.080]   about this a number of times.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.200]   You may have heard of BlockFi.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.600]   They're the company that got fined $100 million
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.560]   by the SEC this week.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.760]   We went into this on depth on Animal Spirits this week.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.920]   - Yeah, you did a good segment on that.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.760]   Everyone should listen to Animal Spirits.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.600]   - Yeah, kind of felt like they were
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.760]   the sacrificial lamb here.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.240]   It wasn't like they were doing anything nefarious,
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.200]   but the way I equate it is,
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.600]   they were kind of like Uber and Airbnb,
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.160]   just going into these markets before regulations existed.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.400]   Like, the SEC didn't really have regulations.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.240]   They said, you know,
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.920]   "Stable coins are unregulated securities,"
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.840]   and they had to pay this fine.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.160]   Now they're gonna be regulated.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.040]   Setting aside all the boring regulatory talk,
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.600]   first of all, one thing to understand here is that
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.240]   there are no traditional forms of finance in crypto.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.160]   Like, there's no banks that are doing any sort of lending.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.000]   If you wanna borrow against a stock or a stock portfolio
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.400]   from basically any brokerage on the planet,
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.120]   you can do so at a very low interest rate.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.360]   We've talked about that a few times.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.640]   People borrowing against their portfolio
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.040]   because you can do so at, I don't know, 2% to 3%.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.800]   Maybe those rates are going a little higher now
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.400]   because interest rates are rising.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.640]   But there's just not as many options
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.760]   for borrowing against crypto.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.880]   So if you're a person who got in early
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.160]   on Bitcoin or Ethereum or something,
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.960]   you've made millions of dollars,
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.120]   and your significant other says,
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.640]   "Hey, I wanna build a new kitchen
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.840]   "or buy a new car with that money."
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.040]   And you say, "No, no, no, I'm a hodler.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.800]   "I'm never selling."
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.120]   You wanna somehow unlock that newfound wealth
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.520]   that you've made, so you borrow against your crypto.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.520]   And because there are no traditional forms of lending here,
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.600]   the places like BlockFi and Gemini that do allow lending
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.760]   can do so at a high interest rate.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.080]   So I think they charge like 10% if you're gonna borrow at it
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.160]   since crypto is such a new form of collateral.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.120]   And oh, by the way, it's a very volatile form of collateral.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.320]   So that's why they're able to charge higher prices.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.720]   So I don't wanna sell my Bitcoin or whatever
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.560]   because I've made a ton of money on it.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.760]   I don't wanna pay the taxes.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.120]   I wanna borrow against it.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.160]   You borrow against it.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.520]   These stable coins are paying the spread.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.240]   Just like you borrow for a mortgage at 3%
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.160]   and the bank pays you 0.5% and they keep the spread,
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.800]   Gemini or BlockFi are doing the same thing
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.360]   where they're lending out at 10 and paying eight
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.920]   and keeping the difference, right?
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.400]   And then there's also institutional investors
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.040]   who are borrowing for arbitrage opportunities
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.720]   and market making and trying to short it.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.000]   But that's the idea here.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.080]   So that's how you're able to earn these high rates.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.720]   And I would say, as this stuff matures,
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.200]   you would expect those rates to come in a little bit, right?
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.960]   But that's how it makes sense.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.520]   And the other risk factor here is just that you don't know.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.680]   This stuff is still so new, right?
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.880]   I mean, some people worry this stuff is gonna get hacked.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.400]   Some people worry about the security of it.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.600]   Other people worry about the counterparty risks.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.320]   So the company that's actually paying the interest,
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.680]   that's potentially a problem.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.260]   It's not FDIC assured.
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.200]   So that's this type of thing.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.640]   But I think about this in a few ways.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.280]   So I have money in stable coins at BlockFi.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.760]   But I think like, am I gonna use this money in the next,
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.360]   I don't know, three to 12 months for spending purposes?
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.040]   If that's the case, I don't think you think about this
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.500]   in terms of all or nothing.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.600]   Like I'm gonna put all my savings into stable coins
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.000]   'cause they're earning way more interest
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.720]   or I'll leave all of it on that.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.760]   I like to diversify and have a little bit in both.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.420]   So I have money in online savings account not earning much.
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.680]   And I feel pretty safe about that.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.360]   It's FDIC insured, all this stuff.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.520]   And I have money in stable coins earning money.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.360]   I think for house down payment,
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.680]   especially if you've got your timeline figured out,
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.080]   I think you can do the calculations
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.520]   and figure out how much more money you'd make
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.560]   earning 8% versus earning less than 1%
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.560]   and figure out is it really worth it.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.840]   And again, maybe not do an all or nothing type of thing.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.000]   But yeah, I think this is something
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.840]   people are still working on.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.160]   We talked to Zach at BlockFi.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.040]   He said, listen, if it's emergency savings,
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.520]   I don't think I'd feel comfortable leaving it in there.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.640]   But if you're saving for a boat or something
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.080]   and it's down the line and it's not something
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.200]   that is gonna make or break your family or your finances,
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.040]   maybe that makes more sense.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.640]   - Yeah, I feel like diversifying with a savings account
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.620]   at a bank is the target date fund of this.
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.720]   - Yeah, because again, you're not earning
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.560]   those higher rates of return for nothing.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.400]   There is some risk here.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.400]   And BlockFi, after settling their thing
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.840]   with the SEC this week,
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.520]   said you can't put more new money in now
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.480]   and no one can open a new account.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.200]   So this stuff is still so new.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.240]   I think that's part of the problem.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.160]   So you have to have a little bit of risk appetite
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.840]   to earn that 8%.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.480]   - Right, that makes sense.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.480]   - All right, let's do the next one.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.560]   - Okay, up next we have a question
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.040]   from, hopefully I'm pronouncing this right,
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.200]   but Yannick, and they write,
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.520]   I'm a 33-year-old movie producer in L.A.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.360]   We've had several movie industry people write in,
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.360]   which is kinda cool.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.720]   I'm a 33-year-old movie producer in L.A.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.080]   and have my own company, so no steady salary.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.120]   But I will make anywhere from 40 to $150,000 this year.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.120]   I currently have $125,000 saved.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.840]   Personal finances are in good shape, no kids, no debt.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.400]   I'm currently renting and have a roommate and it sucks.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.620]   My goal is to get a house by mid-2023 in the Valley,
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.000]   preferably sooner.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.760]   Most of the houses are about 650 to $850,000.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.640]   Do I need to put myself in a larger cash position
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.720]   since I want to spend the money soonish?
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.040]   What's a good ratio?
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.960]   Should I wait until I have a big enough down payment
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.120]   or go for it when I find the right place?
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.280]   Would it be better for me to save a larger down payment
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.120]   since my annual income varies so much?
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.760]   - Now, Duncan, the Duncan High wants to know,
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.080]   did you ever think about going to Hollywood
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.360]   after going to film school?
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.560]   Or you're always more of a New York independent film
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.400]   kinda guy?
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.280]   - So, I mean, my plan was to stay in Wilmington,
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.680]   North Carolina, which was like, you know,
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.120]   Hollywood East, but the film industry died there
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.760]   because of a bunch of convoluted tax stuff.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.760]   - Oh, they had people coming there from the tax, okay.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.600]   I gotcha.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.800]   You seemed like a more East Coast kinda guy to me.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.320]   - Yeah, that was my plan.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.480]   - All right, so this question is basically,
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.880]   do I wait to save for a larger down payment to buy a house?
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.280]   Do I just try to do it now?
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.960]   What do you think is a good ratio here?
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.480]   I think it seems like an old wives' tale
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.840]   that you need to have a 20% down payment for a house.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.600]   And obviously, the one biggest reason for it
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.560]   is because it gets you out of that PMI,
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.680]   the private mortgage insurance.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.800]   If you have a 20% down payment, you don't have to pay that.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.720]   It's really not that much.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.720]   I don't know, it's, depending on the size of the mortgage,
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.080]   it could be anywhere from 50 to 150 bucks a month,
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:04.920]   something like that.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.740]   It's not terrible.
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:06.580]   - So 20 is the cap for, or the force of that?
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.780]   - Yeah, so you need to have a loan-to-value ratio
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.060]   of 80% to not have to pay that.
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.100]   So let's do a chart on here of the median down payment.
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.540]   This is from the National Association of Realtors.
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.140]   It shows the median down payment by age.
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.860]   And you can see all buyers, it's like 12%.
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.980]   But if you're in your 20s or 30s,
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.020]   the median down payment is more like 6% or 10%.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.540]   You can see people who are older
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.580]   can afford a bigger down payment.
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.500]   And that makes sense
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.740]   because they have more financial assets.
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.660]   When you're younger, you don't have those financial assets.
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.480]   And that's the thing that's holding
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.980]   a lot of young people back these days,
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.740]   is they think, well, I can afford the down payment,
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.460]   even these higher-priced houses,
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.100]   but I can't afford, or I can afford the monthly payment,
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:40.940]   'cause interest rates are so much lower.
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.300]   I can't afford the down payment.
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.700]   I think that's holding a lot of people back.
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.300]   When we bought our first house way back in late 2007,
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.160]   we put 5% down.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.740]   And we weren't doing it because, ah,
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.180]   we said let's lever up this house because it's a great deal.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.380]   That was all we could afford at the time.
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.900]   It would've taken us a lot longer to buy a house
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.100]   if we waited 'til we got 20%.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.220]   So I think this person mentions they have a variable income.
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.800]   I think they probably have to think about
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.340]   what the lender will do for them
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.220]   and what their credit situation.
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.020]   It sounds like their personal finances are in good shape
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.820]   and they have no debt, so they should be in good shape.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:08.860]   Put this next one up that shows,
[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.260]   this is from the same report,
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.740]   the reasons mortgage lenders rejected by applications.
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.060]   And you can see there's a bunch of different,
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.700]   debt-to-income ratio is the biggest one.
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.180]   So if this person has, I know it's a variable income,
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.020]   but they don't have any debt,
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.000]   they're probably in pretty good shape.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.540]   So here's what I would do if I'm in this situation.
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.900]   I'm thinking, well, I'm gonna buy a house
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.600]   in a couple years, but they already have a,
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.220]   they said they have a roommate and it sucks, they said,
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.460]   so they probably are ready to do it now.
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.620]   I would shop around for a lender.
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.460]   I wouldn't go to one place.
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.300]   I wouldn't just go to my bank.
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.260]   I would look for a bunch of places.
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.140]   And the great thing about the internet
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.740]   is you can shop around these days,
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.700]   see what kind of down payment they're looking for.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.060]   That way you know how much money you need
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.860]   and what your sort of range is
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.100]   in terms of the house you can get.
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:46.920]   'Cause they'll tell you, listen,
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.420]   we'll lend you up to this amount
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.900]   and between these two amounts, that's what we can give you.
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.560]   So you kind of have a range.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.860]   And I think then you start looking for houses
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.060]   because the process can take way longer than you expect,
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.740]   especially now with supply so low these days.
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.940]   I wouldn't really wait.
[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.260]   I wouldn't wait for a 20% down payment.
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.820]   I wouldn't wait for housing prices.
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.700]   I know people say, I'm gonna wait for housing prices to fall
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.320]   or I'm gonna wait for a recession.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.540]   I think you find a house because you like it,
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.460]   it's that stage in life, you can afford it,
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.920]   you can service the debt,
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.980]   and it's something you wanna live in for a number of years.
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.900]   So I think trying to time this thing perfectly
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.220]   is probably not a great situation,
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.220]   but I would definitely talk to a lot of lenders now.
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.380]   Don't wait to do it until you have a 20% down payment
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.380]   because what happens if you get to that point
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.580]   and then you can't find a house or they're more expensive?
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.180]   I would start the process early.
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.900]   - Yeah, no, that sounds like good advice.
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.060]   You guys have talked about this before,
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.180]   but there's so much more of it goes into buying a house
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.180]   that is important to you
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.980]   and that you're gonna live in for a long time
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.100]   than just trying to make the best math decision.
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.020]   - Yes, and I think as long as you're looking at it
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.220]   as something that I'm gonna be in this
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.380]   for five, seven, 10 years at least, minimum,
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.380]   obviously life can get in the way and change that,
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.460]   but from the start, if you say I'm finding a place
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.100]   that I'm gonna be there for a while,
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.420]   then I think that takes away some of the investment stuff
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.020]   where you can get burned by a bad housing market
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.420]   if you just lengthen your time horizon a little bit.
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.460]   - Right.
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:05.300]   - All right, let's do one more.
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:09.460]   - Okay, so up next we have the following.
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.580]   This is another fun one.
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:11.900]   I'm an engineer in New York City
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.660]   who joined a SaaS startup a few years ago
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.780]   just before unicorn status.
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.420]   The path to IPO is underway
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.580]   and over half of my options have vested,
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.340]   but I have not executed a single one.
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.220]   My equity at current fair market value
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.060]   will be about $1 million.
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.580]   I currently have $250,000 invested in the stock market.
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.380]   And if I come into this windfall of equity post IPO
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.140]   and after taxes, I'd like to know your thoughts on,
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.380]   and then they have a couple options here.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.560]   So first, leveraging this equity for a stock secured loan
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.900]   to either reinvest or use for a down payment.
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.500]   Selling my equity immediately
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.720]   despite short-term capital gains hit.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.340]   This is growth tech, so it could be up 100% from the IPO
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.820]   or down 80%.
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.580]   And then lastly, what are your thoughts
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:54.900]   on using some of this windfall
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.820]   for a down payment in Manhattan?
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.460]   - Great, this is a good question.
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.820]   Obviously a good problem to have,
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.940]   but this person is going from a quarter million dollars
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.340]   to well over a million dollars in net worth,
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.540]   assuming that their IPO price
[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.540]   doesn't fluctuate too much more.
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:13.380]   So this is definitely more of a financial planning question
[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.340]   than an investment question.
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.740]   So I'm gonna bring in Blair Duquene,
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.460]   who's been on the show before to help answer this one.
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.300]   Hey Blair. - Hey man.
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.580]   Hey Duncan.
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.780]   - Obviously, there's no right or wrong answer here.
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:24.620]   They give a lot of options
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.980]   and I think they're thinking about this the right way,
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.100]   but how do you approach a situation like this
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.660]   when your net worth, basically overnight, grows in multiples?
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.980]   How do you help someone think through this decision?
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.560]   - Yeah, well, first of all, congratulations, right?
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.680]   Making money off of working for a company
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.620]   that's very successful is one of the fastest ways
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:46.340]   and you've gotten lucky, so congratulations to you.
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.420]   One thing to keep in mind,
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:48.540]   and you hit the nail on the head,
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:52.380]   this could be up 100% or down 80% after the IPO.
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:57.220]   Right now is sort of not a great environment for IPO stocks.
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.100]   And I actually put together a chart
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.620]   of some of the recent names that we've seen go public, right?
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:03.780]   So this is what you're looking at
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.060]   with single stock security risk,
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.540]   whether it's like a Robinhood
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:13.260]   or a Rent the Runway down over 60% since their IPO price,
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:17.980]   or even a Coinbase down 40%, Bumble down 44%, right?
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.700]   So this is the environment we're looking at for IPOs.
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.140]   So your question about should I leverage this stock
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.620]   with a securities-backed loan, absolutely not.
[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.860]   You really do not wanna lend against,
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.460]   borrow money against something that's volatile.
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.540]   I'd be surprised if they lend you even 25%, right?
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.700]   And keep in mind that if the stock is down 60, 65%,
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.080]   you're getting close to the point at which
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.620]   you're gonna have to sell the stock and pay off the loan
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.980]   and you've completely wiped out all of your equity.
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.980]   - Yeah, I agree with you.
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.300]   Take that off the table, that makes no sense.
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.220]   If you do that, you do it for a diversified portfolio.
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.420]   But how do you deal with the psychology here
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.620]   of someone thinking like, we're gonna IPO,
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:56.060]   but what if this thing grows even bigger from here?
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.740]   So how do you deal with the psychology of,
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.100]   listen, I know I need to diversify, it's smart,
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.500]   it makes sense, but what if I'm just worried
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.900]   that I'm gonna regret this decision
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.980]   and I wanna hold on to some of it?
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.360]   How do you deal with that?
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.220]   - Yeah, this is a tough one because
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.900]   if you sell and the stock goes up,
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.680]   you're always gonna do the math in your head
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.420]   about how much you could have been worth.
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.140]   But what you have to decide,
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.740]   knowing that the future is unknown,
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:21.500]   is how much are you not willing to risk in the stock?
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.500]   How much do you wanna go ahead and take off the table?
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.700]   Now, you mentioned taxes as well.
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.120]   If you do not have longer than a one-year time holding period
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.240]   you are gonna owe short-term capital gains tax,
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.240]   which is generally at a higher rate than long-term.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.300]   So you're gonna have to play all of these factors.
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.820]   I would say, come up with a number in your head.
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.060]   What's a number that I'm not willing
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.080]   to go below in net worth?
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.440]   Probably sell that immediately.
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.460]   Come up with a number.
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.420]   What's a number of shares that I wanna hold forever,
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.700]   just in case the company does really well?
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.820]   And put those aside.
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.300]   And then maybe the remainder you sell over time
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.060]   after you have long-term capital gains treatment.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.500]   There's no perfect answer.
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.860]   And you're always gonna go back and play mental games
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.940]   and do the calculations.
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.500]   But you have to make the best decision
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.060]   without having the information
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:07.780]   about what's gonna happen to the stock in the future.
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.460]   - And I do think your point about the ones,
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:12.140]   the stocks that have crashed recently from IPOs
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.180]   is a good one that people are kind of coming to reality
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.120]   and thinking like, okay, in the past,
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.380]   I would wanna hold onto these forever
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.860]   because look, they all went up for years
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:19.780]   and now they're coming down.
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.860]   I think that's put a dose of reality
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.540]   for people on this type of stuff.
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.580]   - Exactly.
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.140]   The last point of his question though was,
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.340]   should I put this down on Manhattan real estate?
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.900]   So, I would never bet against the city of New York.
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.500]   Obviously, there can be periods of softness
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.420]   in Manhattan real estate.
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:37.260]   I'm hearing that condos are--
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.020]   - Are you saying James Altucher was wrong?
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.140]   No way. - 100%.
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.060]   I'm having my Jerry Seinfeld moment here.
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.300]   Why would you bet against New York?
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.440]   If you wanna live in New York
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.220]   for at least the next seven to 10 years
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.180]   and that's where you're gonna make your home,
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.940]   absolutely, use this money for a down payment.
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.380]   But if you're buying it for an investment as an investment
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.380]   and don't expect it to do better than the stock market,
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:00.220]   we've talked ad nauseum about real estate as an investment.
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.860]   But as a home, 100%.
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.580]   I'd love to see you in your dream Manhattan apartment.
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:05.800]   - Yeah, especially since the net worth
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.980]   is multiplying so much, like using that as a down,
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.280]   I think that makes a lot of sense
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.260]   'cause you're diversifying your balance sheet then.
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.340]   All right, Duncan, we got one more.
[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.980]   - I have just a quick new boil question there.
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.380]   So is there always a lockup for all employees
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.000]   of a company when it goes public
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.680]   or is that just for certain employees?
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.540]   - It depends.
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.720]   Some companies have that and others don't.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.820]   So that's something that's worth knowing.
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.060]   But yeah, that depends on the company, I think.
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.340]   - Gotcha, okay. - Exactly.
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.900]   Nothing you can do about that though.
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.360]   - Right. - Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.180]   Okay, so up next we have a question from Mark who writes,
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.380]   "I have two 529 plans to pay for the college expenses
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.680]   "of my two kids that are six years apart.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.440]   "I've saved enough over the past 12 years
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.460]   "to cover private school for both kids
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.820]   "and my expected annual returns
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.060]   "have been a modest 7% or higher.
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.420]   "I don't use target date funds."
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.040]   I don't know if that's a slight to you or not, Ben,
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.020]   "but I'm about two years away from my first tuition bill
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.540]   "and I want to start planning my drawdown strategy.
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.880]   "Do you recommend allocating a year's worth of tuition
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.740]   "at a time into a more conservative fund
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:04.140]   "as the bills come due?
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.400]   "Would that ensure that the short-term bills can be paid
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.180]   "while still letting the longer-term investments
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.900]   "grow more aggressively?"
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.180]   - By the way, for my kids' 529 plans,
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.780]   I actually do use the target date fund options.
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.020]   For this reason, I don't have to do it.
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.980]   It does the glide path for me.
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.060]   So, we have a lot of haters out there on target date funds.
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.460]   But, Blair, I think that the idea here is,
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.180]   especially from a financial planning perspective,
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.300]   accumulation is way easier for most people
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.880]   than going through withdrawal.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.500]   Because it requires, accumulation is easier
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.940]   because you're just setting your savings rate
[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.300]   and you're hoping it grows and the market does what it does.
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.700]   Withdrawal strategy is a little different,
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:38.980]   especially for something like college,
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.440]   because I think, actually for college,
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.980]   it might be a little easier because,
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.740]   versus retirement, you have a much longer time horizon.
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:45.740]   For college, you have these four years
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.740]   and you kind of know what it's going to be.
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.780]   But as you approach that level,
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.060]   what's the point where you start saying,
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.680]   "All right, I'm completely shutting off
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.420]   "the market risk here and getting out."
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.060]   So, how do you approach that one?
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.020]   - Yeah, and this reader has done a great job of saving
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.100]   because I'm hearing that private schools today
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.140]   are costing anywhere between $60,000 to $80,000 a year.
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:08.460]   So, kudos to you for doing that saving and investing.
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.260]   Your time horizon now is between two and six years,
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:14.140]   at least on the child who's older.
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.540]   Longer, obviously, if your children are six years apart.
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.900]   So, think of it in terms of time horizon.
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.500]   I also use the Target Date Fund
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.500]   because I don't want to have to go in
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.460]   and make changes as my kids get older.
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.780]   And I looked up, in the state of Louisiana,
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.000]   my Target Date Fund, even on the aggressive side,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.920]   goes 100% in short-term bonds and cash
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.780]   when the child turns 16.
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:35.860]   - Oh, really interesting.
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.580]   - Yeah, that might be a little bit too much
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:39.660]   on the conservative side,
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.700]   because if you're thinking about that fourth year of college
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.340]   it's still six years away,
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:44.460]   you could make the argument
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.580]   that even if the market were to sell off now,
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.940]   it may, it will probably have recovered.
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.320]   But think in terms of three years, right?
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.540]   You're gonna be making that second year payment.
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.300]   I'll give you two three-year examples,
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.100]   August 2007 to August 2009,
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.520]   great financial crisis in between.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.620]   You really don't wanna see your hard-earned savings
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.740]   be worth less after you've already won.
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.840]   You know, 2000 to 2002 is another three-year example.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:13.160]   So maybe 50% or more should be in fixed income
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.000]   at this point.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.860]   Go ahead and lock in those gains.
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:16.700]   - Right, yeah.
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.480]   Because essentially, again, you have the end date.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.760]   When you're retiring,
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.100]   you could have two, three, four decades ahead of you.
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.640]   So like that stock bond balance makes more sense
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.320]   to like overweight it to stocks potentially,
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.180]   depending on your resources and stuff.
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.460]   But if you have a four-year period,
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.660]   like you said, start thinking about it two years before,
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.700]   like you know your end date, right?
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.220]   So taking too much risk of that
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.880]   just doesn't make a lot of sense.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.340]   - Yeah.
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.600]   - Okay. - Absolutely.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.440]   - Perfect.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.520]   So I did see we had someone in the comments
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.560]   suggest that our Hollywood producer look for a credit union.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.400]   I think that's a great idea.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.080]   I actually use a credit union for my mortgage.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.640]   They actually offer better rates on the savings
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.000]   and checking accounts too.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.400]   I get like 3% on my checking account, not bad.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.120]   So we appreciate the feedback.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.720]   Again, have some thoughts on the questions today.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.340]   We always appreciate the feedback.
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.200]   Leave us a comment below.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.080]   You can come in for the live show like all the people here.
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.100]   We're getting very close to Duncan's big round number
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.680]   of 100,000 YouTube subscribers.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.880]   I think next week we're going to do a t-shirt giveaway.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.200]   We're going to figure something out there, right?
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.040]   We have our Portfolio Rescue t-shirts.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.080]   - From the chat right here, we're going to do a giveaway.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.360]   So yeah, tune in for that.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.160]   - So anyone who's not here live, check in live.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.440]   We're going to be doing a giveaway here on the live chat.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.680]   Thanks again to Blair for joining us as always.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.280]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.120]   - Yep, remember, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.400]   if you have a question and we will see you next week.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.780]   - Also, one other thing.
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.520]   We're watching Portfolio Rescue's now its own podcast.
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.040]   So if you ever miss a live, then you can find this
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.440]   on whatever platform you use to listen to podcasts.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.280]   - I don't know, Duncan.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.360]   They say I have a face for YouTube.
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.080]   So people should really watch it on YouTube.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.160]   I know a lot of people prefer to have it on podcast.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.080]   So we're going to have their own Portfolio Rescue feed
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.020]   and we're going to put it up the same day, I think, right?
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.240]   - Yes, same day.
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.200]   - All right, thanks everyone.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.040]   - See ya.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.900]   (upbeat music)
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.480]   (soft music)
