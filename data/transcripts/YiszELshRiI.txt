[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   We want to pick up from where we left off in our last class period together and we were
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.800]   talking about what is it that Satan knows?
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.360]   Because we had talked about the fact that the scripture tells us, it makes it very clear,
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:29.680]   that our real enemy in this war is Satan and as Ephesians 6 says, it tells us that we don't
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:38.360]   wrestle against flesh and blood, but we wrestle against the spiritual forces of darkness.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:49.240]   We have an adversary, as Peter says there in 1 Peter 5, 8, and that Satan is very active.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:58.580]   Satan has declared war on the family and focuses much of his attention on the family because
[00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.320]   he knows how important the family is.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.340]   We said, first of all, that Satan knows that because the family is the basic building block
[00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:14.640]   of every other social unit or institution, that it is key to God's plan in our day and
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.280]   age and we also know that Satan knows because the command to multiply, replenish, and fill
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.240]   the earth was given to a family unit.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:34.920]   How critical, there in Genesis 1 and verse 28, that information is to God's plan and
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.920]   his redemption.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.000]   Thirdly, we know that Satan knows that because the family is unique and irreplaceable in
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.200]   God's program as well, he will bring along all kinds of opposition against the family.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.040]   He will do everything he can to redefine the family, and then that brought us to one of
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.080]   the last points that we dealt with in our last section, that the family is of utmost
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.340]   importance to God's program because God starts his revelation to man with extended teaching
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.900]   about marriage and the family.
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.240]   He starts his revelation to man with extended teaching about marriage and the family.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:23.480]   We can see this in Genesis chapter 1, Genesis chapter 2, Genesis chapter 3, Genesis chapter
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.480]   4.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:32.240]   The first four chapters of Genesis is all about one family, one husband and wife relationship
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:44.040]   with two children, two boys, Cain and Abel, Adam and Eve, one family, the first family.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.360]   That's where God starts his revelation.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.760]   Furthermore, Satan knows that the family is of utmost importance to God's program because
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.640]   everything else grows out of the family and is dependent upon the family.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.320]   Everything grows out of the family and is dependent upon it.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:16.520]   When you think about how many things in your life, the way that you live, right down to
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:23.860]   the things that you eat, the way that you dress, the attitudes you have about life,
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.040]   the older you grow, the more you realize how absolutely dependent upon your family you
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.680]   were in adopting those attitudes about life and about things.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.640]   You find yourself saying the same thing your father said or your mother said.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:48.320]   You say, "Oh my goodness, I'm being just like my mother, being just like my father.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.280]   I can hear my father speaking through those words."
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.440]   Your whole attitude and your perspective on life is driven by that.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.360]   They made a profound impact on you.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:05.640]   But Satan understands that and if he can disrupt that particular process, he can do a lot to
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.520]   disrupt what God's plan is here on earth.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.480]   F in your notes.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:20.160]   He also knows that the family is of utmost importance to God's program because distortion
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.800]   and deficiencies in our families will produce distortions and deficiencies in every other
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:35.160]   human institution.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:42.000]   My wife at this particular time is serving on a jury and I'm not allowed to say what
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.680]   the court case is about at this point, but it's a very, very serious court case and it
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:58.320]   has to do with a breakdown in a family, a breakdown in a family, a major breakdown in
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.800]   a family.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.500]   And now this has affected society at large.
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.800]   When there's a breakdown in a family, it affects society, it affects the court system, it brings
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.240]   the law into play.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:19.080]   Now judges are involved, lawyers are involved, other social institutions within the state
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.640]   and the federal government is involved.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.080]   All of these things.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.880]   When there's a breakdown in the family, there is a breakdown in society at large.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.760]   There's an effect upon it.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.120]   As the family goes, so goes society, we would say.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.880]   And Satan understands that.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.880]   And so if he can disrupt the family, he can also disrupt society as well.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.400]   See in your notes, Satan also knows that the family is of utmost importance to God's program
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:55.320]   because God uses the family as a means of reflecting the communicable aspects of his
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.320]   nature.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.040]   Whose nature?
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.480]   It's God's nature.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.080]   The communicable aspects of his nature.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.280]   Now, you know, you've talked about this in systematic theology before.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.800]   In systematic theology, there are incommunicable aspects of God.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.320]   In other words, there are things that, aspects of God and his personhood that we will never
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.320]   be.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.400]   We will never be omniscient.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.880]   Only God is omniscient.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.740]   We will never be omnipresent.
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.560]   Only God is omnipresent.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.520]   We will never be omnipotent.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.840]   Only God is all powerful.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.520]   We'll never be that way.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.600]   Those are incommunicable attributes of God.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.560]   But there are communicable attributes of God.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.320]   God is holy, and to a degree, we are to be holy.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.320]   We are to be holy like him.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.200]   Now, while we walk this earth, we'll never be perfectly holy.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:57.000]   But God is perfectly holy, and to some degree, while even in our sinful flesh, we can walk
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   holy.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.640]   The Bible expects us to.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.180]   God is a God of love.
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.180]   He loves.
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.560]   That's part of his personhood.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.040]   God is not the force of Star Wars out there in the universe.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.380]   No, there are personal attributes to his character.
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.380]   He loves.
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.960]   A force doesn't love.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.960]   God loves.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.960]   And we can love.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.600]   That's part of his communicable attributes.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.260]   God is a jealous God.
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:31.000]   Only his jealousy is absolutely backed up with a pure holiness.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.920]   Well, in a similar way, we can become jealous as well.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:46.880]   Like God is jealous, hopefully in a good way, we're jealous for righteousness' sake in that
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.880]   way.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.200]   Now, our own sinful depravity can twist that jealousy into a sinful form of jealousy, agreed,
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:58.040]   but that's one of the communicable attributes of God.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:09.800]   Well, you can see this in several aspects, because like him, the Bible says, we have
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.800]   his image.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.320]   In the image of God, he created man, male and female, he created them.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:25.160]   That means both the man and the woman, in their gender distinctiveness, both possess
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.360]   the image of God.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:32.440]   It's not a physical image, because God is not a physical God.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.180]   God is spirit.
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:42.360]   But it is an image that has to do with personal attributes.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:47.480]   The animals do not bear the image of God, even though there are some animals that are
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.180]   more intelligent than other animals.
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:55.600]   Man is not an animal, and the basic characteristic that separates him from the animal world and
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:02.080]   from the animal kingdom is the fact that man bears the image of God.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.600]   Now, secular science would reject this.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:11.560]   Good science, that is, science that's built upon what the scripture says, would back that
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.560]   up.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.600]   So, we bear the image of God, Genesis 1.27.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.520]   In fact, I want you to take your Bible and take a look at that for a moment, because
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:26.600]   there is actually in the Hebrew, behind the English here, in the Hebrew, a language, there
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:35.040]   is a play on singular and plural that happens in verse 26.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:43.080]   It says, "Then God said, 'Let us (plural) make man singular in our (plural) image singular
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:48.080]   according to our (plural) likeness singular, and let them rule over the fish of the sea
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.960]   and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.340]   creeping thing that creeps on the earth.'
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:10:01.280]   God created man," verse 27, "in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.400]   female he created them."
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:08.080]   Now, verse 27 gives that gender distinctiveness.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:13.440]   And so, the genders were created to complement one another.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.560]   Verse 26 tells us how, when it says, "Let us make man."
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:25.360]   It's not a reference to the angels, because the angels are not creating, only God is creating.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:30.560]   Most theologians believe that this is actually a reference to, the earliest reference we
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.480]   have to the Trinity.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:39.880]   So God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit, we've seen earlier where the Spirit
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:45.840]   of God in verse 2 of Genesis 1 is moving upon the surface of the water, and so we have God
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.280]   the Father and God the Spirit involved here, but there's the Trinity, later on we find
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:58.240]   out in Hebrews 1 and verse 2 that Jesus Christ was a part of the creation of the world, we
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.920]   understand that, so the Trinity was involved here, God the Father, God the Son, God the
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.920]   Holy Spirit.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:16.880]   "Let us," plural, God is three persons and yet one God, three persons, co-equal, co-eternal,
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.000]   and yet one God.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:29.400]   "Let us make man," man here is singular, singular form, "in our," plural, image singular.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:41.800]   So there is a plurality to God and yet we as Christians are still monotheistic according
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.800]   to our likeness.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:49.400]   So we could say something like this, that God in relationship creates man in relationship
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:57.360]   with gender distinctiveness, male and female, essentially brought together as one, we know
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:09.520]   that later on in Genesis 2 and verse 24, "they shall become one flesh," the scripture says,
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:17.600]   brought together as one, and yet two different genders, a male gender and a female gender.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:25.560]   So there is God in relationship creating man in relationship, male and female He creates
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:33.880]   them in His own image, wow, in the image of God He creates them.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:43.840]   Now Satan understands this, man bears the image of God and that image is no better reflected
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:54.360]   than in the plurality of heterosexuality and yet the central unity of marriage.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:13:03.000]   The relationship of marriage no better reflects the unity and plurality of the Godhead than
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.080]   anything else and Satan understands that.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:15.440]   If he can disrupt that relationship and destroy it, the picture that God has intended for
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:23.640]   of Himself is now distorted and it is now destroyed in the eyes of man.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:31.400]   God in relationship creates man in relationship, male and female He creates them and if Satan
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:38.160]   can destroy that relationship in terms of the image of God, then he distorts the picture
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.880]   of who God is.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:49.920]   There is then within this Godhead an essential unity and yet diversity in a similar way in
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:59.720]   the marital relationship there is an essential unity and yet there is a diversity of gender
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.240]   and that is good.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:12.200]   Third, there is also an independence and interdependence.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:21.000]   All three persons of the Godhead are distinctive, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.560]   Spirit and yet there is an interdependence among them which sometimes in systematic theology
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:39.320]   is called the economical aspect of the Trinity where Jesus submits Himself to the Father
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:46.480]   and the Spirit submits Himself to the bidding of Jesus Christ so there is a functional subordination
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:54.140]   within the Godhead and hence an interdependence between them and yet there is a distinctiveness
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.760]   of personhood.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:09.280]   In a similar way in marriage there is an independence, male and female, and yet there is an interdependence
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:18.760]   for the procreation and propagation of the human race that has to be there.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:26.480]   Homosexual and lesbian relationships will never ever express the unity and diversity
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:32.000]   or the independence and interdependence of the heterosexual relationship.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.480]   It is not reflective of the Godhead and it destroys that picture.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:46.600]   Fourth, there is an equality and subordination as I've already alluded to.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:50.120]   Just as there are within the Trinity so there is within man.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.520]   You can see this reflected not only in the marital relationship of on the one hand there
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:00.080]   is an essential equality between the male and female, on the other hand there is a functional
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:06.600]   subordination and it's funny how even homosexual and lesbian relationships reflect this because
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:13.640]   there is usually a male or leader in a homosexual relationship and someone who of the same sex
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:17.440]   who takes on the female role who is more subordinate.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.200]   Same thing is true in lesbian relationships.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.640]   There is someone who takes on the male role and there is someone who takes on the female
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.160]   role in those particular relationships.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:30.200]   Someone who is more dominant and someone who is a little bit less dominant and more passive
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.680]   in the relationship.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:41.120]   So even in that distortion of what God intended to be, they are still reflecting God's original
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.120]   order.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:49.000]   There is an equality and there is a subordination in the Trinity and there is an equality and
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.880]   subordination within the husband and wife relationship and marriage as well.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.640]   You can see this in parents' relationship to children.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:02.640]   Parents or children are not somehow more equal to each other but the parents have the authority
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.360]   in the relationship.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.420]   You can see this in elders in relationship to the church.
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.600]   Elders are not more important than anybody else at church and yet the rest of the church
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:22.640]   is supposed to have a submissive role in following the leadership of biblically appointed elders
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:31.760]   So, in the human domain, there is this equality and subordination as reflected in the Godhead
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.000]   as well.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.360]   Furthermore, in that distinctive relationship, you also have creativity.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:46.080]   "Let us make man" There is that creativity.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:51.520]   Genesis 1.26 "Let us make man"
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:58.760]   I list for you here in your notes John chapter 1 and verse 3 and there you remember this
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:05.600]   is talking about the main focus is Jesus who has become flesh but it says there in the
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.120]   gospel of John "All things came into being through him and apart from him nothing came
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.200]   into being that has come into being."
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.480]   In other words, who is it talking about?
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:22.320]   That is, the Word being Christ.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.560]   The Word was with God and the Word was God.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:29.200]   Verse 14 says, "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us and we saw his glory, the glory
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.680]   as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth."
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:43.280]   So it is Jesus Christ who is a part of creating this world.
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.520]   God is creative.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.560]   In the same way when you have a husband and wife relationship and their gender distinctiveness
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:58.920]   coming together then that usually results in creative propagation of progeny, children.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:04.640]   So there is an essential creativity that occurs in the husband and wife relationship.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.640]   Satan understands that as well.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.360]   Furthermore, there is fellowship.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:16.320]   This is what God said in Genesis 2 and verse 18, "It was not good that man be alone.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:21.440]   I will make a helper suitable for him."
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:28.040]   The primary reason that Eve was created was not to be a baby factory.
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:34.220]   The primary reason that Eve was created was because Adam was alone.
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:42.040]   So there is intentionality of fellowship that is supposed to go on there.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:47.480]   We can see the same thing reflected in John 17, 20, and 21.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:54.040]   So Satan understands that the family is of utmost importance to God's program because
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:20:03.640]   God uses the family as a means of reflecting the communicable attributes of his nature.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:17.360]   We understand God better when we view the proper Christian family.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:25.200]   It communicates to us significant parts of his attributes.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.200]   Now that's not all that Satan understands.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:33.520]   Satan also understands in this battle, in this warfare, that the family is of utmost
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:39.360]   importance to God's program because God uses the family as a means of reflecting the nature
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.760]   of his relationship with his people.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:49.200]   In fact, God calls himself the husband of Israel.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:55.840]   We can see this in Hosea.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:01.640]   Here is the prophet Hosea and his wife Gomer.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:08.120]   It is the husband and wife relationship that depicts God's relationship with his people.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.440]   Hosea is representing God in this sense.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.720]   His wife Gomer is representing the people of Israel.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.560]   His wife Gomer is an adulteress.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:22.720]   She is selling herself out as a prostitute in much the same way that the people of Israel
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.480]   were selling themselves out as a prostitute.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:31.400]   God says to Hosea, "I want you to go and be a husband to her."
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:36.560]   So God now depicts himself as a husband in relationship with his people.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:41.440]   We understand God better, and we understand that relationship better, and we understand
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:49.320]   what happens with God as a grieving husband with a rebellious wife.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:55.520]   We understand what is going on there because the people of Israel were so rebellious.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:00.000]   We can also see that in the New Testament as well.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:08.440]   There in Ephesians 5, verses 22-33, husbands are to love their wives as Christ loved the
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.440]   church.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:14.240]   Christ is the husband, and the church is the bride.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.480]   Husbands are supposed to love their wives in a similar way.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:21.800]   We can see that in Revelation 19, verse 9.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:29.440]   The marriage supper of the Lamb, where the bride, which is the church, comes together
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:39.400]   with the husband, which is Jesus Christ, finally wedded together.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.240]   We can also see this in the father-child relationship.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.760]   There's another depiction.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:51.700]   This is carried through with God referring to himself as the father, and the people of
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.240]   Israel as his children, the children of Israel.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.640]   That's where that phrase comes from.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:11.440]   For Jesus himself being a father-like figure to the people that are a part of his church,
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:19.080]   Romans 8, 12-17, 2 Corinthians 6, 18, John 1, 12, 1 John 3, 16.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.280]   We can see that father-child relationship.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:29.840]   So the family now is used as a picture of God's relationship to his people.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.840]   Satan understands that.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.960]   Satan knows that.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:39.040]   Furthermore, Satan also understands that the family is of utmost importance to God's program
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:44.120]   because of the Bible's teaching about the negative impact that an ungodly family member
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:49.360]   can have on other family members.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:56.840]   You can see this in several different situations in Scripture, or examples that are given in
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:03.620]   Scripture, real life examples.
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:15.400]   Let's grab our Bible for a moment and let's go over to Exodus 20 in verse 5.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:21.880]   Here we have the Decalogue, or the Ten Commandments, and in verse 5 it says, "You shall not worship
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:22.880]   them.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.880]   You shall not serve them.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.560]   For I am the Lord your God, and I am a jealous God, visiting iniquities of the fathers, on
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:32.400]   their children, on the third and fourth generation of those who hate me."
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.440]   Those who hate me.
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.600]   It's a negative impact.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.360]   You can see that there.
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:47.920]   Or if you go to Joshua 7, there's the example of Achan, and how Achan stole, he directly
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.200]   disobeyed God.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:58.920]   He hid what he stole underneath his tent, the floor of his tent, supposedly so that
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:04.400]   people wouldn't find it, but God understood and God knew, and he judged him, and his whole
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:13.520]   family was brought into this betrayal, and as a result of that his whole family was judged.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:19.100]   The negative impact that one member of a family can have upon another member.
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:30.120]   We can go over to Proverbs chapter 21 and verse 9, "It is better to live in the corner
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:34.400]   of a roof than in the house shared with a contentious woman."
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:40.400]   So a woman who decides to be very contentious in her marriage, in her household, makes life
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:45.920]   extremely miserable for people to live.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:51.240]   That's hard to live with such a person.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.840]   The shoe could be easily put on the other foot too.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:26:00.560]   A contentious man can be a very difficult person to live with and make life every day
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:04.400]   almost unbearable.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:11.720]   Or look down at verse 19, same chapter, where he says, "It is better to live in a desert
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:17.760]   land than live with a contentious and vexing woman."
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.360]   Better to live in a desert land than to live that way.
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.520]   Have you ever been in the desert?
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:27.920]   A couple of years ago we were in Israel and we went down the Negev and the bus driver
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.160]   stopped for a little while and let us get out.
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:37.480]   Our tour guide, one of the profs of IBEX, took us out a little hike into the desert
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:42.760]   and we sat there in the scorching heat and a little bit of shade, but it was beastly
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.080]   hot out there.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:50.120]   And after a little while we were all craving the air conditioning of the bus.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:57.960]   And all that kept going through my mind was, "The people of Israel spent 40 years out here,
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:08.000]   and it's hard for me to bear 45 minutes, much less 40 years, my land."
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.720]   That certainly would test you, but God called that a testing ground for them.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:20.080]   And they grumbled and they complained and they tested God and they tested His patience.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:26.080]   Wow, I probably would have been one of the first to grumble and complain.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:35.840]   I hope not, but after just 45 minutes in the desert, well, here living with a very contentious
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.320]   and vexing woman is very similar to that.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.480]   It's just miserable to live that way.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:46.360]   Or you could, again, put the shoe on the other foot and say the same thing about a contentious
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.360]   and vexing man.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:54.560]   I know of a lot of guys who are very, very vexing.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.960]   I've had to counsel a lot of Christian wives who have to live with some pretty horrible
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.940]   husbands in a similar way.
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:06.360]   So the negative impact that an ungodly family member can have on another family member is
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:10.000]   huge, it's just huge.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:18.400]   Well, furthermore, we've got Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 4.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:23.640]   You remember that particular passage because that deals with a father in relationship to
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:35.560]   his children, Ephesians 6 verse 4, "Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:46.040]   bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord."
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:53.120]   The word for anger is parogizomai, which is a word that means to make angry.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:29:03.340]   In fact, it's used in the present active imperative that is a father who, in a sense, brings his
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:16.000]   child along to a deep-seated anger, brings his child along to a deep-seated anger.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   In fact, there's a preposition that's used here in compound here with this, so it indicates
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.440]   an ongoing type of direction.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.260]   This is the way this treatment is.
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:41.600]   It's an ongoing treatment of a man towards his children, and the negative with the present
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:51.000]   imperative says, "Don't bring your child up in this angry," or we could translate it,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.600]   "exasperated type of lifestyle."
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:59.960]   So it's to prevent a habitual action.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:07.380]   Maybe you've seen fathers that are that way, where they're constantly poking at their kids,
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:13.780]   maybe not physically or verbally, maybe they're doing it verbally.
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:23.020]   They always say hurtful little things that are meant to sound funny, but, "Wow, you're
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:25.900]   really stupid, aren't you?
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.080]   You're dumb.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.980]   You're an idiot.
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:33.700]   You're the most clumsy person I've ever seen in my life."
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:39.700]   When a kid grows up with that kind of thing, where he's getting all kinds of verbal jabs,
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:46.560]   that's bringing your child up in an angry, exasperated lifestyle.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:53.400]   It provokes anger in the child, and so that child lives with a constant subset of anger
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:31:01.620]   in his heart towards that father, and he hates it, and later on, turns on his father or causes
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.620]   him to...
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.140]   Now, some fathers twist this in the back of their head.
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:11.180]   They think, "I'm just teaching my kid to grow up tough," which is a real twisted thing.
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:17.620]   Well, that kid's gonna be tough, but that kid's gonna be wicked tough, not righteously
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:20.400]   tough.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.480]   That kid's gonna explode in anger.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.240]   This is the type of kid that will purposely go around and hurt other people.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:33.140]   You bring up a kid with that way, present active imperative, you're constantly making
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:43.160]   him angry by the things that you do or the words that you say, then there's gonna be
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:47.680]   a reaction at some particular point.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:53.000]   You can see the same thing in Colossians 3, in verse 21.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.480]   Let's go over to Colossians 3, 21.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:32:01.480]   It says, "Fathers, do not exasperate your children," there it is, "so that they will
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:05.880]   not lose heart."
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:11.600]   The word here, to lose heart, means that they've given up hope.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:22.600]   They've lost hope that anything is ever going to change in life.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:35.400]   They have been the type of kids who have had their hopes removed and dispelled.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:55.120]   They are sad kids who are given to depression, or it may result in overt rebellion, or it
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:33:01.400]   may result in a passive form of rebellion.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:10.000]   But there's that exasperated lifestyle, Colossians 3, 21, a child who's lost heart.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.560]   There's nothing left.
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:17.240]   For him, life is nothing but emptiness because the father has done nothing but irritate that
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:24.200]   child for years.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.800]   Maybe some of you grew up in households like that.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:32.080]   Maybe your father was that way.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:45.520]   You grew up with a father who was not a believer and he provoked you all the time, or maybe
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:51.480]   your father was a professing believer and he still provoked you.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:57.600]   That is a miserable way to grow up; it's a horrible way to grow up.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.680]   Well, Satan understands that.
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:06.960]   He understands that certain family members can have negative impacts.
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:14.200]   There can be ungodly husbands, or ungodly wives, or ungodly children, or ungodly parents
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:19.160]   that can have negative impacts upon other people's lives that affect them.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:27.040]   We also see this in Proverbs 14, in verse 1.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:36.900]   Here it talks about, this is again a reference to a woman and the way she directs her house.
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:44.640]   The wise woman builds her house, but the foolish tears it down with her own hands.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:49.980]   Over in chapter 12, in verse 4, an excellent wife is the crown of her husband, but she
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:56.800]   who shames him is like rottenness to his bones.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:06.040]   A woman has a huge impact upon the disposition of her household, huge.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:09.600]   You've heard that old saying, "if mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy."
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:15.840]   Well, that's sort of what this is saying.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:25.540]   If mama is an unhappy, angry person who is always attacking other people and tearing
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:36.360]   them down, the Bible calls that type of woman a foolish woman.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:44.160]   If she shames her husband, does shameful, disgraceful things, she is like rottenness
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.200]   to his bones.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:51.040]   But an excellent wife is like a crown to her husband.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:55.200]   That's like saying, some of you guys have favorite hats you like to wear because you
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.000]   just think you look really good in that hat.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:08.760]   Well, in the same way, a really God-honoring, loving wife is like a great hat.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.200]   You want to display that wife everywhere.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:19.240]   You want to show her off to other people because she honors you.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.600]   You love that.
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.600]   That's why you take her to class.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.760]   You want to show her off, there you go.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.760]   That's good.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:32.360]   You get credit for that there.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:35.520]   That's right.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:39.160]   So a godly woman is like that.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:43.920]   And a wise woman, rather than tearing her family members down, does everything she can
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.040]   in order to build them up.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.240]   Now, this is not a self-esteem verse.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.320]   It's not the idea where you're trying to build up somebody's self-esteem.
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:56.080]   The idea is you're doing that which is beneficial to their long-term spiritual welfare.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.080]   That's what you're doing.
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.080]   A godly woman does that.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.120]   A wise woman does that.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:04.720]   She does that which is beneficial to their long-term spiritual welfare.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:09.280]   This is not building up some kind of sinful self-esteem thing.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.280]   That's not the idea.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.280]   All right.
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.280]   So Satan understands this.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.880]   Satan also knows that the family is of utmost importance to God's program because of the
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:20.160]   Bible's teaching about the important functions that the family is to fulfill in the lives
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.240]   of its members.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:26.480]   Everybody has a function, an important function there.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:35.800]   We can see that in Ephesians chapter 5 verses 25 through 27 where Paul talks about husbands
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:39.640]   loving your wives just as Christ loved the church.
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:43.660]   Later on in verse 27, "That he may present her to himself in all of her glory, having
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:53.040]   no spot or wrinkle or such thing, but that she should be holy and blameless."
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:58.000]   In other words, a husband is supposed to be a benefit to his wife so that his relationship
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   to her builds her up in holiness and blamelessness.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.440]   It builds her up in the right way.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.440]   That's the way a husband should be.
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:12.360]   Genesis 2, 18, "It's not good for a man to be alone, but I will make a helper suitable
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.360]   for him."
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:18.760]   Proverbs 31, you've got the virtuous woman and the characteristics of the virtuous woman.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:24.640]   Proverbs 14, we already saw where the wise man builds her house up, but the foolish woman
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.520]   tears it down.
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:31.880]   And Proverbs 12, 4 talks about the woman who is a crown to her husband, but then the one
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:35.080]   who is disgraceful or shameful is rottenness to his bone.
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:40.600]   When you see the same thing in the illustrations that are used in Psalm 127 and 128 and Psalm
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:49.320]   112, as well as Proverbs 14, 26, and 27, there's all examples.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:55.360]   So Satan understands this, and he also understands that the family is of utmost importance to
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:59.920]   God's program because of the important roles that the family life is given among the requirements
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.480]   for leadership in the church.
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:07.640]   In fact, you can't be a leader in the church without having your relationship to your wife
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.640]   and your children right.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.800]   That's at the top of that qualification.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:17.040]   First Timothy 3, you can see the same thing in First Timothy 5, 10.
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:24.640]   A man has a responsibility to support his household.
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:27.840]   Satan also knows that the family is of utmost importance to God's program because of the
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:33.600]   way that God connects family relationships to our relationship with Him.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:39.440]   We can see this in Ephesians 5, 18, where it says, "Don't be drunk with wine," which
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:45.760]   leads to debauchery, but be filled with the Holy Spirit, and then a direct outgrowth of
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:51.960]   that is the relationship of the husband and the wife has to do with interpersonal relationships
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:52.960]   there.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:40:00.240]   You can see that in 1 Peter 3, 1-6, where Peter talks to women who are married to unbelieving
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:07.320]   husbands or at least husbands who act like unbelievers, that the way that you win them
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.880]   over is without words by the behavior of their wives.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.120]   We're going to talk about that more later.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:20.400]   First Peter 3-7, Peter talks to Christian husbands married to unbelieving wives.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:25.280]   How are you supposed to relate to the unbelieving wives, especially the wife who brings suffering
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.240]   into your life?
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:31.840]   It's that Proverbs 12, 4 woman who brings rottenness to your bones.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:38.340]   How are you supposed to live with that kind of a woman who does that kind of thing?
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:40.520]   So Satan understands that.
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:44.600]   Furthermore, Satan understands that the family is of utmost importance to God's program because
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:51.840]   the Bible teaches that the family demands top loyalty next to God and His kingdom.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:55.960]   We can see that in Ephesians 5, 22-23.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:01.600]   Our first relationship is to God, then it is to our husband or our wife and our children.
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:10.040]   We can see that in 1 Timothy 5, 8, Colossians 3, 17-19, 1 Peter 3, 1-7.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:21.680]   So our relationship to God is first, then comes our relationship to our husband or wife
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:22.680]   or our kids.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:28.520]   In fact, that is the very thing that sets the tone for our relationship to our husbands
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:31.840]   or to our wives or to our children.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:37.320]   So I say again, the answer to the question that we started in our last class period,
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:45.320]   "What is the family?" is tremendously important for all the reasons that we have talked about,
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:52.280]   but especially for this one, that Satan is opposed to the biblical concept of the family
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:59.000]   because of the important role that the family plays in the program of God.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.840]   Satan is opposed to it.
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:08.360]   If we resist Satan, then part of that resistance of Satan is having godly families.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:15.240]   As pastors, helping our flock or shepherding them in such a way that they understand what
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:18.960]   it means to be a godly husband, they understand what it means to be a godly wife, they understand
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:25.600]   what it means to be godly parents, they understand what it means to be godly children, shepherding
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.920]   them in that way.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:35.640]   And now, having emphasized the importance of this question, we're going to turn to the
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:38.320]   actual question itself.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:46.240]   What does the Bible say is the definition of the family?
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:50.280]   Let's pick up and talk about what is the family.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:57.760]   We left off with this question, and we've talked about how important this particular
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.680]   question is, but we need to define it biblically.
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:05.520]   If we look at this from a biblical standpoint, the first and primary thing we have to look
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:12.960]   at is what the Bible calls "spiritual family."
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:19.600]   There are really two kinds of family described in the Bible, and the first is a spiritual
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.760]   family.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.760]   Now, what are we talking about here?
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:40.440]   Well, according to 1 Timothy, chapter 3, verse 15, Ephesians 2, verse 19, 3.15, John 1.12,
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:46.800]   and Galatians 3, there are several verses here in the scripture that refer to Christians
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:55.760]   as the family of God, or as sons or children of God.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:44:09.040]   So in eternity, we belong to a family, and for us as believers, it's all the same family.
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:19.520]   God is the Father, we are His kids, and He directs all the affairs of the family.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:23.840]   Now that's not the only spiritual family that's out there.
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:35.680]   The Bible also talks about another spiritual family, and it does so in John 8, verses 38-44,
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:41.240]   and here, Jesus refers to this other spiritual family in His interaction with a group of
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.640]   people.
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:51.160]   He does the same thing in Matthew, chapter 13, verse 38, and He talks about the children
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:57.000]   of the wicked one, or the children of the devil.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.960]   The children of the wicked one, or the children of the devil, that's a second type of spiritual
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.560]   family.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:12.480]   Now these are believers, and in verse 39 of Matthew 13, He identifies the wicked one
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.220]   as the devil.
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:25.640]   In Acts 13.10, there's another reference to this other spiritual family, and Paul confronts
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:38.240]   the man by the name of Elimeas, and he refers to him as a child of the devil.
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:44.200]   First John chapter 3, verse 10, tells us that all who are not children of God are children
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.920]   of the devil.
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:52.120]   All who are not children of God are children of the devil.
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:56.340]   So the Bible talks about spiritual families.
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:05.240]   In a sense, this is the greater reality, and when you read psych textbooks on marriage
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:10.000]   and the family, or sociology textbooks on marriage and the family, nothing is talked
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.680]   about in regards to spiritual families.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:17.180]   Even in a lot of integrational family material, there's nothing talked about in terms of spiritual
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:18.540]   families.
[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:22.920]   But here, the Bible gives a lot of information on spiritual families, and it's almost totally
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:24.660]   neglected.
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:26.340]   But it's an important aspect.
[00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:31.820]   You get some aspect of the spiritual family within the local church because you are brothers
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:37.600]   and sisters in the local church, and you get a little foretaste of what heaven is supposed
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:44.160]   to be like when the church is functioning in a holy and God-honoring way.
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:48.600]   Spiritual taste of heaven, brothers and sisters interacting, caring for one another, loving
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:53.900]   one another, praying for one another, supporting one another, encouraging one another, edifying
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:56.780]   one another, building one another up.
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:01.040]   That's what the church should be doing.
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.660]   That's the spiritual family.
[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:14.500]   Long after your husband or your wife passes away, you still have a spiritual family.
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:20.060]   That's an important family.
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:28.860]   And when you die and go to heaven, or if Christ returns first, you will join up with your
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:31.580]   eternal family.
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:40.080]   That's the broader context of what the family is supposed to be.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.900]   Now that's not the only kind of family the Bible talks about.
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:47.380]   The Bible also talks about a second type of family.
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:53.560]   In this particular case, it's talking about what we would refer to as biological families
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:48:00.220]   or physical families.
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:11.420]   And here, even in physical families, we have two distinct kinds of physical families.
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:17.700]   The Bible refers to extended families.
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:22.740]   This is the family that is described today as the extended family and would include grandparents
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:31.340]   and uncles and aunts and cousins and great grandparents and so on.
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:49.180]   First cousins, second cousins, depending on where you come from, aunts or aunts, and uncles.
[00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:51.620]   So there's this extended family.
[00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:59.300]   You can see this in Judges 6.15 and Genesis 10.5 and following, Luke 2.4, 1 Timothy 5,
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:08.400]   Mark 7, extended families that go beyond just a husband and wife relationship.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:15.740]   But there is another type of family as well that the Bible recognizes that is described
[00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:21.860]   today as the nuclear family.
[00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:30.120]   This unit is the traditional nuclear family consisting of a husband and his wife along
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:36.100]   with unmarried children who are living with them and for whom they bear important child-rearing
[00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:40.940]   responsibilities.
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:47.900]   That's the family units that are talked about in Genesis 2.24, Psalm 128 verses 1-4, Ephesians
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:59.340]   5.22-6.4, Colossians 3.18-21, 1 Peter 3.7, all of those.
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:04.020]   So broadly, we would say this, the Bible divides family and the concept of the family down
[00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:05.580]   into two broad categories.
[00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:08.820]   There are spiritual families and there are physical families.
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:12.540]   And within both of those, there are two categories.
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:17.620]   One is the family of God and the other one is the family of Satan and the spiritual family.
[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:22.100]   In the physical family, there are extended family members and then there are immediate
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:30.300]   family members or the traditional nuclear family of a husband and wife and children.
[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:39.920]   You don't have to have children in order to have a family unit or home in the Bible.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:46.480]   But that is what is referred to as the family.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:55.560]   So we could say this, that our first answer to the question here, what is the family?
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:51:01.200]   What is the Biblical concept of the family, would be that from God's perspective, there
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:04.160]   are basically only two kinds of families.
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:08.640]   Spiritual families as well as physical families.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:13.040]   Two broad types of family.
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:16.160]   And you belong to both types of family.
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:21.920]   Whether you're a Christian or not, you either belong to the family of God or the family
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:29.400]   of Satan.
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:37.000]   If you are born into the world and you grew up with people, whether they were your biological
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:47.560]   parents or not, you have a family relationship there and you usually have also extended family
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:55.240]   members that you may not be biologically related to, but they are nonetheless a part of the
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:56.560]   family.
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:04.760]   Now, there are also several more specific facts about what the family is and what it
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:08.400]   should be from God's perspective.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:13.360]   What the family is and what it should be from God's perspective.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:15.000]   What is it?
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.880]   What should it be?
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:27.280]   Well, first, the Bible teaches that the family is God's antidote to loneliness.
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:34.440]   It's a place where the deepest kind of friendships are formed and experienced.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:45.620]   The family is God's antidote for loneliness.
[00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:50.400]   We can see this in Genesis chapter 2 and verse 18.
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:54.640]   I want you to grab your Bible and let's go back there.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:53:03.200]   And we're going to actually elaborate on this verse a little bit more later on in our class.
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:08.120]   But let's at least get familiar with this now.
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:12.360]   "Then the Lord God said, 'It is not good for man to be alone.
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:19.400]   I will make him a helper suitable for him.'"
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:27.160]   So after God created Adam, he said it's not good for Adam to be alone and this is the
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:38.960]   occasion or the setting we would say, or the rationale behind giving Adam a gender complement.
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:40.680]   That is Eve.
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:41.840]   Why?
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:44.720]   Because Adam was alone.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:48.580]   He needed fellowship.
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:56.080]   He needed someone to interact with and this is made much more poignant in the verses following
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:57.080]   verse 18.
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:59.120]   We can see this in verses 19 and 20.
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:03.080]   It says, "Out of the ground, the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:06.720]   bird of the sky and brought them to the man to see what he would call them.
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:11.760]   And whatever the man called a living creature, that was its name.
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:15.040]   The man gave names to all the cattle and to the birds of the sky and to every beast of
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:16.040]   the field.
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:20.980]   But for Adam, there was not found a helper suitable for him."
[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:26.760]   Now the Hebrew word for helper suitable is the word ezer kanigno, actually a compound
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:27.760]   word.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:33.720]   Ezer kanigno, a suitable helper, a fitting completer, an ezer kanigno.
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:37.640]   For several years, I used to call my wife my little ezer kanigno.
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:39.840]   Some people who didn't know Hebrew thought I was cursing at her.
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:40.840]   I wasn't.
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:42.400]   It was a term of endearment.
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:47.440]   In other words, she was a fitting help.
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:51.040]   One who completed me.
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.040]   That's who she was.
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:57.240]   She was someone ideally suited for me.
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:02.760]   You can see here within context, he acknowledges in verse 18, there's no suitable helper, there's
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:04.960]   no ezer kanigno for Adam.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:09.560]   In verse 20, he comes back to the fact there is no ezer kanigno for Adam.
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:13.800]   And in between this, Adam spends all of his time naming the animals.
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:19.040]   Which by the way, shows you the incredible intelligence of Adam, far more intelligent
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:26.160]   than Einstein or anyone else that the world has produced.
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:34.960]   Because to be able to name all the animals on the planet, and to remember and not repeat
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:45.480]   any of those names, and if he named them based upon common semantic ways that they would
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:51.960]   name their children, or name creatures, he probably named the animals based upon the
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:55.320]   most common characteristic of that animal.
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:56:01.360]   But he was able to remember all of that and do that all in one day, and there are a whole
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:06.320]   species of animals that are passed out of existence since the time of Adam, and even
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:10.240]   a lot of the species that are still alive on earth today, or there are species that
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:14.080]   are still alive on earth today, that we have never named yet.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.880]   We're still finding them.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:20.280]   I love to watch all those history and science channels on the TV, and they're always talking
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:27.840]   about all these new types of animals that they're finding in the outer reaches of the
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:35.960]   Amazon jungle, or Honduras, way up in the mountains.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:44.520]   Some new kind of species of rat, or rock badger, or in the depths of the sea, some new species
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:46.240]   of fish.
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:55.600]   Well, Adam was able to name all the animals, and remember all those names, and he was able
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:57.360]   to do that in one day.
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:01.880]   You understand the intelligence that it took for Adam to do that kind of thing.
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:10.000]   Now, why does God say there was no Azirconigno for Adam, and then he has him name all the
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   animals?
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.280]   What does he do that?
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:25.000]   Well, because at the end of the day, Adam realized, after seeing Mr. and Mrs. Giraffe,
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.920]   and Mr. and Mrs. Hippopotamus, and Mr. and Mrs. Skunk going by all day long, after seeing
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:36.000]   all of that, Adam realized, even though the animal was teeming with life, he was still
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   alone.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.480]   He understood that.
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:44.640]   This becomes a gigantic object lesson for Adam.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.720]   It's huge.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:57.740]   And so, this is where God now creates Eve, verse 21, "For the Lord God caused a deep
[00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:02.040]   sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept, and he took one of the ribs and closed up
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:05.200]   the flesh at that place."
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.600]   So God creates Eve.
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.080]   Now Adam has a complement.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:14.000]   None of the animals in the world complemented him.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   Eve does.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.720]   She is his perfect Azirconigno.
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:21.480]   She is his perfect gender complement.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:25.080]   She is exactly what he needed.
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:26.740]   Wow.
[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:29.560]   This is what Adam wanted.
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:35.640]   So the point is that Adam was alone, even though the whole earth was teeming with life,
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:36.640]   with animals.
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:40.800]   You know, we have that saying that the dog is man's best friend.
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:44.600]   Well, that's not true.
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:51.000]   The woman is man's best friend, according to the Bible, not the dog.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.160]   And the two are not the same thing.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:57.040]   You don't pet her.
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:00.080]   No, not the same thing.
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:04.720]   She is his gender complement.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:09.480]   Now, grab your Bible and let's go over to another passage.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:14.640]   Let's go over to Psalm 68 and verse 6.
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:22.760]   Here's an interesting little passage.
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:32.640]   It's a Psalm of David and he says, "God makes a home for the lonely.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:36.520]   He leads out the prisoners into prosperity.
[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:40.560]   Only the rebellious dwell in a parched land."
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:48.400]   In other words, the marriage relationship was made for lonely people.
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:55.320]   The home was designed for lonely people.
[00:59:55.320 --> 01:00:01.920]   The home is God's antidote for loneliness.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:05.440]   It's the place of fellowship.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.380]   It's a place of intimacy.
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:17.140]   It's a place where a husband and a wife can be themselves and not fear any judgment or
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:19.300]   reprisal.
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:25.540]   And it is a sorry state that a lot of homes get into, an ungodly state where they dread
[01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:30.780]   being around one another and they hate one another and they criticize one another.
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:32.540]   That's not the way the home is supposed to be.
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:36.660]   The home is supposed to be a place for the lonely.
[01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:41.340]   That's a good thing.
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:49.260]   When you're single for a long time and you desire to be married, you understand that
[01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:50.580]   loneliness.
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:57.180]   Or all you have to do as a pastor is talk to the widows or widowers in your congregation.
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:59.460]   You want to talk about loneliness?
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:04.860]   These are people who probably have had great marriages for several years and they've lost
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:14.400]   their lifelong spouse and they have this far off look in their eye like "I don't know what
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:18.540]   my place in this world is anymore.
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:22.700]   I don't know where I belong."
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:25.860]   They're gone.
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:30.620]   That's a sad situation.
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:39.820]   God has a place for the lonely and the place is the home and the family.
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:02:02.700]   >> I've got a question with a man in our ministry now who is a divorced man and he keeps talking
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:03.700]   about how he's lonely, so lonely.
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:04.700]   He's longing for that companionship, which is a good thing.
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:05.700]   But how do you balance that good desire for a companion, a spouse, and that relationship
[01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:12.040]   with trusting in God, finding your satisfaction in God, especially at that stage of life?
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.040]   >> That's a really good question.
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.720]   Let me see if I can repeat it.
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:20.580]   You're asking the question about a divorced man in your church who expresses the fact
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:24.340]   that he has this deep sense of loneliness now.
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:32.600]   And how do you balance that with the fact that that deep sense of loneliness with, well,
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:36.020]   how did you express that with?
[01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:40.300]   >> How do you balance that loneliness with finding satisfaction in God?
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:43.780]   >> Oh, finding satisfaction in God, yeah.
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:49.700]   And it's good that you put it that way because that's really going to be the struggle because
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:55.820]   if his desire to be married overrules his desire to be God's kind of man, then that
[01:02:55.820 --> 01:03:00.880]   becomes an idolatrous desire and it becomes an ungodly desire.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:04.980]   His first desire has got to be I want to be God's kind of man, whatever he chooses, whatever
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:07.060]   God chooses to bring into my life.
[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:12.140]   If that means a life without a wife, then that's what that means.
[01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:15.640]   And I've learned to be satisfied in him.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:19.660]   But is it wrong for him to have a desire to be married?
[01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:20.660]   No it's not.
[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:22.020]   It's not wrong.
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:29.540]   But he's got to keep that desire in check by being God's kind of man first and foremost
[01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:32.100]   in his desire to be married.
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:39.340]   In other words, if he gets married just on the basis of that desire, it would be a very
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:41.340]   selfish marriage.
[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:47.980]   Because he would be getting married with that desire, that is, desire to get married, to
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:53.700]   overcome his loneliness, would be based upon the fact that I'm marrying this woman so she
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:55.820]   can keep me happy.
[01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:57.820]   I don't feel alone anymore.
[01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:03.940]   Well, that's the wrong ultimate reason to be married.
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:07.740]   The ultimate reason to be married is I'm going to marry her so that I can serve her.
[01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:10.900]   And by the way, she's going to be a companion to me.
[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:12.740]   But I'm going to serve her.
[01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:16.900]   So if he doesn't keep his priorities right by being God's kind of man first and only
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:22.540]   secondly desiring to be married, then if he does get married, he's going to marry for
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:25.620]   all the wrong reasons.
[01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:31.500]   So he's got to keep that, and you as a pastor need to help him understand that because he's
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.340]   setting himself up for a disaster.
[01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:37.500]   God could send along somebody for him to get married, and then he marries for the wrong
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.500]   reason.
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:43.300]   It becomes a very selfish marriage and becomes very evident to his wife that he married her
[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:49.420]   for what she can do for him, not for what he can do for her.
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:55.100]   So I think that keeping that in perspective will help him a lot.
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:05:01.220]   That's a good question though because in my ministry in the past as a pastor, I can remember
[01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:03.140]   situations like that.
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:07.580]   Now most of them that stand out in my mind are people who are widowed or widowers.
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:13.140]   Those are the ones where I think if they've had really good marriages that are part of
[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:17.940]   the past, I mean, you can see the loneliness in their eyes.
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:18.940]   You can see it.
[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:24.580]   And they'll honestly say to you as a pastor, "You know, I'm not suicidal or anything like
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:30.260]   that, but I really long for heaven," because they miss that companionship, and they don't
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:33.740]   have it anymore.
[01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:37.580]   And as a pastor, I just say, "Hey, I agree with you.
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:38.580]   I understand.
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:39.580]   I fully...
[01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:40.580]   I'm there."
[01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:46.500]   In the meantime, let the body of Christ minister to you as much as possible, and do what you
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.500]   can.
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:51.060]   There's obviously a reason that God has you here on earth after your spouse is gone.
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:54.020]   So let's make the most of that for this particular time.
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:59.260]   Don't dwell in self-pity because I don't have a companion anymore.
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:02.860]   Self-pity becomes an excuse for sin.
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:04.460]   Don't dwell in that.
[01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:05.460]   And you can help them.
[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:11.700]   You can coach them along in that way, but I fully understand what you're talking about
[01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:12.700]   there.
[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:16.180]   Well, let's see if we can go to another passage here.
[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:23.020]   Grave Revival, let's go over to Proverbs, Proverbs 2, and verse 17.
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:31.460]   And you notice, here's a word, a reference to marriage that refers to marriage as a covenant.
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:37.500]   Verse 17 says, it talks about this strange woman who is the adulteress, and verse 17
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:44.340]   says, "that leaves the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God."
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:48.960]   So marriage here is referred to as a covenant.
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:52.220]   Now I know that there are a lot of people out there in the Christian realm that want
[01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:56.820]   to extend that covenant relationship out into the engagement period.
[01:06:56.820 --> 01:07:00.060]   Boy, I resist that intensely.
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:06.040]   When you're engaged, you're not making a covenant, not in an official miracle sense.
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:07.840]   That's not what's going on.
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:11.860]   Only when you get married at a wedding ceremony are you making that.
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:16.500]   If you're making that covenant when you agree to get engaged, then why do you even have
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.140]   to go through a marital wedding?
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:22.460]   You shouldn't have to go through it, because you've already made the covenant, it's supposed
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:23.460]   to be a lifetime.
[01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:24.460]   No, no, no.
[01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:31.240]   The engagement period of time is intended as a time to see, all right, we're gonna seriously
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:34.460]   talk about marriage and putting our lives together, is this going to work?
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:38.200]   And it's a time to back out if it's not going to work.
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:42.500]   It's a time to implement discernment, judgment, and wisdom.
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:49.060]   You don't extend that covenant over the engagement period.
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:51.960]   The covenant begins at marriage.
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:54.160]   The Bible's very clear about that.
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:59.440]   And you understand that the Hebrew word for covenant is the word "burrit," and it is,
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:03.720]   it's not burrito, that's Mexican, but it's burrit, okay?
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:07.560]   And it means, the idea is to cut a covenant.
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:13.940]   And back in ancient times, when they made agreements, they didn't sign papers.
[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:19.400]   They would take an animal, and they would slaughter the animal, and they would slice
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:25.080]   that animal down in half, and the two parties making the agreement would walk between the
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:30.600]   two halves of that animal, and in that way, they were making a covenant before God, saying,
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:36.600]   if we were to break this covenant, may God do to us what has been done to this animal.
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:41.840]   May God split us in half, or me personally in half.
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:42.840]   That's the agreement.
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:50.040]   That's a very graphic thing, to take a sheep or a lamb and to split that thing in half,
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:56.720]   and to walk between the two halves of that, was a very memorable covenant.
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:00.240]   And that's where the idea of cutting a covenant comes from.
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:06.920]   So it's a very sacred thing, okay, which meant the taking of a life, in this case, the life
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.480]   of an animal.
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:15.960]   So the implication is, if we were to ever break this covenant, may God take our life.
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:19.900]   May God do the same thing to me.
[01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:23.880]   So here, marriage is referred to as a covenant.
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:29.040]   And notice how it talks about the fact that when a woman commits adultery, or a man for
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:38.120]   that matter, what they have done is they have left the companion of their youth, verse 17.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:43.720]   You see the emphasis here is upon companionship, right?
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.160]   That's the emphasis.
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:51.560]   So marriage is not primarily, the purpose of marriage is not primarily here to have
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:52.800]   children.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:57.320]   That's one of the blessings of marriage, but that's not the purpose of marriage.
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:03.360]   In Genesis 1, 28, talks about, "Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth and subdue it."
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:06.360]   God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful, multiply."
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:07.840]   That's the blessing of marriage.
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.500]   The purpose of marriage is companionship.
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:14.460]   It's the antidote for loneliness, is the implication.
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:17.040]   Same thing's true in Malachi, all right?
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:28.880]   Let's go over to Malachi, Malachi chapter 2, and in verse 14, Malachi chapter 2.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:36.080]   I used to have a guy who was on staff at our church when I was a pastor.
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:41.040]   He was Italian, and he always talked about Malachi being the only Italian book in the
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.660]   Bible.
[01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:44.120]   It's Malachi.
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.760]   That's the way he would pronounce it.
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:50.440]   Malachi chapter 2 and verse 14, all right?
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:54.120]   "Yet you say, 'For what reason?'
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:57.320]   Because the Lord has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:04.800]   you have dealt treacherously, though she is," notice this, "your companion and your wife
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.280]   by covenant."
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:09.800]   There's brit, companion and covenant.
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:13.160]   The covenant is a reflection of the promise that they made before God that was a sacred
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:21.080]   promise, and the companionship is a description of what they are to mean to one another.
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:22.200]   What do they mean to one another?
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.280]   They're companions to one another.
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:28.120]   They're companions for a lifetime for one another.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:32.360]   They walk through thick and thin with one another.
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:36.600]   That's the idea.
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:42.800]   I cannot stand to be away from my wife for a long period of time.
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:44.040]   I can't do that.
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:47.900]   I've always got to drag her with me.
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:50.240]   I love being around her, and she loves being around me.
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:56.960]   It's a good thing, except for when I drag her all over the planet, and she has lots
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:58.320]   of stuff to do at home.
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.600]   That becomes a problem, but we love being together.
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:04.720]   That's a good thing because we're companions.
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:07.480]   We share everything in life.
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:12.680]   She knows more about me than I know about myself.
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:16.400]   I know an awful lot about her as well.
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:17.520]   That's a good thing.
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:19.540]   That's the way God intended it.
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:22.760]   The family is really God's antidote for loneliness.
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:24.240]   I can't imagine life.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:29.160]   I can really, as a pastor, sympathize with widows and widowers.
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:38.040]   What are you going to do after you lose your spouse where you've had a wonderful, not perfect
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:42.680]   on this human earth, but a wonderful, mutually satisfying marriage?
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:49.080]   What are you going to do if you lose your companion?
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:56.820]   We learn that the family is a place where people experience friendship.
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:13:00.540]   They experience companionship.
[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:03.660]   They experience intimacy.
[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:11.420]   It's a place where people are supposed to be themselves, not as if they're fakes out
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:18.860]   in public, but they don't have to be afraid of people criticizing them or demeaning them.
[01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:23.660]   I'm sorry to say that that's not the way some families are, and even Christian families.
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:24.800]   They're critical of one another.
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.060]   They're hateful with one another.
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:27.260]   They're mean with one another.
[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:30.180]   They're sharp-tongued with one another.
[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:39.620]   God never intended the family to be that way, never.
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:48.060]   So this has huge implications.
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:55.060]   It has tremendous implications for every family member, husbands, wives, parents, children.
[01:13:55.060 --> 01:14:01.360]   The word "companion" that we saw there in Proverbs 2.17, Malachi 2.14, literally means
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:06.820]   one who accompanies.
[01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:19.580]   It refers to spending time with someone, doing things together, being interested in what
[01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:25.140]   interests other people in the family.
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:34.660]   This is what ought to be happening in families.
[01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:40.940]   Your kids should enjoy being around you.
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:43.340]   Our kids do.
[01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:47.780]   They enjoy being around us, and we love being around them, and we're constantly teasing
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:56.700]   them how they like to be around a couple of old fuddy-duddies, all right?
[01:14:56.700 --> 01:15:07.620]   Proverbs 17, verse 17, and 27.10, that involves being a true friend, being loyal, faithful,
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:19.660]   concerned, committed, helpful, unselfish, protective, defending the other person, willing
[01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:23.880]   to sacrifice for the other person.
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:31.200]   You can see this in Jonathan and David's relationship, 1 Samuel 18.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:38.620]   Now that's the kind of thing that should be happening in the family relationship, where
[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:41.600]   people do that.
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:46.640]   They're around one another, and they enjoy being around one another.
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:53.520]   They love that.
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:16:01.960]   They're protective of one another.
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:12.680]   Sometimes that can extend to sinful deeds, but there is a sense in which you watch over
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:17.320]   your family.
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:20.720]   I grew up with two younger sisters.
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:25.940]   My mother tells a story that we lived in a house that was sort of on a hill, and coming
[01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:32.640]   from our grade school to the house, we had a road behind the house that went up towards
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:40.120]   the house, and my mother would stand and do dishes and look out the window and watch us
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:41.800]   coming home from school.
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:48.920]   She still tells the story about one day she looked out the window as she was washing dishes,
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:55.240]   and I had some kid by the nap of the neck and was ready to clobber him, and what had
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:17:03.520]   happened was he had come along and taken school papers of my sister and had torn them up,
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:05.800]   and so I'm ready to defend my sister.
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:13.320]   Now every other time I'd tease her mercilessly, but here I'm defending her, okay?
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:22.280]   And she stepped out the back door and yelled at me, "Johnny, you get home right now!"
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:29.080]   So now that was a sinful reaction on my part, but there is a sense in which, as Proverbs
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:34.160]   17, 17, Proverbs 27, 10 talks about, that's part of being loyal and protected to a family
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:35.160]   member.
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:40.280]   If you see somebody doing something that's unjust, you need to step in and help that
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:41.280]   family member.
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:42.280]   That's a good thing.
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:43.280]   That's what families are for.
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:45.680]   It's not wrong.
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:49.440]   God as the Father protects His family, His children.
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:55.500]   He did that with Israel over and over again.
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:56.500]   He provided for them.
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:59.360]   I mean, they're the crossing of the Red Sea.
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:00.560]   What does He do?
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:04.080]   There's an army bearing down upon them.
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:09.560]   He protects His children, and He destroys the enemy of His children.
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:14.040]   So that's the example that God the Father uses.
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:15.040]   That's not a bad thing.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:23.980]   That's a good thing, as long as we're careful not to let sinful desires to step in there.
[01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:27.600]   Because of our sinfulness, we are not perfectly like God.
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:33.320]   Well, in addition to that, we've got Proverbs 29, 5, and Proverbs 27, 5 and 6.
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:38.320]   Being a true friend means that you will avoid flattery and that you're not afraid to rebuke
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:41.060]   gently as well.
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:51.640]   In the family, you can tell people hard things because they know that you mean it in love.
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:57.720]   There's a place for open rebuke.
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:03.520]   That's a type of rebuke that's said in love, but it's honest and faithful.
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:16.560]   First Kings chapter 1, you can see that David, verse 6, never rebuked his son Adonijah, and
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:25.240]   it caused Adonijah his life.
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:33.280]   The Hebrew there says that David never caused his son pain.
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:36.140]   First Kings 1, verse 6.
[01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:40.360]   So in that sense, David was a negligent father.
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:46.720]   He never caused Adonijah pain, and he should have.
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:48.960]   He should have lowered Adonijah's self-esteem.
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:58.760]   That's what he should have done, because Adonijah, he thought he was pretty hot stuff, and he
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:02.800]   grew up thinking he was pretty hot stuff.
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:05.200]   David never checked that.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:09.280]   David's family was not functioning in the way that God wants families to function.
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:17.640]   So in this respect, David was not being a true father to his son.
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:22.720]   God's plan for the family is that family members should be companions, friends, and part of
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:30.240]   being a true friend means being lovingly honest with other family members.
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:31.440]   David should have been that way.
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:36.960]   He should have said, "Adonijah, what you're doing is wrong and it's sinful.
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:44.800]   You're a prideful young man, and I'm going to cause you some pain because of your pride.
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:51.080]   I'm going to apply the Board of Education to the seat of irresponsibility.
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:56.000]   That's what I'm going to do."
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.680]   That's what David should have said.
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:05.720]   Now Proverbs chapter 12 and verse 26, here being a true friend involves being concerned
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:10.840]   about being a positive influence, too.
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:15.120]   It's interesting the way the New International English version translates this.
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:19.800]   It says it is cautious in friendship.
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:28.360]   The New American Standard version says it's a guide to his neighbor.
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:33.720]   So being a good friend involves being a good influence rather than an evil influence in
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:36.400]   the life of another person.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:41.400]   So if you're going to be a good family member, then the implication is you're going to be
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:51.160]   a good influence and influence people positively, not an evil influence.
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:54.600]   You're not going to bring out the worst in people.
[01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:56.440]   Husbands are not going to bring out the worst in wives.
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:58.640]   They're not going to bring out the worst in husbands.
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:00.600]   Parents are not going to bring out the worst in their children.
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:06.360]   Children are not going to bring out the worst in one another or their parents.
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:08.840]   That's being a true friend.
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:12.000]   Then Proverbs 27, verse 14.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.520]   Now here being a true friend means that you will be sensitive to the likes and dislikes
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:18.040]   of others.
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:28.000]   You can also see Proverbs 25.20 and Proverbs 25.17.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.080]   Being a true friend means you're going to be sensitive to the likes and dislikes of
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.080]   the other person.
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:38.920]   In other words, you'll be a blessing to your friend.
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:44.920]   But when you're a blessing, you'll do it at the appropriate time.
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:49.360]   Because Proverbs says, "He who blesses a friend with a loud voice early in the morning, that
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.920]   kind of person is a fool."
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:59.760]   It's like getting up early in the morning and running around and being loud.
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:03.120]   "Hey, how you guys doing?
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:04.120]   What?
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:05.120]   What is that?"
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:06.120]   That's not being a true friend.
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:07.640]   You're not caring for the other person.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:19.040]   You're getting amusement out of their misery.
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:25.600]   Or grab your Bible just for a moment and go over to Proverbs 26 and verse 18.
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:31.640]   A person also understands, a good friend in this case and a family, also understands the
[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:45.960]   wisdom of Proverbs 26.18.
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:53.060]   So a person like this knows when a joke has gone too far.
[01:23:53.060 --> 01:24:02.600]   You know those kind of people who love to play practical jokes that humiliate you.
[01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:04.320]   You hate that.
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:06.320]   And they laugh and they say, "Oh, I was just joking.
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:07.920]   I was just joking.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:11.660]   Made you feel like an idiot or a fool."
[01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:15.160]   They know when a joke's gone too far.
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:20.180]   It's like Proverbs compares them to a madman who just indiscriminately takes bow and arrows
[01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.440]   and shoots them into the air.
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:26.720]   Well eventually those arrows are going to come back down and hurt somebody.
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:29.200]   Maybe cool to shoot that off in the air, but it has consequences.
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:33.920]   It's going to come back to earth.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:41.680]   Or throws firebrands in the air.
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:42.800]   Eventually those things are going to come back.
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:45.700]   They're going to come back and get that person.
[01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:50.760]   So a person knows when a joke has gone too far.
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:55.560]   When you're really tearing a person down, you're not building them up.
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:25:00.040]   Proverbs 27 and verse 9, being a true friend involves encouraging others, cheering them
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:02.040]   up.
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:06.980]   A man's counsel is sweet to his friend.
[01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:18.760]   So a true friend will add sweetness to another person's life through his help, advice, counsel,
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:21.040]   and encouragement.
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:28.800]   It's always amazing to me on a college campus to watch new freshmen come in and some of
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:35.920]   those new freshmen have brothers and sisters that are older than they are, that have been
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:41.680]   there at college for a few years, and to watch those brothers and sisters come in and help
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:49.320]   their sisters and brothers out, adjusting to college, their feeling of loneliness, being
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:53.640]   away from home for the first time for a long period of time.
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:54.840]   They're there to help them out.
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:57.520]   They're there to encourage them and help them.
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:00.480]   That's exactly what should be going on.
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:03.160]   Encouraging the other person, cheering them up.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:06.240]   That's what should be going on in the family, in the home.
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:10.920]   Proverbs 27, 17, being a true friend involves shaping the other person's countenance or
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:18.200]   sharpening, I should say, the other person's countenance.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:24.840]   As iron sharpens iron implies that a true friend, friends are unselfish, a true friend
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:30.480]   is aware when the other person gets dull, is discouraged or down or perplexed or confused
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:37.840]   or hurting, or when the other person is weary or lonely or fearful or anxious or overreacting
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:46.560]   or blowing things out of proportion or practicing tunnel vision or overgeneralizing or exaggerating
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:52.000]   or being lonely or feeling blue or forsaken or useless.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:27:00.040]   And so that person does what they can to lift up the other person's spirit, to help them
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:07.480]   see things more clearly, gain new insights.
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:11.840]   You're sharpening the other person as iron sharpens iron.
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:16.480]   You're sharpening them.
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:18.600]   That's what should be happening.
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:25.760]   Furthermore, John chapter 15, verses 13 through 15, you're willing to sacrifice doing what
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:33.880]   others desire, sharing yourself, your thoughts, your feelings, your concerns.
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:39.000]   Being a true friend involves doing things that the other person wants you to do unless
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:46.640]   to do so would violate a command of God or would be sinful.
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:50.880]   It involves sharing your thoughts and your feelings and your concerns with the other
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:55.940]   person on a deep level, sharing any information with the other person that would not hurt
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:59.080]   them or anyone else and that would be helpful for them.
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:03.720]   It involves open communication, especially involves sharing what God is teaching you
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:11.840]   with them.
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:14.240]   Jesus talked about that with his disciples.
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:18.520]   He says, "I've called you my friends for all the things that my Father has shared with
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:20.540]   me, I've shared with you."
[01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:23.240]   Being a true friend does that.
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:25.720]   You share these good things.
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:28.840]   That's what the family does.
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:36.520]   A family helps one another through those kind of sharing type of experiences.
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:47.040]   Now, all of that is part of God's antidote for loneliness.
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:58.000]   It involves being a true companion, being a true friend.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:04.480]   So this has tremendous implications for every family member, husbands, wives, parents, children.
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:12.220]   Being a companion, being loyal, avoiding flattery, being positive influence, being sensitive
[01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:18.680]   to likes and dislikes, being encouraging, sharpening the other person, sharing of yourself
[01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:23.720]   and willing to sacrifice for the other person, that's what should be going on in the Christian
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:25.140]   home.
[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:26.020]   That's what should be happening.
