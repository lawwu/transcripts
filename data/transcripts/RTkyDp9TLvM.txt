[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Deterrence really seemed to work for a long time, but there's been a change lately, and it's kind of terrifying, I find it at least.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   And the first manifestation was when India and Pakistan, which both went nuclear full scale in the late 1990s.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   But then in 1999, there was a border conflict between the two countries, and Pakistan came up with a whole new argument about nuclear deterrence.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Not only could you prevent a nuclear escalation, but if you kept your deterrent in place, you could have a conventional war with the other side not willing to escalate to nuclear because you still had your nuclear arsenal.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Putin, or someone in the Russian complex, picked up on that new approach, and it's the one Putin is using now.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   He's basically saying, "I'm having a conventional war here, and don't you dare introduce nuclear weapons, or I will.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   In fact, if you defeat me, I may introduce nuclear weapons.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Screw you.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   I'm going to use my nukes as a backup."
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   That's new, and it's terrifying because it's a totally different kind of deterrence that risks going too far too fast to be able to know what's going on.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   I mean, this has gotten really very hairy.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   It used to be pretty straightforward.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Don't bomb us, or we'll bomb you.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Attack in some peripheral country, and we won't bomb you because you might bomb us.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   We'll lose that little war, but we'll come in somewhere else.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   All of these things, that's complicated enough, but now we're talking about this other level.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   You know, the Soviets had millions of men in their army after World War II stationed in Eastern Europe.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   What was it, like 2 million people in the Red Army or something?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And we said, we didn't have the troops remaining in Western Europe, but we said, "Listen, if you invade Western Europe, we'll respond with a nuclear attack."
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   That worked until August 1949, when the Soviets tested their first atomic bomb.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And that's when panic hit Washington, and the whole debate went on about, "Do we build hydrogen bombs?"
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   But there had been a balance of forces.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   You're quite right.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   They had 2 million men on the ground in Europe.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   We had the bomb.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   And then the balance of force was disrupted when they got the bomb.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   So then how do we rebalance?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   And the rebalance was the hydrogen bomb.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And that's, you know, that's how you get to Armageddon, ultimately.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   It's only by having a Democles sword over our heads, the potential for world destruction, or at least of the human world, that it's possible to limit war in this way.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And when people start saying, "Well, look, we can have a conventional war if we've got nuclear weapons, because you're not going to attack us.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   You don't dare.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   We'll use our nuclear weapons on you."
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Something's changed most recently in all of this.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   It's outside the range of all the books I've written.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   It's a whole new thing.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Thank you.
