[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840]   We're going to close out the week with a question from me, Pastor John, about one of Paul's
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.960]   most profound statements of applied theology, and it's too often overlooked, I think.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.340]   It's on my mind because I heard you recently explain it off air.
[00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.880]   You were leading us in a devotional at a Desiring God leadership team meeting, something that
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.460]   we do to open up every meeting together.
[00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.600]   We gather together and begin with a brief devotional and pray together to kind of focus
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:36.080]   our minds and our hearts before we go on to plan and dream and make decisions.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.240]   Last time we met as a leadership team, you led us in the study of Galatians 4, verses
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.240]   4-7.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.160]   It was a great little devotional.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.040]   The guys in the room were all met pretty powerfully there as you explained this cry, "Abba, Father,
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.200]   Abba, Father."
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.120]   And as soon as you were done, I was like, "Wow, I want to record and share this with
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.120]   the APJ audience."
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.000]   So here we are now on record, this "Abba, Father" cry.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.920]   What exactly is this experience?
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.900]   What's happening to us and in us?
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.480]   Is this "Abba, Father" cry my own cry?
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.240]   Is it the Holy Spirit crying in and through me?
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.640]   Explain all this, and then does this text apply to struggling believers?
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.840]   Does this cry "Abba, Father" apply to Christians when they're struggling?
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.000]   How so if it does?
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.720]   Explain all of this for us on the podcast today, if you would.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:39.320]   What I have found, Tony, over the years is that being a Christian hedonist, that is,
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:47.360]   being a person who believes that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:55.720]   in him, what this has done to me is make me hungry for experiential theology.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:05.640]   In other words, I have a discontent with theology that floats in the air above my life with
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.500]   no connection to my living now or living forever.
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:20.440]   So I am on high alert when I read the Bible for statements that are intensely theological
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.600]   and intensely experiential.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:32.920]   And one of those texts that took hold of me months ago is Galatians 4, 4-6.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.000]   So let me read the text and break it into four parts, and then I'll address some of
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.080]   those things you asked.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:48.560]   The first part, "When the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.560]   woman, born under the law."
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.680]   Stop.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.120]   So there's the incarnation, and the life of Jesus lived perfectly under the law in
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.240]   fulfillment of the law.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.640]   And then the text goes on, part two.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.200]   He came to redeem those who were under the law.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.260]   Stop.
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:19.320]   So when Jesus died, a redemption price was paid to set free slaves of sin and death,
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.440]   slaves of law-keeping.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:29.920]   A kind of legal transaction happened by which the Father satisfied all the demands of his
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.360]   own justice and purchased for himself a people.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.840]   Third, the text goes on.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.960]   So he redeemed those who were under the law so that we might receive adoption as sons.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.960]   Stop.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:56.560]   Now, the effect of that legal redemption, that price that was paid, was that God now
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.160]   legally possesses a people for himself.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.300]   He bought them.
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.480]   They are legally his, his children.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.900]   He's adopted them, paid the necessary price for them.
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.240]   They are sons of God.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.560]   Now, last part, verse six.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:20.400]   And because you are sons, so the legal transaction has taken place at the cross, because you
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:33.720]   are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, "Abba, Father."
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:42.600]   Now, this is where that magnificent, glorious theology in the first three parts of those
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.840]   verses becomes intensely experiential.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.640]   Up till now, we have incarnation, we have redemption, we have legal transactions on
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.440]   the cross securing our adoption.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.520]   All of that is historical outside of us.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.440]   That's not inside of us.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.320]   This is different.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:12.600]   Now he says, our hearts are in view, our hearts, the place of spiritual experience, the experience
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.960]   of perceptions and experience of affections.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.900]   Because we are legally sons, God gives us the experience of sons.
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:36.520]   The Spirit of the Son of God is sent into our hearts, and he cries in our hearts, "Abba,
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.200]   Father."
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:48.280]   Now, that should shake everybody up and make every Christian say, "Oh, okay, have I experienced
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.280]   that?
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.280]   Am I real?"
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.600]   Now, Paul had already said just a few verses earlier, chapter 3, verse 26, that we are
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.940]   sons of God through faith.
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:06.080]   So there are at least three ways that we can talk about becoming sons of God.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.700]   One, Ephesians 1.5 says we're predestined before the foundation of the world for adoption
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:13.700]   as sons.
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:21.800]   Number two, Galatians 4.5, we just read it, says we are redeemed so that we might become
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.800]   sons.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:29.520]   And third, now Galatians 3.26 says we are sons of God through faith.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.860]   Predestination is not an experience in the heart.
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.400]   Redemption is not an experience in the heart.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.200]   It's on the cross.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.940]   But faith is an experience in the heart.
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:49.400]   And that's what Paul is describing when he says that God sent the Spirit of his Son into
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.440]   our hearts, crying, "Abba, Father."
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.440]   So let's think.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.980]   Let's think about this experience for just a moment.
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.900]   Every Christian has experienced this.
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.660]   And if that shakes you up and you say, "I can't remember when I got the Spirit crying,
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.660]   'Abba, Father.'"
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.760]   Well, just listen carefully.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.080]   Every Christian has experienced this, at least in some measure.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:22.640]   Some of us have been so badly taught, so badly taught or not taught at all, that we experienced
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.900]   this.
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:24.900]   We really did.
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.760]   And we had no idea what was happening to us.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.320]   No one ever explained it to us.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:39.040]   Oh, how keenly interested we should be in understanding what has happened to us to make
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:46.760]   us Christians and how we should understand our experiences as Christians.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:53.720]   Paul is not saying that God sent the Spirit of his Son into a few special Christians,
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.720]   crying, "Abba, Father," like pastors.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:03.080]   That's what he does to all the redeemed sons of God.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.420]   So what is it like?
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:11.600]   What is this experience of the Spirit of the Son of God crying in our hearts, "Abba, Father"?
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:18.960]   So to answer that question, let's bring in the really close parallel from Romans 8, 15
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.360]   and 16, which goes like this.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.160]   You did not receive the Spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:35.840]   the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, "Abba, Father," the Spirit himself
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.040]   bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:50.720]   So in Galatians 4, 5, Paul says the Spirit is poured into our hearts, he himself crying,
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.480]   "Abba, Father."
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:09:00.560]   But in Romans 8, 15, he says we have received the Spirit and we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:09.280]   So is this an experience of us crying, "Abba, Father," from our heart or the Spirit crying,
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.720]   "Abba, Father," in our heart?
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:17.640]   And then verse 16 of Romans 8, the next verse, gives us the answer.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:26.480]   The Spirit himself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:33.920]   We don't hear a voice inside of us saying, "Abba, Father, Abba, Father," as though
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.760]   we were separate from the experience, watching it happen and then deciding whether we like
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.760]   it or not.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.560]   That's not at all what's happening here.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:51.120]   This is the Spirit of the Son of God taking possession of God's child and giving voice.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:10:00.320]   He's giving voice to the child, his spirit witnessing with our spirit, a voice, our voice
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:07.600]   inside our heart, a voice of recognition, a voice of affection, a voice of joy.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.200]   It says something like this.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.200]   "I have God as my Father.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.320]   He has paid for me.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.960]   He has adopted me.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.580]   He cares for me.
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.580]   He wants me.
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.780]   He loves me.
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.080]   He protects me.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.760]   He provides for me.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.280]   He has made me an heir of all that he owns.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.600]   God is my Father."
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:35.080]   Now the word "crying," "crying, Abba, Father," doesn't mean lament.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:40.000]   I mean, in English, the word "cry" is so often connected with "weep."
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.160]   That's not the meaning here.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.560]   This is a cry of joy, unspeakable joy.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:52.000]   It's the same word used when the children back in the gospels said, "Hosanna, Hosanna
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   to the Son of David."
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.480]   They were crying that.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.600]   And that's the way we should hear the word "crying" here, not "weeping," but "crying."
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.200]   "Hosanna, Father, Abba, I can't believe I'm a child."
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.520]   That's the spirit of this cry.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:14.960]   And the word "Abba" is the Aramaic word used by Jesus himself in speaking to his Father
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.240]   in Mark 14:36.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:24.040]   When Paul chooses to use this Aramaic word taken over into Greek—it isn't a Greek
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:31.140]   word, he takes it straight over and transliterates it in Greek as "Abba"—when he does that,
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:40.320]   he makes clear that we are being drawn into the very experience of the Son of God.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:46.500]   The Son of God called his Father "Abba," Father, and that word stuck with the early
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:53.140]   church because the Holy Spirit creates the very experience of the Son of God towards
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:59.800]   his Father in our hearts so that we are sensing the same kinship with God that the Son of
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.420]   God has as our elder brother in the family.
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:12.340]   So this experience is the inner voice of the Spirit-indwelt Child of God.
[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:22.020]   It's the experience of God's Spirit causing to rise up in us a spiritual sight of God's
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:30.020]   blood-bought fatherly care and a spiritual taste of the sweetness of Christ's own love
[00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.980]   for his Father.
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:39.300]   It's the Spirit of the Son crying "Abba, Father" in and with our spirit.
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:44.440]   Now let me make one more connection that I had never seen before when I was thinking
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.780]   about this a while back.
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:55.860]   In John 7, 37, Jesus stood up and it says he cried out, "If anyone thirsts, let him
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.220]   come to me and drink.
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:06.480]   Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.340]   living water."
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:14.620]   And then he adds this, "Now this he said about the Spirit."
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:23.120]   So believing is described as the thirsty soul coming to Jesus to drink.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:30.540]   And the effect of that drinking, that believing, Jesus says in John 4, 14, is that we will
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.820]   never be thirsty again.
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:38.700]   The water will become a spring, a spring of water, ever self-replenishing.
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:48.460]   And then he says in 7, 38, John 7, 38, "No, more than a spring, a river, a river."
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.020]   And then he adds, "This is the Spirit.
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:57.580]   This is the experience of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of the Son of God, the Spirit of
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:06.500]   the risen Son of God, the sight and the taste of God becoming our all-satisfying Father
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.180]   through Christ."
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:14.580]   So you ask, Tony, how this applies to a struggling believer.
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.700]   So may I put it like this?
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:23.300]   When Jesus was trying to help his disciples experience the loving provision of God as
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:29.740]   their Father in Matthew 6, remember, where he said, "Don't be anxious about anything,"
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:34.880]   Matthew 6, 25 to 33, your Heavenly Father feeds them.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.100]   Your Heavenly Father knows that you need them all.
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:44.180]   He's trying to persuade these disciples, "If you follow me, come to me, trust me, God Almighty
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:48.800]   will be your all-providing Father."
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.900]   And then he says, "Oh, ye of little faith."
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.220]   So I take that to be the struggler.
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:04.420]   I mean, what else is struggle, except I hear John Piper talk about this, "I don't know
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:08.900]   if my faith reflects what he's just described."
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.280]   That's who I'm talking to right now.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.220]   So what did Jesus say when he said, "Oh, ye of little faith, get out of here, I'm done
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.220]   with you."
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.780]   Thank God he doesn't do that.
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:26.500]   Instead, he gave them eight reasons to trust their Heavenly Father.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.960]   He didn't throw them out.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:32.420]   He named them as little faith strugglers, and then he kept on pleading with them, "Listen
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:33.420]   to me, listen to me.
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.820]   I'm talking about the birds, I'm talking about the lilies, I'm talking."
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.780]   There are eight reasons to trust him as our Father.
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:48.020]   So I would say to all strugglers, and I'll stop with this, get to know what has happened
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.980]   to you.
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:50.980]   Get to know it.
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:51.980]   You've got to learn it from the Bible.
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.180]   You can't learn it any other way.
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:16:00.780]   We can't interpret what has happened to us if we don't read our Bibles through and through.
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:05.620]   Get a biblical understanding of how you came to faith, because you probably don't know
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.180]   how you came to faith if nobody's taught you truly.
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:14.260]   Get a biblical understanding of all those motions in your heart.
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.340]   You can't even name them.
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.340]   You can't describe them.
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:21.340]   You don't know what's going on inside of you when the Holy Spirit is stirring you up from
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:22.700]   within.
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:30.860]   God is very patient with his children as they grow up into the wonders of what their
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.460]   adoption really means.
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.620]   That is experiential theology at its finest.
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.460]   Thank you, Pastor John, for committing that to the podcast.
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:39.460]   Appreciate it.
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.460]   Glorious.
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.460]   It is.
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.460]   Amen.
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.460]   It really is.
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.460]   The more I think about it, the more precious it is.
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.460]   Amen.
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.460]   And the more I think, "Pastors, come on.
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.140]   Come on.
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:54.540]   What is this silly stuff you're doing on the weekends trying to help people make money
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:59.220]   or get along and not telling people the riches of what's happened to them?"
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:04.220]   There's an urgency in these truths, an incredible experience being explained by Paul.
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.940]   Thank you for recording this for us, Pastor John.
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:06.940]   I appreciate it.
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.780]   And thank you all for joining us today.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.020]   You can ask a question of your own.
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:16.700]   You can search our growing archive or subscribe to the podcast all at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:22.300]   Well, can we speak to angels?
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.140]   We see angels speaking to all sorts of people in the Bible.
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:31.500]   But can Christians today carry ongoing conversations with angels?
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:36.320]   One man says yes, and he claims to be having such an experience, an ongoing conversation
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.300]   with an angel right now.
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.300]   Wow.
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.940]   We're going to open our Bibles and look at the phenomena from Scripture next time.
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:47.580]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we will see you back here on Monday for that.
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.340]   Have a great weekend.
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.340]   [End]
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.620]   Thank you.
