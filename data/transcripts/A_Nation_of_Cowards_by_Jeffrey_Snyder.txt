[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.160]   published in fall of 1993 in the Public Interest, a quarterly journal of opinion published by
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.560]   National Affairs Inc. Our society has reached a pinnacle of self-expression and respect for
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.360]   individuality rare or unmatched in history. Our entire popular culture, from fashion magazines to
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.880]   the cinema, positively screams the matchless worth of the individual and glories in eccentricity,
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.280]   non-conformity, independent judgment, and self-determination. This enthusiasm is reflected
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.720]   in the prevalent notion that helping someone entails increasing that person's self-esteem,
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.920]   that if a person properly values himself, he will naturally be a happy, productive,
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:07.200]   and in some inexplicable fashion, responsible member of society. And yet, while people are
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   encouraged to revel in their individuality and incalculable self-worth, the media and the law
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.320]   enforcement establishment continually advises us that, when confronted with the threat of lethal
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.000]   violence, we should not resist, but simply give the attacker what he wants. If the crime under
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.360]   consideration is rape, there is some notable waffling on this point, and the discussion quickly
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.160]   moves to how the woman can change her behavior to minimize the risk of rape and the various ridiculous,
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.880]   non-lethal weapons she may acceptably carry, such as whistles, keys, mace, or that weapon that really
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.680]   sends shivers down a rapist's spine, the portable cellular phone. Now, how can this be? How can a
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.800]   person who values himself so highly calmly accept the indignity of a criminal assault? How can one
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.400]   who believes that the essence of his dignity lies in his self-determination passively accept the
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:09.360]   forcible deprivation of that self-determination? How can he quietly, with great dignity and poise,
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.840]   simply hand over the goods? The assumption, of course, is that there is no inconsistency.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.240]   The advice not to resist a criminal assault and simply hand over the goods is founded on the
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.880]   notion that one's life is of incalculable value and that no amount of property is worth it.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.000]   Put aside for a moment the outrageousness of the suggestion that a criminal who proffers
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.160]   lethal violence should be treated as if he has instituted a new social contract,
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.360]   I will not hurt or kill you if you give me what I want. For years, feminists have labored to
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.480]   educate people that rape is not about sex, but about domination, degradation, and control.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.960]   Evidently, someone needs to inform the law enforcement establishment and the media
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.360]   that kidnapping, robbery, carjacking, and assault are not about property.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.760]   Crime is not only a complete disavowal of the social contract, but also a commandeering of
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.120]   the victim's person and liberty. If the individual's dignity lies in the fact that he is a
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.360]   moral agent engaging in actions of his own will, in free exchange with others, then crime always
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.160]   violates the victim's dignity. It is, in fact, an act of enslavement. Your wallet, your purse,
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.680]   or your car may not be worth your life, but your dignity is, and if it is not worth fighting for,
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.920]   it cannot hardly be said to exist. The Gift of Life
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.360]   Although difficult for modern man to fathom, it was once widely believed that life was a gift
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.040]   from God, that to not defend that life when offered violence was to hold God's gift in contempt,
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.600]   to be a coward, and to breach one's duty to one's community. A sermon given in Philadelphia in 1747
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.760]   unequivocally equated the failure to defend oneself with suicide. "He that suffers his life
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.720]   to be taken from him by one that hath no authority for that purpose, when he might preserve it by
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.400]   defense, incurs the guilt of self-murder, since God hath enjoined him to seek the continuance of
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:10.800]   his life, and nature itself teaches every creature to defend itself." Cowardice and self-respect have
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.880]   largely disappeared from public discourse. In their place we are offered self-esteem as the
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.920]   bellwether of success and a proxy for dignity. Self-respect implies that one recognizes standards
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:30.160]   and judges oneself worthy by the degree to which one lives up to them. Self-esteem simply means
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.560]   that one feels good about oneself. Dignity used to refer to the self-mastery and fortitude with
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.480]   which a person conducted himself in the face of life's vicissitudes and the boorish behavior of
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.640]   others. Now, judging by campus speech codes, dignity requires that we never encounter a
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.000]   discouraging word and that others be coerced into acting respectfully, evidently on the assumption
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.560]   that we are powerless to prevent our degradation if exposed to the demeaning behavior of others.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.160]   These are signposts proclaiming the insubstantiality of our character,
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:11.200]   the hollowness of our souls. It is impossible to address the problem of rampant crime without
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.400]   talking about the moral responsibility of the intended victim. Crime is rampant because the
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:24.160]   law abiding, each of us, condone it, excuse it, permit it, submit to it. We permit and encourage
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.520]   it because we do not fight back. Immediately, then and there, where it happens. Crime is not
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.320]   rampant because we do not have enough prisons, because judges and prosecutors are too soft,
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.400]   because the police are hamstrung with absurd technicalities. The defect is there in our
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:50.560]   character. We are a nation of cowards and shirkers. Do you feel lucky? In 1991, when then Attorney
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.880]   General Richard Thornburrow released the FBI's annual crime statistics, he noted that it is now
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.280]   more likely that a person will be the victim of a violent crime than that he will be in an auto
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.040]   accident. Despite this, most people readily believe that the existence of the police relieves them of
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.920]   the responsibility to take full measures to protect themselves. The police, however, are not
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:18.160]   personal bodyguards. Rather, they act as a general deterrent to crime, both by their presence and by
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.680]   apprehending criminals after the fact. As numerous courts have held, they have no legal obligation
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.400]   to protect anyone in particular. You cannot sue them for failing to prevent you from being the
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.720]   victim of a crime. Insofar as the police deter by their presence, they are very, very good.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:41.520]   Criminals take great pains not to commit a crime in front of them. Unfortunately, the corollary is
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:47.920]   that you can pretty much bet your life—and you are—that they won't be there at the moment you
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:54.240]   actually need them. Should you ever be the victim of an assault, a robbery, or a rape, you will find
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.960]   it very difficult to call the police while the act is in progress, even if you are carrying a
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:04.160]   portable cellular phone. Nevertheless, you might be interested to know how long it takes for them
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.480]   to show up. Department of Justice statistics for 1991 show that, for all crimes of violence,
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:17.040]   only 28% of calls are responded to within five minutes. The idea that protection as a service
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.480]   people can call to have delivered and expect to receive in a timely fashion is often mocked by
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:28.080]   gun owners, who love to recite the challenge, "Call for a cop, call for an ambulance, and call
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:34.720]   for a pizza. See who shows up first." Many people deal with the problem of crime by convincing
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.880]   themselves that they live, work, and travel only in special "crime-free" zones. Invariably, they
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.240]   react with shock and hurt surprise when they discover that criminals do not play by the rules
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:52.480]   and do not respect these imaginary boundaries. If, however, you understand that crime can occur
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.920]   anywhere, at any time, and if you understand that you can be maimed or mortally wounded in mere
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.000]   seconds, you may wish to consider whether you are willing to place the responsibility for
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.960]   safeguarding your life in the hands of others. Power and Responsibility
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:13.360]   Is your life worth protecting? If so, whose responsibility is it to protect it?
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:19.920]   If you believe that it is the police's, not only are you wrong, since the courts universally rule
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:26.080]   that they have no legal obligation to do so, but you face some difficult moral quandaries.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:33.040]   How can you rightfully ask another human being to risk his life to protect yours when you will
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:39.040]   assume no responsibility yourself? Because that is his job and we pay him to do it? Because your
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:45.840]   life is of incalculable value but his is only worth the $30,000 salary we pay him? If you believe it
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.680]   reprehensible to possess the means and will to use lethal force to repel a criminal assault,
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:57.440]   how can you call upon another to do so for you? Do you believe that you are forbidden to protect
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.080]   yourself because the police are better qualified to protect you? Because they know what they are
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:08.400]   doing but you're a rank amateur? Put aside that this is equivalent to believing that only concert
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:14.400]   pianists may play the piano and only professional athletes may play sports. What exactly are these
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.280]   special qualities possessed only by the police and beyond the rest of us mere mortals?
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:26.400]   One who values his life and takes seriously his responsibilities to his family and community
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:31.920]   will possess and cultivate the means of fighting back and will retaliate when threatened with death
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:37.680]   or grievous injury to himself or a loved one. He will never be content to rely solely on others
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.320]   for his safety or to think he has done all that is possible by being aware of his surroundings
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:48.640]   and taking measures of avoidance. Let's not mince words. He will be armed, will be trained in the
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:55.200]   use of his weapon, and will defend himself when faced with lethal violence. Fortunately, there is
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.200]   a weapon for preserving life and liberty that can be wielded effectively by almost anyone.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:06.240]   The handgun. Small and light enough to be carried habitually, lethal but unlike the knife or sword,
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:13.280]   not demanding great skill or strength, it truly is the great equalizer. Requiring only
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.480]   hand-eye coordination and a modicum of ability to remain cool under pressure, it can be used
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:24.720]   effectively by the old and the weak, against the young and the strong, by the one against the many.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.840]   The handgun is the only weapon that would give a lone female jogger a chance of prevailing against
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:36.080]   a gang of thugs intent on rape, a teacher a chance of protecting children at recess from a madman
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:42.160]   intent on massacring them, a family of tourists waiting at a midtown subway station the means to
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:49.360]   protect themselves from a gang of teens armed with razors and knives. But since we live in a society
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:54.880]   that by and large outlaws the carrying of arms, we are brought into the fray of the great American
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:01.120]   gun war. Gun control is one of the most prominent battlegrounds in our current culture wars,
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.520]   yet it is unique in the half-heartedness with which our conservative leaders and pundits,
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.560]   our conservative elite, do battle and have conceded the moral high ground to liberal
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:17.040]   gun control proponents. It is not a topic often written about or written about with any great
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:23.360]   fervor by William F. Buckley or Patrick Buchanan. As drug czar, William Bennett advised President
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:29.600]   Bush to ban assault weapons. George Will is on record as recommending the repeal of the Second
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:35.040]   Amendment, and Jack Kemp is on record as favoring a ban on the possession of semi-automatic assault
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:41.680]   weapons. The battle for gun rights is one fought predominantly by the common man. The beliefs of
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.240]   both our liberal and conservative elites are in fact abetting the criminal rampage through our
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:54.160]   society. Selling crime prevention. By any rational measure, nearly all gun control proposals are
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.320]   hokum. The Brady Bill, for example, would not have prevented John Hinckley from obtaining a
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.200]   gun to shoot President Reagan. Hinckley purchased his weapon five months before the attack,
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.360]   and his medical records could not have served as a basis to deny his purchase of a gun,
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.560]   since medical records are not public documents filed with the police.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:16.320]   Similarly, California's waiting period and background check did not stop Patrick Purdy
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.840]   from purchasing the assault rifle and handguns he used to massacre children during recess in a
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.320]   Stockton schoolyard. The felony conviction that would have provided the basis for stopping the
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.840]   sales did not exist, because Mr. Purdy's previous weapons violations were plea bargained down from
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:37.200]   felonies to misdemeanors. In the mid-60s, there was a public service advertising campaign
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:42.160]   targeted at car owners about the prevention of car theft. The purpose of the ad was to
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:47.920]   urge car owners not to leave their keys in their cars. The message was, "Don't help a good boy go
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:54.800]   bad." The implication was that, by leaving his keys in his car, the normal, law-abiding car owner
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:00.480]   was contributing to the delinquency of minors who, if they just weren't tempted beyond their limits,
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:06.800]   would be good. Now, in those days, people still had a fair sense of just who was responsible for
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:12.160]   whose behavior. The ad succeeded in enraging a goodly portion of the populace and was soon dropped.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:19.840]   Nearly all of the gun control measures offered by Handgun Control Inc. (HCI) and its ilk embody the
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:25.120]   same philosophy. They are founded on the belief that America's law-abiding gun owners are the
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.720]   source of the problem. With their unholy desire for firearms, they are creating a society awash
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:37.840]   in a sea of guns, thereby helping good boys go bad and helping bad boys be badder. This laying
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:43.840]   of moral blame for violent crime at the feet of the law-abiding, and the implicit absolution of
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:51.440]   violent criminals for their misdeeds, naturally infuriates honest gun owners. The files of HCI
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.920]   and other gun control organizations are filled with proposals to limit the availability of
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:01.760]   semi-automatic and other firearms to law-abiding citizens, and barren of proposals for apprehending
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:08.720]   and punishing violent criminals. It is ludicrous to expect that the proposals of HCI or any gun
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:14.160]   control laws will significantly curb crime. According to Department of Justice and Bureau
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:20.480]   of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) statistics, fully 90% of violent crimes are committed without
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:25.280]   a handgun, and 93% of the guns obtained by violent criminals are not obtained through
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:30.080]   the lawful purchase and sale transactions that are the object of most gun control legislation.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:36.000]   Furthermore, the number of violent criminals is minute in comparison to the number of firearms
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.520]   in America, estimated by the ATF at about 200 million, approximately one-third of which are
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.880]   handguns. With so abundant a supply, there will always be enough guns available for those who
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:52.080]   wish to use them for nefarious ends, no matter how complete the legal prohibitions against them,
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:57.440]   or how draconian the punishment for their acquisition or use. No, the gun control
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:02.320]   proposals of HCI and other organizations are not seriously intended as crime control.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:07.600]   Something else is at work here. The Tyranny of the Elite
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:17.600]   Gun control is a moral crusade against a benighted, barbaric citizenry. This is demonstrated not only
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.320]   by the ineffectualness of gun control in preventing crime, and by the fact that it focuses on
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:27.360]   restricting the behavior of the law-abiding rather than apprehending and punishing the guilty, but
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:34.080]   also by the execration that gun control proponents heap on gun owners and their evil instrumentality,
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:41.520]   the NRA. Gun owners are routinely portrayed as uneducated, paranoid rednecks fascinated by and
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:47.520]   prone to violence, i.e. exactly the type of person who opposes the liberal agenda and whose moral
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:54.800]   and social "re-education" is the object of liberal social policies. Typical of such "bigotry" is New
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:16:00.240]   York Governor Mario Cuomo's famous characterization of gun owners as "hunters who drink beer,
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:06.960]   don't vote, and lie to their wives about where they were all weekend." Similar vituperation is
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:13.440]   reigned upon the NRA, characterized by Senator Edward Kennedy as the "pusher's best friend,"
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:20.320]   lampooned in political cartoons as standing for the right of children to carry firearms to school,
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:25.280]   and in general, portrayed as standing for an individual's God-given right to blow people
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:33.120]   away at will. The stereotype is, of course, false. As criminologist and constitutional lawyer Don B.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:39.200]   Cates Jr. and former HCI contributor Dr. Patricia Harris have pointed out, "Studies consistently
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:44.800]   show that, on the average, gun owners are better educated and have more prestigious jobs than
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:50.560]   non-owners. Later studies show that gun owners are less likely than non-owners to approve of
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:57.520]   police brutality, violence against dissenters, etc." Conservatives must understand that the
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:03.360]   antipathy many liberals have for gun owners arises in good measure from their statist utopianism.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:09.520]   This habit of mind has nowhere been better explored than in the Republic. There, Plato
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:16.080]   argues that the perfectly just society is one in which an unarmed people exhibit virtue by minding
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:20.240]   their own business and the performance of their assigned functions, while the government of
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:26.000]   philosopher-kings, above the law and protected by armed guardians, unquestioning in their loyalty
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.320]   to the state, engineers, implements, and fine-tunes the creation of that society, aided
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:38.400]   and abetted by myths that both hide and justify their totalitarian manipulation.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:47.840]   The Unarmed Life When columnist Carl Rowan preaches gun control and uses a gun to defend his
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:53.680]   home, when Maryland Governor William Donald Schaefer seeks legislation year after year to ban
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:59.840]   semi-automatic assault weapons whose only purpose, we are told, is to kill people, while he is at
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:05.840]   the same time escorted by state police armed with large-capacity 9mm semi-automatic pistols,
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:12.240]   it is not simple hypocrisy. It is the workings of that habit of mind possessed by all superior
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:18.480]   beings, who have taken upon themselves the terrible burden of "civilizing the masses,"
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:24.720]   and who understand, like our Congress, that laws are for other people. The liberal elite know that
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:30.880]   they are philosopher-kings. They know that the people simply cannot be trusted, and that they
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:37.760]   are incapable of just and fair self-government, that left to their own devices their society will
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:44.720]   be racist, sexist, homophobic, and inequitable. And the liberal elite know how to fix things.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:50.400]   They are going to help us live the good and just life, even if they have to lie to us and
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.080]   force us to do it. And they detest those who stand in their way.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:02.080]   The private ownership of firearms is a rebuke to this utopian zeal. To own firearms is to affirm
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:08.640]   that freedom and liberty are not gifts from the state. It is to reserve final judgment about
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:13.520]   whether the state is encroaching on freedom and liberty, to stand ready to defend that freedom
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:18.560]   with more than mere words, and to stand outside the state's totalitarian reach.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:25.280]   The Florida Experience The elitist distrust of the people
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:30.880]   underlying the gun control movement is illustrated beautifully in HCI's campaign against a new
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:36.880]   concealed carry law in Florida. Prior to 1987, the Florida law permitting the issuance of concealed
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:42.080]   carry permits was administered at the county level. The law was vague, and as a result was
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:47.200]   subject to conflicting interpretation and political manipulation. Permits were issued
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.880]   principally to security personnel and the "privileged few" with political connections.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:59.120]   Permits were valid only within the county of issuance. In 1987, however, Florida enacted a
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:04.640]   uniform concealed carry law, which mandates that county authorities issue a permit to anyone
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:10.880]   who satisfies certain objective criteria. The law requires that a permit be issued to any applicant
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:16.960]   who is a resident, at least 21 years of age, has no criminal record, no record of alcohol or drug
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:22.160]   abuse, no history of mental illness, and provides evidence of having satisfactorily completed a
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:27.920]   firearm safety course offered by the NRA or other competent instructor. The applicant must provide
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:33.920]   a set of fingerprints, after which the authorities make a background check. The permit must be issued
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:39.280]   or denied within 90 days, is valid throughout the state, and must be renewed every three years,
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:43.360]   which provides authorities a regular means of reevaluating whether the permit holder still
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:49.680]   qualifies. Passage of this legislation was vehemently opposed by HCI and the media. The
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.920]   law, they said, would lead to citizens shooting each other over everyday disputes involving
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:59.360]   fender-benders, impolite behavior, and other slights to their dignity. Terms like "Florida,
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:05.360]   the gun-shy state" and "Dodge City East" were coined to suggest that the state and those seeking
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:11.200]   passage of the law were encouraging individuals to act as judge, jury, and executioner in a
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:18.320]   death-wish society. No HCI campaign more clearly demonstrates the elitist beliefs underlying the
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:23.520]   campaign to eradicate gun ownership. Given the qualifications required of permit holders,
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:29.680]   HCI and the media can only believe that common, law-abiding citizens are seething cauldrons of
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:36.240]   homicidal rage, ready to kill to avenge any slight to their dignity, eager to seek out and
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:42.080]   summarily execute the lawless. Only lack of immediate access to a gun restrains them and
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:48.560]   prevents the blood from flowing in the streets. They are so mentally and morally deficient that
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:54.160]   they would mistake a permit to carry a weapon in self-defense as a state-sanctioned license to kill
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:22:02.400]   at will. Did the dire predictions come true? Despite the fact that Miami and Dade County have
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:07.920]   severe problems with the drug trade, the homicide rate fell in Florida following enactment of this
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:15.280]   law, as it did in Oregon following enactment of similar legislation there. There are, in addition,
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:20.160]   several documented cases of new permit holders successfully using their weapons to defend
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.800]   themselves. Information from the Florida Department of State shows that, from the beginning of the
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:35.760]   program in 1987 through June 1993, 160,823 permits have been issued, and only 530, or about 0.33%
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:40.880]   of the applicants, have been denied a permit for failure to satisfy the criteria, indicating that
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:47.920]   the law is benefiting those whom it was intended to benefit. The law abiding. Only 16 permits,
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:55.840]   less than 1/100th of 1%, have been revoked due to the post-issuance commission of a crime
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:03.920]   involving a firearm. The Florida legislation has been used as a model for legislation adopted by
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:09.760]   Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Mississippi. There are, in addition, seven other states—Maine,
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.000]   North and South Dakota, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, and, with the exception of cities with
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.720]   a population in excess of 1 million, Pennsylvania—which provide that concealed carry permits
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:23.200]   must be issued to law abiding citizens who satisfy various objective criteria.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:29.680]   Finally, no permit is required at all in Vermont. Altogether, then, there are 13 states in which
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:35.440]   law abiding citizens who wish to carry arms to defend themselves may do so. While no one appears
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:40.160]   to have compiled the statistics from all of these jurisdictions, there is certainly an ample
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:45.280]   database for those seeking the truth about the trustworthiness of law abiding citizens who carry
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:53.040]   firearms. Other evidence also suggests that armed citizens are very responsible in using guns to
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:58.320]   defend themselves. Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck, using surveys and other
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.720]   data, has determined that armed citizens defend their lives or property with firearms against
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:08.640]   criminals approximately 1 million times a year. In 98% of these instances, the citizen merely
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:13.920]   brandishes the weapon or fires a warning shot. Only in 2% of the cases do citizens actually
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:18.800]   shoot their assailants. In defending themselves with their firearms, armed citizens kill 2,000
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:24.320]   to 3,000 criminals each year, three times the number killed by the police. A nationwide study
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:29.760]   by Cates, the constitutional lawyer and criminologist, found that only 2% of civilian
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:35.440]   shootings involved an innocent person mistakenly identified as a criminal. The error rate for the
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:41.760]   police, however, was 11%, over five times as high. It is simply not possible to square the numbers
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:46.720]   above and the experience of Florida with the notions that honest, law abiding gun owners are
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:52.640]   borderline psychopaths itching for an excuse to shoot someone, vigilantes eager to seek out and
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:59.600]   summarily execute the lawless, or incompetent fools incapable of determining when it is proper to use
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:05.280]   lethal force in defense of their lives. Nor, upon reflection, should these results seem surprising.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:12.640]   Rape, robbery, and attempted murder are not typically actions rife with ambiguity or subtlety,
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:18.560]   requiring special powers of observation and great book learning to discern. When a man pulls a knife
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:23.440]   on a woman and says, "You're coming with me," her judgment that a crime is being committed is not
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:28.240]   likely to be in error. There is little chance that she is going to shoot the wrong person.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:34.000]   It is the police, because they are rarely at the scene of the crime when it occurs, who are more
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.040]   likely to find themselves in circumstances where guilt and innocence are not so clear cut,
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.440]   and in which the probability for mistakes is higher.
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.680]   Arms and Liberty
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:49.440]   Classical Republican philosophy has long recognized the critical relationship between
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:54.240]   personal liberty and the possession of arms by a people ready and willing to use them.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:26:01.600]   Political theorists as dissimilar as Niccolo Machiavelli, Sir Thomas More, James Harrington,
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:07.520]   Algernon Sidney, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau all share the view that the possession
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:13.600]   of arms is vital for resisting tyranny, and that to be disarmed by one's government is tantamount
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:19.360]   to being enslaved by it. The possession of arms by the people is the ultimate warrant
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:26.000]   that government governs only with the consent of the governed. As Cates has shown, the Second
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.120]   Amendment is as much a product of this political philosophy as it is of the American experience in
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:37.440]   the Revolutionary War. Yet our conservative elite has abandoned this aspect of Republican theory.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:43.760]   Although our conservative pundits recognize and embrace gun owners as allies in other arenas,
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:49.760]   their battle for gun rights is desultory. The problem here is not a statist utopianism,
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.920]   although goodness knows that liberals are not alone in the confidence they have in the state's
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:59.840]   ability to solve society's problems. Rather, the problem seems to lie in certain cultural traits
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:05.680]   shared by our conservative and liberal elites. One such trait is an abounding faith in the power
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:10.320]   of the word. The failure of our conservative elite to defend the Second Amendment stems,
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:14.800]   in great measure, from an overestimation of the power of the rights set forth in the First
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:20.960]   Amendment and a general undervaluation of action. Implicit in calls for the repeal of the Second
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.560]   Amendment is the assumption that our First Amendment rights are sufficient to preserve
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:30.640]   our liberty. The belief is that liberty can be preserved as long as men freely speak their minds,
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:35.520]   that there is no tyranny or abuse that can survive being exposed in the press,
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.480]   and that the truth need only be disclosed for the culprits to be shamed. The people will act,
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:48.000]   and the truth shall set us free. History is not kind to this belief,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.280]   tending rather to support the view of Hobbes, Machiavelli, and other Republican theorists that
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:58.720]   only people willing and able to defend themselves can preserve their liberties. While it may be
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:04.160]   tempting and comforting to believe that the existence of mass electronic communication has
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:09.520]   forever altered the balance of power between the state and its subjects, the belief has certainly
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:15.280]   not been tested by time, and what little history there is in the age of mass communication is not
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:21.280]   especially encouraging. The camera, radio, and press are mere tools, and like guns can be used
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:28.640]   for good or ill. Hitler, after all, was a masterful orator, used radio to very good effect, and is
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:34.080]   well known to have pioneered and exploited the propaganda opportunities afforded by film. And
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:38.720]   then, of course, there were the brownshirts, who knew very well how to quell dissent among
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:45.840]   intellectuals. Polite Society In addition to being enamored of the power of words,
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:50.320]   our conservative elite shares with liberals the notion that an armed society is just not
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:55.520]   civilized or progressive, that massive gun ownership is a blot on our civilization.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:01.120]   This association of personal disarmament with civilized behavior is one of the great
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:06.720]   unexamined beliefs of our time. Should you read English literature from the 16th through 19th
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:11.920]   centuries, you will discover numerous references to the fact that a gentleman, especially when out
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:16.800]   at night or traveling, armed himself with a sword or a pistol against the chance of encountering a
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:22.320]   highwayman or other such predator. This does not appear to have shocked the ladies accompanying him.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:26.640]   True, for the most part, there were no police in those days, but we have already addressed
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.800]   the notion that the presence of the police absolves people of the responsibility to look
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.720]   after their safety, and in any event, the existence of the police cannot be said to
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:41.840]   have reduced crime to negligible levels. It is by no means obvious why it is "civilized" to permit
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:47.840]   oneself to fall easy prey to criminal violence and to permit criminals to continue unobstructed
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:53.680]   in their evil ways. While it may be that a society in which crime is so rare that no one ever needs
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:59.920]   to carry a weapon is "civilized," a society that stigmatizes the carrying of weapons by the law
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:06.960]   abiding because it distrusts its citizens more than it fears rapists, robbers, and murderers
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:13.120]   certainly cannot claim this distinction. Perhaps the notion that defending oneself with lethal
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:18.880]   force is not "civilized" arises from the view that violence is always wrong, or the view that
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:24.080]   each human being is of such intrinsic worth that it is wrong to kill anyone under any circumstances.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:29.840]   The necessary implication of these propositions, however, is that life is not worth defending.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:36.000]   Far from being "civilized," the beliefs that counter-violence and killing are always wrong
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.240]   are an invitation to the spread of barbarism. Such beliefs announce loudly and clearly that
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:49.120]   those who do not respect the lives and properties of others will rule over those who do. In truth,
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:54.560]   one who believes it wrong to arm himself against criminal violence shows contempt of God's gift
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:31:00.800]   of life, or in modern parlance, does not properly value himself, does not live up to his responsibilities
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:07.120]   to his family and community, and proclaims himself mentally and morally deficient because he does
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:13.200]   not trust himself to behave responsibly. In truth, a state that deprives its law-abiding citizens of
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:19.200]   the means to effectively defend themselves is not "civilized" but barbarous, becoming an
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:25.200]   accomplice of murderers, rapists, and thugs, and revealing its totalitarian nature by its tacit
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:31.120]   admission that the disorganized, random havoc created by criminals is far less a threat than
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:35.120]   our men and women who believe themselves free and independent and act accordingly.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:41.920]   While gun control proponents and other advocates of a "kinder, gentler" society incessantly decry
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:48.080]   our "armed" society, in truth we do not live in an armed society. We live in a society in which
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:53.440]   violent criminals and agents of the state habitually carry weapons, and in which many
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:59.920]   law-abiding citizens own firearms but do not go about armed. Department of Justice statistics
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:06.000]   indicate that 87% of all violent crimes occur outside the home. Essentially, although tens
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:14.080]   of millions own firearms, we are an unarmed society. Take back the night. Clearly, the police
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:19.120]   and the courts are not providing a significant break on criminal activity. While liberals call
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:24.800]   for more poverty, education, and drug treatment programs, conservatives take a more direct tack.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:29.680]   George Will advocates a massive increase in the number of police and a shift toward
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:34.800]   community-based policing. Meanwhile, the NRA and many conservative leaders call for laws that would
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:40.000]   require violent criminals serve at least 85% of their sentences and would place repeat offenders
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.160]   permanently behind bars. Our society suffers greatly from the beliefs that only official
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:51.040]   action is legitimate and that the state is the source of our earthly salvation.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:57.360]   Both liberal and conservative prescriptions for violent crime suffer from the "not in my job"
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:02.000]   description school of thought regarding the responsibilities of the law-abiding citizen,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.400]   and from an overestimation of the ability of the state to provide society's moral moorings.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:12.560]   As long as law-abiding citizens assume no personal responsibility for combating crime,
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:18.880]   liberal and conservative programs will fail to contain it. Judging by the numerous articles
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:23.920]   about concealed carry in gun magazines, the growing number of products advertised for such purpose,
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.920]   and the increase in the number of concealed carry applications in states with mandatory
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:33.600]   issuance laws, more and more people, including growing numbers of women, are carrying firearms
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.800]   for self-defense. Since there are still many states in which the issuance of permits is
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:43.520]   discretionary, and in which law enforcement officials routinely deny applications,
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:48.240]   many people have been put to the hard choice between protecting their lives or respecting
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:53.040]   the law. Some of these people have learned the hard way, by being the victim of a crime,
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:58.560]   or by seeing a friend or loved one raped, robbed, or murdered, that violent crime can happen to
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:05.600]   anyone, anywhere, at any time, and that crime is not about sex or property, but life, liberty,
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:13.280]   and dignity. The laws proscribing concealed carry of firearms by honest, law-abiding citizens breed
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:18.320]   nothing but disrespect for the law. As the Founding Fathers knew well, a government that does
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:24.240]   not trust its honest, law-abiding, tax-paying citizens with the means of self-defense is not
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:31.200]   itself worthy of trust. Laws disarming honest citizens proclaim that the government is the
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:38.400]   master, not the servant, of the people. A federal law along the lines of the Florida Statute,
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:43.520]   overriding all contradictory state and local laws and acknowledging that the carrying of
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:49.920]   firearms by law-abiding citizens is a privilege and immunity of citizenship, is needed to correct
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:54.880]   the outrageous conduct of state and local officials operating under discretionary licensing
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:01.040]   systems. What we certainly do not need is more gun control. Those who call for the repeal of
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:05.680]   the Second Amendment so that we can really begin controlling firearms betray a serious
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:11.040]   misunderstanding of the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights does not grant rights to the people,
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:16.880]   such that its repeal would legitimately confer upon the government the powers otherwise proscribed.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:24.720]   The Bill of Rights is the list of the fundamental, inalienable rights, endowed in man by his Creator,
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:30.480]   that define what it means to be a free and independent people, the rights which must exist
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:37.280]   to ensure that government governs only with the consent of the people. At one time, this was even
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:43.600]   understood by the Supreme Court. In United States v. Cruikshank, 1876, the first case in which the
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:49.120]   Court had an opportunity to interpret the Second Amendment, it stated that the right confirmed by
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:56.080]   the Second Amendment "is not a right granted by the Constitution, neither is it in any manner
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:03.680]   dependent upon that instrument for its existence." The repeal of the Second Amendment would no more
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:09.120]   render the outlawing of firearms legitimate than the repeal of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:14.720]   Amendment would authorize the government to imprison and kill people at will. A government
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:21.920]   that abrogates any of the Bill of Rights, with or without majoritarian approval, forever acts
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:31.520]   illegitimately, becomes tyrannical, and loses the moral right to govern. This is the uncompromising
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:36.240]   understanding reflected in the warning that America's gun owners will not go gently into
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:42.720]   that good utopian night. "You can have my gun when you pry it from my cold dead hands."
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:49.520]   While liberals take this statement as evidence of the retrograde, violent nature of gun owners,
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:55.680]   we gun owners hope that liberals hold equally strong sentiments about their printing presses,
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:03.200]   word processors, and television cameras. The Republic depends upon fervent devotion
