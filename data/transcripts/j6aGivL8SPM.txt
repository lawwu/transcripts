[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.080]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue, our show where we take questions straight from the
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.080]   audience.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.920]   Askthecompoundshow@gmail.com is the email.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.880]   Duncan, last week, I laid it out in the field and I talked about my daycare expenses.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.340]   We have an international audience here for the show.
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.640]   Had some people chiming in from Germany saying I pay $100 a month, just sort of rubbing salt
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.640]   in the wounds.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.560]   Someone from Sweden said they pay $1,000 a year for child care.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.560]   That's great.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.560]   Thanks everyone for sharing.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.360]   Makes me feel even worse about it.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.200]   I thought you were going to say the opposite, because I did see a couple of people say that
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.480]   they actually spent a whole lot themselves, so I thought maybe you got some consolation.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.360]   Yeah, but people around the globe, they sort of have a speed, I guess.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.560]   Maybe they're paying it, making up for it in taxes.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.080]   So anyway, a lot going on in the market.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.560]   I was going to do a little intro here about the correction and going on, but we have some
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.640]   questions about that, so we're going to get into it, so let's just get right into it.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.640]   Okay.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.320]   So first up, I have about $69,000 left of my original student loan of $110,000.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.280]   The interest on the loan is 2.95 and the monthly payment is approximately $750.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.960]   At that rate, I have 105 more payments.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.080]   For the past two years, I've been paying an additional $500 a month, which decreases the
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.520]   payments from 105 to 60.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.680]   I hate having debt over my head, but I know that this is not the best use of the $500
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.080]   and it could be more advantageous to invest it long term.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.640]   Even when I do basic calculations with very conservative annual returns, it seems like
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.280]   investing is the right answer.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.960]   I know you've covered this topic ad nauseum, but I'm hoping that you can piece together
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.600]   some charts or data that would give me the final push to commit.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.720]   Okay.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.200]   Let's spreadsheet this thing, okay?
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.280]   So you're paying an extra $500 a month for five years.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.280]   That would mean you're forgoing $6,000 a year of saving over that five years, 30K total,
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.280]   right?
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.000]   Because you could pay it off in five years.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.960]   Let's assume, you know, an 8% annual return in the stock market, and unfortunately that's
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.880]   not usually a realistic comparison because the stock market doesn't give you the same
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.400]   return year in and year out, right?
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.240]   Like it's not a retirement calculator.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.920]   But if it was, an extra five years of compounding, especially for a young person, that could
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.760]   be worth close to $60,000 over 10 years, $120,000 after 20 years, and $260,000 after 30 years,
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.680]   assuming an 8% annual return, right?
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.080]   So that five years of compounding is big.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.840]   I mean, simplifying things here, you don't even have to take it to the spreadsheet.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.860]   3% basically is your hurdle rate, right?
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.760]   Can you earn higher rates of return in the financial markets than 3%?
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.760]   I hope so.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.200]   If you can't, that's not great.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.360]   But it's not the case over every five-year period that you're going to do great.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.160]   So over the past hundred years or so, the U.S. stock market has been positive in 88%
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.380]   of all rolling five-year periods.
[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.560]   But actually, if you're going to take that $500 instead of paying down the debt and invest
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.960]   it, you probably want the market returns to be lower over that five-year period because
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.720]   that means you're buying at lower prices for longer, right?
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.720]   You're --
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.440]   It's foreshadowing for an upcoming question.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.000]   I think another way to think about this, if you're one of these people that just wants
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.280]   to pay the debt off, let's say you keep paying that extra $500 a month for your debt, pay
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.280]   it off faster.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.400]   So after that five years, you now have $1,250 a month to save, right?
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.040]   Because you have the $750, which is the original payment, and the extra $500.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.600]   And now almost four years sooner, you can start putting that money to work and saving
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.880]   and investing.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.680]   I guess having said all this, like, maybe you don't want the spreadsheet answer.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.680]   Maybe you just want to pay it off.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.680]   And guess what?
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.680]   That's fine, too, right?
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.680]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.340]   So I think the calculus is pretty easy.
[00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.060]   Can you earn high returns, and can you allow your money to compound faster?
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.660]   So I had some student loans.
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.400]   I think my interest -- I had some deal where if I paid them off a certain amount of months
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.300]   in a row, like 15 months in a row when I started, it got lowered.
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.540]   So I think my final rate was like 2.25%.
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.460]   Michael would say that's like two and a quarter.
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.460]   Yeah.
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.460]   Two and a quarter.
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.060]   So I didn't see any need, even if I could, to pay it off earlier.
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.780]   Like, especially in an -- I think maybe in a higher inflationary environment where that
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.500]   debt is being slowly inflated away, it makes sense.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.460]   But again, some people's brains don't work that way.
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.940]   So if you want to make it easy on your brain, and you really hate that debt, but you also
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.980]   understand like I'm giving up and compounding here, and inflation is good for debt because
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.860]   it inflates my payments, pay an extra 250 a month and then invest the other 250.
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.660]   Like, split it in two, right?
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.980]   Because there's no right or wrong reason here, or right or wrong answer here, right?
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.620]   It's just -- it's kind of what you want it to be.
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.660]   You probably -- this person knows the spreadsheet answer.
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.660]   They know what it is.
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.660]   They can't bring themselves to do it.
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.880]   I don't know.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.880]   Cut the baby in half.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.880]   Cut the baby in half.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.880]   What do you think?
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.660]   No, I mean, this is one that we get a lot of questions about, you know, all the time
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.660]   because, yeah, some people -- this person even said it's their personality, they hate
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.660]   debt.
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.180]   And so some people, you know, have that like Dave Ramsey type mentality that debt is evil
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.340]   and they have to get rid of it as soon as possible.
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.340]   And then other people are like, yeah, why would I pay it off any faster than I have
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.060]   to, you know, especially if the rate's low?
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.460]   It seems so personal to most people.
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.820]   >> I also think my relationship with debt has changed where rates got so, so low that
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.940]   I think that changed the calculus for me, and especially with inflation being higher,
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.540]   that made me rethink the repayments.
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.060]   But again, for some people, they don't care about that spreadsheet answer.
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.660]   It's just let it -- and again, if this person does pay it off four years early, they can
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.620]   immediately take that money and then start saving it then.
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.260]   So either way, this person is -- if they're paying extra, they're probably going to do
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.180]   fine either way because they're putting some extra money in.
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.980]   >> What are your thoughts on -- I know this is a hot topic right now because of how long
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.860]   the payments have been suspended for federal student loans.
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.300]   Should people be paying during this entire time, or is that silly considering they're
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.660]   not accruing interest during this time?
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.340]   Do you have any thoughts on that?
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.900]   >> The interest just kind of gets pushed to the end, right?
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.740]   It gets kind of pushed to the end, or -- I mean, I guess as a young person, you want
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.220]   to spend -- you're going to need that money more when you're young than when you're older.
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.420]   So yeah, I guess if the government is giving you a freebie here, it probably makes sense
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.500]   again, unless you really want to get rid of it.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.740]   But yeah, I see no problem with delaying it, especially if it helps you in other ways,
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.500]   especially with inflation being so high.
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.500]   >> Right.
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.500]   >> All right.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.500]   Let's do another one.
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.500]   >> Okay.
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.660]   So up next -- and that question was from Colin.
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.700]   So up next we have, as the NASDAQ has had a rough start to 2022 and high multiple names
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.140]   have been crushed, and the street view seems to be that Cathie Wood stocks are essentially
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.980]   going to keep crashing with rates and inflation being what they are, I wanted to see if there
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.720]   was a contrarian take.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.980]   If one has a five-year or 10-year horizon, would these innovation technology plays not
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.940]   be the perfect companies to have in a portfolio?
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.620]   Should one not be slowly buying into these names as the prices keep dropping?
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.980]   >> All right.
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.620]   Let's put a little meat on the bones here.
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.660]   The NASDAQ composite is down like 20%, bear market basically.
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.140]   But there's more than 4,700 stocks in this exchange.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.620]   Over 60% of them are down 20% or more.
[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.060]   More than 40% of them are down 40% or more.
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.140]   And almost a third of them are down 60% or worse.
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.020]   Like there is some serious carnage out there.
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.540]   There is someone who I've looked at before and does a lot of writing on this topic that
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.220]   talks about a lot of these innovation names.
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.660]   So we're going to bring in a new guest here, Brian Faraldi from The Motley Fool, a new
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:28.660]   author.
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.660]   We're going to talk about his book in a little bit.
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.740]   Brian, I've seen you write about a lot of these companies, Tesla and Shopify and some
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.260]   of these other more innovative companies.
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.740]   What do you think about the question here that our person is at least trying to have
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.920]   a long-term time horizon and not think I'm going to make all my money back in three months?
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:50.060]   A lot of these stocks, really well-known name brand stocks are down 60%, 70%, 80%.
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.140]   What are your thoughts here about like picking through the rubble?
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.620]   >> Yeah, it's been trying times to say the least.
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.980]   I mean, if you rewind the clock to 2020, it was like Cathie Wood could do no wrong and
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:05.500]   over the last 18 months, it feels like she can do no right.
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.860]   And in truth, I like this question.
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.660]   The questioner is saying, shouldn't we be digging through these companies, digging through
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.660]   this carnage?
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.140]   And if you have a long-term time horizon, wouldn't now be a good time to start easing
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.140]   into these companies?
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.260]   I can tell you that's what I've personally been doing with my capital.
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:26.900]   And if you're going to buy individual stocks or especially high-growth ones like the one
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:32.900]   the questioner is talking about here, you really need to have a multi-year time horizon
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.260]   in mind with each of these stocks.
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:40.260]   If you look back at any of like the best performing stocks over any long period of time, 10 years,
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:46.020]   20 years, 30 years, you get companies like Apple, like Amazon, like Netflix, et cetera.
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:50.020]   And without exception, every single one of them has gone through periods like this where
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.620]   they just fall hugely peak to trough.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.620]   And this actually happens on a regular basis.
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.540]   The tricky part about that is so do all the worst stocks over that long period of time.
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.140]   They also fall peak to trough huge.
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:08.340]   And it's really tricky in real time to figure out, well, is this just a temporary downturn
[00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:12.020]   or is something more long-term impaired?
[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:16.380]   How do you think about the psychology between you own a stock that's down 50% or 60%?
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.100]   You've held it because you're a buy and hold investor and you have to think, I'm either
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.620]   going to put more money in or I'm going to cut bait and put my money somewhere else versus
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.620]   buying a new stock where you see it's down 80% and you go, I'm going to take a flyer
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:27.620]   on this one.
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.540]   How does the psychology of holding it change?
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.420]   Because at that stage, a lot of people have this mentality of I'm going to wait until
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.420]   it breaks even or I can't let go now because I'm selling, well, it's down.
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.820]   How do you think about that calculus?
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.380]   Yeah, that's a really hard question to answer.
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.900]   And every company is unique in that respect.
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.220]   Personally, what I always try and do is I always go back to the most recent earnings
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.460]   report, the most recent conference call, and what I'm trying to ask myself here is, is
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.320]   this a broken stock?
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.540]   Is valuation the problem?
[00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.780]   Is sentiment the problem?
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.340]   Or is this a broken business?
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:05.020]   Is there something fundamentally wrong with the business or my assumptions about the company
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.860]   moving forward?
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:12.180]   That chart you just showed is great because if you look at companies like, say, Shopify
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.060]   and Zoom, those businesses are still growing.
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.220]   They're still growing quite nicely.
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.700]   Teladoc is too.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.940]   I think Netflix is a bit of a different scenario because they reported a year-over-year decline
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:23.940]   in number of subscribers.
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:28.020]   And the real hard question you have to ask yourself right now is, is that a temporary
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.020]   thing?
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.180]   Is that something that they can work through?
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.100]   Or have they reached peak subscribers?
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:37.820]   And is the growth here going to be low single digits moving forward or even potentially
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.900]   negative given the ability to switch back and forth between these things?
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.100]   This is why investing is hard.
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.100]   Lewis: Yeah.
[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.740]   You talked about doing some homework on these companies, too.
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:49.860]   I think the hard part for a lot of people is, what is the right multiple for a growth
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:50.860]   stock?
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:55.020]   Because some of these companies are still growing, but their multiples were so high
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.140]   that they couldn't possibly live up to the expectations.
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.740]   So how do you think through the fundamentals on one hand, but the expectations on the other
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.020]   hand, which rarely are in line with one another?
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.020]   Feroldi: Yeah.
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.020]   And you just said it.
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:09.060]   I mean, there's no doubt that these companies were trading at very high multiples in 2020,
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.640]   and those multiples have been compressed.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:15.520]   But even still today on some of these stocks, you still can't call them classically cheap.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:21.720]   Like even Shopify, which is down 60-something percent, it still trades at a very high multiple
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.760]   to profits and free cash flow.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.200]   So these are absolutely the kind of questions you need to think through as an investor.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.240]   And personally, when I'm investing in companies like this, not only am I trying to buy spaced
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:38.500]   out over different time periods, I'm also trying to invest during different cycles of
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.500]   the market.
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.440]   High growth stocks were in vogue 18 months ago.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.960]   Now nobody wants to own them.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:48.600]   And the question here is worried that there could be further big drops ahead.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.460]   That's entirely in the realm of possibility.
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.560]   But I think if you're going to own some of these companies, companies like this with
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.640]   a multi-year time horizon, you have to just stay focused on the business and just know
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:04.360]   that you're going to pay high valuation sometimes, low valuation sometimes, and that long term
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.040]   the business results are going to drive returns.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.040]   All right.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.040]   Okay.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.140]   Let's do another one about another company that's getting smoked lately.
[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.420]   Okay.
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:17.380]   So up next we have, "I started investing in Square in 2019 when shares were about $65 a
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.380]   share.
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.980]   During the Corona crash, I was able to scoop shares around $40, which brought my cost basis
[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:22.980]   way down.
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.660]   I continued to buy the entire way up, and with the recent pullback, I'm now pretty much
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.500]   even, even though the stock has done well on the chart."
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.220]   By the way, I'm not exactly sure when this question came in, so it might have been a
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.220]   while.
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.300]   "How do you accumulate gains while dollar cost averaging?
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.840]   And how do you measure performance?
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.540]   Money-weighted return or actual return?
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:45.140]   Let's also assume one's pay is going up each year, so as you average in, you're making
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.140]   larger purchases.
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:50.740]   If the market goes up more than it goes down, aren't we buying more shares when they're
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.740]   most expensive?"
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:52.740]   All right.
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.220]   Let's put the chart of Square on here.
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.740]   By the way, I'm sick of all these tech companies changing their name.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.060]   I went to look for this today on YCharts, and it's called Blocknow.
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.460]   Jack Dorsey said he's the blackhead.
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.820]   Stop changing your names, people.
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:04.820]   Keep it the same.
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.820]   It's too hard to understand.
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:06.820]   All right.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.300]   Anyway, Square is down, or Block, whatever it's called, well over 60%.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.140]   This person says they've been dollar cost averaging in.
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.700]   Now, if you're a long-term holder, that's technically what you want.
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:15.960]   This is the Warren Buffett school, right?
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.060]   If a stock is getting crushed, you want to be buying when it's lower because everything
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.980]   is on sale.
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.820]   And this is also an interesting question from the idea of, does dollar cost averaging into
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.460]   individual stocks actually make sense?
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:30.340]   Because if we're talking about an index fund or an ETF, you can be pretty sure it's not
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.580]   going to go to zero or go away, right?
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:37.060]   And so buying when it's going lower makes a lot of sense because you can be pretty sure
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.360]   that it's probably going to be doing much better in the years ahead.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.100]   The same is not true of individual stocks.
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.220]   You talk about all those worst-case stocks where we have some survivorship bias.
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.660]   They don't always come back.
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:50.620]   So what do you think about doing some sort of dollar cost averaging into an individual
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.900]   stock to start a position?
[00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.620]   And at what point do you get too worried to say, all right, I think I've made a terrible
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.620]   mistake here?
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.620]   Yeah, that is, again, a really hard question.
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.580]   And I think you just brought up an excellent point.
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:08.060]   Dollar cost averaging into the S&P 500, the Nasdaq, even the Dow, that makes a whole lot
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.980]   of sense because over the long periods of time, those indices will go up because you're
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:16.580]   buying huge swaths of the economy, a huge number of growing profitable companies.
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:21.100]   And while some of them will certainly fail, on the whole, you can be pretty sure that
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.900]   over long periods of time, the market will go up.
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.140]   Individual stock investing is an entirely different category.
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:31.940]   And to his point, he seemed to be getting in in 2019 at some pretty good prices.
[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.380]   He added on the way down.
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.980]   And then he was also adding at the highs last year.
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:43.280]   I think Square was up to like $289, was like the peak price, now down to $100.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.740]   So net-net, his total position is about even.
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.340]   And that's what you need to look at.
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:52.180]   When I'm buying an individual company, I care about the total amount invested and the total
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.980]   amount that I have.
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:57.220]   I don't care that some of my purchases were in the green and some of them were in the
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.220]   red.
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.800]   I want to know if the money I'm putting into this company, am I doing well over time?
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.180]   But it is worth noting that those purchases that were in the green, that's because he
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.880]   purchased them three plus years ago.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:13.040]   And you won't know if those purchases you made in 2021 are going to be in the green
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.520]   at any point until the business has a time to continue to execute.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.960]   So if he stopped adding today, the time to really judge is this company doing well or
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.280]   has it done well is in 2023, 2024, even 2025.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:30.200]   But to your point, but to your point, Ben, Square the business is far more dynamic, right?
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:35.280]   The fundamentals of Square are changing far, far faster than they are at the S&P 500.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.920]   And this is why you really have to focus on the fundamental growth drivers of the business.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:44.480]   If you're happy with how Block is performing in the long-term trajectory of the business,
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.120]   then yes, I think dollar costing averaging in can be a viable strategy.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:53.440]   However, that could turn on a dime if Block's business headed south.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.520]   So far, though, the company continues to execute, although it is worth noting that their Bitcoin,
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.800]   their involvement with Bitcoin, have made their financials pretty tricky to actually
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.440]   dig through, like their revenue is actually no longer a good number to judge the company
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.440]   by.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.440]   All right.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.440]   Brian, I refuse to call it Block.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.400]   I'm still calling it Square, just like Facebook has never met me, Google is not Alphabet.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.400]   This question brings up another point about you start earning more income over the years.
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.720]   And do you keep putting the same amount of money in something?
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.280]   I think that's actually a good time, if you start earning more, to maybe use that extra
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.840]   cash to rebalance in certain places, or potentially diversify even further if you start making
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.840]   more money.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.880]   So I think that as you change and make more money, it's obviously a good problem to have.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.520]   But that is an interesting thing to think about in terms of dollar cost averaging and
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.520]   how that changes it.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.520]   So I think we have one more that's kind of similar.
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.520]   So let's do the next question, Duncan.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.520]   Okay.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.520]   So up next.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:43.360]   Do you have any advice for someone who has a large sum of money to invest right now?
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.200]   So this makes me think back to Nick Majulie, you know, having Nick on the show.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.960]   It's interesting to think about investing a large sum right now.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.720]   Because especially when markets are going down, people panic a little easier.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.320]   And everyone thinks that there's this Murphy's Law sort of thing where anything that can
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.080]   go wrong will go wrong, especially when I'm going to do this, right?
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.760]   So if I put a big slug of money to work right now, it's going to fall further and stocks
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.920]   are going to fall another 20%, and I'm going to totally mistime it.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.520]   So this is the psychological aspect.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.400]   Even though, whatever, three out of every four years in a stock market, you're going
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.400]   to be positive, right?
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.720]   Because 75% of the time, historically, you have the probability of seeing a gain.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.400]   But people don't think that way when stocks are going down.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.600]   So how do you think about this, Brian, in terms of deploying cash right now if you have
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.600]   some?
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.600]   To your point, this is more of a psychological question than it is a mathematical question.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.680]   I mean, the math that I've always seen on questions like this is, it always makes sense
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.120]   to put all your money in right away.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.800]   But that is psychologically hard to do.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:41.720]   If you do that, and then, to your point, the stock market continues to fall another 10
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:46.120]   to 20%, of course, you're going to feel stupid for doing so.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.400]   So the way I would approach a problem like this is, personally, I wouldn't want to put
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.300]   it all in at once, even though, mathematically, I know that that's the right thing to do.
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:58.800]   So a simple solution is just to create a really simple table, a schedule for yourself, and
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.600]   to invest that money in a fixed schedule, say, over the next six months or a year or
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.680]   whatever it is.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.580]   And if you want to take that strategy to the next level, one way that you can take advantage
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.920]   of market declines is to create that schedule for yourself and then also make a simple rule,
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:19.260]   like, OK, if the market falls x percent, say, 5%, I'm going to accelerate my next monthly
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.340]   investment early, and that's going to be the new starting date.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.680]   And you could keep doing that again and again and again, so you're buying at lower and lower
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.680]   prices.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.640]   Or if you're lucky enough to start investing and the market just stays flat or going up,
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.800]   just stick to the schedule.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.680]   So that's one way that you can kind of take that money and put it in at better and better
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.160]   prices over time.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.920]   But I think sticking to a schedule and just thinking through how you want to invest that
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.480]   ahead of time will really pay dividends down the road.
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.520]   I agree that you have to have a plan that's almost written out and follow it to a T and
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.840]   have some if-then rules.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.140]   But the thing is, you can show people all the data you want about how putting a lump
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.520]   sum in makes more sense.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.960]   Some people would just rather have that dollar cost average.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:01.920]   That would make them feel better about putting it to work just because they don't know, and
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.560]   that uncertainty really nods at people.
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:07.880]   And they can say, "The data's fine, but this is me here and this is my one time to do this."
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.920]   That kind of reminds me of on the recent The Compound Friends where Josh was talking about
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:18.760]   his DCA on steroids strategy, where he's looking at the VIX and adding more as the market goes
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.000]   down and that kind of thing, doubling his contribution.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.720]   You remember Nick and he were about to fight over it.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.720]   Sorry, Josh.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.360]   I was on Nick's side here because that's harder to do.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:34.280]   There was a value averaging strategy where you do that, where you're putting more money
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.960]   in when things are down and putting less in when things are up.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.680]   I think, to Brian's point, picking a set amount and just doing it and then letting the market
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.680]   dictate that for you.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.960]   So when stocks are going up, you're buying fewer shares.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.200]   Stocks are going down, you're buying more shares.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.200]   That's way easier to me.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.480]   I think the more complex you make this, the harder it is to stick with it.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.260]   So I think the simpler the better is usually my way to think about this.
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.840]   This reminds me of Colin's question, by the way.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:57.840]   It's like, "What do I do?
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.840]   Do I drop that?
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.840]   Do I invest now?"
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.440]   The answer is merely, this is more your personal preferences than anything else.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.840]   There's the mathematical answer and then there's the emotional answer.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.560]   Which one you choose is totally depending on you.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.280]   And the thing is, the biggest thing is you do something you can stick with.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.480]   You could pick the perfect strategy in the world and if you can't stick with it, it's
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.200]   basically going to be a failing strategy.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.200]   It's not going to work.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.400]   So you have to just pick something.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.560]   Even if it's suboptimal for a spreadsheet, if you can see it through, that's the one
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.560]   that makes sense.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.560]   All right.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.560]   Last question.
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.560]   Okay.
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.640]   This is a nice short and sweet one.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.960]   Why does the stock market go up over the long term?
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.960]   All right.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.120]   And if you could, just keep this brief.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.120]   Just explain.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.120]   Sure.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.120]   This was a plant.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.760]   So this is, Brian has a new book out, Why Does the Stock Market Go Up?
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.660]   Everything you should have been taught about investing in school but weren't.
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:47.280]   It's a great guide for beginners, intermediate people, even people like us that have been
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.520]   doing this for a while.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:53.720]   So I'm curious how you thought through this because there are a lot of people who think
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:58.240]   that the stock market is just this thing that's rigged against them by wealthy people in the
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.080]   Illuminati or they think that it's a casino.
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.520]   And so I think there's a lot of people out there who don't really try to take a step
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.520]   back and think like, "Wait.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.920]   Why does the stock market go up over time and why does it get high returns than most
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.920]   other financial assets?"
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.280]   So how did you approach this question?
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.320]   Or I asked that question on Twitter and the people on Twitter, a ton of answers I got
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.320]   was the Fed.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.680]   Like that was the only answer was the Federal Reserve means they go up.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:25.440]   And to be fair, this is a question that is actually, this perplexed me personally for
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:31.060]   years and if you look at the chart of the S&P 500 or Dow over long periods of time,
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.640]   it's as clear as day what the long-term trend is.
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.680]   It's like up and to the right.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:40.280]   But what I think is such a mystery is people that are looking at the stock market, what
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:45.040]   is the only data or the data that gets 99% of the headlines?
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.080]   Price.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.080]   Just price.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.500]   That's the only information that we have.
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:54.520]   We never see the thing behind the data that's actually driving stock price returns over
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.520]   long periods of time.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.880]   The news at 5 o'clock never says the S&P 500 paid out $100 million in dividends this quarter
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.880]   or something.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.880]   No one cares about that.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:02.880]   Exactly.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.000]   And to me, before I really understood why the market went up, I really wanted to answer
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.880]   why does an individual stock go up?
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.720]   I really think because those are the building blocks of the indices, right?
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:16.600]   So just as a simple example, I had heard for years, Starbucks, great investment, right?
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.600]   It'd been a great investment.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.280]   I was like, "Well, I don't understand why.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.340]   There's a Starbucks that I go to regularly.
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.340]   Why has it been a great investment?"
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:28.980]   But if you look back, Starbucks came public in 1992 at a split adjusted price of $0.35
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:29.980]   per share.
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.020]   Today, it's worth $76 per share.
[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.020]   Why?
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.740]   Why did the company go up so much in value?
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:42.100]   Well, in 1992, the company had 154 stores and generated $92 million in revenue.
[00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:48.980]   Last year, they had 34,000 stores and they generated $29 billion in revenue.
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:53.980]   With Starbucks, the business became far more profitable and far bigger.
[00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.820]   Stock market works exactly the same way.
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:02.060]   All of the components in the S&P 500 and in the Dow, they're working to increase their
[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.740]   revenue, increase their profits.
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:08.380]   In turn, their businesses as a group become more valuable over time.
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:13.740]   And that is a factor that drives the stock market higher over time.
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.820]   But that is something that is not obvious.
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:20.220]   That is something that I've never seen taught in schools or anything like that.
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:24.820]   So I wrote the book to just make the very basic connection between what the business
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:28.740]   community's profits does and what the stocks does and kind of give people a framework for
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.100]   thinking about why the market goes up over time.
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:35.380]   One of my favorite stats that I've found, I think over the last 100 years, the dividends
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:39.020]   paid on S&P 500 stocks has gone up like 5% a year.
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:42.940]   So that's actually cash coming out of the business, that's investor shares of profits.
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:46.320]   And you're right, people don't really think about the fundamentals of that.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:50.860]   They think, "I kind of like this brand and this celebrity person seems to like this company,
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.660]   so I'm going to invest in it."
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:56.540]   And you're right, like there are these fundamentals and obviously in the short term, those fundamentals
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.820]   of the stock market and those companies can get way out of whack with one another.
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:00.820]   We've seen that happen.
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:05.180]   2020 was an example to the upside, 2022 might be an example to the downside.
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.180]   It's never going to match.
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:10.640]   But over the long term, like it all sort of seems to work itself out and shake out in
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:16.220]   your favor where I think investing in the stock market is your way to take part in innovation
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.860]   from businesses and profits over time and the growth in that.
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:20.860]   And that's what it is.
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:27.100]   You're investing in global corporations that earn profits and are motivated to continue
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:32.540]   to grow those profits and make themselves bigger and more profitable over time.
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:37.340]   But again, that fact is hidden from view because everything is focused on just price.
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.780]   That's the only information that you get is just price.
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:43.760]   And if you're only looking at price and you have no idea it's attached to anything else,
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.980]   of course, you're going to come away and say it's rigged or it's just a big gambling machine
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.420]   because you don't understand what you're actually buying.
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:51.420]   All right.
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:53.700]   I think I've shared this before, but when my wife and I were going to get married, we
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.300]   had like a financial talk because I'm a huge nerd.
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:01.540]   And I came prepared and I told her, "Listen, 100% of our retirement savings are going into
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:02.540]   the stock market."
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.420]   And she said, "That seems crazy to me.
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:05.420]   That seems dangerous.
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.420]   Aren't we going to lose our money?"
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:12.340]   And she kind of had some of these myths perpetuated by TV shows and movies and stuff that like
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:15.920]   the stock market is a place you go to have people take advantage of you and obviously
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:16.960]   that can happen.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:22.760]   But it's also this place like that you can, that real people can play in the same marketplace
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:27.480]   as the professionals, right, and invest alongside of them and invest in these huge corporations
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.980]   and buy a piece of them.
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.480]   And that to me is like one of the most wonderful things about it.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.720]   So I really get upset when people try to scare people out of the market.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.520]   Like I think what we should be doing is getting more people involved.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.760]   And I think that's what you're trying to do with the book, right?
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.920]   Very, very much so.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:44.480]   And to your point, what are the most popular movies about investing that have ever existed?
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.800]   It's like the Wolf of Wall Street or Wall Street or Margin Call.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.800]   That is how a lot of people get their perception of the market is through movies that are just
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.760]   Wall Street preying on everyday people.
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:59.640]   So it totally makes sense why so many people have that perception.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:04.920]   I think it's also taken for granted like you're saying just what a tool this is for the average
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:10.200]   person really in the scheme of things to actually build and accrue wealth that, yeah, there
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.760]   used to be this mentality of the stock market's just for the people who already have a bunch
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.760]   of money.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:19.000]   And, you know, especially in the commission-free world now, it's like, no, it's everyone's
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.080]   like tool that everyone can use and even the little guy can.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:27.640]   And I think even the information that we have accessible to now, right, we can listen to
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.640]   conference calls.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.640]   We can get financial data.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.000]   We can get SEC filings like instantaneously.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.520]   All of that was incredibly hard just like 30 years ago.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.520]   Right.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.120]   And I think another, what's going on in the market right now, like why does the stock
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.120]   market go up?
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.120]   Because sometimes it goes down too.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.120]   Like that's part of it too.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.120]   There's risk involved.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.240]   And so you wouldn't earn higher returns if there wasn't some risk involved.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.680]   So I think that's something that people have to realize too that this year is not like
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.480]   some sort of watershed moment where the stock market is reminding people that like it's
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.480]   not that easy.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.480]   Like that's part of it.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.720]   But also the stock market has to go down so it can go up over time.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.720]   That's part of it too.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.280]   And the funny thing about that is I think if you ask somebody why does the stock market
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:06.240]   go down, that's at least intuitive, right?
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.240]   Inflation right now.
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.240]   Rates are going up.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.240]   There's a war.
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.200]   It makes sense why the market is going down, right?
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.680]   2008, people are losing their houses.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.680]   Market down.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.000]   2000, dot-com crash.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Market down.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Totally makes sense.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   Never made sense to me.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   Well, why does it come back up?
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   Why does that happen?
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.160]   That never made sense to me.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.800]   Because it's a process and not an event.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:28.640]   So again, check out Brian's new book, Why Does the Stock Market Go Up?
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.640]   Somewhere you get your books.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.640]   Anything else to plug, Brian?
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.640]   That's it.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.640]   Thank you so much.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.640]   You get the floor.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.640]   All right.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.640]   Thanks for coming on.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.640]   I have something to plug.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.640]   What's up, Duncan?
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:41.640]   Everyone should go read your piece, It's Okay to be Confused, right now.
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.640]   Okay.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.640]   Yeah, I put that on yesterday.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:44.640]   Because that's on a lot of the same kind of stuff.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.600]   I think a lot of the cross-currents in the economy and the markets are very confusing.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.160]   And I think it's okay to admit that sometimes that you just don't know what's going to happen
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.160]   and what's shaking out.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:57.760]   I do think this is one of the more interesting periods that we've had, especially since the
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:58.760]   pandemic.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.760]   There's all this stuff going on.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.760]   It's kind of fun.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:01.760]   It's scary.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.760]   It's scary right now.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.760]   Check out Brian.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.760]   Follow Brian on Twitter.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.760]   He's always got some great stuff to post.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:06.760]   Charts, thoughts, quotes.

[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.800]   Duncan looking good in the racing hat and jacket today, I've got to say.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.320]   A lot of people in chat blowing it up.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.160]   Askthecompoundshow@gmail.com if you want to ask us another question.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.880]   Our questions are overflowing right now.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:22.960]   We're going to have to do another lightning round.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.560]   But no ticker this time, Duncan.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.560]   Okay.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.560]   Okay.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:27.560]   We'll see everyone next week.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.560]   Sounds good.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.560]   Thanks, everyone.

[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:38.560]   Bye.
