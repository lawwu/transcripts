[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120]   I think what I find most enjoyable about the LSB, I particularly love the consistent translation
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.520]   of doulos, the Greek word for slave.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:18.000]   You go to Romans chapter 1 and even in the NASB 95, which I love, it translates it as
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.520]   bondservant, but that's not the word.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.640]   So the LSB has said the word is slave, let's translate it as slave.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.760]   Consequently when you read Paul saying things like, "I, Paul, a slave of Christ," we know
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.920]   what a slave is.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.880]   A slave is someone who has no rights.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.640]   And so Paul is saying, "Because my Savior has purchased me from a world of sin and death,
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.000]   I'm his."
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.600]   And I think that translation is, for me, one of the most meaningful consistencies in the
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.360]   LSB because it paints a picture of to whom I belong.
