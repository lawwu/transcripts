[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.320]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we continue our "Pathways to Financial Freedom in 10
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:45.480]   Years or Less" series with a discussion of my idea of working as an RV mechanic.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.720]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.200]   skills, insight, encouragement and inspiration that you need to live a rich and meaningful
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.360]   life now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.360]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.960]   I am your friendly financial philosopher and fellow traveler down this road of financial
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.960]   freedom.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.160]   Today, I'm going to sketch out for you a blueprint that I think you can use and adapt to your
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.640]   situation.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:22.480]   Today's episode is â€“ well, I guess we'll call it the second in a very occasional series
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.480]   that I'm calling the "Pathways to Financial Freedom in 10 Years or Less" series.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.840]   The first episode in this series was episode 476 in which I talked about pathways to financial
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.640]   freedom in 10 years or less and I used the idea of working as an expediter, expedited
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.320]   trucking and other live-on-the-job opportunities and I sketched out how you could use a career
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.400]   such as expediting as a way for you to achieve financial freedom very quickly, especially
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.280]   in that 10-year or less time frame.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.360]   This is something I say to you every day when I open the show.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.000]   I say financial freedom in 10 years or less and I want to consistently paint these pathways
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   out for you.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.320]   Now, there's nothing easy about any of these paths but they're very, very doable and today
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.080]   I'm going to share with you a new one that I think will be illustrative and instructive
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.600]   for you and that is as working as an RV mechanic.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.480]   But I want to emphasize this point.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.840]   As you listen to me go through this idea, don't listen just for the specific idea.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.040]   You may care nothing about RVs.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.400]   You may care nothing about working as a mechanic.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.200]   You may not like this specific idea at all.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.480]   But listen for the themes in the progression of this business that I'm about to describe
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.760]   for you and listen to what you have to actually do to build financial freedom.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:49.720]   Listen not just for RV mechanic but listen for how you increase income, decrease expenses,
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.200]   invest wisely and then optimize lifestyle.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.400]   We're not going to talk about avoiding catastrophe today, just optimizing lifestyle.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.520]   Recently I had somebody come over to do a little bit of work on my RV.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.360]   I have an older RV and I try to do a lot of the things on it myself but sometimes it's
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.040]   just intimidating to do things you've never done and also often you don't have all the
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.600]   tools, you don't have all the supplies.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.960]   I needed some stuff done especially I had a leak in the roof and I had it planned to
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.200]   work on it, planned to work on it, planned to work on it.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.480]   Finally I just said, "I'm obviously not getting to it.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.280]   My time has been utterly consumed with my radical personal finance projects and my family
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.960]   obligations and some of my other personal areas.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.600]   I just wasn't able to get to this in a timely manner."
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.360]   So I decided I was going to go ahead and hire the work done.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.000]   So I called a couple of local RV repair shops and the ones that I trusted, the one that
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.320]   I trusted especially, was booked out for a couple of months.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.000]   They couldn't even get me in for a couple of months and so they referred me to a local
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.120]   mobile RV mechanic.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.240]   Now the work of a mobile mechanic is something that I've thought has a huge value as I've
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.180]   looked at it in other areas.
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.920]   For example, a mobile auto mechanic I think has a lot of advantages.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.440]   There are disadvantages to working as a mobile auto mechanic.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.640]   You give up some of the niceness of having a shop but there are advantages especially
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.960]   in the decreased expenses and the more adjustable work schedule.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.280]   And of course that same thing can be applied to many other mobile businesses.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.240]   There are mobile dog groomers.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.340]   There are mobile farriers, the people who shoe horses.
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.000]   There are mobile boat mechanics and boat repair people.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.120]   There are mobile cleaning people.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.080]   It's just about any business can be taken and turned mobile.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.560]   And in this case we were talking about a mobile RV mechanic, somebody who could just work
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.880]   on the systems of my RV.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.320]   So the guy came by and of course as I always do, I tried to talk to him, hear a little
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.160]   bit about his story, hear a little bit about the industry.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.020]   And I noticed all of these themes that for me are very, very valuable.
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.480]   First and foremost, you should know that for the repair work that he did for me, he was
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.040]   charging $95 an hour, offered a flat fee the way he priced his services.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.120]   He just charged a flat fee of $95 an hour plus the cost of parts if he needs to use
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.440]   any specific parts.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.720]   $95 an hour is not a bad rate.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.360]   $95 an hour would be if you worked a 40-hour a week over the course of a full year, that
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.240]   would be a total income of about $200,000 if you could do that 40 hours a week.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.020]   Now of course I'm ignoring a few expenses, but what expenses are there?
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.640]   This guy was driving a middle-of-the-road van, just a standard cargo work van, a couple
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.960]   thousand bucks, a few thousand dollars of tools, really not that much, gas.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.000]   And most of his work was pretty simple.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.880]   He just had a cell phone that I called and coordinated with, a simple calendar book.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.400]   So his expenses were very, very low.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.320]   And as we got to talking, we started talking about the careers and he shared with me some
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.800]   things that I have noticed again and again and again every time I talk with people in
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.200]   the trades.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:02.760]   Number one, I noticed that he has a very hard time finding good work, workers, finding
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.280]   good workers, very hard time.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.000]   He talked to me about how many people he's tried and he says every time he brings a guy
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.480]   in, a younger guy, he says either number one, they just don't want to work, they want to
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.040]   hang out on their phone the whole time instead of working, or two, they don't want to continue
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.980]   doing the work because it's hard work.
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.720]   You're out in the sunshine sometimes, you're working in a hot RV, you're actually doing
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.880]   hard work and he says, typical older guy, the kids these days just want to sit around
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.880]   and play on their phones.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.880]   Guess what?
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.880]   It's true.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.740]   And I've heard that again and again and again from people in the trades.
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.680]   One of the big opportunities coming up in the coming decades is going to be for skilled
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.160]   tradespeople.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.120]   Skilled tradespeople are getting older, grayer, and they're getting out of the business.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:52.360]   And yet while many of the professional jobs are being shipped overseas, it's relatively
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.640]   easy if you are working as an accountant to have your job shipped over to a foreign country
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.900]   and you have the global population that's competing with you for your work.
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.080]   It's not so easy to ship your plumbing work overseas.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.840]   It's not so easy to ship your electrical work overseas and it's not so easy to ship your
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.200]   RV repair work overseas.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:20.720]   So he starts talking to me about how he'd like to sell his business and yet he doesn't
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.280]   have anyone who's interested and he doesn't have anyone who will do the work.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:31.160]   Now this guy came from a career in boat repairs but then he moved into RV repairs and he's
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.860]   done it for many, many years and has good skill and he's very honest.
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.480]   That was why I got the referral from the RV shop that I called, was because he said he's
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.800]   honest and that's what you're looking for when someone's going to come and work on your
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   stuff.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.020]   You're looking for somebody who's honest.
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.600]   So let me explain to you how I would pursue this career and what I would do.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.960]   And I'm going to do it for you in the context of let's pretend that I had â€“ let's pretend
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.840]   that my oldest son is â€“ we're 15 years old and I was giving him advice, something like
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.840]   that.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:06.120]   Well, if my oldest son were 15 years old at this point in time, this is the type of career
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:11.800]   that I would encourage him to pursue during his teenage years.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:17.660]   Any time from that 13, 14, 15, 16, anywhere in there where it works out conveniently,
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:25.480]   this is an ideal time for a young man to start apprenticing in a business like RV repair.
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.280]   Now again, remember, this is in some ways a metaphor.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.340]   You could do this in boat repair.
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.180]   You could do this in almost just any kind of skilled trades.
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:38.360]   But this is a good one for that age of young man to apprentice in.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:43.040]   What I would do is I would have my son do his schoolwork in the morning.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.780]   He'd do about four hours of specific class instruction from say 8 AM to noon, have a
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.780]   quick lunch and then I would have him working from 12.30 to 5.30 every day if he could,
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:57.140]   if I could arrange the details with rides and all of that with somebody like this other
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.140]   man.
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.400]   Now, with this older guy, he can go and basically where you start on these things is you start
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.100]   as a helper with very little skill.
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.260]   I did this when I was about 13 years old.
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.980]   I started working as a helper in the tile business.
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.820]   You go and you mix up the mud and you cut the tiles in that business.
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.980]   But while you're around the business, you start to pick things up quickly.
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:21.300]   Once the older â€“ what they call mechanic â€“ once the older skilled mechanic starts
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.820]   to notice that you're interested, then you can learn things very, very quickly and then
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.100]   you start to do more of the jobs yourself.
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:34.080]   So I would apprentice my 15-year-old to somebody like this older guy for a period of years
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.360]   and he would work as his helper.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:43.360]   Along the way, that 15-year-old would build the skill over the course of an apprenticeship
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.120]   over two, three years and with some side study â€“ they're actually courses in RV repair
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.760]   that somebody could take â€“ would build the skill to do the work themselves.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.840]   Now this guy that came and worked on my RV wants to sell his business but he can't
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.560]   find a buyer for it because he can't find somebody who has the skills.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.480]   Well, the business that he's selling is the customer lists.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:10.160]   Let's pretend that my son grew past 15 and now he's 17, 18 years old, has a driver's
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.240]   license, is able to get himself around, has a few years of experience and finds that the
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.760]   business is helpful and useful for him and it works with his skill sets.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.000]   He's developed the necessary skills.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.560]   He has interest in running his own business, et cetera.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.840]   Then I'd encourage him to go right to work full time in that as a business.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:31.400]   Don't waste years and years studying a specific college course at that point in time.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.000]   Go ahead and go right into the business.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Why?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.360]   Well, because a skilled RV mechanic as affirmed by the guy I spent some time digging into
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:46.520]   details with could very conceivably make a profit, a straight profit of six figures per
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:51.920]   year, one guy working out of one van.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:58.960]   If you have the choice between spending six figures to get some non-important degree that
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:06.000]   may open the door for you to get a $35,000 a year job or making six figures in a skilled
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.360]   trade, chances are you should probably go right to making money because those extra
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:16.400]   few years of productivity will make a tremendous difference.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.480]   So I would encourage my son to go ahead and start the process of buying them out, whether
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.800]   he starts his own independent business and has to build up his own customer list or buys
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.800]   out a business owner like this guy.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.860]   I didn't talk to him about what he'd want to sell the business for, so I don't know.
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.840]   But go ahead and pursue the business full time.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.480]   Now what are the benefits of a business like a mobile RV repair service?
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.240]   Well, number one, it's flexible.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.540]   It's big time flexible.
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:45.920]   So even if my son did want to go to college and then this type of work can easily be scheduled
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.000]   around a college class schedule.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.240]   I would guess the average service call in a business like mobile RV repair would be
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.320]   a few hours, a couple, three hours.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.080]   Most RV repairs are going to be relatively simple.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:04.460]   And so this type of business is a very productive, very financially profitable way for somebody
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.040]   to earn an income and you can do it on your schedule.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:11.240]   When you're going to show up at your customer's place of residence or place of business, they're
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.380]   not so concerned about exactly what time you're there.
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.280]   So if you're taking college classes and you're working this business that you've now built
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:23.620]   the skill set in and you have college classes on Tuesday mornings from eight till noon,
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.300]   you just tell your customer I can be there Tuesday at one o'clock.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.140]   Does that work for you or is Wednesday better?
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.680]   And you schedule your work around your classes.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.760]   So it gives you the opportunity to earn at a very high rate of pay because you've invested
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.420]   time into skill.
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:45.080]   Instead of pursuing some dead end bird brain minimum wage job that doesn't have opportunities
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:50.300]   for skill advancement, you're just a cog in a machine, you pursued something that you
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:54.840]   have unique skill and you can charge $95 an hour.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.700]   That's a better move.
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:02.160]   So the flexibility of the career helps in those early years.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.940]   Now what we would do if I were advising my son in this path is we would generate that
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.860]   huge amount of income through a lot of hard work.
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:15.740]   Whenever there's an opportunity to take paying clients, we take those paying clients with
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:20.760]   the goal of stashing as much cash as possible, keep living expenses low, hopefully he can
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.920]   live with family.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.500]   If not, keep living expenses low.
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.860]   Why don't you get a cheap RV and fix it up and live in it while you're fixing it up?
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.380]   And with those low expenses, you start to develop significant amounts of investment
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.180]   capital.
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.220]   Now with that investment capital, what do you do?
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:41.120]   Well, you look first close at hand to find the best investment opportunities, which probably
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:46.760]   in this scenario that I'm painting, would be opportunities in fixing up and flipping
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.580]   RVs for profit.
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:54.260]   Finding RVs that somebody doesn't want anymore and shining them up or remodeling them, whether
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:14:01.380]   that's working out in the custom shop, finding some 1955 Airstream and completely renovating
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:07.340]   it for a very nice stack of cash or fixing just some minor cosmetic damage or minor water
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:12.300]   damage or whatever the opportunities that are found on modern ones and then flipping
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.700]   those again on Craigslist.
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:19.260]   The benefit of working as an RV mechanic would be that you would come in contact with a lot
[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.660]   of RV owners and you would come in contact with a lot of RVs.
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.760]   If I were doing that job, there would be a couple of things I would do.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.980]   Number one, I would always take a few minutes to talk to an owner while I'm doing the work
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.420]   for them about if they have any interest in selling.
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:37.220]   And I would make it clear that I'm always interested in buying older RVs.
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:41.580]   I'd always leave a card, a very simple card to say, "Hey, I'm interested in buying older
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.740]   RVs if you know anybody who's selling them."
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.180]   Just by telling people that you're interested in buying older RVs, just like by telling
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.780]   people you're interested in buying older houses or just by telling people you're interested
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:56.940]   in buying older fancy watches, you'll start to get some leads on ones.
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:02.620]   And then many RV owners are frustrated because they don't really want to own their RV anymore.
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.520]   A lot of times they're either fixing it up because they want to sell it or they're fixing
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.500]   it up and it's constantly taking money out of their pocket.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:14.900]   Just like boats, RVs constantly take money out of your pocket.
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:19.460]   And so now you have the opportunity to make offers, lowball offers on RVs and see if you
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.460]   find owners that want to sell.
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.460]   The way to do it is simple.
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:26.460]   You always explain to the person you're buying something from how much you think it would
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.180]   be worth if you fixed it up.
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:33.100]   For example, if I were doing this work, I would go and I would say, "Hey, do you have
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.100]   an interest in selling?"
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.100]   "I don't know.
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.100]   What do you think it's worth?"
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.660]   "Well, if this RV were fixed up, you could probably put it on Craigslist and you might
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.900]   be able to sell it for $10,000.
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:47.020]   Do you have any interest in selling it now as is without the work done?"
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.060]   Somebody is looking down and imagining a couple thousand dollar bill and say, "Well, maybe.
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.400]   What do you got?"
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.740]   And so you make them an offer and the most simple way to do it is to say something like
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.420]   this, "Well, I'm probably not the best buyer for it.
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.380]   After all, this is kind of what I do for a living.
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:05.160]   You could probably make more money if you went ahead and shined it up and then put it
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.680]   out of the retail market.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.360]   But if you want to sell it fast, I mean, I give you five grand.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.360]   Take it right now."
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:19.120]   It's a very honest and straightforward and effective way to buy things inexpensively.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.120]   Language is simple.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.740]   Again, you'd probably get more money for it.
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:27.080]   You may be able to sell it for $10,000 on Craigslist if you can shine it up and fix
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.480]   everything and get it going.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:33.480]   But if you want to sell fast, I'd be willing to give you five grand for it.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.940]   This is what car dealers do all the time.
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.120]   When you take your car in and you trade it into a dealership, you know you could shine
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:44.840]   it up and show it to 10 people on Craigslist and have one of them maybe buy it and give
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.840]   you a bad check and then resell the thing again and you might get a little bit more
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.840]   money.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.840]   But what's the value of your time?
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.840]   That's not the business that you're in.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.600]   And every time you're trying to arrange a showing to somebody who wants to buy your
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.200]   car on Craigslist, you got to take time off from work or drive home and keep the car shined
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.240]   up and keep the battery going and you don't have a license plate for it and it goes on
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.240]   and on.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.720]   So you take it to the dealer and you know the dealer is giving you less money than you
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.560]   could in the open market but you're happy to take it because, well, I'll go ahead and
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.720]   just sell it quickly for cash.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.040]   So you put the same thing to work for you.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:20.000]   Now as an RV mechanic, you're not going to be booked 40 hours a week every single day.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   You're going to have time.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   So if you're not working with a paying customer, then you spend your time fixing up your own
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.040]   RVs and then selling them and flipping them on Craigslist and building up a good investment
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.080]   portfolio.
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:36.880]   Now continuing with the theme of the business being flexible, because you can decide your
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:42.780]   own calendar, you have the opportunity and the ability to simultaneously pursue other
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:49.440]   businesses and other lines of investment and other lines of business activity while you're
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.200]   doing this process.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.980]   Just because you're fixing up RVs doesn't mean you can't also fix up a car if you come
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:59.560]   across it or just because you're fixing RVs doesn't mean you can't also go ahead and fix
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.840]   up a rental house.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:07.560]   After all, if you were an 18-year-old young man making $100,000 a year living on 20, a
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.820]   year or two of work and savings, you could flip a bunch of RVs and all of a sudden move
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:17.520]   into a different market where you're working with cash and you're doing other projects.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.640]   If you keep your expenses low, then this flexible income is great for you because you don't
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.440]   have to work 40 hours a week.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:30.440]   You can keep your rates high and along the way, while you're keeping your rates high,
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:35.480]   you can put all of your time to good use, whether that's in your business hours or in
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.480]   your investment hours.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.840]   You still retain the benefits of the flexibility of your income.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:46.100]   Now the RV business has a few other advantages that you should also look for in whatever
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.100]   business you're pursuing.
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:52.060]   For example, when you're working with people who own RVs, most of the time you're going
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:55.680]   to be dealing with a wealthier clientele.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.560]   RVs are toys for most people and yes, many people will stretch to buy one.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:04.640]   They can't perfectly afford, but a lot of people who own an RV have significant amounts
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.640]   of money.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:10.400]   When you're working with people who are wealthier and providing a service that they want, that
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.700]   can be a good market to work in.
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:16.520]   In many ways, it's easier than dealing with say, auto repairs.
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.720]   If when you're working on lower end cars, you're going to have significant constant
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.680]   price pressure.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.480]   But an RV owner is probably more likely, yes, they want a good deal and they want fair work,
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.760]   but they want it to be done right.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.280]   So that's good in terms of the business model.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.560]   You're also working in a business that's largely unregulated.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:40.100]   Whenever possible, I always try to steer completely clear of any industry that is licensed or
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.360]   extensively regulated and I encourage other people to do that as well.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.840]   It's one of the reasons why I was so glad to get out of the financial industry because
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:51.840]   the financial industry is hamstrung by just awful constant regulations and licensing and
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.200]   it's the same in every industry that's licensed.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.280]   Whenever you get a group of people together that can force the government through the
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:03.120]   power of collective lobbying to impose some kind of licensing scheme, they're doing it
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.920]   so that they can freeze out the competition.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.920]   That's the idea.
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:12.280]   Well, freezing out the competition has the effect of making it harder for you to get
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:15.120]   in and break into that business.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:19.520]   It also has the effect of wrecking most industries.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:24.880]   So in any industry you're in, you look for the least regulated part of it and you probably
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.240]   get a better business structure.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.640]   Well, I don't know.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.640]   Maybe they are.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:39.920]   I haven't done the research, but I'm not aware of any RV mechanic cabal of licensees, which
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:46.640]   means you can set up a great business and actually compete in a free market.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.000]   Doesn't mean there are no barriers to entry.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.760]   Think about the different types of barriers to entry that you may have.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:56.200]   One barrier to entry would be skill and this is the best advantage of the RV industry.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.880]   You're dealing with skills that are not common.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.440]   Lots of people work on cars.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.520]   Lots of people develop the skills to work on cars.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.920]   Fewer now than in years past, but still a lot of people work on cars, but not many people
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.880]   work on RVs and not many RV owners.
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.920]   Many RV owners do complex repairs to their RVs.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:19.200]   So you've got good protection from other people because of the skill set and your benefit
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.320]   however is there's not a huge cost, not a lot of overhead to get into the business.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:27.920]   Now compare an RV business with something like a lawn care business.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.120]   Lawn care businesses are great.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.960]   Lots of people build them and they're very, very flexible, but you have a lot of competition
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.360]   and so you have intense pressure on prices.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.360]   Why do you have a lot of competition?
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.360]   Well, you have a lot of competition because it doesn't cost all that much to start a
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.360]   lawn care business.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:46.640]   Any 12-year-old kid with a push lawnmower can start a lawn care business and you don't
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.720]   have any protection because of skill.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.000]   Anybody who cuts their own grass would consider themselves perfectly capable of going and
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.720]   also cutting the neighbor's grass.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:22:00.480]   So if you work in an industry like lawn care or like snow shoveling or similar industries,
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:05.040]   yes, you can gain wages and income because of the work, but you don't have any protection
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.880]   from a skill or investment perspective.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.560]   So in my example of my son, if my son were in this age group, he wouldn't have a lot
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:19.120]   of money so therefore he's not going to go into an industry where there's big financial
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.300]   barriers to entry.
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:26.880]   But we do want to go where there's barriers to entry based upon skill.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.880]   That's why you can earn higher money, because of the skill.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:36.440]   Other benefits of the RV business model, very low overhead which means a very low risk.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.040]   You're dealing in largely a cash business.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.760]   There's low overhead there.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:41.760]   You don't have a huge amount.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.040]   You don't have to have a big shop.
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.360]   You don't have to have a lot of financial risk.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.360]   You don't have to go into debt.
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.280]   You just need a vehicle and some basic tools and equipment.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.280]   That's good.
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:55.160]   You also have a very movable business.
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.960]   If the RV market in Florida dries up because the economy tanks, well, guess what?
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:04.780]   The RV market in Arizona is probably still pretty good or other places.
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:08.460]   You also have diverse skills that can translate over to different things.
[00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:13.320]   Somebody who can fix up RVs is using practically the same technology as somebody who can fix
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.320]   up boats.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.300]   There's a lot of translation between that and somebody who can fix up houses.
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.520]   So there's a good diversity of skill sets and you can use these skill sets.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:28.200]   Now a few other wrinkles on the RV business that I think bear close focus with regard
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.320]   to financial freedom.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.640]   I've described here the pathway.
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.640]   Remember, I tell my 15-year-old son, "Hey, why don't you go and apprentice?"
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.760]   He goes and apprentices for two to three years, let's say from 15 to 18.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:46.160]   While he's finishing up his formal academics, he apprentices for four or five hours a day,
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:53.280]   builds the skill set and puts himself on track to buy out the business owner, buys the list,
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.520]   the customer list, the referrals, buys the phone number, et cetera.
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.560]   So he has additional sources of business, builds the necessary skills.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:04.560]   At 18 years old, he puts himself in the position just like this RV mechanic that I spoke to,
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:12.240]   to earn six figures per year profit on a very simple business that depends upon his input.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:18.360]   Let's say I'm wrong and at 18 it's 80,000, 19 it's 80,000, then at 20 it's 100,000.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:23.320]   For a moment, let's ignore personal expenses because of course I've trained my son, hopefully
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:28.480]   we'll find out in a number of years, but I've trained him to live cheap until he's wealthy
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.920]   and even then to continue living frugally on a comparative basis to his wealth and his
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.920]   income.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.160]   So let's ignore for a moment personal expenses.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:41.440]   He's living at home, minimal expenses and just saving as much as possible.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:50.380]   Will you do the math on $80,000 earned and saved for the course of seven years?
[00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.380]   Just do the math.
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:56.380]   80,000 times seven would be $560,000.
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:03.960]   Can you think of a bunch of ways for a diligent 25-year-old to build out a good way to invest
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.960]   $560,000?
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:16.480]   I could list dozens and what I would guess is the investment opportunities would grow.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:21.120]   If I were out doing that business at 18, I bet you he could buy an RV a week.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.040]   Or an RV every couple of weeks.
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.360]   Well, you flip $5,000 RVs, you can turn a lot of money pretty quickly.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:33.200]   The biggest challenge becomes when you're flipping cheap RVs and then your capital starts
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.440]   to outgrow your ability to do a certain level of business.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.000]   So you move to more expensive RVs if there are good margins there and you start to flip
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.980]   those from time to time.
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:46.280]   You have the benefit of selling something that people would really like to have.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:52.200]   Having done extensive shopping in the RV marketplace as it stands currently in 2017, the RV marketplace
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:57.200]   is hard because it's dominated by either the new market and it's very tough financially
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:03.960]   to buy a new RV because they depreciate so fast, or the used market where many of the
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.240]   units aren't very reliable and they haven't been used.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:11.480]   The problem with buying used RVs is they usually are being sold by an owner who didn't use
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.720]   it anymore and they sit.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:16.520]   And RVs sit just like boats, everything falls apart just like cars.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:20.760]   Everything falls apart and they become very dangerous to own.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:25.880]   So the best type of RV to buy from a financial perspective is one that has everything working,
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.000]   that's been worked on by a good mechanic, but that's not brand new.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.600]   It depreciates less but you have the confidence of it being functional.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.260]   So I think somebody who is skilled and used their time when they weren't working for paying
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:40.320]   clients to fix up their own RVs and flip them, I think could make a lot of money in something
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.320]   like this.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:46.520]   And again, because of the flexibility of the RV business, they could continue to work in
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:51.400]   something like fixing up old houses and starting to accumulate some rental houses.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.400]   So you do the math.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.840]   Let's say with a $500,000 investment portfolio, slowly invest it, just buy one house a year
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:02.080]   from 20 to 25, somebody owns five rental houses.
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.720]   I would call that financially independent.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:12.640]   Even at a time when many of their age group competitors are just coming out of school,
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:19.720]   saddled with student loan debt, getting entry-level jobs, which is what many people do when they
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:25.240]   go through just a standard four-year career and it takes them a few years to find themselves.
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:32.880]   I think our enterprising young adult would be in a pretty good situation.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.080]   But a few other bonus ideas of the RV lifestyle.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.080]   Remember this.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:44.720]   There are RVs all over the place and there are RV owners who would like to have their
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:48.600]   work done on their RVs all over the place.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:54.880]   And many people, one of the reasons they pursue something like financial independence is so
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.880]   they can do things like travel the country in an RV.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.120]   Here's what I would do.
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:08.120]   If I had the desire to travel the country in an RV, I would do it.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:12.920]   What I would do is I would put a small little magnetic sign on the side of my tow vehicle
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:20.520]   for towing my RV and I would do mobile RV mechanic work while I'm on the road.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:25.800]   Every place that you are in a campground, you have a whole bunch of potential customers.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:29.640]   Certainly, you're not going to be working every day but there are a bunch of people
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:37.040]   in a campground who if they saw somebody with a sign that said mobile RV mechanic, 10 years
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:42.360]   experience and that doesn't perfectly fit into the young man model here.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.300]   I'm thinking about somebody with more experience and more age.
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.480]   They would be happy to say, "Hey, listen.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.480]   I've got this problem.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.760]   Do you think you could help me fix my water heater?
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.040]   Do you think you could help me figure out what's going on with my roof?
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:56.080]   Or do you think you have the time to help me diagnose my electrical problem?"
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.040]   A lot of these problems that we have on RVs are things that are not permanent.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.280]   They don't mean you can't use it at all.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:07.520]   They're just annoying little obnoxious repairs that I need to get around to it sometime.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.840]   But somebody could make some money in a campground.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.320]   Here's one to go at one better.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:20.120]   I see no reason why a career like this couldn't be connected to other opportunities in the
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.880]   RV business.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.440]   If you live in an RV, one of the things that many people who want to travel long-term in
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.480]   an RV will do is they'll take a job working as a campground host.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:36.560]   Now frequently, campground hosts are seemingly wealthy people in their 60s, usually a couple,
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.560]   usually have a big old fifth-wheel trailer and a couple of dogs and kennels and things
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.560]   like that.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:48.080]   The task of a campground host is to go and welcome everybody, help in some parks.
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:54.560]   They help with assigning a certain site to people who come in and they often will do
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.880]   things like clean the bathrooms.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:00.800]   It requires usually perhaps a few hours a day of work, maybe three.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:06.200]   It depends on the host, depends on the campground, depends on a bunch of different factors.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.800]   They do some minor cleanup at a campground as well.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.520]   But what they get in exchange for that is free rent, free lot rent.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.400]   So they have a place to park their RV where they're not paying nightly campground fees
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.840]   and then depending again on the park, they'll get the amenities of that park.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.660]   That might be an electrical connection for their RV.
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:26.680]   It might be full hookups, which would mean electrical connection, water connection, a
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:31.040]   sewer drain set up for their RV and cable TV and also internet.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:36.360]   So somebody who has an RV, if they live and work as a camp host, could put themselves
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:42.880]   in a situation where their only living expenses are personal food and they're working off
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:49.280]   their rent, their utilities, etc. from their camp hosting duties.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:55.600]   I also don't see any reason why if somebody had skill as an RV mechanic, they couldn't
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:03.080]   put up maybe a smaller sign and indicate that they also work on RVs in their off time.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.240]   I can't imagine, although I've never seen anyone do it, but I can't imagine as long
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:13.040]   as you were low key about it, why you wouldn't be able to have your personal customers to
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.200]   work on their RVs in the afternoon.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:20.840]   So now we've put ourselves in a situation where you've got free rent in exchange for
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.480]   your few hours a day of work as a campground host.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:29.920]   As a campground host, you are often connecting with many of the campers.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.600]   Some campgrounds, it's every camper.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.640]   Other campgrounds, it's more of if you need us, we're here.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.520]   Depends on the setup.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:42.520]   And you've got a side business that you can do on the road wherever you go and earn a
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.440]   good hourly wage.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:49.920]   If you did it that way, you wouldn't even need the seven years of hard work and the
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.820]   half a million dollars.
[00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:57.440]   You just need the skill with RVing, with working on RVs.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:02.440]   You need a rig to live in and the will to make it work.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.000]   And you've built yourself a career that can go on the road.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.680]   That's not dependent on an internet connection.
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:11.120]   That's not dependent on you being the next big blogger.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:16.120]   It's actually a highly skilled industry and a real service.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:22.100]   Now that idea of building an industry or building a business and a skill set around the place
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:25.800]   that you want to live in your dream retirement is common.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:30.680]   That's common in the cruising circles where if you're a diesel mechanic or if you are
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:35.320]   a sail maker or sail repairer or if you know how to work on boats, then you can go and
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.800]   you pull into a marina and you advertise your services.
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:44.160]   If you're the teak guy or you're the underwater barnacle scraping crew, you can figure out
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.680]   how to earn your living while you're in that marina living the lifestyle with the other
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.680]   cruisers.
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.680]   Many people do that.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.600]   This is just taking that idea and bringing it over to dry land.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:58.160]   I think for a lot of people, the barriers to entry, doing it on dry land are a lot lower
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.720]   than they are in the marina environment.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:08.560]   One final advantage I forgot to mention of the RV mechanic lifestyle, especially given
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:12.540]   that flexibility of business.
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:19.800]   We often underestimate how valuable it is to have control of your time and flexibility
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.280]   in your location.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:26.440]   Again, by this I mean if I were scheduling work, let's say that I could figure it out
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.160]   that I could fit in two or three customers a day.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.160]   Average repair may be two hours, two to three hours.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:36.280]   I could fit two to three customers a day in and then there's time for me to travel between
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:40.040]   them but I've got flexibility here.
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:43.920]   I can adjust my customers and fit an extra hour in the day or if I know I'm going to
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.640]   be up in the north of the county or the south of the county, then I've got the flexibility
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.240]   and the ability to go places because I'm out and about and I've got some control over my
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.360]   schedule.
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:58.640]   That allows me to save a lot of money on the other stuff that's associated with life.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:04.760]   One of the reasons why people work a job, people work a job, get sunk every which way.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:10.480]   You get the worst tax code, unlike a business owner and our friendly mobile RV mechanic
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:14.880]   has his vehicle as a deductible expense.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:19.640]   Certainly of course only his business miles but come on, when you're an RV mechanic, the
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.840]   vast majority of your miles are business miles.
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:25.280]   His cell phone is a deductible business expense.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:31.760]   His gasoline â€“ there are other â€“ basically a lot of his personal expenses become business
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:36.800]   expenses and he has a huge advantage in this context over somebody who's an office worker.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:41.560]   An office worker who's working a standard salaried job of course doesn't have a deductible
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.560]   car expense.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.840]   They don't have a deductible cell phone expense.
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:47.600]   They don't have any deductible expenses because they're a salary worker.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:51.040]   The only deductible expense that you get when you're a salaried employee is you get a
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.040]   401(k) maybe.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.800]   Of course our business owner can set that up for himself anyway.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:00.000]   But the other benefit is you get the flexibility to be able to go after deals and save money
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.860]   on things.
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:07.200]   If you need a new washer, washing machine or if you need a new appliance or a new piece
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:11.280]   of furniture, you can hang out on Craigslist and you can watch for something to be posted
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:15.980]   that's inexpensive and then you can react quickly and go and pick it up.
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:22.680]   But if you're working at a job, let's say that you are a medical office clerk and
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:28.240]   your job is to be there at the dentist's office welcoming the clients and taking care
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.880]   of the medical billing and making sure that everyone is squared away.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.200]   Well, if you need a new washing machine, the only time that you have available is Saturday
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:38.120]   morning and there's a lot of competition on Craigslist on Saturday morning.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.440]   And so thus if you need a new washing machine, you're going to be much more likely to go
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:46.400]   down to the local appliance store and pay full retail for a washing machine.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:52.240]   Well, $650 versus a hundred bucks or maybe you pick it up for free because it doesn't
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:55.200]   work and then you got a little bit of time to fix it.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:00.100]   Those things added up make a big, big difference.
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:04.920]   So if you can build a career or a business or a lifestyle that keeps your flexibility
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:08.000]   with your time, it's not that you won't work.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   You're going to work.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   I work a lot.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.360]   But it's that you can work with a little bit of flexibility.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:18.480]   You can choose when you work to a degree.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:23.080]   You aren't telling me exactly the time of day that I have to record my podcast.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:28.280]   And because I'm not accountable to you in that way, that means that if I want to record
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:33.560]   it first thing in the morning or if I want to record it late in the evening, I can assign
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:37.080]   and allocate the hours of my day as I like.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:43.440]   That frees up time for me to do things that help to save money.
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:53.680]   This is why the dual income household with two wage-earning, salary-earning jobs is the
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:37:01.640]   most awful way to design an income stream from the perspective of financial freedom.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:06.580]   It's the absolutely best way to design an income stream if you're trying to maximize
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:12.000]   tax revenue to the US federal government or to your country of residence.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:19.280]   It's the absolute best way to lower wages if you are in charge of massive corporations
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:24.360]   and you want the lowest possible per capita wage.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.280]   Well, take everybody out of the house.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.640]   Put everybody into salary jobs.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:36.560]   Their taxes are going to be carefully tracked by their employer, the big companies.
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.560]   We can threaten big companies.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:47.840]   Going a little bit into tax evasion world here but this is the destruction of it.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:52.360]   The guy â€“ when I paid for my RV, I always prefer to do business in the free market whenever
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:55.160]   I can to encourage the free market.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:59.320]   When the guy worked for me and he fixed a couple of things on my RV, he didn't give
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:04.400]   me an invoice and I didn't give him a credit card.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:08.280]   I handed him little stacks of green bills.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.240]   Now what he does, that is up to him.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:16.360]   But there's a pretty good chance that that money went right into his pocket and it's
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.320]   not going on a tax return to Uncle Sam.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:24.900]   And there's a pretty good chance that a high proportion of that guy's clients do exactly
[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:27.880]   the same thing.
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:32.360]   That's standard operating procedure in the world of small business.
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:39.080]   But that's not standard operating procedure in the world of salaried employees, which
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:43.560]   is why people are encouraged â€“ get a big â€“ one of the reasons and I'm not trying
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.560]   to say it's conspiratorial.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.960]   I'm saying it's practical.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:52.240]   When everybody gets a big job, you're locked into a world of paying retail for all of your
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:56.840]   expenses and earning in the highest tax system possible.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:02.400]   It's a very inefficient way to set up your life.
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:07.620]   Much, much better to set up at least one of your family's income streams.
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:11.240]   If you can't handle all of them, make sure at least one of them is set up to take advantage
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:13.040]   of the business tax code.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:19.140]   You have a deductibility of expenses that are related to business income and the ability
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:28.720]   to be flexible on when you go and pick stuff up for cheap on Craigslist and then have the
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.720]   time to fix it up, have the time to use it.
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:38.040]   If you found a deal on a couple thousand board feet of boards that somebody was getting rid
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:41.760]   of and you go and pick them up because you're on your way to a job and you're out and
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:47.600]   about and you're not stuck behind the dentist's desk answering phones, you can go pick up
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:53.840]   those couple thousand feet of cheap or free boards and then use them to make your floor.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.800]   You saved yourself $10,000 instead of going down to Home Depot on the weekend and buying
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:06.180]   all of the fresh off the rack laminate flooring with all of the associated sales tax and paying
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.720]   for everyone's health insurance.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:14.400]   So there's a little just of a mini discussion on the power of flexibility with a job like
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.400]   this.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.760]   I hope that you can see the principles.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:21.800]   The principles are to increase income and in this case, you increase income by going
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.840]   into a skilled trade that's in demand.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:32.720]   And if you have children, you had better make sure that you're carefully analyzing your
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:38.480]   children's inclination and personal skill sets because there is a huge opportunity available
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.080]   in the skilled trades right now.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:45.640]   If you're a plumber, if you're an electrician, if you're an air conditioning contractor and
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:53.320]   many, many other aspects of that, you can charge a very high hourly rate and young people,
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:59.620]   young men and women are walking away from these trades because they involve hard work.
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:06.440]   So you go into a trade that earns you a high income because of your differentiation with
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.440]   skills.
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:14.360]   You keep your expenses low while you're accumulating investment capital and then you invest close
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.360]   to you.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.080]   You invest in what you know.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:22.680]   The RV marketplace is an incredibly inefficient market and it's a market that you can manipulate.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.440]   You can shine up a trailer and sell it.
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.320]   You can take advantage of the things that your customer is looking for.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:31.200]   They're looking for an RV where everything works and you can certify that everything
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.200]   works.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.360]   You may choose to offer your own little mini warranty on the RVs that you sell.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:38.240]   That'd be valuable to me.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.260]   And then you optimize your lifestyle.
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:44.620]   You build a business around something that keeps your freedom with your time, your freedom
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:49.360]   with your location, even your freedom to pursue other businesses along the way.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.840]   You may have a real estate license and sell some real estate here and there while you're
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.260]   doing your RV work.
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:58.280]   You may have a car dealer's license and you go down to the auctions and buy a car cheap
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:00.960]   and sell a few cars here and there.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:04.160]   You may have dozens of lines of income.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:08.840]   But you can build resilience, you can build flexibility, and you can achieve financial
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.960]   freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:17.960]   It's not a pipe dream, but does require your careful analysis and your being willing to
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:22.480]   go against the grain and think about what your skills are, what your opportunities are,
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:25.760]   and then take the ideas I've presented here and adjust them to your situation.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.480]   Thank you for listening.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:28.480]   Bye.
