[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480]   Welcome, friends, to this episode of the Everyday Educator Podcast.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.800]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey, and I'm excited to spend this time with you today as we encourage
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:22.300]   one another, learn together, and ponder the challenges and the delights that make homeschooling
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.900]   the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:31.620]   Now, whether you're just considering this homeschooling possibility or deep into the daily delight
[00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.200]   of family learning, I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.720]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome, you'll find even closer support
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.960]   in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.540]   So, go to classicalconversations.com and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.380]   So, listeners, this is one of our first episodes with video two.
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:07.840]   And so, my guest, Deb, and I are sitting here thinking, okay, don't scratch your nose, don't
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.660]   flick your hair, don't shift in your seat because people are watching us.
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.620]   So, if I'm a little awkward, it probably means that I all of a sudden remembered that you could
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.000]   see my facial expressions.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.780]   And so, they are sometimes speaking out loud.
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.760]   And I have a lot of feelings about the topic that we're going to cover today, finishing strong
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.360]   as we all approach the end of our CC year.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.180]   You know, community days are coming to a close.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:48.120]   Our kids are in the thick of last minute projects and end of the year celebrations.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.360]   Sometimes, mamas and daddies, I know, we're tired.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.340]   And dare I say, sometimes everybody in our family is just the smallest bit tired of it.
[00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.860]   And so, we are here to encourage one another in how to finish strong.
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.000]   And I have a dear friend, Deb Switzer, with me today.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.960]   Deb has lots of experience as a homeschooling mom and as a homeschooling community leader.
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.600]   And so, we're going to pick Deb's brain about how to finish strong with your students and
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.960]   what you as a parent can do to help your student finish strong and bring your school year to
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.440]   what you'll consider a successful end.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.740]   So, Deb, I'm so glad that you're here with me today to talk about this.
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.900]   Thanks for coming.
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.240]   Thanks for having me and picking my tired brain as well.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.240]   Because we're in the last five weeks of CC as well.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.240]   So, it's fun though.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.820]   Yeah, that's what I want people to know.
[00:02:51.820 --> 00:03:01.460]   The podcast guests that I bring to you guys every week and my own perspective are not coming
[00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.260]   from a talking head point of view, but from the point of view of moms and dads who are in
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.740]   the trenches too.
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.660]   And so, you know, Deb is probably sitting here thinking, I want to talk to these dear folks,
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:23.460]   but I also have children who have XYZ Project and students who are working on a senior thesis
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.760]   or who are waiting for me to give them one more prod of goodness to the end.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.600]   And so, we feel your pain and we feel your delight as you are helping your students come to the
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.160]   end of a great year.
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.940]   We want to help you help them celebrate success.
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.600]   So, I'm going to go back.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.900]   I'm going to let everybody see how credentialed you are, Deb, for this very thing.
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.660]   So, I want you to tell people, how long have you been homeschooling?
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.460]   Oh, so I know when I was thinking about this, I started to age myself tremendously.
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.520]   Oh my gosh, I know.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.440]   You just don't.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.420]   What in the world?
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.800]   So, I've been homeschooling for 20 years.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.320]   I've actually hit the 20-year milestone this year.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.120]   So, I've been homeschooling for 20 years.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.920]   That's awesome.
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:18.300]   So, I've been doing CC for 15 of those 20 years.
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.080]   I came in five years into that.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.480]   And I've been directing in the communities or tutoring or directing in the communities from
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.480]   the moment that I started.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.960]   So, I definitely have been hitting the ground running all the way through.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.220]   Yeah.
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.900]   Yeah.
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.360]   It does feel strange when you think back.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.520]   You think, well, I've been doing this for a few years.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.880]   I probably have, you know, eight to 10 years of experience.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.740]   And then you look back and you think, oh, no, it was 20 years.
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:49.220]   And so, I personally can't decide if homeschooling kept me young or has aged me terribly.
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.000]   I don't know.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.260]   Maybe it's a bit of both.
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.140]   That's right.
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.900]   I do know that it's been a blessing and that God has, I will say this, and this is a different
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.340]   podcast.
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.980]   We'll cover this at a different time.
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:08.740]   I feel like God has blessed me and grown me more than I was ever able to grow my children.
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.380]   And so, homeschooling, you know, parents, if you're coming to the end of the year and
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.560]   you think, man, I feel like I was the one who was schooled this year.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.000]   Just know you're in good company.
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:29.200]   And I really do think that homeschooling is the most refining and redeeming endeavor of
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.140]   a parent's life.
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.740]   But that, like I said, that's a different podcast.
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.460]   So, let's think about this, finishing strong.
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:44.880]   As a parent, Deb, and as a director, which is harder for you, starting the year or finishing
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.100]   well, oh, well, I'm sure it all depends on personality.
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.180]   So, my personality loves to, I have a, I feel like I start well.
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.840]   So, I'm a planner.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.600]   And so, I'm able to like try to get all my ducks in a row.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.240]   And I have all these great, wonderful ideas of how I'm going to start the school year.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.880]   It's going to be amazing and all this different stuff.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.640]   And then, I think finishing is always a lot harder.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.300]   I'm like, almost there.
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.560]   I'm going to make it.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.000]   I'm trudging to the finish line and thinking about, yes.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.880]   Pulling people in assignments after you on a big chain.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.120]   And realizing which ones I've dropped and that that's okay.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.160]   And that's okay.
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.620]   It's, you know, which ones have I been able to keep and what ideas stayed strong and which
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.240]   ideas fell off the wagon.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.860]   And that's all right.
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.520]   It's all good.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.680]   It's part of the process.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.900]   And, you know, just remembering it's lifetime.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.920]   So, I think we can look at, you know, May as like, it's this hard finish line.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.460]   And, you know, but it's, you know, every time I step back and say, hey, I'm in this for
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.360]   the long call with my children.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:04.360]   And this May, the end of this year, is like a mile marker on your journey.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.760]   It's not, perhaps, for many of us, not the final destination.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.900]   Now, we'll talk in a minute.
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:18.360]   For some moms and dads, this May, there's a definite finish line that they're crossing.
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:26.180]   But for most of us, you're right, we are trying to get across the finish line that looked so
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.300]   full of promise and so far away when we started.
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.780]   I tend to be like you.
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.380]   I love the start of a school year.
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.920]   Even when I was a student, man, I loved the idea of new notebooks.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.720]   There weren't any scratched out places in them.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.180]   And all my pencils were sharp and all my pens were full of ink.
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:51.400]   And, you know, none of, I didn't have any of the little ratty, torn out pieces in my spiral
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:51.880]   notebooks.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:59.900]   So something, there's something fresh and exciting and turning a new leaf about the beginning of
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:00.280]   the year.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:06.360]   The end of the year for many of us, like you said, just is a fight to the finish.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:13.060]   It is, you know, you had all these plans and now you're looking and you're thinking, well,
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.580]   some of them are still doable or some of them are barely doable.
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.560]   And some of those, is that what that was I left back there in the dust?
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:33.200]   And so it's just sometimes for most of us, finishing strong is harder because I think because
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:41.300]   we're tired and I think for some of us, our goals changed in the middle and we didn't recalibrate.
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:50.180]   So we still, you know, on paper still have these goals that maybe we stopped really working
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:50.660]   toward.
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:55.880]   And all of a sudden we think, oh, I wrote that down and we're for sure not going to make
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.280]   that because it fell off the radar.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.620]   And so some of us can beat ourselves up about that.
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:08.240]   And so finishing strong, well, that makes it a challenge.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.700]   What else, what else do you think?
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.300]   I want to talk about why is finishing strong a challenge?
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.940]   You know, what are the pain points?
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.780]   What are the issues that we feel in a lot of different ways?
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:27.720]   So what are the challenges to finishing strong at home?
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:34.660]   So for people, I mean, not even what's due in community and what other people are expecting
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:39.060]   of you as a director or your children as community participants.
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.720]   What makes finishing strong challenging at home?
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:50.300]   I think, you know, as I think there's a whole sense of that there, you know, we want to
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:50.800]   be done.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.520]   Like if you're like my mind, I want to be done so I can have my season of rest.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.280]   And because I, I take some, not everybody does, but I take summers off.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:06.720]   And so for me personally, that concept at home of I, I personally want rest.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.320]   I want my kids to be done so that I can have rest.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:19.200]   And so I think that I, um, sometimes I need to pull myself back and say, Hey, um, don't
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:25.320]   get so, yeah, don't get so caught up in the calendar, get, allow God's grace to really kind
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.960]   of come in during the season.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:32.480]   And I think, um, different personalities handle things differently, but I definitely get into
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.880]   a place where I want it done so that it can be there.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:43.800]   And I, the calendar starts to dictate my focus and God spoke to me about just take your eyes
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.940]   off the calendar and put your eyes on me.
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:52.080]   Uh, and when I can do that, when I start to shift, I think that's probably my personal biggest
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.460]   pain point at the end of the year is that I'm looking at the counter.
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:11:01.460]   I'm seeing all the activities, all the projects, all the assignments that, you know, my kids have
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:05.380]   and I just get zoomed in on the calendar and right.
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.460]   It all has to be done by this block.
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.100]   Yeah.
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:13.580]   And I forget to lift up my eyes and just say, uh, I need to lift up my eyes to the hills.
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.080]   Where does my help come from?
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.720]   It comes from the Lord maker of heaven and earth.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:24.060]   And to just sit back and say, you know what, God, you are in charge of this calendar.
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:29.980]   You are in charge of every single one of these things that I have color coded and lined up and
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:30.700]   everything else.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.380]   You're in charge of it.
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:39.060]   And some of these things may not be your plan for us this month, even though I think it is.
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.040]   And some are, and are things that we have to buckle down and do.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.540]   And can you lead me, God, can I lift up my eyes from what I think we have?
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:53.300]   And can I lift up my eyes and let you show me what we have the grace for in this season of life
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.540]   and what you are calling us to, to work hard on?
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.160]   What are you calling us to maybe let go of?
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:06.280]   Uh, what are you calling us to do the best that we can in at this moment and balance that for me,
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:11.900]   God, so that I'm not, I'm not running my family or like trying to show my family away.
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.280]   That's made by, you know, man, but that's made by you.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.820]   Um, and my calendar is helpful.
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.000]   I love calendars.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.040]   Absolutely.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.760]   It can keep us focused and moving ahead instead of just spiraling.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.700]   Like, Oh, I don't want to be like, I don't want to be all over the place.
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.320]   I want to help my children by giving them direction.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.960]   You know, they need direction and they need, um, guidance, right?
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.940]   They need those boundaries during the season.
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:41.160]   So giving up focus to our kids helps remove the pain points a little bit.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.880]   Cause they're like, I don't know what to do next.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.220]   They need a little bit more help at the end of the year with all those projects and the different
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:47.940]   things coming in.
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:52.120]   They need a little, let me walk you through this and show you how to manage your time
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.100]   and balance your time.
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.200]   So it's just, it's, it's just helpful for them.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.000]   You know what?
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.640]   You have said so many wise things.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.460]   I wish I could just like go back and replay it in slow motion.
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:11.920]   I love, I love your testimony because I think a lot of us can feel it of, um, falling into
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:21.280]   the trap of having the calendar dictate our pace because we're so focused on this was the
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:21.640]   plan.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.820]   And this is the date on the calendar.
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.580]   Here's my red X.
[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:30.180]   All this stuff has to be done by then.
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:38.180]   And then we start to feel it all piling up behind us like a tidal wave ready to crash on us instead
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.700]   of the gentle swell.
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.260]   That's going to take us along.
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.860]   I tend to fall into that too.
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:52.320]   Like once I have made a plan, it's really hard for me to accept a change to the plan.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:58.320]   And so if I think we're going to be done, then like, there's something in my spirit that
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.060]   has been pressing toward that.
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:06.020]   And, and I guess internally thinking I can keep going because there's the end, there's the
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:15.100]   end, but your counsel to stop and breathe and look up and ask the Lord it, that is, that
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:19.000]   is the end, but does it have to be right there?
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:25.600]   We do want to accomplish these things, or maybe that's no longer ours to do.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.100]   Maybe, you know, the focus has changed.
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:34.120]   And I think sometimes like there are things that are the hard deadlines and we know, but
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:39.080]   then sometimes God extends things out for us that in ways that we don't know that he's
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:39.740]   going to do.
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:40.720]   I love this.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.940]   My daughter told me this story when she was, and I use it for an analogy for homeschool all
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:51.980]   the time now where she had to go to, she went to summer camp when she was younger and
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.180]   she had to pass a pretty rigorous swim test.
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.140]   And so, you know, she was trying to get ready for it.
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.100]   And this swimming is not our natural thing.
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.900]   We don't do a ton of swimming in our home, but you know, she was fine.
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:02.980]   Like she should be able to do it.
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.900]   And so it was a four lap swim test and then some other things.
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.120]   And so she said four laps.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:12.880]   And so she did up and down and up and down and she thought she was done.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.640]   So she thought that that was four laps.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:23.640]   And so she got to what she thought was the end and she realized, I'm only halfway.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.320]   I'm only halfway.
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:30.520]   And all of a sudden, everything that she thought she could do in her own strength was gone.
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:37.780]   And she said, she literally prayed, God, I need you because that mental block of I'm only halfway
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.220]   there and I thought I was done.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:46.480]   And she had to just rely on grad's grace to do another full, you know, two laps.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:52.240]   And, and she said, I felt something kick in, mom, you know, I felt something kick in.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.920]   And, and she passed the test and we talk about that all the time.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:02.120]   And I say, I feel that way sometimes with school that, you know, we're doing all this, all this,
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.300]   you know, learning at home and these projects.
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.000]   And I thought we were done.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.020]   And then I go and see, Oh, we didn't, we didn't do that as fully as I thought we did.
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:17.340]   You know, like maybe we got to like a project and you did it, but Oh, all the, maybe some
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.920]   of that back work that was supposed to have happened.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:25.340]   Maybe we were winging it a little bit and we have to go a little bit longer to just ensure
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:26.700]   that we finished that.
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:27.060]   Right.
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:30.340]   And I was like, that's when God's grace kicks in.
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:34.700]   God's grace kicks in when we need it and that we don't have to keep trying to do it in
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.340]   our own strength.
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:40.600]   We can rely on God's strength to take us all the way through to bring it to full completion.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.220]   It is by God's grace that we do that.
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.200]   That is great.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:45.900]   Hey everybody.
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:51.120]   We want to interrupt the show to talk to you about ACCU, where you bank matters and America's
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:56.260]   Christian credit union is proud to partner with classical conversations to provide a full
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:00.340]   suite of banking services to CC communities across the country.
[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:05.120]   America's Christian credit union is a cooperative of believers pooling resources.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:10.160]   together to support a biblical worldview and the greater body of Christ.
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:15.980]   So whether you're a licensed director looking for better business banking or a family seeking
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:21.640]   a financial partner that shares your values, ACCU is here to serve.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:26.280]   ACCU invites you to join and enjoy the many benefits of membership.
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:32.020]   learn more about America's Christian credit union by visiting our episodes show notes.
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.520]   Let's get back to the show.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:40.100]   That is really, that's very, that's very heartening testimony, Deb.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.040]   And I appreciate it.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:45.380]   You said one thing about your students that we're going to come back to in a moment.
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:55.660]   Sometimes at the end, when there are a lot of things that you're bringing to the end, bringing
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:03.520]   full circle, what our students need from us at the end is different from what they need from
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.440]   us in the early days and in the middle.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:11.860]   So we're going to talk about that in a minute, but what is, cause you've been a director for
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:19.600]   a lot of years also, and there are unique challenges to finishing well in community.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.600]   What are some of those challenges?
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.820]   Yeah.
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.580]   Well, spring fever hits, right?
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:30.480]   And confidently felt that is a big thing across the whole community.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:35.580]   It doesn't matter the age, like spring fever hits, everyone senses the end coming and everybody's
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:41.880]   like the doing wild crew that I have sitting here before me.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:48.320]   And so, um, helping everybody kind of, um, like capturing that energy, like how can we use
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.640]   that energy to actually, um, propel us forward.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:59.460]   And so, uh, you know, taking students outside, uh, if you have the opportunity in the spring and letting
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:06.160]   them relish, uh, the, the warmer weather, if you've been somewhere that's cold and still continuing
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:12.920]   learning, I think really helps the, the, um, the dynamic and community to be able to get out there and
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.100]   spend some time outdoors.
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:14.820]   They need it.
[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.340]   Let them run around for a minute.
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:21.060]   I don't care what age from four to 18, they still need to do it.
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.600]   They need to run around.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.400]   They have a lot of pent up energy.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.660]   Um, really sitting down and meeting with the students.
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.020]   Like, so I just had a touch point with all of our families.
[00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:34.260]   I said, okay, so this is where we are.
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.740]   How do we finish strong?
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.540]   I said, let's make sure we see what's coming.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:44.400]   Let me help you think through all of the stuff that's coming at the end of the year
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.300]   and what's vital for your family and your educational goals.
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.600]   And I think that's a great question.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.300]   Directors can ask families.
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:52.900]   Yes.
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.840]   Here's this, you know, here's what's left.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.900]   What's important right now?
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.820]   Like what's key in your child's education right now?
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:08.660]   What do, what does he or she need to improve in or focus on or thrive in at this point?
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:15.880]   Um, and how can we not drop everything else, but put some focus there and tailor some of
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:21.440]   these other things to ensure that that sense of accomplishment comes, uh, at the end of the
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:28.020]   year, you know, we don't want to end the, the, the academic year and say, Hey, I, I feel
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.880]   like I didn't do anything right at the end.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:30.180]   Right.
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.120]   I made a mess of all of it.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.420]   Oh, wow.
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:34.560]   That is so good.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:34.880]   Okay.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.220]   Listeners.
[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:43.580]   If your director has not done this with your students, you can do it, but you can also ask
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:44.300]   your director.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.020]   Okay.
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:54.960]   Could you maybe help me help our, our community see what's left to do and, and help us prioritize.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:59.360]   That is what a blessing, Deb, you are to those families.
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.260]   That's really good because you're right.
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:07.460]   There's a lot going on in the community and for older students.
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:07.780]   Okay.
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.700]   So here's a real pain point.
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:16.540]   Usually our challenge students still have some weeks to go when our foundation students
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.040]   are done, done.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:26.300]   And so in the community now I can remember, um, sometimes my challenge students were actually
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:33.960]   kind of glad when all the hubbub of foundations and essentials kids were gone.
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.900]   It was a quieter campus.
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.820]   It was a quieter church building.
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:41.020]   The halls were not as busy.
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.160]   The bathrooms were not as crowded.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.640]   Um, they, I don't know.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:52.620]   It's almost like the tone of the conversations went up when it was just the older kids left,
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.280]   um, in community.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:22:00.840]   But it is a challenge, uh, for families that have kids that are done and families that have
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.420]   kids that are still working.
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:12.440]   And sometimes still working on the hard stuff or the stuff that is the showcase of all the
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:16.200]   skills that they have sharpened over the years.
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.400]   So, all right.
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:23.680]   We've talked a little bit about what are the challenges for parents to finish strong.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.700]   Um, cause it, you're right.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.520]   As a parent, you're ready for a break too.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.660]   I mean, I can remember being a student thinking about my parents.
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:41.900]   You have no idea the stress I'm under with all of these exams coming up and all these big
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.460]   papers and all these projects.
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:47.960]   You just, I wish I had your life because you really don't have any problems.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:56.600]   Spoken like, or thought, thought like a true teenager, but there are things that are difficult for
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.400]   us as parents.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:03.960]   Some of it, some of the problems for parents in finishing strong is that juggling of all
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.460]   the needs of all of your children at once.
[00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:16.600]   speak to that Deb and, and, and the other challenges that parents feel about finishing strong.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:24.380]   Well, I can definitely just say like, I, I have been reduced to tears numerous April and May
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.360]   months, you know, not because.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:27.880]   Oh my gosh, me too.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:34.180]   Just cause it just, it can just, there's so, there are so many things happening and, you
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:40.080]   know, as much as we want to be relying on God's grace, there are just times and seasons where
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.300]   you're just like, I cannot do this.
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:42.580]   Right.
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:49.300]   And yeah, you want to say to your kid, you have these three things, but so does your sister
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.400]   and your two brothers.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.160]   And I have all 12 of them.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.040]   Yes.
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:58.380]   It's like, you know, and somehow we're going to do this.
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:05.000]   And, um, and I just remember when I had, uh, so my son was doing memory master, my daughter,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.480]   I had a, I had a daughter in challenge for a son and challenge two.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:16.040]   And I was directing, I had a daughter in challenge a, and a son doing memory master and essentials
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.020]   and faces of history.
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:18.140]   Oh my word.
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.860]   It's all coming at once.
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:23.440]   And I was like, I was like, and they're all like, mom, I need this.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.300]   Mom, I need this.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.860]   Everybody needs it at the same time.
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:31.960]   And I'm just being stretched, you know, here and there and everywhere.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:39.240]   And, uh, just, you know, I think I would normally, um, have a mental breakdown and then after I
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.200]   had my mental breakdown.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.480]   After that five minutes of allotted time.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.180]   God would gently remind me again, this is not about you.
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:50.560]   Uh, and that, you know, my grace is sufficient for you in this.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.480]   If your grace is sufficient for Paul, then your grace is sufficient for me.
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:59.600]   Uh, and so then I just, uh, one of my tips was that I always just tried to schedule at the
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.480]   end of the year, like make sure I had individual time with each.
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:08.440]   You know, like sometimes we're doing the, you know, with a, the one room school house and
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.600]   we have everybody together and we're used to that.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:17.280]   Uh, but during the end, um, it's important that they get individual time was my big takeaway
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:21.060]   that I need to really spend some individual time with my youngest.
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:27.020]   So if he's doing memory master and faces, I, and my olders too, like we get so used to their
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:33.440]   independence as homeschoolers, we're like, you have just been sailing, you are independent,
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.420]   you're doing this.
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.860]   And then it frees us up and we're just having these conversations with them.
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:44.740]   But at the end of the academic year, from the youngest to the oldest, they all just need
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:51.040]   some individual time of just, Hey, let me sit down with you and see how the, see how
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.760]   this project is coming along.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:58.200]   Let's make sure we're touching base on this one and that we're looking at your schedule
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:02.120]   and how your time is going and what's distracting you, what's helping you.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.200]   And, uh, they just need that.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:09.760]   So my biggest takeaway in my really busy time when all four were doing this thing at once
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:15.720]   was, um, pull back Deb for a minute and just make sure you're having that individual time
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:20.160]   because then they can take it and they can, they can, they can run more.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:20.480]   Right.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.800]   And so I need to equip them to run the race.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.560]   Um, and so that just requires a little bit more individual time.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.060]   At that end of the year.
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:29.660]   Yeah.
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.680]   That is really, really good.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.840]   That's wise counsel.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:40.700]   And somehow Deb, it's counterintuitive because for, for those of us who have multiple children,
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:46.680]   who are freaking out about multiple different things all at the same time, we think, okay,
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.560]   I got to sit you all down and get everybody, they're marching orders.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.200]   And, but you're right.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:59.000]   What they need is the individualized attention for their specific freak out moment.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   What's yours?
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:00.940]   What's yours?
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:01.580]   Yes.
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:14.400]   So, because sometimes it is, um, an older student who sees this huge task still to go, I am here
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.340]   and I have to get here and I don't have very long.
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:26.300]   And, and I had a daughter who was paralyzed by those, she would such a good student, but
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:31.620]   she would get to a certain point and there's like a week left and she knew what to do, but
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:32.600]   she's like paralyzed.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:40.620]   And so she needed me, even as an older student, she needed me to say, and she knew all this,
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:47.360]   but in that time she needed me to say, okay, honey, I think that you need to work on this
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.320]   for an hour.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:53.820]   And then I'm going to need you to take a 10 minute break, run around, go walk the trail,
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:56.720]   go get a drink, go check your email.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.120]   And then I'm going to need you.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:03.800]   I think you need to come back and work for 45 minutes and then we're going to have a check-in
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.260]   time.
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:08.200]   And then I need you to work for an hour and then we're going to have lunch and we're just
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:14.360]   going to, and I would say, and she knew that she needed to work and break and work and break,
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:20.140]   but she almost needed somebody to tell her, she needed a schedule to say, okay, because
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.880]   this is going to help me move forward.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:30.400]   And then at the end of the day, she could look back and be heartened that, okay, so I did bite
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:35.120]   off those pieces and I did chew it up and I am farther along.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.460]   And so you're right.
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:42.580]   They just need individual time and sometimes they need help that you think they've grown
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:43.300]   past.
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:48.340]   Yes, because that executive function paralysis that you're talking about is real.
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.300]   It is a real thing.
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.840]   It's a real for them and it's real for us, right?
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.940]   So I, that's why I was like, I would get in that mode.
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:59.660]   And when I'm in that mode and I'm like, I'm just looking at it.
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.200]   I'm just looking at my calendar and I'm looking at everything.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.940]   And you don't know how to start.
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.800]   Like 20 minutes have gone by and I'm still looking at my calendar.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.060]   What on the world is going on?
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:15.120]   And so pausing ourselves and remembering, we're like, that's what we need to do is remember
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.880]   we need to go for a walk as homeschool mamas.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:22.900]   We need to go out in the fresh air and take a minute and just let God order our thoughts
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:23.780]   for a little bit.
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:28.740]   And then we can come back and help our children get out of that paralysis as well and say,
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:29.940]   hey, you need this too.
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:33.480]   This is so important for you, right?
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.520]   To be able to just take a, take a breath and remember.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:43.600]   And then just that resetting just helps so much to let some other things go and just get reset.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:43.920]   Okay.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.440]   This is what I'm going to do right now.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.080]   Yes.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:54.980]   And, and what we want to do for our children is call them back to the joy of learning.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:30:03.120]   So if, when you get caught up in the spinning, I have so much to do, then it just becomes
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:08.160]   something to finish, not something to relish and learn from.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:12.940]   So let's think about, okay, what's the challenge for our younger kids?
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:19.760]   So let's think about like for foundations and essential students, many of them are coming
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:27.740]   to the end and they are interested in becoming memory masters, maybe, or subject matter experts
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:32.780]   for kids who are going to choose a strand to memorize.
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:40.760]   For essential students, a lot of them have one last big paper that they're showing what
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:41.420]   they've learned.
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.000]   Faces of history has come up.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.680]   How, what are the challenges for our younger students?
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.940]   And, and how do we, as parents help them?
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:57.120]   Yeah, I, you know, that, uh, again, I think that individual times, so for memory master,
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:01.920]   there's, there's no way that a child's gonna be able to get through all of that.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.780]   If they're working at it without mamas or a sibling's guidance.
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:12.960]   And so that's the blessing of, uh, you know, larger families is that we can have an older,
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:19.360]   older, uh, child say, Hey, help your younger child by going through the questions, uh, and
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:24.360]   being able to create that family dynamic, which by the way, has the added bonus of your older
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.400]   children who think they know everything going over the memory again.
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.280]   Reminding themselves that's perfect.
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:34.380]   Let's remember that timeline and all those fun history and science facts.
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.700]   So that actually works out really well.
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:40.640]   And with, uh, with the larger families to be able to do that, but, you know, and then just
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.380]   encouraging them.
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:47.680]   Like, I remember when my, um, my son wanted to do memory master, uh, you know, just saying,
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.280]   you know, I, first of all, I was like, you don't have to do it.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.760]   Cause he saw an older sibling do it.
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.660]   It's like, this is not a requirement of you.
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.900]   This is one thing we're learning as we go.
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.360]   This does require more work on your part.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.600]   Do you want to do it?
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:05.020]   And when he said yes, then that was more of his, like at a young age, starting that personal
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:05.400]   ownership.
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.580]   And I said, all right, let's set it up for you.
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:09.580]   Let me find some ways to make this.
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:13.860]   And that was more pre-work type of thing so that the end could go a little bit better.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.120]   Just setting up those things that they could be like, I'm just going to practice this.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.660]   And I have a sheet to practice on, or I have a way to practice.
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:26.440]   But at the end, as they're going through that, that time with mom, dad, aunts, uncles, cousins,
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:31.300]   siblings, neighbors, uh, who are all willing to kind of help in with that.
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.920]   It reminds me of, um, the movie Akilah and the bee when she was doing the spelling bee.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.280]   Yes.
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.720]   All the people in the neighborhood helped her.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.640]   Everybody can use those resources.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.320]   You can only do so much mama.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:47.700]   So, you know, use all those resources and let everyone help you along, uh, in that memory
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:48.640]   master drilling.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:53.300]   And, you know, I think Deb, one of the best things that we can do for our children at the
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:58.620]   very end is to remind them of why they wanted to do it.
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.160]   Um, instead of just feeling the stress.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.260]   So what excited you about this?
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.120]   What do you enjoy?
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:15.000]   What have you enjoyed about the year and reminding them that it's not all about performance and
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.280]   it's not only about the destination.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:24.440]   It's about the journey and your attitude about the journey and what you pick up along the way
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:28.400]   that you never expected to get along the way.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.860]   You know, and just as an encouragement, because there is so much that happens if, you know,
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:36.300]   whatever you're doing, whether you're a subject matter expert, if you're going for memory master
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:42.120]   or whatever it is, my son, my oldest son, uh, he struggled with, you know, some dyslexia and
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:42.660]   things like that.
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:47.740]   And he always struggled when he was younger, not feeling like he could do things.
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:52.540]   And at some point, uh, he decided that he wanted to do the memory master.
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:58.920]   And at the end of it, he looked at me and he said, mom, I'm smart.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.120]   Isn't that the best?
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.640]   Crying, bawling my eyes out.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:12.200]   Because before he was so down on himself and did he do everything perfectly the first time?
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:12.700]   No.
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:13.640]   And that was okay.
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:18.520]   He was seeing that he could learn, that he could, that he could understand things and
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:19.500]   express things.
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:26.800]   And all of a sudden his whole, his whole attitude toward education changed in a major way because
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.780]   he was like, I can do stuff.
[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:30.360]   And that changed everything.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.220]   Then I was like, well, remember how you did this?
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:34.100]   You can do that with writing too.
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.400]   You didn't think you could do it, but you can.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.720]   And he's like, you're right, I can do it.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.620]   And was it perfect?
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.380]   No, but he could do it.
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:44.900]   And that's, I think, part of the beauty of the journey.
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:45.860]   Yes.
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:50.140]   Part of finishing strong is remembering it's a journey.
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:56.860]   Even when your challenge for a student graduates and walks down that aisle for a cap and gown,
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.940]   it's still a journey.
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:34:59.440]   Right.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:04.220]   That was not the last exit on your journey.
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:04.660]   Yes.
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:04.940]   Yes.
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:09.780]   You know, it's one season ending, but the learning journey has not ended.
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:15.480]   And to know that we're creating that lifelong learning, I think it just gives a little bit
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.560]   of a sigh of relief.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.300]   It does.
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:21.980]   Finishing strong does not mean that everything was checked off at the end of this year.
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:27.800]   Finishing strong means that my child is learning to love learning and is learning how to learn
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:28.780]   in the process.
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.960]   And that's finishing strong.
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:40.780]   And I think if we can help our students realize that, like you said, that end is a false finish
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:41.260]   line.
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:41.740]   Yes.
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:44.620]   It's going to keep going.
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:53.680]   But that the beauty of crossing that finish line is in the looking back to where you started
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:58.200]   and seeing the progress that you made.
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.880]   One of my daughters was like your son in writing.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:05.800]   She just said, she would say to me, I don't think that way.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:06.480]   I don't.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:11.480]   She asked me one time, do you just think in five paragraph essays, mama?
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.240]   And I thought, I mean, yes, I kind of do.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.360]   And do you not?
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:23.360]   And the truth was that it was not, she said, I don't, words don't flow like that for me.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.880]   It was a real struggle.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:33.160]   And as a challenge A student, she just never felt like she was a good writer.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:41.160]   In the last paper she wrote, though, she had worked hard.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:47.800]   And this was at a point where they were, they were still doing a lot of writing instruction
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.320]   in challenge A.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:56.780]   And so she got to the end of the year and she read her paper to me and her daddy out loud.
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:01.720]   And she looked up at me and she just had this amazement on her face.
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.620]   And she said, I am a good writer.
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:08.880]   And that was another one of those bawling moments.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:15.940]   And she was able to look back and she was able to say, at the beginning of the year, I couldn't
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:16.680]   do this.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.880]   And now I can do this.
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:24.280]   And was it, you know, she would look at it now and think, well, that was really mechanical
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.020]   and that was very stiff.
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:33.640]   But as a child, she was able to look and see where she had come from.
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:38.660]   And so crossing that line was a huge celebration for her.
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:43.540]   And we celebrated that she could see herself in a different light.
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:47.780]   That's what we want for our children at the end of the year.
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:55.460]   Finishing well doesn't mean they won all the prizes and maybe won the $10,000 National Memory
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:56.200]   Master Prize.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:02.040]   It is, can they look back and see how far they came?
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:07.800]   And how far we've come as moms, as a family, did we come?
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:16.140]   Because now we know what to celebrate and we know what better assessment is and what a blessing
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:17.580]   to our students.
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:29.060]   I think one of the best ways to finish strong, to bless your family, is to take time when you
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:36.700]   can, to pause, like when the breath comes, but pause and spend some time reflecting on
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:37.120]   the year.
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:41.500]   Spend some time looking back at what did we start?
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:42.900]   Where did we start?
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.200]   How did we start?
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:50.220]   What were we trying to learn in this strand or in, you know, like what did, what facts did
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:56.080]   we memorize if we were younger or what paper, what paragraph did we write to this year that
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:56.840]   stands out?
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:03.620]   And to take the time to celebrate with each, each of your kids, the, the process that they
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:04.760]   went through for the year.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:09.720]   I mean, you know, my son is like, when can, when I finished challenge one, can I burn my
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:10.200]   Henley book?
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:15.800]   You know, like, so like these are the things that, you know, but I was like, no.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:24.040]   And instead let's think about what concepts we actually, you know, what do you know now that
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:28.320]   you didn't know and what did you learn in economics that you didn't know?
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.040]   You just finished your policy debate.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:32.600]   Let's talk about what you actually discovered.
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:37.560]   And that let's celebrate the fact that you just did an incredible speech that you didn't
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:38.380]   think you're going to be able to do.
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:39.140]   You did a rebuttal.
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:39.400]   Right.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.080]   Right.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.800]   In the world, you did it, you know?
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:46.920]   And so, um, all of these things and just celebrating with them and just saying, you know, all of these
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.280]   things are worth a celebration.
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.620]   You've, you've done so much.
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:55.960]   And instead of them thinking, I didn't get that paper done and I didn't finish that assignment
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:59.600]   or, you know, or I rushed this or, right.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:04.080]   Cause we all do, we all do, you know, and there's always room for growth.
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.300]   You can set new goals.
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:12.760]   You can change things around eventually, but celebrate, really celebrate the, the, the goodness
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:17.680]   of God, the truth, beauty, and goodness that you've discovered, uh, in this, in this year,
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.440]   the one that you've had, there is goodness in it.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.540]   There's beauty in it.
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:23.100]   There's so much truth in it.
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.320]   So celebrate it.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.260]   Uh, enjoy that moment with them.
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.720]   That's so good, Deb.
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:33.220]   And I love the idea of looking back to see how much you've learned and what you've learned
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:34.260]   and how you've grown.
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:41.200]   And parents, I want to encourage you that doesn't happen just in your academic subjects.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:47.360]   It's not just that you did a rebuttal for the first time or that you wrote an actual
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:55.220]   senior thesis or that you participated in a mock trial and did a great job of all your
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:55.720]   speeches.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:59.040]   Maybe it's looking back.
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:40:59.540]   Okay.
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:03.980]   What did God teach you this year about perseverance?
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.360]   Yes.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:13.060]   About pride, about mercy, um, about being kind.
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:21.660]   If we can look back and help our students see how they have grown in taking ownership for
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:32.160]   their own work and not passing blame, um, what a great, the spiritual aspects of growth that
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:39.960]   that we see in our children, um, are sometimes overlooked, especially by our kids because they're
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:46.920]   so eager to finish their work and they don't see that really that's what blesses our hearts.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:53.560]   When we can see that the Lord has grown them in maturity and we are celebrating that, but I think we
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.240]   need to help them celebrate what God's done in their hearts.
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:42:00.440]   There's so much discipleship that is happening through homeschooling, right?
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:04.020]   That it goes so much deeper than academics.
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.820]   There's so much growth.
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:06.420]   I know.
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:12.100]   I can't even imagine my life without homeschooling in the way that I've personally grown, let alone
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:19.000]   seeing the change and the transformation in my children and just knowing the work that God's
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.420]   done and the good and the bad and the ugly, it's all been working together for his good and his
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:24.800]   purposes.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:30.920]   And I just, I'm so thankful that we have the right, the freedom to be able to homeschool our
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:36.800]   kids and be able to have an opportunity, not just to teach them, but to disciple them that
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.740]   what a, what a gift from the Lord, uh, to be able to have that in our families.
[00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.640]   That is so encouraging.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:47.620]   And so I sort of want to say at this point, and that's how you finish strong.
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:52.160]   You, you stop, you take a deep breath.
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:55.080]   You have one-on-one time with your kids.
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:43:03.460]   You assess what, where are we and where do we still want to go and map out some steps for
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.280]   how to get there.
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:11.760]   But also one of the ways to finish strong is to look back and see where the Lord has brought
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.860]   you and be sure that you include celebration.
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:20.820]   Deb, thank you for all the, you have given us so much to think about and so much good wisdom,
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:25.880]   but also some really good practical tips that I feel like we're all going to go and massage
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:29.760]   over the next couple of weeks as we finish strong.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:30.780]   So thank you, Deb.
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:31.720]   I appreciate it.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:32.800]   Thank you so much.
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:33.000]   Awesome.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:39.980]   All right, guys, we'll see you next week and, um, go celebrate something today with your kids.
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:40.960]   Yes.
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:41.860]   Bye-bye.
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:49.000]   Bye-bye.
