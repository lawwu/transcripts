[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.400]   So what do you think of the recent first image
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.040]   of a black hole visualized from the Event Horizon Telescope?
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.680]   - It's an incredible triumph of science.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.720]   In itself, the fact that there are black holes
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.600]   which collide is not a surprise.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.640]   And they seem to work exactly
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.760]   the way they're supposed to work.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.000]   Will we learn a great deal from it?
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.120]   I don't know, we might.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.280]   But the kind of things we'll learn
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.260]   won't really be about black holes.
[00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.480]   Why there are black holes in nature
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.760]   of that particular mass scale and why they're so common
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.640]   may tell us something about the structure,
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.440]   evolution of structure in the universe.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.480]   But I don't think it's gonna tell us
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.960]   anything new about black holes.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.600]   But it's a triumph in the sense
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.400]   that you go back 100 years
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.200]   and it was a continuous development,
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.460]   general relativity, the discovery of black holes,
[00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.480]   LIGO, the incredible technology that went into LIGO.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:14.600]   It is something that I never would have believed
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.760]   was gonna happen 30, 40 years ago.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.840]   And I think it's a magnificent structure,
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.840]   magnificent thing, this evolution of general relativity,
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.960]   LIGO, high precision, ability to measure things
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.260]   on a scale of 10 to the minus 21.
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.380]   So yeah.
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.640]   - So you're just in awe-- - Astonishing.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.920]   - That we-- - Just in awe.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.760]   - This path took us to this picture.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.800]   Is it different?
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.840]   You know, you've thought a lot about black holes.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.400]   How did you visualize them in your mind?
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.280]   And is the picture different than you realized it?
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.740]   - No, it simply confirmed,
[00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.200]   you know, it's a magnificent triumph
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.760]   to have confirmed-- - Confirmed.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.320]   - A direct observation that Einstein's theory of gravity
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.480]   at the level of black hole collisions actually works
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.440]   is awesome, it is really awesome.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.560]   You know, I know some of the people
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.160]   who were involved in that.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.920]   They're just ordinary people.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.600]   And the idea that they could carry this out,
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.440]   I just, I'm shocked.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.360]   - Yeah, just these little Homo sapiens.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.960]   - Yeah, just these little monkeys.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.760]   - Yeah, got together and took a picture of--
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.640]   - Slightly advanced limers, I think.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.360]   (laughs)
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.840]   (upbeat music)
