[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920]   If you get before World War II, which is when the really huge atrocities that the Imperial
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.200]   Japanese Army commits without any doubt.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.120]   Going into someone else's country committing atrocities, that's not a winning game plan.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.800]   If you go before then, if you think of the Meiji Restoration, and so they colonized Taiwan,
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.800]   they colonized Korea.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.640]   It was brutal in Korea because the Koreans resisted and the Japanese got nasty.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.560]   Taiwan, much less resistant.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.800]   To this day, the Taiwanese do not have this bitterness about Japan that the Koreans do.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.720]   But what the Japanese did when they moved into Korea and Taiwan is they set about creating
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.720]   infrastructure.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.720]   They put in train lines.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.120]   They set about educating people.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.400]   Do they put them in the top positions?
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.400]   No.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.400]   The top positions are for Japanese.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.680]   But they do things like publish all kinds of magazines, like Technical Journal about
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.080]   agronomy and things, so that you have this incredible improvement of output because you're
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.960]   spreading knowledge to the Taiwanese and to the Koreans.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.840]   As they do it from the bottom up, they control the police force and the locality and from
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.840]   there all the way up.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.280]   So they really have local control.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.480]   It's not remotely democratic, but it turns out it's a very effective means for economic
