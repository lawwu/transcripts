[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   [Intro Music]
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.440]   What role does our faith play when we are praying for the salvation of others?
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.860]   It's an important question related to our prayer lives and the question comes to us
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.160]   from a listener named Richard.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.320]   "Hello Pastor John, thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.680]   I write because I have become discouraged in my prayer life.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.040]   None of my requests ever get answered.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.240]   I've been praying for family members to be reconciled, friends to come to faith, Christ's
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.760]   glory to be made evident to me, and other requests like these.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.120]   I faithfully read scripture and I cannot think of any unrepentant sin in my life that would
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.800]   hinder my prayers.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.400]   It just seems my answers are always no and I have become discouraged because of it.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.680]   Do you have any sustaining counsel for a weak brother who is enduring the silence of God?"
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:56.640]   Richard, I will try to give you some sustaining counsel, although I do share some of your
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:06.280]   deep disappointments and am fighting the same fight you are fighting in regard to extended
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:15.080]   years of unanswered prayer, especially as it regards salvation of people we care about.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:23.800]   So I don't know if what I say will be what you need, but it is what I have to give and
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.400]   how I press on.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:36.920]   Outside the Bible, no one has taught me more about prayer than George Mueller.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:45.400]   Perhaps you know that he was famous in the 19th century for founding and running orphanages
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:54.240]   in Britain by asking God for every need that it would be met for these children and seeing
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.880]   amazing answers to his prayers.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.960]   But listen to him in 1864.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.560]   He was 59 years old when he wrote this.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:12.320]   "I am now in 1864 waiting upon God for certain blessings for which I have daily besought
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.840]   Him for 19 years and 6 months without one day's intermission."
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.040]   Still, the full answer is not yet given concerning the conversion of certain individuals.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.320]   In the meantime, I have received many thousands of answers to prayer.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.560]   I have also prayed daily without intermission for the conversion of other individuals about
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:48.800]   10 years, others 6 or 7 years, for others 4, 3, and 2 years, for others about 8 years,
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.240]   18 months, and still the answer is not yet granted.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.560]   That's the end of the quote.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:05.520]   Mueller had an explanation for why some prayers like this were not answered for 20 years and
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.000]   thousands were answered.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   His explanation was that his prayers for the salvation of particular people to be saved
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:26.360]   did not have explicit biblical promises to rest on that those very individuals would
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.920]   be saved.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:35.280]   And the promise that whatever we ask would be given is always qualified, he would argue,
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.400]   by praying according to God's sovereign will.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.840]   Read 1 John 5, 14 to 15, and read it carefully because in one half of the verse it sounds
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.040]   totally sweeping, whatever you ask, and in the other half of the verse it sounds very
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.520]   qualified according to God's sovereign will.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:01.440]   But Mueller said that when he prayed for the needs of the orphans to be met, the prayer
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:09.080]   was based on an explicit biblical promise in Matthew 6, 33, "Seek first the kingdom
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:15.520]   of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.320]   He cited that specifically.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.920]   He did not decide ahead of time what the "all things" had to include.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:28.420]   Be careful, don't over-expect with specificity when the Bible hasn't been specific.
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:36.200]   But he did believe God had promised that what was needed for the doing of God's will and
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.080]   the glorifying of God's name, which is what we're commanded to do, we could go to many
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.280]   other passages of Scripture to see this same explicit promise.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.280]   Philippians 4, 19, "My God will supply all your needs."
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.120]   Romans 8, 32, "He will give us all things with Him."
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.920]   Psalm 34, 10, "Those who seek the Lord lack no good thing," and on and on.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:07.260]   Mueller believed that it was a sin not to believe that God would give us what these
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.640]   passages promise.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.240]   People thought he had the gift of faith that was in a class by itself, and other Christians
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.840]   didn't have this.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.320]   Mueller emphatically denied this.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:27.240]   He insisted that he simply had the grace of faith, not the spiritual gift of faith from
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.600]   1 Corinthians 12, like the gift of prophecy or the gift of wisdom.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.120]   In one of the most illuminating passages, helpful for me, here's what he said.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:45.040]   "The difference between the gift and the grace of faith seems to be this.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.540]   According to the gift of faith, I am able to do a thing or believe that a thing will
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:59.240]   come to pass, the not doing of which or the not believing of which would not be sin."
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.920]   You may have to pause this and think about that.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.520]   According to the—I'm still quoting now—"According to the grace of faith, I am able to do a thing
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.960]   or believe that a thing will come to pass, respecting which I have the Word of God as
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:23.080]   the ground to rest upon, and therefore the not doing it or not believing it would be
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.520]   sin.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:32.360]   For instance," he says—I'm still quoting—"For instance, the gift of faith would be needed
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:40.600]   to believe that a sick person should be restored, for there is no promise to that effect.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.840]   The grace of faith is needed to believe that the Lord will give me the necessaries of life
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:55.020]   if I seek His kingdom and His righteousness, for there is a promise to that effect."
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.020]   So here's the implication.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.460]   I'm done quoting now.
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.280]   So here's the implication.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.120]   His wife, Mary, was dying.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.340]   He's about 60 years old.
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.760]   He prayed that she be healed.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.780]   She was not healed.
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.880]   And here's what he wrote.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.880]   He died.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.880]   Here's what he wrote.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:18.080]   "The last portion of Scripture which I read to my precious wife was this, 'The Lord
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.240]   God is a sun and shield.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.640]   The Lord gives grace and glory.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:31.240]   No good thing will He withhold from those who walk uprightly.'
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:37.680]   I said to myself with regard to the latter part, 'No good thing will He withhold from
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.520]   them that walk uprightly.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:46.400]   I am in myself a poor worthless sinner, but I have been saved by the blood of Christ and
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.440]   I do not live in sin.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.280]   I walk uprightly before God.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:59.160]   Therefore if it is really good for me, my darling wife will be raised up again.'
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.160]   Sick as she is, God will restore her again.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:11.360]   But if she is not restored again, then it would not be a good thing for me.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.120]   And so my heart was at rest.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.560]   I was satisfied with God."
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:30.600]   So Richard, perhaps the encouragement for you and me is first, don't grow weary in
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:37.680]   praying for your lost friends and family since it may be that the very perseverance is a
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:45.000]   sign that the faith you are exercising in the perseverance is itself a gift.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.960]   That's what Mueller believed, and he did see some saved after 50 years of prayer.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:59.800]   And second, don't miss or minimize the answers you are receiving.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.880]   You say there are none.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.760]   I doubt that.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.200]   Are you still a Christian?
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.040]   God is hearing your prayer for keeping.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.400]   Are you in any measure of health?
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.480]   God is sustaining.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:19.680]   Are you in any way at all influential in pointing others to Christ?
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.360]   God is working.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.640]   Are you inclined to God's Word?
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.200]   That's an answer to prayer.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:31.960]   Are you able to see any beautiful spiritual things in God's Word?
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.920]   God is answering.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.400]   Is Christ precious to you?
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.600]   That's a miraculous answer.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.360]   Do you have any measure of satisfaction in Him?
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.160]   He's acting.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:50.880]   Do you hallow His name, seek His kingdom, do His will, eat daily bread, escape from
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.400]   temptation, defeat the devil's lies?
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.940]   Oh, my!
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.480]   God is answering.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:02.880]   Let us not make too little of these glorious acts of God.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.880]   Amen.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.920]   Wow, there's a lot to meditate on here for all of us in our prayer lives.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.080]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that response.

[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.720]   It's a massive question.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.560]   And it's one we get in the inbox every single day, it seems, and it's the question we will
