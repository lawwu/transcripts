[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   We're looking to eat largely when the sun is out
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.160]   and provide a bit of that digestive break
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.800]   in the evening when it's dark out.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.720]   We're just looking to kind of cluster
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.440]   a lot of your eating time closer to these rhythms of nature.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.000]   And this is what we would have done for so many years.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.200]   So how can we bring this into our modern society?
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.440]   Bare minimum, the last bite of food you have,
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.720]   you're having that about three hours before bed.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.520]   But if we look at things like four to five hours
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.240]   before bed experimentation with that,
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.720]   your last bite of food,
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.320]   often we see things like heart rate go down,
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.560]   HRV go up, changes in body temperature, blood oxygen,
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.480]   of course, your instances of sleep apnea.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.400]   'Cause we know that if you are having
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.280]   any respiratory based issues or mouth breathing, et cetera,
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.200]   that some of these things can flare up
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.960]   if you're eating too close to bed.
