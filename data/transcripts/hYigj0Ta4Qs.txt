[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.280]   the book of the Prophet Jeremiah, the 17th chapter and the 10th verse. The 10th verse
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.120]   in the 17th chapter of the book of the Prophet Jeremiah.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:29.760]   I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, Even to give every man according to his ways,
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.240]   And according to the fruit of his doings.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.080]   But it will be good for us and indeed essential that we should also bear in mind the previous
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.960]   verse, the 9th verse, for obviously these two verses go together.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:56.960]   The heart is deceitful above all things, And desperately wicked; who can know it?
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:08.040]   I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, Even to give every man according to his ways,
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.040]   And according to the fruit of his doings.
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:20.640]   In other words, we can continue our consideration of this most important series of paragraphs
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.240]   in this 17th chapter of the prophecy of Jeremiah.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:34.440]   It's important, I say, because we have here in such a short space and compass the essence
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.080]   of the message of the whole Bible.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.920]   The message of all these various prophets whose writings are recorded in the Old Testament
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.560]   is virtually the same message. It is God's controversy with his people, the children
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.160]   of Israel. But here and there in these various prophetic writings we come across passages
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:08.160]   such as this in which we are led at once to the very heart and center of the entire message.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.960]   Now there is no question at all but that one of the great functions of the Old Testament
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:24.600]   is just this, it is to give us an illustration of what God has to say to mankind.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:32.560]   The children of Israel are a great object, listen, standing here before us in the scriptures.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.920]   God raised them up in order that he might do certain things in them and through them.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:46.680]   And this is undoubtedly one of the things which God does with them. He addresses a message
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.600]   to the whole of mankind.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.040]   You see, the story is something like this, isn't it? Here are people brought into being
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.680]   by God in a miraculous manner, not a nation like every other nation, but God took one
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.640]   man Abram and turned him into a nation. He made a nation and a people for himself and
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.360]   he showered his blessings upon them. But he spoke to them and he made it very clear to
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.400]   them at the very beginning that there were two great possibilities ahead of them. If
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.840]   they walked in his ways, if they kept his commandments, he would smile upon them and
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.240]   bless them. But he made it equally plain and clear that if they forsook his ways, if they
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.700]   followed their own ways or the ways of other nations, if they turned their backs upon him
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:47.600]   and gave themselves to other gods and to idols, well then, he would punish them. Cursing,
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.080]   he would curse them.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.160]   God made that abundantly clear to them at the beginning. He gave them a law, he accompanied
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.400]   it by promises and by threats, he repeated it many times. The whole thing was put so
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:10.480]   plainly before them that you would have thought that no people could possibly have misunderstood.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.520]   And yet we remember that the story of these people is this, that they found themselves
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:24.640]   eventually conquered by an enemy with their great city of God, the city of Jerusalem,
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:31.840]   reduced to a mass of rubble and of ruins, their great temple flattened to the ground.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.960]   And they themselves carried away as slaves to a foreign land, there having to work for
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.400]   other people. This great and mighty nation that had been perhaps the greatest nation
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.680]   in the world in a sense, there she is humbled and debased and disgraced.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.000]   Now, that is the story. And the great question that arises is, well, how did that ever happen
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.240]   to them? How did such a thing ever come to pass? What we have in this paragraph, in this
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:09.320]   chapter, is an answer to that question. And I say that we are interested in it, not because
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.880]   we are animated by some sort of antiquarian interest in the history of the children of
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:20.080]   Israel. I am calling your attention to it and adverting to it, because I say God is
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:27.160]   speaking to us here, to everybody in this meeting at this moment who is down, who is
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:34.520]   miserable, who is defeated, who is unhappy. God is speaking to the whole world of men,
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:43.400]   with the world as it is in its present position and predicament. It is the same message precisely.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.200]   I say, therefore, the great question that arises is, what is the matter? Why did the
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:56.040]   children of Israel go wrong? Why did things go wrong with them? Why is it that things
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:02.080]   have gone wrong with all of us? Why are things so patently and obviously wrong in the world
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:09.440]   this evening? Well, now, the answer in general is this. It is all due to what the Bible calls
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:20.600]   sin, this devastating thing that has entered in, this thing that produces the kind of story
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.080]   that you have in the case of the children of Israel.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.360]   You see, I put that question to you. With a nation like this, which had been offered
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.880]   and promised so much and which had received so much, how did it ever become possible for
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:41.280]   them to land there in captivity and to be slaves? Well, there is only one answer. That
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:50.160]   is exactly the effect that sin produces upon the human race. It is the most devastating
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:56.680]   thing conceivable. What does it do to men? Well, in that previous verse, the ninth verse,
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:02.800]   we saw last Sunday night, one of the things it does. It has the most terrible effect upon
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:09.360]   our hearts. And there, you remember, we mean by the heart not merely the seat of the emotions,
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:16.800]   but we mean the center of men's personality. We saw that the real problem with men is that
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:25.920]   he has got inside him a deceitful nature. The heart is deceitful above all things. There
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.320]   are many things that are twisted and perverted in this world, but there is nothing which
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:37.360]   is as twisted and perverted as the human heart, as man's nature, as the result of sin. But
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:44.320]   it is not only deceitful, it is desperately wicked. And it is so wicked and so deceitful
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.200]   that rarely man himself can never do anything about it, because the whole time he is trying
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:58.400]   to, he is still being deceived. That is one of the things that sin does to mankind. It
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:06.840]   has introduced this awful principle of contradiction and deceitfulness and wickedness, which is
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:17.560]   entirely beyond man's own understanding. But alas, it does not stop at that. Sin does
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:23.560]   something else to man. And you know, this next thing is even more important and more
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:30.760]   serious than the first thing, because that first thing, in a sense, leads to this second
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:39.720]   one. And this second one is, of all things, the most devastating of all. What does it
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:48.600]   do? Well, we are given the answer in this tenth verse that we are going to look at tonight.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:56.880]   Sin darkens our minds, it darkens our understanding about the most vital thing of all in this
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:08.800]   life and in this world, which is our knowledge of God. Now, sin is almost endless in its
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:16.440]   effects upon men. And perhaps it is foolish to compare them and to contrast them and to
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:21.560]   try to say that one is worse than others. But surely, we are entitled to say this, we
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:31.400]   must say this, that of all the things that sin has done to men, the most serious of all
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:43.200]   is that it has cut him off from God. Sin leads to this awful twisting and perverting, this
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:50.240]   hatefulness, this terrible wickedness that we saw last Sunday. Yes, sin leads to lust,
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:57.080]   it leads to passion, it leads to envy, it leads to everything that makes life ugly and
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:03.880]   foul and unpleasant. All the horrors that can be seen in this world tonight, sin is
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:12.520]   the thing that leads to them all. It leads, therefore, to terrible misery. It leads to
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:21.080]   a sense of frustration and futility. It leads to every form of unhappiness. And of course,
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.560]   we are all concerned about those things. And there is nothing wrong in our being concerned
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:33.860]   about all those things, on condition that we realize that something is altogether much
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:39.480]   more important than all those things. Now take it like this. Go back to the beginning
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:44.720]   of the human race. Go back to the story as it is given there in the early chapters of
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:51.440]   Genesis. Now there, there you have got it all. There is man made and created in the
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:58.360]   image of God, in the likeness of God. He was in paradise. Well, that is marvelous. You
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:04.240]   see, he just had to eat the fruit. He did not have to work, he just gathered the fruit.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:10.080]   It was a wonderful life. Ah yes, but the greatest thing of all about the life in paradise was
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.000]   not simply that men did not have to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow. That is good,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:23.200]   but here is the best thing of all. He was in fellowship and communion with God. God
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:30.200]   came down into the garden and he spoke to men. God came down and had converse with men.
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:36.560]   Man was God's companion. He walked with God, he talked with God, he lived with God,
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:42.480]   he was in the condition of intimacy with God. The Lord God came down and spoke and men spoke.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.680]   He was face to face with God and in correspondence with God.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:52.160]   Then in comes sin. Well, we know all about its devastating effects. We know that how
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:58.680]   men was turned out. We know how thorns and briars began to grow and men began that fight
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:04.640]   against thorns and briars, which is still waging. Weeds and all these things began to
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:11.080]   emerge. Nature became red in tooth and claw. Diseases and pestilences came in. Murder came
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:19.640]   in and all the rest of it. All came in and it is terrible. But that is not the greatest
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:26.800]   tragedy. The most terrible thing that happened to men as a result of that sin and that fall
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:36.760]   was that he lost his contact with God. He became a stranger to God. The apostle Paul
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.680]   describes the condition in the epistle to the Ephesians in the second chapter in this
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:51.200]   way, "Without God in the world, the highest thing of all, he lost. He became estranged
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.840]   from God." And that is something that has continued ever since.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.000]   Now then, the prophet Jeremiah concentrates on that in this verse that we are looking
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:08.080]   at together tonight. And I want to call your attention to this and God grant that I may
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:13.280]   have strength and power to do so. My friends, I am going to speak to you tonight about something
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:24.200]   that you will remember in eternity. Does that sound like bursting? I do not care who is
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:30.280]   speaking anywhere in the world tonight, whoever he is, however great, however gifted, intellectually
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:38.160]   or oratorically. There is no one speaking on a more vital subject than this tonight.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:47.160]   This is, of all questions, the greatest and the most important. What is the matter with
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:57.120]   men? Well, here is the answer. Men's central trouble is his failure to realize the truth
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:07.720]   about God and about his relationship to God. That is where this deceitfulness of sin comes
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:13.960]   in, you see. Man deceives himself, he deceives others, yes, and he is deceived about God.
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:22.760]   "I the Lord?" But man forgets the Lord. That was the whole trouble with the children
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:28.800]   of Israel. If the children of Israel had not forgotten the Lord God Almighty, they would
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:36.000]   never have found themselves in the captivity of Babylon. Never. There is only one explanation
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:45.880]   of all the calamities that overwhelmed them, and it is that they forgot the Lord. And there
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:50.720]   is no question that the central trouble in the world this evening just comes to that
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:15:05.040]   and to that alone. Mankind forgets God. It is something of which we are all guilty. It
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:10.760]   is almost inconceivable, isn't it, when you look on objectively, but it is a fact,
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:22.320]   isn't it? You and I have actually been guilty and are still guilty of forgetting God. Hours
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.040]   can pass and we do not think of him. Weeks can pass, perhaps, and we do not think of
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:35.920]   him at all. Months, years, and God is not thought of at all. He is not in all our thinking.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.320]   There are those indeed who go so far as to try to say there is no God. They try to explain
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:45.080]   him away. They were to be heard, you know, centuries ago. The psalmist says, "The fool
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.960]   hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'" There is nothing modern in saying there is
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:55.200]   no God. The fool was saying that before the Lord Jesus Christ ever came into this world.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:00.800]   That is about the oldest and the stalest news you can ever give. "The fool hath said in
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:13.360]   his heart, 'There is no God.'" They try to explain everything apart from God. They
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:20.320]   try to explain things in terms of nature. They will even deify force in order to try
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:28.160]   to get rid of God. You see how pathetic sin makes us. Men spell force today with a capital
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:33.880]   F. They spell energy with a capital E. They do not believe in God, but they will deify
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:43.200]   force and energy. Anything to get rid of God.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:49.760]   Now I say that that was the central tragedy of the children of Israel. Look at these foolish
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:58.640]   people ready to worship the gods of the nations with whom they came in contact. Look at these
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:05.280]   people of all people, making gods out of wood and stone and precious metals and bowing down
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:11.880]   and worshipping. These people. Why do I say these people? Well, for this reason. If ever
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:19.520]   there were people who had no excuse for not believing in God, it was the children of Israel.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:25.280]   Their whole story is a proof of the being of God. As I have reminded you, they had come
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:30.760]   into being because of the action of God. You cannot explain their origin. You cannot explain
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:36.000]   their history in any other way whatsoever. They have been made and produced and sustained
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   by God. They are a miracle nation made out of that one man, Abram. Go back and read their
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.320]   story. You remember how they went down to Egypt because of the famine. There they became
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:54.160]   slaves in Egypt. There they would have been destroyed if it were not that God had intervened
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:01.200]   on their behalf and had manifested his power and his glory on their behalf. God the Lord
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:07.280]   had revealed himself on their behalf and in their presence. Think of the ten plagues that
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:15.080]   were enacted before their very eyes. That is a part of their story.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:24.800]   And then the crossing of the Red Sea. The pillar, the cloud, and the fire. The way they
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.360]   destroyed their enemies who were much mightier than they were. Why, well, the Lord was with
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:35.840]   them. The way they crossed the Jordan, the way Jericho was conquered, simply by marching
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:41.160]   round it and blowing trumpet blasts down all the walls. That is the God they are concerned
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:46.000]   with. That is the God who has made them and who has led them and sustained them. And yet
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:56.960]   the foolish people have forgotten him. They have forgotten God. That is one of the things
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:03.600]   that sin does to us. Oh yes, you see, the author of that fiftieth
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:12.400]   psalm, he has got the same idea, hasn't he? God addresses the people through that man
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:17.080]   in exactly the same way as he addresses the children of Israel at this point through the
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:23.360]   prophet Jeremiah. What have people forgotten? Well, they have forgotten the Lord. They have
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:30.120]   forgotten God. And we are all of us without any excuse at all. Look at his marks, look
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:34.960]   at his fingerprints, look at these flowers in front of me at this moment. Can you explain
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:40.880]   those without God? Look at the sunshine, look at the seasons, look at the order, the arrangement,
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:46.320]   the design. Oh, can't you see him there? God hath not left himself without witnesses,
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:54.120]   the apostle Paul. The seasons proclaim him. The whole of creation proclaims God. The heavens
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:59.560]   declare the glory of God. The sun coming out like a bridegroom out of his chamber this
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:09.960]   morning was proclaiming God. The heavens declare the glory of God.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:22.440]   The Lord. Don't you hear him in the thunder? Don't you see him in the lightning? Can't
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:30.680]   you see his effect and his influence in the hurricane and in the storm? God, the maker
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:41.800]   and the controller of the ends of the earth, the Almighty who is over all, the Lord? And
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:48.360]   yet you and I, because of sin and its terrible effect upon us, can live days and weeks and
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:54.800]   months and years, as I have said, in this world and not even give him a thought. Do
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:59.840]   you know that this Almighty being is in the heavens at this moment and looking down upon
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:05.840]   us, the children of men? Isn't it almost inconceivable that we are not aware of it
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:10.560]   and that we are not constantly living in the light of such knowledge? It is a fact, my
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:15.480]   friends. The whole world proclaims it. The Lord Jesus Christ came to proclaim it. The
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:22.840]   Bible proclaims it. This is the message. God over all, the maker and the creator, the sustainer
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:29.440]   and the artificer of everything, the Lord God Almighty, everlasting and eternal in all
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:38.920]   his attributes and in his eternal power, the Lord.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:46.520]   But man forgets the Lord. Ah yes, he not only forgets the fact of the Lord and the being
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:52.280]   and the greatness of the Lord, he forgets a second thing. He forgets that God is his
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:22:02.880]   judge and that he will have to appear before him. My dear friends, you don't think that
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:11.840]   I'm fool enough to choose a text like this, do you? I can't imagine a man choosing a text
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:20.160]   like this just to please himself. I haven't chosen this text. I haven't written this.
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:25.440]   It isn't what I think. I'm expounding this paragraph and I've got to be honest. Here
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:31.720]   it is in front of me. I'm told, "I, the Lord, search the heart. I try the reins, even
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:42.780]   to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings."
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:51.500]   But man forgets that God is the judge, the judge eternal, and that every one of us will
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:23:00.020]   have to appear before him. We forget it in practice, don't we? We ignore it. Do you
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:05.740]   know if only every man and woman in this world lived every second of every minute of every
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:12.420]   hour of every day in the conscious realization of the fact that we must all stand before
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:23.740]   God, the world would become paradise again. There's no question about it. But men don't
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:29.660]   realize this. Indeed, even when they're told it and when they're reminded of it,
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:38.340]   they won't believe it. The idea of judgment is not popular. It's hated. It's always
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:45.180]   been hated, of course. They try to argue today in terms of philosophy and in terms of God's
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:50.420]   love that this whole conception of God as a righteous judge is something which is a
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:57.100]   contradiction of God's love and of God's mercy and of God's compassion. They take
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:03.540]   it out of the Bible. They say it isn't true. They say it's inconceivable that an almighty
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:08.300]   person could possibly do such a thing. You're familiar with the argument, aren't you?
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.380]   Men today do not believe in God as judge. They don't believe in the wrath of God.
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:20.900]   Well, what is my reply to them? Well, the only reply I've got to make is this, that
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:29.940]   I know nothing about God except what I find in this book. And I'll go further. Nobody
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:37.980]   else knows anything about God either except what is found in this book. Because a man
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:44.380]   by searching cannot find out God, he can try to, and they have tried to. I've been dealing
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.260]   with that the last two Sunday mornings in going through the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:56.900]   The apostle Paul puts it in one phrase, "The world by wisdom knew not God." The greatest
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:01.900]   minds, the greatest philosophers have been trying to arrive at God and at a knowledge
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:07.660]   of God, and they admit honestly they can't get there. We know nothing about God except
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:12.940]   what God has revealed concerning Himself, and it's in this book. And what do I find?
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:25.140]   Well, I find this as clear as I find anything else, that God is the judge eternal. You had
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:31.500]   it there in that fiftieth psalm which I read at the beginning. You've got it in the account
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:38.380]   of the flood. You've got it constantly running through your Old Testament. It's in the
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:44.180]   Ten Commandments. It's everywhere. The law is an announcement of judgment. God says,
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:48.700]   "I'm going to judge by this standard." That's why He gave it. He revealed His holy
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:55.740]   nature. "Ah, yes, but you say, 'Oh, that's Old Testament,' and I no longer believe
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:00.820]   in the Old Testament. I'm a New Testament man." Well, very well, be careful what you're
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:04.700]   saying. If you want to say you're a Christian and that you only take the words of Christ,
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:12.500]   be careful. He believed the Old Testament, every bit of it. He talks about Moses and
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:19.300]   the prophets, and He exhorts people to listen to them. But listen to His own words directly,
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:24.820]   and what you find? Well, you find that He taught the judgment of God as clearly and
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:33.300]   as explicitly as anybody else. His forerunner, John the Baptist, appeared before the people,
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:41.260]   and this was his message, "Flee from the wrath to come." Certain Pharisees and doctors
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:44.620]   of the law came to him, and John looked at them and said, "Who hath warned you to flee
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:55.660]   from the wrath to come?" And the Lord Jesus Christ taught exactly the same thing. My dear
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:27:01.500]   friends, it's the Son of God, the incarnation of love, who has spoken the three parables
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:06.420]   that you find in the twenty-fifth chapter of Matthew's Gospel. The five wise virgins
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:11.260]   and the five foolish virgins, the parable of the talents, the parable of that final
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:16.700]   judgment of the nations, it's their His words. It's He who has pronounced woes upon
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:23.180]   the Pharisees. This is not man, it's the Son of God. He preaches that men should flee
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:34.220]   from the wrath to come and to save themselves from this untoward generation. Indeed, He
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:41.940]   is proclaiming judgment when He says that He has come to seek and to save that which
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:50.180]   is lost. It's because of judgment He has come, so He preaches it negatively and positively.
[00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:55.140]   And you find exactly the same thing as you go on in your New Testament, what has Peter
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:01.220]   preached on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem. It's the same message. Save yourselves from
[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:06.940]   this untoward generation. Listen to the apostle Paul, "God hath appointed a day in which
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:12.380]   He shall judge the whole world in righteousness by that man whom He hath appointed, whereof
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:18.220]   He hath given notice in that He hath raised him from the dead." You glory in the resurrection,
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:23.300]   do you? Well, this is what the resurrection announces, that Christ is going to judge the
[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:34.100]   whole world in righteousness. It's God giving preliminary notice of this. Read the apostle
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:41.140]   Paul's first epistle to the Thessalonians in the first chapter and the ninth verse.
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:46.140]   And he says that the news about these Thessalonian converts had gone everywhere, how they had
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:53.940]   turned to God from idols to serve the living and the true God, and to await for a Son from
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:29:07.460]   heaven, even Jesus, who saved us from the wrath to come. My dear friend, I wouldn't
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:14.060]   invent such a doctrine. It alarms me. It's such a tremendous statement. But here it is.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:25.020]   It is appointed unto men once to die and after death. The judgment. That's what makes preaching
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:28.980]   such a solemn and such a terrible thing, and that's why I can never understand laughter
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:35.580]   and joking in a preaching service. We are, every one of us, moving on every moment and
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:42.980]   second we are alive in this world in the direction of that judgment of standing before this holy
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:55.900]   God. "I, the Lord, search the heart, I try the reins." Mankind forgets that. And then
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:04.740]   the last thing that it forgets is this. It forgets, or if you prefer it, it doesn't
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:15.740]   realize that it cannot deceive God. The human heart is desperately wicked and the human
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:21.780]   heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked. Yes, so much so that as we look at
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:34.140]   it we say, "Who can know it?" I think I demonstrated to you last Sunday night that
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:43.420]   no man knows anybody else and that no man knows himself. It's idle to tell me with
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:49.620]   the philosophers, "Know thyself." I cannot know myself. I'm much too fond of myself
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:57.940]   to know myself, and so are you. You can't know yourself as long as you're shielding
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:02.900]   yourself, as long as you're defending yourself, as long as there's a power within you that
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:07.980]   is always doing it and rationalizing your sins. You can't know yourself. Who can know
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:21.420]   it? Nobody. But there is one who does know it. "I, the Lord, search the heart, I try
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:30.660]   the reins." He is not deceived and he cannot be deceived, but man doesn't realize that.
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:35.820]   Did you notice that extraordinary expression used in the 50th Psalm in the 21st verse?
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:40.460]   "You've done these things," says the psalmist to these sinners, "You've done
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:52.300]   these things," says God. "And I was silent. Thou thoughtest that I was altogether
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:32:00.260]   such an one as thyself." "Ah," said the sinner, "this is good." "I'd been
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:04.900]   taught to believe when I was a child," says the sinner, "that God was almighty and
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:10.460]   eternal and that God was the judge and that God would punish sin. I was told that in Sunday
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:14.860]   school when I was a boy and I believed it, of course, I didn't know any better then.
[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:23.220]   But you know," says this man, "I began to grow up. And one day I decided I'd do
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:29.180]   something that I'd always been told I mustn't do, that God would punish me if I did it.
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:34.580]   But I did it. I liked it, I wanted to do it, and I did it. And you know," he said,
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:41.780]   "nothing at all happened. Nothing at all happened. So much for your God. There is no
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:48.700]   God. Can't be. It's a denial and a contradiction. Thou didst this thing and I was silent. And
[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:59.980]   thou thoughtest that I was just such another altogether as thyself." So men think that
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:06.580]   as he deceives others and as he deceives himself that he can deceive God. Now I'm not romancing,
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:12.940]   alas, I wish I were. But I'm not romancing. I've thought many a time that I could fool
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:18.740]   God. And you've thought so and the world is thinking so tonight. How do we do it? Well,
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:27.780]   we do it like this, don't we? We rather persuade ourselves that after all God doesn't see everything.
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:33.420]   We thought at first that he did, but now we discover that he doesn't. That's one way
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:38.780]   in which we do it. Another way is this, we think that God will be perfectly satisfied
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:46.300]   as long as we pay lip service to him. Now I suppose that of all their errors, that was
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:52.180]   the greatest error of the children of Israel. Again, it's exposed by Jeremiah, it was exposed
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:34:01.180]   in that 50th Psalm. They did it like this. They'd been guilty of sin and they paid no
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:05.340]   attention to it. Then something went wrong. Perhaps there was somebody taken ill in the
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:09.340]   family or there was a war or something like that and then they began to feel a little
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:14.060]   bit unhappy. Their conscience began to work. And they said, "Well now of course, yes,
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:17.580]   we did sin. We sinned against God. What shall we do about it?" "Ah," they said, "it's
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:21.940]   all right. We'll take God a burnt offering. We'll take God a bullock or we'll take a
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:27.780]   bird as a burnt offering and a sacrifice and there we'll offer it and God will be perfectly
[00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:37.620]   satisfied. Everything's all right." You remember the reply to that, don't you? "I'm not
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:45.460]   interested in your bulls," says God. "The whole world is mine and the cattle on a thousand
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:51.180]   hills. If I were hungry I wouldn't ask you and I wouldn't eat anything that you bring
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:35:00.660]   to me in that way, thinking you can buy me off." The children of Israel had persuaded
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:06.980]   themselves that they were fooling God with their burnt offerings and sacrifices. But
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:12.620]   God said back to them, "This people honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:18.260]   from me." Ah yes, you know, we're still doing it, aren't we? Yes, we think if we give a
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:24.340]   subscription to a good cause that God is somehow placated. We think that if we do a little
[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:29.260]   bit of good here and there that it compensates for the evil that we've done. We balance it
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:33.980]   up, don't we? Profit and loss account. And how expert we all are at it. We're all guilty
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:37.780]   of this. We are balancing. We hide that thing. "Oh, that doesn't matter. Look at the good
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:42.100]   I'm doing. This thing is kept silent. I'm doing good work and the whole time there's
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:45.820]   something wrong in my heart." Ah, but I say, "All this is going to compensate." And we
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:53.420]   think that because we are not looking at it that God doesn't see it. But another psalmist
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:59.020]   has answered again in the 68th Psalm, "If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:05.180]   not hear me." You can go to God in prayer and you can pray most eloquently, but if you're
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:09.380]   harboring a sin or something you're not prepared to give up, you might as well stand up and
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:16.620]   go for a walk. Your prayer is useless. "If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:28.180]   not hear me." He's not deceived. Be not deceived. God is not mocked.
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:37.780]   We sometimes think again that as long as we tell God we are sorry, that he'll be satisfied.
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:43.060]   We put remorse in the place of repentance and we think that it works with God. Don't
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:51.500]   we? You know the difference, don't you? Remorse is simply a man suffering from the consequences
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:58.500]   of his sin and anxious to be delivered from the consequences. He rarely hasn't faced
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:04.500]   the sin. The man who's suffering remorse is a man who said, "Well, what a fool I was.
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.860]   Why am I suffering? Well, because I did that. I shouldn't have done it. I was a fool."
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:13.860]   But he rarely doesn't hate the sin. He hates the consequences of the sin. If I may so put
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:19.140]   it, he hates the headache that follows the debauchery and the drunkenness and the vileness
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:23.860]   because he's ill the next day. He dislikes that. He doesn't like the sin. If he could
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:32.460]   only have the sin without the consequences, he'd be perfectly happy. That's remorse.
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:38.540]   And therefore, merely to say that we are sorry is not enough. Repentance is what God demands.
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:43.060]   And he'll be satisfied with nothing less. And again, we think sometimes that our good
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:48.140]   intentions and our good professions and our good protestations are enough, but they're
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:56.760]   not, my friend. I remember an old man putting me right on this point once in the very early
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:05.740]   days of my ministry. Forgive me for referring to it. We were talking together about a poor
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:14.700]   fellow who had become an utter absolute slave to drink. And I had been delighted that this
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:21.940]   man was attending the services in the chapel where I preached. And I was still more delighted
[00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:29.900]   when I observed this man weeping during the sermon. And I told this older man, "You
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:35.540]   know," I said, "I think that man's going to be converted." Every Sunday night I see
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:43.820]   tears streaming down his face. My dear friend said, "The old experienced man to me, I
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:49.860]   don't want to discourage you. God forbid that I should." "But don't assume," he
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:55.660]   said, "that because that man weeps that he's there for repenting." He said, "You
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:39:01.500]   will learn, you will discover that men sometimes think that weeping, some way or another, does
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:06.700]   duty for repentance." He said, "That man is probably saying to himself, 'I've
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:12.860]   sunk, I've gone very low, but I've not yet gone beyond feeling. I can still weep
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:17.780]   because of my sin.'" And he was comforting himself by weeping because of his sin, but
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:25.900]   he still kept on with his sin. And in that particular case, alas, the old man was perfectly
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:35.940]   right. The poor fellow went to a drunkard's grave. Ah, it's true of all of us, we'll
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:41.460]   put our good intentions, our good emotions, our good reactions. We think we deceive God
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:49.660]   with these things. But oh, the folly of it all. Well, I mustn't keep you. What does
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:54.260]   man need to know? Well, he just needs to know the things that are mentioned here. God, my
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:40:04.740]   dear friend, knows all about us. "I search the heart, I try the reins, neither is there
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:12.780]   anything, any creature that is not manifest in his sight. But all things are naked and
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:25.100]   opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do." This eternal, everlasting God,
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:31.140]   the Lord, who made the world out of nothing, who said, "Let there be light," and there
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:38.620]   was light. He is everywhere, He is omniscient, He is omnipresent, He is eternal, and everything
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:45.020]   that you and I have ever done or said or thought are all known to Him and open before Him.
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:50.180]   He's got books, He keeps them in the books of His remembrance. Go to the twentieth chapter
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:55.300]   of Revelations, if you like, and there you'll see it symbolically. The great day of judgment
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:41:00.540]   has arrived, and the books are brought forward, and the books are opened, and all you have
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:05.940]   done and I've done, and all I've said and thought and imagined, they're all there,
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:18.060]   every one of them. And we are going on to face these things. That's the message of
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:27.260]   the Bible, not my message. "All things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:33.660]   whom we have to do." My dear friend, God knows everything. "Whither shall I flee
[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:38.740]   from his presence?" You cannot. Take the wings of the morning and go to heaven. Go
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:44.460]   down into the depths, make your seat in hell. You can't get away from him. He's everywhere
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:52.900]   and encompasses everything, and He knows all. And it's the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:42:01.940]   of God, who says that every man shall have to give an account of every idle word that
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:09.220]   he's spoken. Not only are deliberate statements and actions, every idle word, every joke,
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:17.980]   every unworthy thought, all of them, they'll all face you. It's the Son of God who said
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:23.460]   that. Yes, the other thing we need to know is this,
[00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:29.700]   that we shall all be judged according to what we actually are in our hearts, and not what
[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:36.780]   we appear amongst men to be. "I search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every
[00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:42.860]   man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings." Did you notice
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.340]   how it was put there again in that fourth chapter of Hebrews? "The word of God is quick
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:53.880]   and powerful, and like a two-edged sword that is able to divide, even to the separating
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:59.500]   of the soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow." And listen, "and is a discerner
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:08.420]   of the thoughts and intents of the heart." Your intentions, your desires, God sees them
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:13.740]   all and He'll judge you by the state of your heart. This thing that you can't discern,
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:20.260]   He does discern. And if you want to know what that means, go
[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:26.020]   to the fifth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Matthew, the Sermon on the Mount, and
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:33.460]   Christ puts it like this, "You have heard it has been said by them of old, 'Time thou
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:40.380]   shalt not commit murder.' But I say unto you, that any man who saith of his brother,
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:52.100]   'Who is in danger of hell fire?'" It isn't only the act of committing murder, it's that
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:57.260]   feeling of murder in your heart against another person, that person whom you're jealous of
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:02.820]   or whom you hate. "If only you had murdered him already in your spirit and in your heart,"
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:10.580]   for God knows it and it counts as murder in His presence, says the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:25.940]   "A man stands before God and he says, 'Whatever I am, I've never been guilty of adultery.'"
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:39.460]   The Lord Jesus Christ replies and says, "Whosoever looketh upon or after a woman, the last hath
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:48.860]   already committed adultery with her in his heart." He's a discerner of the thoughts and
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:54.300]   intents of the heart. And it'll be no use just standing up in the day of judgment and
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:58.700]   saying, "I've never done this, I've never done that, I've never done the other." Out
[00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:03.380]   of your own mouth you'll be convicted. The books will be produced. Your thoughts, your
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:09.620]   desires, your intents and intentions, the things you've fondled and played with, the
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:15.220]   hours you've spent in reading these filthy divorce cases in the evening newspaper, because
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:20.260]   you've lusted and have enjoyed it, it'll all be there as evidence. God knows all about
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:32.100]   it. "We shall be judged according to the state of our hearts, not according to our
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:37.460]   words, not according to our pretensions, nor professions, nor the good we've done. God
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:47.540]   looketh upon the heart." And lastly, "We need to know this, that the judgment will
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:56.540]   be an absolutely just one. I search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according
[00:45:56.540 --> 00:46:03.980]   to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings." That's the thing that makes
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:14.140]   it so terrifying and alarming. "We shall not be judged according to opinions, we'll
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:21.860]   be judged according to our own records. We'll be judged according to facts. The judge of
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:28.100]   all the world is righteous and just and holy and true." My dear friend, you'll stand
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:32.580]   there and what'll happen is that your own record will be read out to you. The books
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:37.380]   will be opened and there it'll all come out. All you've done and been and thought
[00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:49.300]   and said and imagined and hoped and desired, it'll all come out, the state of your heart.
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:57.420]   And there'll be no reply. There is no reply. There'll be no defense. The facts will speak
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:03.620]   for themselves. You may say, as we are told people will say, "When didn't I do this,
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:14.620]   that and the other?" And there'll be an absolute immediate reply.
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:28.620]   Talk about it. There's the truth, the simple truth. We are all under God. We shall all
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:42.780]   stand before him. And there is no one who can stand on such an occasion. In and of himself
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:51.420]   we are all undone. There is none righteous, no, not one. We have all sinned and come short
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:48:06.980]   of the glory of God. We are all wretched, vile, foul, sinful. Can't you see, my friend,
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:14.140]   that it is only when you realize the truth like this, that you begin to see why it was
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:25.540]   that the Son of God ever came into this world. We should all be damned but for him. But thank
[00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:41.420]   God he came because of that. He came to deal with that very problem. He came to bear these
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:50.140]   horrible, vile, foul sins of ours and he's borne their punishment. Oh, God is a righteous
[00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:56.540]   judge and God cannot wink at sin. God cannot pretend that he hasn't seen it. The wrath
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:03.860]   of God is revealed already against all sin and all unrighteousness. God being God must
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:19.020]   deal with sin and he has dealt with sin. God forgives those and only those who realize
[00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:27.620]   that they are sinners without any plea, but who realize and believe that the Lord Jesus
[00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:34.300]   Christ has stood in their place and has borne their sins and their punishment in order that
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:42.260]   God might forgive them. They alone are Christians who are thus reconciled to God and who realize
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:49.020]   the need of a new heart and of a new life and of power and of strength. They alone are
[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:53.300]   Christians who have come to the end of themselves, who having seen the truth about themselves
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:58.860]   say, "What can I do? I am helpless. I am hopeless." And then see that it is all in
[00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:05.620]   him and who fly to him and who cling to him and who rely upon him, who forsake their sin,
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:11.900]   who hate their sin and who trust him to hold them and to cleanse them and ultimately to
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:20.620]   present them faultless before the presence of God's glory with exceeding joy.
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:32.020]   My dear friend, what of you? Have you realized that you have got to meet God in judgment,
[00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:39.620]   the God who knows all about you in every thought as well as action? Oh, if you realize it,
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:48.020]   I needn't plead with you, I needn't exhort you. If you realize the awful day, you will
[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:59.860]   fly to Christ and cast yourself at his feet and say to him, even with your last gasp perhaps,
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:15.140]   "Hide me, O my Savior, hide me. Rock of ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in
[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:25.140]   thee. Let the water and the blood from thy riven side which flow be of sin the double
[00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:39.020]   cure. Cleanse me from its guilt and power. Wash me, Savior, ere I die." And if you
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:46.020]   do that, it is my privilege to tell you he will not refuse you. Be as black as hell,
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:52.020]   it doesn't matter. If you feel your need of him, he will receive you and you will know
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:52:01.140]   you are pardoned and reconciled and restored and forgiven and renewed. And relying upon
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:09.580]   the strength which the strong Son of God alone can supply, you will be increasingly delivered
[00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:21.460]   from the fraud and of sin and Satan. Make no delay. The day, the day of judgment is
[00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:31.780]   coming. Flee for safety and become eternally safe. Amen.
[00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:35.860]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
