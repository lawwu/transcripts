[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840]   A really good parenting question in the inbox today.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.840]   How do we raise kids who are not naive and not cynical?
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.880]   It's a question from a dad, a listener to the podcast named Rick in Fort Worth, Texas.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.400]   Hello Pastor John.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.440]   Matthew 10 16 says we are to be shrewd as snakes and innocent as doves.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.440]   As we raise our children we don't want them to be gullible or naive, yet we also don't
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.640]   want them to be hard-hearted and cynical.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.760]   How then do we shape their perspectives in preparing them for this world?
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.720]   What mistakes and consequences can be the result of this effort?
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:45.560]   Well this is such a good question because it reflects a very mature grasp of one of
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.680]   the main paradoxes of the Christian life.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:55.620]   On the one hand, Jesus is sending us out into the world like sheep amid wolves, and sheep
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.800]   are very vulnerable.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.360]   They're not viewed as belligerent.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.400]   Nobody's afraid of a sheep biting them.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.240]   But on the other hand, we are to be wise and discerning and mature and stable and strong
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.520]   and shrewd and not duped by the winds of false teaching.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.040]   So there it is, the paradox, and he's got it.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.880]   We're to be on the one hand humble and lowly, counting others more significant than ourselves,
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:33.360]   and yet on the other hand, unwavering in our convictions, full of courage, because Proverbs
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.080]   says the righteous are as bold as a lion.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.520]   So Rick, it seems to me, has a pretty good grasp of the challenge in front of us, not
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.040]   only to be this way, but to raise kids who become adults who are this way.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.000]   Now I don't know that I can say anything he wouldn't think of on his own, since he's
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.080]   got such a good handle on this, it seems to me, but I'll try.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.000]   Let me make four suggestions, and I think it will be obvious what sorts of mistakes
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.520]   could arise in the effort to carry out these suggestions.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.720]   We'll see.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:20.600]   Number one, from the earliest age, teach the children from the Bible, day in and day out,
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:31.080]   with specific biblical statements about this paradox of shrewdness like snakes and innocence
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.760]   like doves, and fill out the teachings with stories from the Bible, and then maybe stories
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.360]   from Christian history or biography or from the current day.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.480]   Whenever you see someone in a biography or in history or in missions or in contemporary
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.120]   life, illustrate the paradox, point it out, help the children see the beauty of it and
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.640]   how much you admire it, and they should admire it.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.080]   Let me give a specific example of the kind of teaching I mean when I say pick out specific
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.600]   sentences to illustrate what this paradox looks like.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.000]   I'm really influenced here by what I've been thinking about recently, because we at Desiring
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.040]   God have tried to articulate a core value that gets at this very thing.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.920]   I'll mention the name of it in just a minute.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:32.760]   It says in Ephesians 4.2, "To walk in a manner worthy of our calling as Christians."
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.280]   And then it gives three words, more than three, but I'll just mention the first three.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.680]   Being lowly and meek and long-suffering.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.240]   Those three words.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.520]   So we read that to our children, and then we ask them, "What do you think those three
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.680]   words mean?
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.860]   Let's talk about lowly.
[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.940]   What is lowly?
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.700]   Humble because of our sin and what terrible suffering it took to save us and how dependent
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.040]   we are on God all the time.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:14.360]   Lowly and meek, dove-like, sheep-like, a way of life that fits in with lowliness and long-suffering,
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.760]   not getting angry easily, not returning evil for evil."
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.880]   And then you pause and you press in further with your kids as you work through what those
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.440]   words mean, modeling for the kids how to take words of Scripture seriously.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:38.760]   And you ask, "What is the way of life that Paul calls meek, that's supposed to fit with
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.200]   this lowliness of attitude?"
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.840]   And then you show them.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.160]   I'm thinking of this right now just because in my working through Ephesians in "Look
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.720]   at the Book" on Ephesians 4-2, this is what I did.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.920]   And this was so incredibly fresh to me.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.160]   I'd never seen these three verses together like this.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.000]   So I asked the question to myself, and now I'm asking it to my imaginary kids in front
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   of me.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.680]   What are some illustrations of what meekness looks like?
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.040]   Because we want to get this right here.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.120]   We don't want meekness to look like it isn't.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.040]   And here are the three illustrations.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.840]   Galatians 6-1, "If anyone is caught in a transgression, you who are spiritual should
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:28.160]   restore him in a spirit of meekness, keeping watch over yourself, lest you too be tempted."
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.520]   Now here's the catcher.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.780]   It takes a lot of guts, a lot of courage to confront somebody in a bad behavior.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.540]   It's just so much easier to sweep it under the rug.
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:44.080]   Somebody else is just ignoring it, and you're going to go to him with courage, confront
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.800]   him, but you're going to do it in meekness.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.480]   So meekness is that courageous, lowly way of doing it.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.560]   Here's the second illustration.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.280]   Second Timothy 2-24, "The Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome, but kind to everyone,
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.880]   able to teach, patiently enduring evil."
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.580]   And here comes correcting his opponents with meekness.
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.580]   Now there it is again.
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.720]   The first illustration from Galatians was correct their behavior.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.260]   The second illustration is correct their doctrine.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:21.060]   And that may even require more courage, depending on what kind of person they are.
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.300]   But you're going to get in their face, tell them what you believe about this is not true,
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.600]   but you're going to do it with meekness.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.340]   So meekness is combined in those two instances with courage.
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.780]   Here's the third one.
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:40.100]   First Peter 3-15, "Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, but always be prepared to
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:47.700]   give a reason for the hope that is in you, yet do it with meekness and respect, having
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:54.820]   a good conscience, so that when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:55.820]   may be put to shame."
[00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:01.180]   So meekness stands in front of people who are perhaps gnashing their teeth and ready
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:09.300]   to revile you and slander you and speaks a witness for Jesus, courageously, boldly, and
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.780]   yet with meekness.
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:18.820]   So you step back then with those three illustrations out there for your kids, and you say, "So
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.380]   what is meekness?
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.500]   What is a meek person like?"
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.480]   And the answer is courage, courage, courage, courage, correcting behaviors, correcting
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:37.180]   teachings, bearing witness in front of slanderers, but all of it with a gentle and humble demeanor.
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.060]   Now that's going to be a paradox for them.
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.260]   They're going to wrestle with for the rest of their lives.
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:48.600]   But oh my, to return to it again and again and again in our Bible reading would be wonderful.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:55.740]   And then you might illustrate it from Acts 5, where the apostles have been beaten for
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:03.460]   their witness, and it says in 541, "Then they left the presence of the council rejoicing,
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:09.100]   rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name."
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:17.340]   So meekness is willing to take suffering, and it is so content in God, so confident
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.340]   in God, that it rejoices in the suffering.
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:29.620]   So you teach from specific texts and stories and illustrations about this paradox of courage
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.620]   and meekness.
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:40.740]   And the second thing would be simply to look for sharp, clear, memorable, provocative phrases
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.420]   that can sum up what you're trying to get across.
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:48.000]   Now that's what we've been doing at Desiring God, and we've hit upon two phrases.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.280]   One is called brokenhearted boldness, and the other is contrite courage.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:58.240]   And that's one of our core values now, because we want to try to get at this paradox in a
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:06.800]   very controversial, strident, angry age we live in, and look at what courage looks like.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.420]   What is it supposed to look like when Christians are courageous?
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:16.480]   Are they supposed to be brash and braggart and loud and strident?
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.640]   Or is there another way?
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:24.200]   And so I think finding a phrase that you repeat year after year for your kids, so that when
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.600]   they leave home 20 years from now, they'll remember, "Well, there was something called
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.000]   brokenhearted boldness.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.600]   There was something called contrite courage that my dad believed in, and I'd like to discover
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.600]   it again."
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:43.080]   And the third thing I would suggest is be a model for your children in this.
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.440]   Be bold, be humble, be courageous, be contrite.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.360]   Over time, they're going to see this.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:54.680]   And one special form of modeling that I think is really important in this media-saturated
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.560]   time where you're looking at the news, you're looking at videos, you're looking at YouTube,
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.760]   you're looking at all kinds of things, and you see stuff you can't stand.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.060]   It really bothers you.
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.320]   It's so harmful.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.240]   It's so unbiblical.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.520]   And the kids know that you feel that way about it, and they're watching.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:15.080]   Now, how's dad, how's mom going to respond to these things they so strongly disagree
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.080]   with?
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.640]   Well, you want to model for them by saying, "Now, this is wrong.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.160]   This is hurtful.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.320]   This dishonors God."
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.640]   But you want to show them how do you love your enemy at that moment.
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:35.840]   And you might pause at that very moment, turn off the news and pray.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:42.500]   Pray for the person who you just criticized because of how destructive their view was.
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.500]   And the kids will learn.
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:51.520]   You can be a sharp, careful, incisive critic of the culture, and yet you might love it
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:56.860]   and care for it and pray for it as you ought.
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.640]   And the last thing I would say is don't be joyless.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.000]   Be full of joy.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.160]   I look back on my parents' effort to give me strong convictions in the midst of worldliness
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:15.000]   that they thought was encroaching on every side, even back in the '50s and '60s.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:24.040]   And I think the key that won me over so that I embrace their faith today, the key was that
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:30.760]   they were both not only Bible-saturated with high moral standards, but they were the happiest
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.480]   people I think I've ever known.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:39.880]   I took it for granted growing up, but now I look back on some of the things they went
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:46.400]   through in their marriage and in finances and in culture and in disputes, and I marvel
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.460]   that they were as happy as they were.
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:56.520]   So joy in the Lord in the midst of hardship is a great evidence to the children that Christ
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.960]   is real.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:03.200]   It doesn't guarantee that they will embrace the truth and the beauty of Christ, but it
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.760]   is a powerful attraction.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.760]   Yeah, amen.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.480]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the excellent parenting question, Rick, in

[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.480]   Well I believe on Monday when we return, we're going to talk about our past sins and our
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.480]   past regrets.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:41.440]   Specifically, when looking at Romans 8:28, does Paul mean to say that even my past sins,
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.920]   too, are working together for my future good?
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.520]   Really, really important question.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.520]   Oh man.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.920]   Do our past sinful regrets work together for our future good?
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.360]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.360]   We'll see you after the weekend.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.360]   Thanks for watching.
