[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in the book of the Prophet Jeremiah in the second chapter verses 10, 11 and 12.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Verses 10, 11 and 12 in the second chapter of the book of the Prophet Jeremiah.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   "For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see, and send unto Kedah, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? But my people have changed their glory unto that which doth not profit.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid. Be ye very desolate, saith the Lord."
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   "Pass over the isles of Chittim, and see, and send unto Kedah, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? But my people have changed their glory unto that which doth not profit.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid. Be ye very desolate, saith the Lord."
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Now, my friends, we are met together on what has come to be known as Remembrance Sunday.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   We are met together on the evening of Remembrance Sunday.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And surely the question that is uppermost, and certainly should be uppermost, in the minds of all thoughtful people on a day like this, is this.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   What is the matter with man? What is wrong with the world? Why are things as they are?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Now I say that we can surely all take it as being agreed amongst us that that is the one big question that should be occupying our attention.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   We don't meet together like this because we've got nothing better to do, because there are not a thousand and one other things offering themselves to us.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   We don't come together just to turn our backs upon the problems, and to sing hymns, and to spend a certain amount of time together.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   We come because we are concerned about this great question of life and living, because we are concerned about the state of the whole world.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And that, I say, must be the question. In this enlightened, sophisticated age, in this twentieth century, from which so much was expected,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   and of which the poets of the last century vied with one another in prophesying its glories, why has it turned out to be such a devastating century?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Why are we met together thus on a day like this to think of two world wars already in this one century?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   And we look and see the nations and their rulers talking about possible war, considering what can be done to avoid it,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   and yet building up armaments which tend to make it possible and even likely.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Now that's the question. What's it all about? What's the cause of it?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Now that, I say, is the most relevant question that can be asked, and especially in a service such as this.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   There are many people who seem to think that Christianity is what they call "sob stuff."
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   We are familiar with a jibe that describes it as the "opiate of the people."
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   There are those who think that to come to a place of worship like this and to spend our time in this way and manner is nothing but a form of escapism.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   I trust before I am through and before we are finished tonight that we shall see the utter folly of such a view.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   I am here indeed to suggest and to put it to you that the only way in which the great problem confronting the human race at this moment can really be faced
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   is the way in which we are doing on this occasion, and which we do Sunday by Sunday.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Very well, I say, there's our question. What's the matter with the world? What's wrong with men? Why are things as they are?
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Now, my first comment is that there's nothing new about this question. It's a very old question.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   It's a question that men have asked many and many a time throughout the running centuries.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Part of our tragedy is that we don't seem to realize that, and that we will persist in thinking that there's something unique about us
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   because we are alive in the twentieth century, but there isn't.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Our big question, our big problem, is the problem that's been confronting the human race right away through all recorded history.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And, of course, over and above that, it is the great question that is posed everywhere in this book which we call the Bible.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   That's what the Bible is really about. The Bible is the textbook of life.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   It's the manual of the soul. It is the real history, the story of man in this world under God.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   The real business of the Bible is to deal with this question that is so urgently in the minds of men and women today.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And according to the Bible, there is only one answer to the question as to why the world is as it is and as to what is wrong with men.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   And it is the answer that is given in this second chapter of the book of the prophet Jeremiah.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Now, those of us who meet here regularly have been considering this chapter already.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   This is, if I remember rightly, the seventh occasion on which we are looking at it.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   It is the first address that was delivered by this prophet Jeremiah to his own fellow countrymen and women
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   at a time of great crisis, serious trouble in their long and checkered history.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   The children of Israel were very much as we are tonight. Everything seemed to be going wrong.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   There was a terrible threat of a great war, a mighty enemy. The Chaldeans were arising and ready to attack them.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Now, it is in that kind of situation that the prophet Jeremiah addressed the nation.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   And he has only one thing to say. He keeps on saying it throughout this long book of his.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   It is the same message as Isaiah had. It is the same message as all these prophets had.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   There is only one message in the Bible, and it is to say this, that the world is as it is, men is as he is,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   because he has rebelled against God, because he has fallen from God, because he has lost the favor of God.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   That is the answer. But, as I have been indicating, that is worked out.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   It is not merely made as a general statement. It is broken up into its component parts.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   It is reasoned. It is argued out. We were looking at that last Sunday night where God said through the prophet,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   "I will yet plead with you, saith the Lord, and with your children's children will I plead."
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   That means that God was prepared to reason it out with them.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   As a barrister pleads his case, so God was prepared to reason with the people and to plead with them.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   But, of course, what we have been seeing is this, that they and their recalcitrance were quite impervious to all these messages,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   all these arguments, all these appeals. They turned their backs on God without a cause.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   They despised his great deliverance of them from the bondage and the captivity of Egypt.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   They thought nothing of the land into which he had brought them, yea, they despised the pleasant land.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   They saw nothing in this great salvation that God had given them.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And here it is, you see, they, the people, and their priests, and their princes, and their prophets have all turned away from God.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   They are following other gods, Baal, and other gods of their own imagination and of their own creation.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Now the question that we have to ask is this, "What is it in men that makes him do this?"
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   And I gave one answer to that question last Sunday night as we found it in that ninth verse.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   It is this thing which the Bible calls sin. That's the trouble with men.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   All that he does, in these different ways, is ultimately to be traced to this terrible thing which is called sin.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   What is sin? Well, we saw last Sunday night that sin is something very deep, it's very profound.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   It isn't something on the surface of men's life, it isn't a mere negation, it isn't the mere absence of knowledge or of understanding.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Oh no, we saw that it is something that's down deep in the warp and woof of men's nature.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   It's something that makes men fail completely to learn the lessons of his own past history.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   I mustn't stay with that tonight. We were looking at that last Sunday, but do let me, on this Remembrance Night,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   when everybody's tending to look back, let me indicate this thing in a hurried word.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Isn't this one of the most amazing things about the human race, that it seems to be incapable of learning the lessons of history?
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Does war ever do any good? Has it ever done any good?
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Well then, why are they still playing with it and toying with it?
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   But you know, mankind never learns that lesson. Mankind never learns the lessons of history.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   And we are reminded of that on a night such as this, in spite of what has happened.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   The nations are still thinking in terms of war and toying with war.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   It doesn't matter, you see, whether our cities have been bombed
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   and many of our glorious buildings razed to the ground in every country, still they haven't learned the lesson.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Now, what's the matter, I say? You've got to face this question.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   What is it in men that makes them behave in this manner?
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Well, the answer is, it is something that is deep down in human nature.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Sin has got into man's heart, into the very vitals of his being.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   But I lead you to a second aspect of this matter this evening, which is this.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   The perverse element in sin. The way in which sin, as it were, twists men and perverts him
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   and makes him do things which are utterly monstrous.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Things which rarely baffle our understanding.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Now, that's the matter that is put before us in these three verses that we are looking at tonight.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Now, you notice the dramatic way in which the Prophet puts his point.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   And that's why I read it twice to you, in order that the dramatic element, he stands back, as it were.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   He looks at the nation and he says, "What can anybody say?"
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Look here, he says, "Let's see if we can find anything like this anywhere.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Let's pass over the Isles of Chittim and see, make an investigation."
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Do they do things like that there? The answer is no.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Well, very well, ascend into Cedar and consider diligently and see if there is such a thing.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   He picks out distant places, you see.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   He's, as it were, saying, "I want to issue a challenge."
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   "Go anywhere you like," he says, "anywhere in the known world
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   and see if you can discover any conduct and action and behavior
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   which is in any way similar to the action of God's own people."
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   He says, "Go and have a look, make an investigation."
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   And then he puts it like this. This is the essence of his charge.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   "Can you find," he says, "any one of these nations that has changed its God?"
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Now, he said, "What makes it still more striking is this, which are yet no gods."
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   "Go around," he says, "have a look at these other nations
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   and you'll find that they're worshipping different gods.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   One is worshipping this god Bel, another is worshipping Ashtoreth,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   and others have got their gods."
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Well, what are these gods? Well, they're non-existent, of course.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   There's no such god as Bel. There never has been a god called Bel.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Men decided that there was a god to whom they gave the name Bel
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   and they bowed down and they worshipped him.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   And others with their other gods. Then some of them made idols.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   They carved a form of a man or of an animal, of a beast,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   or as we read in Romans 1, creeping things.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   And they said, "These are our gods."
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   And they made temples to them and they took their burnt offerings and sacrifices
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   and they bowed their knees before these gods and worshipped them in their temples.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Now, he said, "When you go around and make your investigation, that's what you'll find."
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   But he said, "You'll find another thing, that they don't change their gods.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   They stick to them. They go on worshipping them.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Hath a nation changed their gods?"
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   He says, "No, you'll never find an illustration of that."
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   And this is what Hyten said,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   "They keep on worshipping those gods which are no gods,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   gods of their own imagination, gods of their own creation.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   They remain faithful to them."
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   "But my people have changed their glory into that which doth not profit."
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   But then he goes on and says,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   "Be astonished, O ye heavens, and be horribly afraid.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Yea, be very desolate, saith the Lord."
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   What he's saying, you see, is this.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   He says, "This spectacle is almost incredible."
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   There's something horrible about it.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   "Be horribly afraid, be horrified," he says.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   "Don't you feel that it's something shocking? Stand back aghast."
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   These are possible translations of these words.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Why? Well, he says, "This is such a monstrous spectacle,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   the way that these people have turned from the living God."
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Now then, that's his dramatic way of bringing out
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   this extraordinary element of perversity
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   that is ever one of the chiefest characteristics of sin.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Let me put this to you.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Let's take a look at it for a moment in general.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   It's worth looking at this, you know, in general,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   in a kind of philosophical manner.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   It's an extraordinary phenomenon.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Do you know, my friends, according to the Bible,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   the most extraordinary phenomenon in the world tonight
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   is man himself, man in sin.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   There is no other phenomenon in the whole universe
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   that is comparable to man.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Look at the whole world, look at the whole of creation.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   You will find nothing so foolish in it
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   as man, in sin, rebelling against God.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   How? Well, let me put it like this to you.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Sin is that which makes a fool of men.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Sin is that which turns men into a kind of monstrosity.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   "Be astonished, O ye heavens!"
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   "At this, be horribly afraid!"
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   "Yea, be very desolate, saith the Lord!"
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   At what? Well, at man rebelling against God and sinning.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Man's a spectacle, man's become a fool,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   man's become a monster.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   In what ways? Well, in these ways.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Sin, you see, introduces into men
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   this extraordinary element of contradiction.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Isn't that the thing that's most obvious about men today?
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   What do you make of men?
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Well, if you examine men truly,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   if you follow this line of investigation
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   pressed upon us by the Prophet,
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   you'll be impressed above everything else
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   by this extraordinary paradoxical element in men.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   He's a mass of contradictions.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Look at what I mean.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Look at men on the surface and you'll say,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   "How great is man!"
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   And, of course, there is a real greatness in men.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Look at his wisdom.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Look at his understanding.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Look at his knowledge.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   You can't deny that to men.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   You can't deny that to the 20th century men.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Look at the grand discoveries he's made.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Look at his genius and his brilliance
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   in all these scientific investigations and discoveries.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Look at the phenomenal advances in medicine
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   and in the treatment of human sickness and disease.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Look at the way in which men have been able to explore
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   the distant parts of the world.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   This is genius.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Man is a great being.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   No animal's ever been able to do anything like that.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   An animal just lives according to his instincts.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   He's governed by his desires.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   He's got a kind of mechanical law within him
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   that makes him do what he does.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   But man rises above it all,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   and he has this great brain,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   this great knowledge, this understanding,
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   and he's searched out mysteries,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   and he's able, even in a theoretical manner to think,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   in a most extraordinary way.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   That's all true about men, isn't it?
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Look at the achievements of the human race on the one hand,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   and you've got to stand back in amazement and say,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   "What a piece of work is man.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   "How noble in reason.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   "How infinite in faculty.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   "In form and moving, how express and admirable.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   "In action, how like an angel.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   "In apprehension,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   "how like a god."
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   That's what Shakespeare said about him.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   And if that was true in the Elizabethan era,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   how much more so now.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Man is an amazing creature.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   But oh, alas, I can't leave it at that, can I?
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   That isn't the whole truth about men.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   There's another side to men.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   What's the other side?
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   Well, it's the side that you see in the world round and about you.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Here is man with all this astounding genius and ability,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   but look at his world.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Look at the misery.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Look at the shame.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Look at the sin.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Look at the evil.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Look at the tension.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Look at the wars.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Look at the destruction in the wars.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   This mass destruction.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   Look what he's proposing to do.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Now it's the same, I'm talking about the same person.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   I'm talking about the same individuals.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   I'm talking about this great person
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   that has searched into the depths and into the mysteries.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   There he is, but here he is also.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   He's glorious.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   He's infamous.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   He's wise.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   He's a fool.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   He's above the animals.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   He does things that animals never do.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   He's higher than the animals.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   He's worse than the beasts.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Isn't that the truth about men?
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   You see, as Jeremiah says here, man is a spectacle.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   He's a phenomenon.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   "Be astonished, O ye heavens, and be horrified at this.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Be horribly afraid, and be very desolate, saith the Lord."
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   But that is it.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   That is man as we see him tonight.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   This extraordinary element of contradiction.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   This paradox that is in him.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   And what heightens it is this.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   That sin not only makes men like this a fool and a spectacle
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   and a kind of monstrosity.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   Oh, what heightens it is this.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   That he is a fool most of all
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   in the matters that are of gravest and of greatest concern.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   It is when you come to the ultimate questions
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   that you see the folly of men at its greatest.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Now that is, I say, what heightens the paradox.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Not just that he is a fool at certain odd points
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   where they don't matter.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   No, no, it's much worse than that.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   And that is why this expression is right.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   It is something at which the heavens are to be astonished.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   That man who is so marvelous in so many respects,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   when you really come down to the question of life and living,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   becomes an unmitigated fool.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   That's the phenomenon of men in sin.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   That's the thing that's most evident in the world tonight.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   That is what makes the heavens horrified
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   and should fill us all with a sense of amazement.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   That is why we should all be aghast.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   But are we?
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Are you amazed and aghast at men in the 20th century?
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   My dear friends, if we are not, we must be horribly blind.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   There must be something preventing our seeing things as they are.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   Because this is the truth about us.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Let me put it in another way to you.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   This element of sin in men, you see, does another thing to him.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   It makes him reverse what he does.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   Not only what he is, but what he does in these other spheres.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   I mean this.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   In most spheres in his life, in his business, in his profession,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   and all the rest of it, men is generally characterized by thought.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   By taking care, by exercising reason,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   by being cautious, by taking forethought.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   You know many men of whom this is true, don't you?
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   You know men in professions, the great learned professions,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   men in business, men in industry.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Put them onto their job and those are their great characteristics.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   Wisdom, thoughtfulness, care, caution,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   making sure that they are taking the right action, forethought.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   We will all agree that those are their characteristics.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   But you know, when you come to these vital matters,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   when you come to men in his relationship to God, what you find?
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Prejudice.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   He doesn't stop to think.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   He doesn't rarely give his mind to it.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   No, no, he jumps to conclusions.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   He starts with a ready-made idea.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   He knows everything before he's read a word.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   He's inherited it from somebody else and he repeats it like a parrot.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   What's he governed by?
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   He isn't governed here by the same element of calm, detachment,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   quiet, cool investigation, caution before arriving at a decision.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   He says, "Rotten nonsense, stuff and nonsense.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   The opiate of the people, some stuff.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Oh, all right for women and children."
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   Isn't that how he speaks?
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   What I'm trying to say is this, you see,
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   that there are men who would never dream of taking a great business decision
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   without saying, "Let me have the relevant data.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Bring me every memorandum you can lay your hands on.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Tell me, have we ever tried this before?
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Put all the evidence before me."
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   He'd have it sifted, he'd have it collated.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   He said, "I can't arrive at a decision
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   before I am aware of all the facts."
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   Quite right.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   But you know there are many men, and we've all known them and we still know them,
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   who reject Christianity in total.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   They've never read the Bible in their lives.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   They display their ignorance of it if you have a discussion with them.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   They don't even know their New Testament.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   They don't know their Gospels.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Here they are saying there's nothing in Christianity,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   but they've never investigated it at all.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   Now, this is the element I'm bringing out, you see.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   This is the supreme tragedy of men.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   This is where he becomes a monster.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   That in this matter, which matters above everything else,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   he throws caution to the winds,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   he throws reason out through the window,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   he jettisons his own highest faculties,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   and he speaks like a fool.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Prejudice is in control.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   You can hear them on the wireless and on the television almost whenever you like.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   If you went to them in their normal evocations
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   and began to produce your theories,
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   they'd smile at you and they'd say,
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   "No, look here, my friend, I don't want your theories, I want facts."
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   And yet, when it comes to their whole view of men and of life and of death
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   and of eternity and of God,
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   they base their whole position on nothing but theories and suppositions.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   You hear them saying dogmatically
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   that evolution is a fact.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   But it isn't a fact, and they know it isn't a fact.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   It's nothing but a theory.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   But they base their whole position on it and on a mere theory.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   God is dismissed.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Christ is not needed.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this,
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   and be horribly afraid, yea, be very desolate.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   Saith the Lord.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   There it is in general.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   But let me ask you to bear with me for a moment
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   when I work it out with you in particular.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   So far I've been looking at it merely from the standpoint of thought in and of itself,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   from a kind of philosophic view of life.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   And it's important we should do that,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   but when you come to the particulars you'll see it still more clearly.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   What does this extraordinary condition of men make him do in detail?
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   Well, the first thing it does is this.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   It makes him reject the highest honor that is offered him.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   In every other realm and department, men not only doesn't reject honors,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   he's very ready indeed to receive them.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   I'm not criticizing that.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   All honor to a man who does that.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   If a man has done well, he deserves to be honored.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   The laborer is worthy of his hire.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   I'm not here to say a word against a man being honored by his king or his country,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   by the profession he belongs to, or by society.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   It's well that that should be done.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   And men like that.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   And men are pleased with that and rightly pleased with it
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   and have a legitimate sense of pride.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   But you know when it comes to the greatest and the highest honor of all,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   men reject it without a thought, without consideration,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   and think that they're clever in doing so.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   This is how the prophet puts it.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   "Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods?"
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   No, they haven't.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   "But my people have changed their glory."
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   What is their glory?
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   That is how the Bible often refers to God himself, the glory.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Why? Well, because God dwells in the glory.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   God's essential being is glory.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   The ultimate attribute of God is glory.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   What is glory?
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   Well, I can't describe glory.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   No man can describe glory.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Had I the pen of a ready scribe or the imagination of an angel,
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   I couldn't describe the glory.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   We read about the very angels in heaven
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   that all they do in the presence of the glory is to veil their faces
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   and they bow down.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   The essence of God, I say, is glory.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   It's greatness.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   It's utter, absolute perfection.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   It is holiness.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   It is light in which there is no darkness at all.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   It is omniscience.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   It's omnipresence.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   It is omnipotence.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   That is God, the almighty God.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   You see the prophet's point.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   These men, he says, in these other nations,
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   they've made their little gods.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   They're not gods.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   They've got no being.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   They've got no life.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   You remember how the psalmist ridicules them.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   He says that--look at their gods.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   He says they have eyes, but they can't see.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   They have ears, but they can't hear.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   They have hands, they can't handle.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   They've got feet, but they can't move.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   You have to carry them about.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Yet men worship them, and they don't change their worship.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   They don't turn away from them.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   But here is the nation of Israel.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   Here are people who ought to know better.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   They've turned away from the glory, their glory, their own God,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   the God who made them, the God who is over all, the everlasting God.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   You know, my friends, that's precisely what the human race is doing this evening.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   And I say this is to turn your backs upon the highest
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   and upon the greatest honor conceivable.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   What is it?
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Well, it is to know God.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Man was meant for a knowledge of God.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   God made man for himself.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   He meant him to be his companion.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   That is what God intended man to be.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   That's the biblical picture of man as God created him.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   He was meant to know God.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   He was meant to have fellowship with God.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   He was meant to have his life guided by God.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   He was meant to dwell under the sunshine of God's blessings and of God's face.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   That is what man was destined for.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   And there is no greater glory, there is no greater honor than that.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Then that man should be the companion of God,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   should be on speaking terms with the eternal,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   should have access into the presence of God,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   and his whole life, I say, be lived under the benediction of the Almighty,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   the Glorious One, the Glory.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   But man turns away from it as if it was nothing.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   He who is so interested in honor and glory isn't interested.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   As our blessed Lord put it when he was here in this world,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   he said, "How can ye believe which receive honor one from another,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   and receive not the honor that cometh from God only?"
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Be astonished, O ye heavens!
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   The world is as it is tonight because it is rejecting
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   the greatest glory and the greatest honor of all,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   and that is to live a life under God and with God,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   and under the smile of God.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   Nay more, I can go further.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Man was made in the likeness of God, he was made in the image of God.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   He had certain qualities about him that are characteristic of God himself,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   but he rejected that.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   That's the glory that he's turned away from.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Nay more, he's offered it again in Christ.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   What is this Christian Gospel?
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   It's this, my friend, that though you and I have lost the glory,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   we can receive it back.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   We've lost the image, it's marred, it's defaced.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Yes, but believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Be born again, receive life anew through the Holy Spirit,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   and you know the glory will return.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   In him the tribes of Adam boast more blessings than their father lost.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   But to the world it means nothing.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   The world isn't considering this tonight.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   The world is living as it is. Why?
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Because it has no conception of man in his real glory.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   It has lost this view of man as made in the image of God,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   standing upright, endowed with an original righteousness,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   the friend, the companion of God.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   It's because men and women know nothing about this,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   and dismiss it with ridicule and scorn,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   that their world is as it is.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   They have forsaken their own glory,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   the glory of the only God.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   But secondly, it makes him do another thing,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   and this is it, the second detail.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   It makes him careless and reckless about his highest and his best interests.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   Have you ever considered that?
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   That was the trouble with these children of Israel.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   They were not only turning their backs upon the glory,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   they were not only displaying their unutterable ignorance
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   of the majesty and the greatness of God,
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   they were throwing away the possibility of redemption and deliverance.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   They were utterly negligent, I say,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   and reckless about their own best and highest interests.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   And you see, that's the whole trouble with this world tonight.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   That's where this contradictory element comes in in men.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   I have been referring to his great learning,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   but let me remind you of something else.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   Look how men cares for and tries to look after his own interests.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   He's never done it so successfully as he is doing it at the present time.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   What do I mean?
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   What are these interests?
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Well, here are some of them.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Look at the trouble men is taking about his own safety.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   I know in spite of the folly and the deaths on the road,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   men's making great efforts to preserve the safety of his own life.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   He's concerned about safety against war, civil defense, air raid shelters,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   all these things.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   Then he's very concerned about the safety, the well-being of his physical being.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   Look at his interest in health and in preserving his health.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   Look at the millions that are rightly being spent upon hospitals
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   and upon new medicaments and upon fostering research and all these things.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   This is very right.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Health, how important it is.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   A man can't go far without his health.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   He may be a genius, but if he loses his health,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   he's not going to make a great career.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   Health is absolutely essential, says men.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   So he pays great attention to his health.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   The same with his wealth, insurances, banking, all these things.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   They're absolutely right.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   A man who doesn't do these things is a fool.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Preparation for a rainy day.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Look at the interest men takes in his own comfort.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Look at the interest he takes in knowledge, I say,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   and in education, in improving his mind.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   He's concerned about himself in all these varied ways.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   He says, "These things are so important to me."
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   And he's never been so assiduous as he is at the present time
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   in trying to look after his interests in all these realms and departments.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   "But be astonished, O ye heavens, and be horribly afraid,
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   yea, be very desolate."
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   At this, what?
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   Well, that men who is so careful about his body's physical frame,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   men who's so careful about his health and about his comfort
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   and about prolonging his life a few years in this passing world of time,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   men who goes out of his way so much to make these provisions
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   with his welfare states and schemes and all the rest of it,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   when you come to the highest interest of all,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   which is the interest of the soul,
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   he doesn't give it a moment's thought.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   He pays no attention to it whatsoever.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   He's not interested.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   He doesn't indeed feel that you're insulting him
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   when you invite him to sit down for a moment and stop and think
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   and to ask himself, "What of the soul?
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   What of your relationship to God?
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   What of that spirit that's in you that's bigger than life and the world?"
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   He doesn't do it.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   He spends even this one day out of seven,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   instead of reading the Bible and meditating about his soul,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   he's reading the filth of the law courts
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   and all the nonsense of these entanglements and immoralities
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   that are so much in evidence at this present time.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   Be astonished, O ye heavens, that man can be such a fool,
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   that he can have such an interest in the body and no interest in the soul,
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   such interest in the externals,
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   but never a thought of that which is innermost,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   the citadel of his being,
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   the thing that really makes him man,
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   that he's a living spirit.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   He never thinks about his soul.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   This is the paradox of man.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   This is the monstrous element in man in sin.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   He's not only not interested in the soul,
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   he's not concerned about its well-being now.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   You know there's a type of life that can be lived even in this present world
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   that is a glorious life.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   It's depicted in the Sermon on the Mount, in the Beatitudes.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   What a life!
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   Poor in spirit, mourning an account of sin,
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   hungering and thirsting after righteousness,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   meek, merciful, pure in heart, peacemaker.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   There's a life that is possible now.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   There is a life possible to man even in this veil of tears,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   in this world of sin,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   a life given by God in Christ,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   the life of the saints,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   the noblest souls that have ever trod the face of this earth.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   Do you know, my friend, it's possible to every one of us tonight?
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   It's offered us freely in Jesus Christ.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   But man isn't interested in it.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Though his world is on fire,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   he wants to read these foul novels.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   He wants to waddle in the mire of the gutters of life.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   He wants to spend his time in sex.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   With his world on fire, I say,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   and the end at hand at any moment,
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   he's not interested in the soul
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   and in this noble life of glory that's possible to the soul.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   He's utterly reckless and negligent
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   about the highest and the best interests of his own life.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   And when you carry this on beyond this life and this world,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   you see the monstrosity still more.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   Modern man, I'm addressing you.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   You who are insuring against illness.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   You who are insuring against accident.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   You who are insuring that you'll be buried even.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Do you ever stop to think as to how you're going to die?
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   You've got to.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   You can't escape it.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   This isn't to frighten you.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   This is just to put a fact before you.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   It's an absolute certainty that every one of us has got to die.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   Have you ever thought of it?
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   Have you ever prepared for it?
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   Have you ever rehearsed it?
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Have you any idea what you're going to feel like
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   when you're on your death bed?
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Have you ever visualized yourself the other side of death?
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   What do you know about that?
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   Or you say the spiritists are saying this and that.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   Are you prepared to risk everything on that?
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   Would you do that in your business?
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   Would you do that in your profession?
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   On these spoofs and spooks.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   Are you prepared to risk it all on that?
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   Here I've got solid evidence for you.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   It is appointed unto all men once to die.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   And after death, the judgment.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   That's all I'm certain of.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   Is that every one of us born into this world
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   will on some future day stand before God.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   Is there anything that compares with that in importance?
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   But men and women don't think about it.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   They regard this as morbidity.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   They say it's shameful that a man should be talking about death.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   And yet they see murder and death all around them
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   and see the dread possibilities that may descend upon us
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   at any moment without a warning.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   And yet they'll never give it a thought.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   It's madness, my friends.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   Oh, be astonished, oh, heavens.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   Is there anything like it anywhere?
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   Man's the biggest fool in creation.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   Animals don't behave like that.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   The ox knoweth his master's crib.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   The swallow and the crane and the turtle
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   know the time of their returning.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   There is a kind of wisdom in nature.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Nature obeys the laws of its being.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   It's only man who is an unutterable fool.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   So why is where it's comparatively unimportant
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   so damnably foolish where it is vitally important
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   and his eternal destiny depends upon it?
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   That's the phenomenon of men in sin.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   Man's a fool.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   He's a monster.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   Be astonished, oh, ye heavens,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   at the way in which man who seeks so much glory
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   refuses the real glory.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   Man who's so careful about himself
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   is so utterly careless in the highest and the noblest matters.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   Oh, and the very depth of the thing is seen here.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   My people have changed their glory
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   for that which does not profit.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   They don't want the glory that God can give,
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   the glory of fellowship with God
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   and communion with him,
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   the glory of becoming children of God
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   and joint heirs with Christ,
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   new creatures following Christ,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   living this noble Christian.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   They're not interested in that.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   Well, what are they interested in?
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   That, he says, which does not profit.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   Idols.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Look what they're worshipping tonight.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   They don't make idols as they used to in the old days,
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   but they're still worshipping them.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   Great name, great wealth, great position.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   These are the idols of the modern men.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   What are they living for?
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   That which does not profit, says this man.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   What's he talking about?
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   Animal nature.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   Man's not interested in the soul,
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   but he's very interested in the body.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   You see how this book's selling?
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   What in the name of heaven makes anybody want to read it?
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   How's that going to help you?
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   How's that going to help you to live?
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   How's it going to help you to die?
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   How's it going to help you to make a better world of this?
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   But they're all after it.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   Why, well, you see, that's their interest.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   It doesn't profit.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   No, no, but it appeals to our lesser, lower natures.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   We're living the life of animals.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   The scripture is quite right.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   Did you notice it in that first chapter of Romans?
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   They not only do the same, says the author,
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   but they have pleasure in them that do them.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   They not only do wrong things themselves, they enjoy it.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   And they like to read about others doing the same thing,
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   and they talk about it.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   And they rush to the cinemas to see more and more of it.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   The thing is horrible, it's foul, but they delight in it.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   They take pleasure in them that do it.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   And the same apostle Paul, as I say,
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   has a similar description in writing to the Philippians.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   Oh, he says there are people whose God is their belly,
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   and whose glory is in their shame.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   Isn't that London tonight?
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   Paul wrote it, you know, nearly 2,000 years ago.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   But isn't it true tonight?
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   Whose God, what is their God?
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   Their belly.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   What they're going to eat.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   The sumptuous repast, the great dinners.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   Have you noticed the prominence of dinners?
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   The eating, and all the delicacies.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   And when the world, I say, is on the verge of disaster,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   and doom, and the end, what are they doing?
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   Eating, feasting, drinking.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   Whose God is their belly.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   What they can put into it.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   The food and the drink.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   And whose glory is in their shame.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   They boast of the number of women they've seduced.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   They boast of their own immoralities.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   It's turned into something marvelous, and beautiful, and wonderful.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Glorying in their shame.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   That's what we are witnessing today.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   What a creature is man.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   Be astonished, O ye heavens,
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   that man with all his genius and ability
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   is at the same time glorying in his shame,
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   proud of his iniquity,
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   boasting of his own wretched moral failure.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   What a terrible thing it is.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   They have changed their glory for that which does not profit.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   But oh, what makes it so sad is this.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   That while man is doing all this, he is unaware, I say,
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   of that other glory that is possible to him.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   You see, that's why Jeremiah wrote,
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   that's why God raised him up and sent him to address the children of Israel.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   This was his message.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   He said, "It's not too late.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   You're in a mad position. You're showing your perversity.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   You're doing something that none of the other nations do,
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   even with their own gods, which are no gods at all.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   You've forsaken your own glory for that which is of no profit.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   There's nothing to be said for you.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   You're unutterable fools.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   You deserve to be blasted out of existence.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   You deserve to be damned."
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   But that isn't what he said to them.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   He said, "You know, in spite of it all,
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   it's still not too late.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   If you but realize this,
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   if you but repent,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   if you but return to God,
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   it's still not too late."
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   God had sent Jeremiah to call them back at the eleventh hour,
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   while there was still time,
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   while the gate of mercy was still open.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   And all they needed to do
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   was to acknowledge their unutterable folly,
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   their indescribable monstrosity.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   They had but to return to God,
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   acknowledging and confessing their sins.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   They had but to cry out for mercy and compassion,
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   and God would forgive them,
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   and God would keep their enemies at bay,
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   and God would smile upon them as He had at the beginning,
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   and God would say, "You are My people."
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   Every time they went back to Him,
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   He received them.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   Then they sinned again.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   And then they came back,
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   and then He received them again.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   Oh, He is plenteous in mercy.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   He is rich in mercy.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   For His great love wherewith He loved us,
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   there are exceeding riches in His grace.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   Paul talks about the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   And, my dear friend,
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   that is my simple message
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   that I am privileged to put to you this evening.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   It matters not how far away you may have strayed.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   It matters not how hopeless you were life.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   It matters not how black your sin.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   It matters not how foul your life has been.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   I have the authority of the Almighty God for saying,
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   if you but see it,
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   if you but recognize it,
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   if you but go back to Him,
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   acknowledging it and confessing it,
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   telling Him that were He to deal with you in righteousness,
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   you would have no hope at all but hell.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   But casting yourself upon His everlasting mercy.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   And you know, in spite of all,
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   He will tell you that He so loved you,
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   in spite of all you've been and all you've done,
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   that He sent His only begotten Son into this world
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   to die for you,
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   to take you a punishment,
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   to receive what you so richly deserved
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   for your folly, for your madness.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   He will tell you that Christ has borne your punishment
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   and that He therefore forgives you freely.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   He'll give you new life.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   He'll give you a new start.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   He'll give you a new outlook.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   He'll make you a new man, a new woman.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   He'll adopt you into His family.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   He'll make you His own child.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   He'll lead you while you're still left in this world.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   He'll never leave you nor forsake you.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   Let wars come, let the bombs burst,
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   let hell be let loose.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   God has said, "I will never leave thee nor forsake thee."
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   And at the end,
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   He will receive you unto Himself
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   into the everlasting glory.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   And even this old body of yours
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   will be changed and will be glorified,
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   and you'll be like Christ
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   and live under the sunshine of God's face
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   throughout the running ages of eternity.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   That's all you have to do.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   Today the gate is open.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   Today, while it is still today,
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   the offer remains.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   God's mercy is not ended.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   Recognize the truth about all of us
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   as we are in sin.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   This thing on which the heavens
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   are called upon to be astonished and to be amazed.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   You have but to acknowledge it and confess it.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   You have but to receive this offer
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   of free pardon and forgiveness and new life
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   and adoption into God's family.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   And you will become a new creature.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   And do you know what will happen?
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   It will no longer be the case
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   that anybody can look at you and say,
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   "Look at him! Be, O ye heavens, be astonished!"
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   That isn't what will happen then.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   I can tell you what will happen.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   There will be joy in heaven
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   amongst the angels of God
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   at what has happened to you.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   For there is joy amongst the angels of God
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   over one sinner that repented.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   The heavens that were astonished at man
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   in his unutterable folly before
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   are now ringing with rejoicing,
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   filled with praise.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   Repent, believe.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   Receive the honor and the glory
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   that come from the only God.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   Amen.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   We do hope that you've been helped
