[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Today, Fun Friday question.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Question comes in from Chris.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Very interesting.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Says, "Joshua, looking to see if you have any insight
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   on emotional or psychological decisions
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   versus logical decisions when it comes to finance.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Backstory.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   I have a paid-for 20-year-old Harley-Davidson motorcycle.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   I have not ridden it in three years.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   I spend about $200 per year on an insurance policy.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Each spring, I do maintenance on it,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   which costs about $30,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   and living in Minnesota,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   we only really have six months or so
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   of decent riding weather.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   I have a big garage, so storage is not an issue,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   apart from each winter when I have to move it around
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   in the garage and I tell myself I'll sell it in the spring.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I can make the logical argument to myself
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   that I need to sell this.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   It is a depreciating asset,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   costs money to maintain and insure,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   and it really brings no value to my life.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   However, I cannot bring myself to sell it.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   I have no pressing financial obligations,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   so the $5,000 or $6,000 that I would get from selling it
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   would really not do much to improve my life.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   About the only thing that I would do with the money
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   is put it in a taxable brokerage account.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   I've told myself I'm going to sell this bike for years now,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   but I still can't figure out why I still have it.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Any insight would be helpful,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   and as always, thanks for the great show.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Chris in Minnesota.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Well, Chris, kind of a fun question,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   and obviously in light of your current financial situation,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   thankfully not a super important question,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   just one of these musings,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   and clearly you have mused on this for a couple of years,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   and what I was most impressed by,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   the reason I wanted to answer this on the show,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   was your clear thinking that you applied to it,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   and so I'll just share with you my suggestions and commentary.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   First thing, I am glad to hear
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   that you are assessing the value of the item
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   and trying to understand its value in your life.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   In general, I think most of us are prone to inertia,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   just simply continuing to do what we've done,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   and in this case, you have a Harley that you've had for a long time,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   and well, why get rid of it if you've had it for a long time?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   But you do point out that there are some problems,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   although minor, financially otherwise,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   with maintaining it and keeping it going.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   I mean, if you don't go out there and start the thing
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   at least every month or a couple of months,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   you wind up with the carburetor all messed up,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   and the thing will run.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I mean, it's a 20-year-old Harley,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   so right there, you're not going to get a very smooth start anyway.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   So you wind up cleaning the carburetor,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   and you have to keep the battery maintainer on it,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   and you're replacing batteries
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   and all of your spring maintenance, as you said,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   and then your insurance policies.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So there are some costs to it,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   and then of course you can calculate the--
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   and as you should, you've calculated the depreciation cost.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Now my guess is for a Harley of this age,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   it's pretty much done depreciating.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I don't--I'm not that in tune with the Harley-Davidson marketplace,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   but it's hard for me to think that it's going to go down
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   much more in value than $5,000 or $6,000.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   So you probably have almost no depreciation
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   at this point in time as long as it is maintained.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   So your really costs are your maintenance costs
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   and your insurance costs.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   One thing I would look into in this case was
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   can you just drop the insurance.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   In the state of Florida, there is no requirement
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   that you have to have insurance for a motorcycle.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Of course, it's a good idea, but unlike with cars,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   there's no legal requirement that you have to maintain insurance.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I guess the state authorities figured that if you get in a crash on a motorcycle,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   probably the damage to the car is going to be a whole lot less
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   than the damage to your bike.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   So it's not required that you maintain insurance.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   That could be one way of trimming your expenses.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And, of course, you have the cost of the maintenance on it.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Here's how I would assess it.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I wouldn't discount the psychological value of things.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I think we all have things that we like,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   and we just keep them around because we like them.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Maybe you had many great rides on this Harley
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   and you've really just enjoyed owning it.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   I have a friend of mine who has the same thing,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   has a classic Harley.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   It's 1993, so over 20 years old.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   He has owned it since it was brand new, put all the miles on it,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   and he just likes to have it.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   A similar thing, except he doesn't do the maintenance on it,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   and so every year he takes it into the Harley shop
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   to have the carburetor cleared up and all that,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   so it does cost him more money.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   But I don't think there's a problem of keeping stuff around.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   In terms of selling it, I think you identified some of the reasons
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   why it's not pressing.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   As you say, I have no pressing financial obligation.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   To me, the idea of selling my $5,000 or $6,000 toy
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   that I've enjoyed over the years
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   to just put the money in a brokerage account
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   sounds very logical and utterly boring.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   So I can understand why you wouldn't do it.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   If you don't have a pressing goal and you're not pressing
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   where this $5,000 or $6,000 is going to make a big deal,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   it's a lot more fun to look at the Harley in the garage
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   than to see an extra $5,000 of value for most people
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   on a probably substantial brokerage account.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Now, if you have no investment assets,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   this could set you on the path to investing.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   So here are a few ideas. Here is what I would do.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Number one, I would not discount the psychological value,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   but I would consider it.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   There comes a time in most of our lives
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   where it's time for us to let things go,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   and if you're ready to do that, let it go.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   But I wouldn't discount the psychological value.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   None of us make all logical decisions.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   It might be a fun economic concept
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   and somewhat useful to think about the rational person.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   What would a rational person do?
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   But the reality is we're not really all rational.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   We're very emotional.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Even the concept of rationality presupposes
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   an external objective standard for rationality.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Interesting philosophical argument there.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   We'll skip it for now.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   But in the context of your own rationality,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   it would be determined based upon what do you value.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Some people would say,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   "I value having money and productive investments."
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Well, it's rational in that context
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   to sell the Harley and toss the money in a brokerage account.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Some people, however, would say,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   "I value living a rich life now,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   and for me, knees in the breeze is my only disease,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   and my Harley Davidson is my two-wheeled psychologist."
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   I left some helmet stickers there for you.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And indeed, to me, that is utterly rational.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   It's perfectly rational to keep something around
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   because you enjoy it.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   So don't discount the emotional value of something.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Now, there's a reason you haven't ridden in three years.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Maybe motorcycles just aren't your thing anymore.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   That's fine.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Which brings me to thing number two that I would do.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   I would think carefully about the utility of the motorcycle.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Is there a reason to keep it from an argument of utility?
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   For example, I think there is a tremendous amount of value
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   of keeping around something like a backup form of transportation.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   If you have a car, but you also have a motorcycle as your backup,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   then perhaps that'll save you some money on renting a car to get to work
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   when you need to go and put your car in the shop or if you have an accident.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   If your total annual cost is $200 a year to maintain it,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   but you take your car to the shop for a few days,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   it wouldn't be hard to meet $200 per year of expenses.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   I think it's also really nice to have something like a motorcycle around.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   A motorcycle can be--although I'm sure a 20-year-old Harley is not--
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   a motorcycle can be something that's more fuel efficient.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   If you need to take a fuel-efficient trip somewhere, that can be good.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Or who knows? Maybe the zombie apocalypse is going to happen.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   North Korea fires off their nuke.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Everyone hits the road, and there's massive traffic jams,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   and a motorcycle allows you to buzz along on the outside.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   So there you've got a zombie apocalypse vehicle in place for yourself.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I don't know. There are a lot of reasons.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   For me, if I had the storage space, I would find it valuable to have backup vehicles.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   And vehicles of different profiles.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   So consider if there's other utility for it that you're not thinking of.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Number three, I would look for something--if you're worried about this emotional connection--
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   I would look for some kind of fun, other positive emotional connection to swap it out with.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   So I wouldn't just toss it into a boring brokerage account.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Think of something fun to do with the money.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Maybe you want to spend it.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   And so tell your wife, "Hey, honey, listen, I'm selling the Harley.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Let's go do something fun.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Something that both of you have enjoyed doing, and turn the Harley into an experience.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   You've traded out the hassle of a thing.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   You've traded out the hassle of storing it and maintaining it.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   It had a lot of fun experiences for you, but you can send it out in style
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   by taking the money and selling it for an experience."
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   I think that's worth it.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   A lot more fun than just throwing it in a brokerage account.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Or if you have not told yourself no on any experiences that you really want,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   then go and find some kind of fun investment that would give you psychological value.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Maybe you want to go ahead and use this as a down payment on a speculative piece of property
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   that you've thought about buying.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Or maybe there is a brand-new cryptocurrency that you've been eyeing,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   and you think, "Well, this is wild speculation, but you know what?
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Let me turn the Harley into something fun here."
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Maybe you've been eyeing that Barrett .50 cal, and you can't justify it.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   There's no reason for it, but you'd sure rather have one of those than a Harley.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   You figure, "Well, if I buy the Barrett .50 cal down at the local gun shop,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   it's going to cost me 6,000, 7,000 bucks, but maybe it will maintain its value over time,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   and, hey, it would be fun to go out and shoot with my buddies every now and then."
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   I don't know. You pick whatever you're into.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   But come up with something that's emotionally fun and stimulating.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   And then instead of it being kind of a boring thing of, "Oh, I've got to get rid of this Harley
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   and toss it into a brokerage account," you have something fun to think about, something interesting.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   And then my final suggestion for you is don't discount just swapping out the experiences that you got with the Harley
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   and swapping it out for something that would give you experiences,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   but that's more appropriate for where you are right now.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   And here I would encourage you, yes, consider selling it and you could put it on the market,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   but be open to doing a trade.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Sometimes with something like this, you'll come out better in the end if you'll trade it.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Take some time and find somebody who would like to have a Harley and trade the Harley for their bass boat.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Do you have bass in Minnesota?
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   For their fishing boat.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Or trade the Harley for a side-by-side, a UTV.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   And maybe you would get more use out of the side-by-side UTV or a snow machine or something like that,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   and you can use it during the winter months.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Maybe that would be more fun for you.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Trade it for a boat.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Trade it for a dual sport.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   If the reason you don't ride the Harley anymore, you enjoyed riding motorcycles,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   but you don't really love just being out on the road and you can't ride it six months,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   get yourself a dual sport or something and try to do a trade for it.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Perhaps you'll find something that would be more interesting.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   So that's my answer.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   I don't know which of these ideas would stick, but I'm not real excited about this idea.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   I have no pressing financial obligations, so the $5,000 to $6,000 that I would get from selling it
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   would really not do much to improve my life.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   That sounds boring, boring, boring to me.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   I'm going to put it in a taxable brokerage account.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Find something with some juice and trade out the emotion that you have in the Harley for something else fun.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   And, hey, Chris, if you can't think of anything else to do with it, toss it on a –
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   call up a local shipper and send it to me.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   I'll ride the pants off of it.
