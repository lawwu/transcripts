[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.860]   I believe, I just have a central belief, that we all do have some unique gifts that we're
[00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.420]   meant to bring to our life and to the world, and it shows up in different forms, and one
[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.540]   of the worst things we can do in trying to find that and express it is trying to be really
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.980]   good at everything.
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.100]   I just think that's the most poisonous idea in the American mindset, that we're supposed
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.380]   to be really good at everything.
[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.100]   On the other hand, I personally believe that we should try a variety of things so that
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.580]   we experience frustration and fail and eventually find what it is that is, you know, we're "meant
[00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.580]   to do."
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.420]   I do, but I feel also very fortunate that I was never really pushed to be excellent
[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.420]   at everything.
[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.780]   I have terrible hand-eye coordination, but I'm pretty good at sports with my feet, but
[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.460]   when I say pretty good, I mean passable.
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.060]   So I gave up on the idea of becoming a professional athlete very, very young.
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.740]   So I think we have to know that we have to play games with our hands and our feet in
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.980]   order to figure that out.
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.260]   I tend not to put anyone on a pedestal.
[00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.460]   I feel like, and maybe part of it is, in part of my private practice for years, I saw, maybe
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.140]   I saw the Stanford grads who are then living in New York, and they weren't literally from
[00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.060]   Stanford, but I'd have all these late 20-year-olds and their pedigree, like all look the same.
[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.580]   Top of their class, Ivy League, Goldman Sachs, this MBA.
[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:30.540]   And like so many of them had the same insane anxiety and emptiness.
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.980]   I still remember the way one of them described how they felt, and she was brilliant with
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:41.060]   her words, and she said, "I walk around, and it's like when I'm with people and doing things
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.820]   and at work, it's like there's a ton of color.
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.740]   When I'm alone, I feel like I am an empty room with white walls."
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.740]   Oh, goodness.
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.180]   That's very sad.
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.180]   Very sad.
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.460]   It actually relates to my own childhood.
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.380]   I feel like I've, you know, grown a lot, had my therapy, and I feel like when I was younger,
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.260]   I was really hard-driving and really like somewhat people-pleasing.
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.340]   And me and my friend who are both like that, were like that, have kids who aren't really
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.340]   like that.
[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.340]   And they're amazing kids, and they do so well, and they have this internal confidence.
[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.860]   But sometimes we joke, we're like, "But there's nothing that will drive you like feeling not
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.140]   good enough.
[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.500]   There's nothing that drives you like feeling like every test score defines yourself."
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.340]   And it's so sick, right?
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.740]   Because we're almost like conflicted with our kids, like they're all great kids, they're
[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.340]   responsible, but they almost have a little bit more inner contentment, right?
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:49.780]   But I think about that young woman I saw, and how at work, she felt amazing, until,
[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.380]   didn't happen until she was 28, she didn't get the promotion she thought she was getting.
[00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.580]   And then, I mean...
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.980]   She never failed before.
[00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.140]   And it's not only the never failure.
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.740]   When your internal sense of self is built outside-in, which you actually can do if you
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.900]   have a lot of accomplishments, it works for a while.
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:22.420]   But as soon as that stops working, if you have nothing, you feel like in an empty room
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.420]   with white walls.
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.180]   What's really compelling about the therapy over the course of a number of years is, as
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.340]   I still remember, over COVID, we were then Zooming, and she'd had her own place.
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.140]   And she actually went through this process, and she was very artistic of painting the
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.900]   walls in her actual room, talking about making something concrete, and kind of in the way
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.780]   that she was feeling a lot more lit up inside-out instead of outside-in.
[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.780]   That's great.
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.100]   I certainly don't hold up these ultra performers in all domains on a pedestal.
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.740]   I think they're in a very precarious place inside and outside.
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.580]   They've essentially given up all their power and agency to one incoming failure.
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.420]   And maybe they never experience it, and they get to the end without having done it, but
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.380]   what a terrible way to live anyway.
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.380]   I've always looked up, since I was little, to people that really took a unique path.
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:20.380]   I've always found that they, yes, accomplished tremendous things, and they have interesting,
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.380]   sometimes painful flaws.
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.500]   Like, I'm a huge fan of the late neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks, very incredible man,
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.060]   very complicated life, became that way and found his passion by realizing how terrible
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.140]   he was at certain things, including certain branches of medicine.
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.620]   So I think that trying many things and being really realistic about whether or not something's
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.340]   for us or not is the key.
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.700]   But then I guess the question becomes, and this must be so hard from the perspective
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.200]   of parenting, but also just in terms of guiding ourselves through life, is how much friction
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.780]   do we experience before we say, "You know what?
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.580]   I'm not a musician, and I'm cool with that.
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.380]   I love music, but I'm going to put my efforts into these other things, and this thing comes
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.740]   more easily for me."
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.940]   I do think we have a lot of natural tendencies, and I feel like, especially in the United
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.860]   States, there's been this complicated relationship with parenting and education whereby we don't
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.100]   want to push people to their own suffering and demise, but we also have to avoid not
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.380]   pushing them because then they don't ever find what they are proficient in, and they
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.660]   don't learn that overcoming friction thing.
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.180]   So it's tricky.
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:34.980]   So how do you know when to keep pushing your kid to even engage in something?
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.700]   Maybe they're the kid that always is picked last for the team, but you know they should
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.160]   play sports.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.420]   So I guess my first reaction is I'm reacting to the word "pushing" because I'm not sure
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.700]   that's the verb I would think about because I think the idea of pushing your kid, even
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.100]   like how much do I push, there's a lot about us there.
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.980]   I guess I grew up in a town where a lot of kids got pushed.
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.580]   Oh, I mean, I grew up in a town where every kid got pushed.
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.180]   So maybe that's why I know something about it, right?
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.060]   I mean, I think we see this all the time, and it goes back to actually what side of
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.260]   the tennis court, like whose feelings are whose.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:17.580]   Is this my unlived dreams as an athlete in my youth, or is this actually about my kid's
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.580]   soccer skills?
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:24.500]   You know, I think parents watching their kids playing sports is a prime example of am I
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.880]   living out my unfulfilled dreams and projecting that onto my daughter?
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.060]   Or does my daughter like soccer?
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.460]   And like, how can I really differentiate those, right?
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.740]   I think actually, though, making it back to that, a lot of this actually goes back to
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.780]   frustration tolerance and why it matters so much to me.
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:50.300]   Like my approach to teaching frustration tolerance, which is like a hidden gem we have here at
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.500]   Kidd Inside, I really want, I want to be in every school.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.720]   I think it needs to be in every school, and I want to describe it to you, okay?
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.620]   So I literally have this graph, it's helpful, and I know you like to write things down too
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:07.840]   to make it concrete, where like point one is not knowing how to do something, okay?
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.660]   And point two, which is very far away, is let's say knowing how to do it or being very
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.660]   proficient.
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.860]   It could be soccer, I think a good example is reading, okay?
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.740]   Like you, everybody starts out not knowing how to read, and let's say, not everybody,
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.220]   but a lot of people learn how to read.
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:33.060]   The space between not knowing and knowing, I call the learning space.
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.900]   It has a name, and it's helpful to know where you are in a map, and the learning space has
[00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:43.580]   one feeling that you're supposed to have, frustration.
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:49.660]   That is the feeling you're supposed to have, and we have this idea that we jet from not
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.660]   knowing to knowing like this.
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.540]   It's because of those damn Star Wars movies, and, oh, no, actually, Star Wars incorporated
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.860]   some frustration, but it's because of movies.
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.760]   Boom, you're supposed to just have the skill because you picked up the rock or the sword
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.060]   or the pen or the wand.
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:11.300]   And now, it's because if you think about the circuitry that kids get used to with dopamine,
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:17.540]   and the space between wanting and having, in general, is low because when you don't
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.980]   know something, you want to know it.
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.660]   Here, you do know it.
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:28.900]   Our tolerance and our kids' tolerance for wanting and not having is so low that what's
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:36.020]   so sad is the learning space has gotten massively compressed, and people fear frustration.
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.020]   This image, when I've gone over this with kids and even teachers, I know teachers who
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.900]   teach us in their class, "Okay, today, we're going to learn this new thing.
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.740]   We're going to learn whatever it is, you know, how to read a short word."
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.700]   Everybody in this class is here not knowing.
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.220]   Everybody in this class is going to get here.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:57.700]   And probably today, most of us, and you can actually do it now, are going to be right
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:58.700]   here.
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.700]   What does this say?
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:00.700]   The learning space.
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.860]   How are we supposed to feel when we're in the learning space?
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:08.740]   The class can say, "Frustrated, okay, here's an interesting assignment, different than
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.740]   you think.
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:14.640]   The goal today is not to tell me if you can read the letters that are in front of you.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.140]   I want you to raise your hand when you feel frustrated," which feels like this, "Oh,
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.140]   I can't do it," because I'm going to come up to you, and I'm going to give you a high
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.940]   five, and I'm going to say, "You are in the learning space.
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:25.940]   You are learning.
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:26.940]   How amazing is that?"
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.460]   Like, "Andrea, I really believe this has the power to change learning."
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.980]   Because then when we talk about proficiency or when we talk about years from now, my kid
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.220]   is saying, this happens all the time, I get questions about this all the time, my kid
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:44.820]   says they want to do whatever, it could be a coding class, it could be a lacrosse class,
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.260]   and they do it once, and then they always come home, and they say, "I want to do it,
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.260]   I quit."
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.540]   Or maybe they're on a swim team, and they want to quit.
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.540]   Do I let my kid quit, right?
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:10:00.860]   To me, the question is actually, like, most likely none of our kids are going to be Olympic
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.900]   swimmers or like professional basketball players.
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.620]   I think about this a lot with these sports.
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:09.260]   The whole goal in my mind for most people with youth sports, not everyone, but most,
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.020]   is learning how to deal with frustration, learning how to do things you thought you
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:18.780]   couldn't do, character, sharing, being a good teammate, sportsmanship, right?
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.260]   All those things are hard skills to learn.
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.500]   So the reason I'm signing my kid up for basketball is actually just because it's like a good
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.700]   medium for all those things.
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:31.740]   And so I want to be sure that if my kid is quitting, it's not because they're escaping
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:38.420]   the very, very natural learning space that is so important to being in life.
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:47.020]   I love, love, love this concept, which I believe to be entirely true, that the learning space
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:52.940]   between unskilled and skilled, if you will, is characterized by the feeling of frustration
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.820]   in mind and body.
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:59.460]   I don't want to rattle off another experiment, but there is just oh so much data, I'll share
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:05.460]   this with you offline, the papers that is, showing that brain plasticity changes in neural
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:10.340]   circuitry only occur when the chemical milieu of the brain is different than it normally
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.340]   is.
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.460]   Otherwise, how would the brain know it should change?
[00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:19.140]   So what sets the context for massive change in our neural circuitry is when there's a
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:24.220]   lot of adrenaline in the body, sorry folks, it's true, adrenaline, also called epinephrine,
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.140]   and norepinephrine released in the brain.
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:31.140]   Now you don't want to be in a state of panic or stress to the point where you're debilitated,
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:39.140]   but that shift in the chemical milieu sets the stage for rewiring of connections between
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.140]   neurons.
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.340]   I mean, this is known at the molecular level, it's known at the cellular level, it's known
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:46.300]   at the circuit level, and I'm excited to share that literature with you because it basically
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:52.940]   is a bunch of nerd speak and numbers to support the fact that you're nailing it right in the
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:57.540]   bullseye, which is, without frustration, there is no rewiring of the neural circuits.
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.500]   And if you think about it, it had to be that way.
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.500]   Right.
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.180]   Otherwise, why would the circuits change?
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:06.020]   So that the error signal is what sets plasticity in motion.
