[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   - Recently, my podcast team was in Australia
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.880]   and my producer and close friend here, Rob Moore,
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.800]   instructed all of us to get rid of social media
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.340]   on our phones, except one guy
[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.520]   who would post our weekly episodes announcements.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.000]   And it was pretty brutal at first.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.800]   And then coming back to social media
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.920]   has actually turned out to be more challenging.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.600]   You really experienced the friction coming back
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.640]   the other way, and then one experiences the lack of friction
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.680]   and that's where it gets scary.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.200]   It's so interesting the way that the brain can adapt
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.400]   the friction, leaving something behind,
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.960]   the friction coming back to it.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.920]   And I think for people listening to this,
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.580]   I raise this because I think, of course,
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.440]   many people listening are, you know,
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.960]   have work that they really need to focus on.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.400]   They may be having issues with productivity
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.800]   and burnout, et cetera.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.160]   I think a lot of people use the phone and social media
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.000]   because it fills their life.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.760]   You know, it provides some enrichment
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.520]   and they aren't necessarily committed to specific projects.
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.840]   But I guess through the lens of the,
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.080]   let's just call it the Cal Newportian lens,
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.560]   one might argue that those people
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.760]   almost certainly have untapped creativity,
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.760]   untapped resources within them that they don't yet know about
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.760]   because they're essentially using that energy elsewhere.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.600]   - Yeah, I mean, I think for a lot of people,
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.560]   it's papering over the void, right?
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.560]   You have this void in your life
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.560]   because there's a unmet potential, unmet interest,
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.160]   living in misalignment with the things you care about,
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.000]   right?
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.820]   I mean, a lot of people,
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.580]   this is the classic sort of catastrophe of life, right?
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.040]   Social media, and there's, before this,
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.040]   it was other things, right?
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.120]   There was other intoxicants or other sorts of distractions.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.980]   It's a way for some people of essentially putting a screen
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.920]   over that like gaping void.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.600]   And it like just makes it bearable enough
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.800]   that you can kind of go on with life.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.640]   And so it is true.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.080]   If you just rip it out, you see the void.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.320]   And that's really difficult, right?
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.540]   I mean, 'cause I did this experiment for one of my books.
[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.400]   I ran an experiment with 1600 people
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.680]   and they all turned off all their social media for 30 days.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.000]   - 30 days? - 30 days, right?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.400]   - These are young people, old people?
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.120]   - A whole mix, a whole mix, right?
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.280]   - They're not just university students.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.840]   - I recruited them from my newsletter readership.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.000]   So they weren't university students.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.060]   And it wasn't formal research.
[00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.960]   It was, you know, I put out the call, right?
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.480]   So this is not randomly sampled, right?
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.320]   But I put out the call and I said,
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.460]   "Here, I'm gonna walk you through this."
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.960]   And then I got a lot of information back.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.160]   So people reported back how it went.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.680]   And this was like the number one thing I heard
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.960]   was it's really hard at first, right?
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.760]   And so who were the people that succeeded for 30 days
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.920]   versus those who didn't?
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.720]   The ones who didn't succeed
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.820]   tended to just try to white knuckle it.
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.280]   Just be like, "I don't like how much I'm using social media.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.920]   "I'm just gonna stop because it's bad
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.880]   "and I don't wanna do a bad thing.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   "I'm just gonna like, you know,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.640]   "hold on to the table with white knuckles."
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.220]   They wouldn't make it 30 days.
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.960]   The people who did succeed followed my advice
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.480]   to incredibly aggressively pursue alternatives
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.400]   in those 30 days.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.040]   So it's like, go learn new hobbies, join things right away.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.560]   Get like really structured about your day.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.920]   Get into exercise again, learn how to knit again.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.160]   A lot of people said, "Oh, I learned about,
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.200]   "I forgot how fun libraries were."
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.400]   Like, you can go into this building
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.600]   and like all the books are free
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.280]   and you could just grab whatever
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.600]   and it's okay if you don't like the book
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.400]   because you didn't have to pay for it.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.420]   I'm going out with friends again.
[00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.560]   Okay, every week I'm gonna have, you know,
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.160]   we're gonna have drinks with this person
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.440]   and every Thursday morning
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.100]   I'm gonna go running with this person.
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.560]   The people who aggressively tried to put in place
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.880]   a more positive alternative
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.160]   through self-reflection experimentation,
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.740]   they lasted the 30 days and beyond, right?
[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.040]   And so then I came to realize like,
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.280]   "Oh, I see what's happening here
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.560]   "is you have these unmet needs."
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.560]   These tools can give you sort of a simulacrum
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.400]   of meeting them.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.600]   I need, I'm a social being.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.760]   I need to be connected to people.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.360]   Well, I'm texting and like doing comments on social media.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.480]   It's sort of touches that a little bit,
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.380]   just enough that you don't feel hopelessly lonely,
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.200]   but it's not really fulfilling that.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.280]   I have a need to like see my intentions
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.800]   made manifest concretely in the world.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.940]   Humans wanna do this.
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.000]   Well, I'm, you know, posting these things
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.080]   and people are responding.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.920]   It's sort of this simulacrum of real creation.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.680]   So it's like kind of satisfying that just enough
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.400]   that it's not just intolerable, right?
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.700]   And so what happens is if you remove that,
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.880]   you have to actually fill those things the right way.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.480]   So now I'm not socializing on social media,
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.920]   but I'm going out of my way to sacrifice time and attention
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.320]   on behalf of other people.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.640]   I'm feeling the social void in the right way.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.680]   Now I don't really feel like I need to go back.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.000]   I'm actually build, making my intentions manifest.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.520]   I'm learning skills and building things.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.000]   Now the sort of pseudo construction
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.160]   and collective attention economy of social media,
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.080]   I'll post this and you'll like it, I'll like this.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.960]   I don't need that anymore to fill that void.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.940]   So it's like, you have to fill the void first.
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.780]   So, you know, five years ago I wrote a book
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.060]   that was about reforming this part of your life.
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.860]   And a lot of the book had nothing to do with technology,
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.720]   but about how to actually just rebuild parts of your life.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.420]   And on my podcast, honestly,
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.040]   like one of the big topics we talk about,
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.820]   which is crazy that I'm a technologist
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.180]   and I write about trying to find focus
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.340]   in a distracted world,
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.340]   is this thing we call the deep life,
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.340]   which is just straight up building a meaningful life 101.
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.880]   And it's like crazy that my podcast is talking about it.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.920]   But on the other hand, it's not
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.540]   because my is the podcast people go to
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.000]   when they're fed up with the digital world.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.260]   And it turns out if you don't get the analog world
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.840]   working right for you,
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.260]   you need something to avoid staring into that void.
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.240]   And the digital world will do that well enough.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.920]   It's like just good enough to keep life tolerable.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.780]   - Thank you for tuning in
