[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   We do apologise for the background crackle on the parts of this recording.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.040]   This was due to a fault on the recording machine on which the tape was originally recorded.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.440]   However, we have processed the recording digitally to minimise these effects,
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.600]   and we hope that they don't spoil your enjoyment of this very relevant message
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.600]   by Dr Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.040]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in Paul's
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.480]   epistle to the Ephesians in the fifth chapter and the sixth verse.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.360]   The sixth verse in the fifth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:44.240]   "Let no man deceive you with vain words, for because of these things
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.880]   cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.160]   Let no man deceive you with vain words, for because of these things
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.960]   cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience."
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.040]   The apostle in referring to these things is referring, of course,
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.400]   to the things which he has just been mentioning.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.360]   For instance, in the fifth verse where we read this,
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:27.920]   "For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man who is an idolater,
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.120]   hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God."
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.920]   He's also referring to the things which he's been mentioning in verses even before that,
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.960]   where he says, "But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness,
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.200]   let it not be once named among you as becometh saints, neither filthiness,
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:02.080]   nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient, but rather giving of thanks."
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.880]   The apostle's primary object here, of course, is, as we've been seeing,
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.080]   to exhort these Ephesian Christians to live the Christian life truly.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.360]   He's impressing upon them the importance of carrying that down to the very smallest detail
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.240]   of their life. But we see that the apostle can't handle even a question like that
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:33.520]   without at once relating it to certain great general fundamental principles.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.760]   In other words, he's not interested only in their conduct as such,
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.120]   conduct and morality, qua conduct and morality. He's got a larger and a bigger interest.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.080]   And this is, of course, characteristic of the whole Christian message.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.520]   It takes everything that we do in this life and in this world and everything that happens to us
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.640]   and puts it into an eternal context. And that is what the apostle is doing here.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:13.200]   In other words, his case is that our conduct and our behavior in this world
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.920]   is important for these three great eternal reasons.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:32.560]   The first is, our conduct is important because it affects our relationship to God,
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.560]   not simply our relationship as it were to ourselves,
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.480]   not simply our relationship to other people. That comes in that is involved.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.080]   But the whole emphasis of the Bible is that our conduct and behavior is important
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:57.440]   because it affects our relationship to the eternal and the everlasting God himself.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.480]   The second principle is this, that there are only two possibilities with regard to that
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.800]   relationship to God. And he's already been mentioning, here are the only two possible
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:22.080]   positions. We are all of us either in the kingdom of Christ and of God. We either have this
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:29.200]   inheritance and a place and a portion in the kingdom of Christ and of God, or else
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:38.400]   we are outside that kingdom. And if we are outside that kingdom, we are under the wrath of God.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.880]   That's what he's saying here. It's one or the other. We are either there as inheritors of that
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:52.800]   kingdom, or else he says, the wrath of God is upon us as children of disobedience.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.920]   Now, that is why the apostles are so concerned that these Ephesians should have no doubt in
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.920]   their minds as to this question of conduct and the importance of conduct. Their conduct is
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.040]   determining their relationship to God, and it's one of those two. But then he has a third principle,
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:20.960]   which is this, that this relationship of ours to God is something that not only applies to time,
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:29.520]   but also to eternity. It is important not only for the sake of our life and our happiness while
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:39.440]   we are in this world, it is that which determines our eternal, our everlasting, our endless
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.320]   condition of either happiness or else intense misery and unhappiness.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.960]   Now, there are the three big principles which he brings out at this point as he is handling
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:02.480]   this question of the ordinary life and behavior and conduct of these Christian people. Now,
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:15.200]   the world is as it is at this present moment, and the world goes on living as it is living at this
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:24.320]   present moment, simply because it doesn't realize those three fundamental truths.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:31.520]   We are meeting together on Remembrance Sunday. That makes us think of the fact that we've
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:39.120]   already had two world wars in this present century. A day of grief, a day of mourning,
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:46.080]   a day when people look back to loved ones whose lives were lost in those two skirmishes,
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:55.200]   those bloody skirmishes. But the question arises, why have there been such wars?
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.720]   Why is the whole world's situation as it is this morning? Why are we living in a world that is
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:09.360]   filled with problems and perplexities and with tragedy? Well, I say the answer is just this.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.960]   The world doesn't realize those three principles which the apostle here enunciates.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:23.040]   It's not concerned about its relationship to God. It doesn't realize that every human being
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.320]   is in one or the other of those two positions in that relationship, either in his kingdom or
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:37.040]   else outside it and under his rock. It doesn't realize that beyond this life and the grave is
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:45.680]   another life, that we go on and go on endlessly, eternally, in one of two positions, either one of
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:54.560]   bliss, unspeakable, or suffering and agony, which even baffles the imagination.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:00.640]   But the question that arises, therefore, is why is it that the world does not realize this?
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:07.760]   What is it that accounts for the fact that men and women speaking generally and in the mass
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:15.440]   and in the main, are so clearly and patently, completely unaware of these three great truths
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:24.160]   and don't realize them? Well, it is because the apostle answers that question in this sixth verse
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.040]   of this fifth chapter of his epistle to the Ephesians that I'm calling your attention to
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.000]   it this morning. And I would like to know if any of you can suggest a more appropriate text
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:43.200]   for remembrance or armistice Sunday, which comes in the natural course of our consideration of this
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:49.600]   great epistle. And I'm emphasizing this because I would emphasize that there is nothing that is so
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:55.520]   amazing about the scripture as the way in which it is always contemporary and always has the
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:04.480]   perfect and the last word to say on every human occasion and in every conceivable human situation.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.120]   Very well, then here is the question. Why does the world not realize these three great truths?
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:18.560]   The apostle says that the first answer is this, because it is being deceived by vain words.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:29.520]   Let no men deceive you with vain words. Now then, this is the thing which we need to understand,
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:36.240]   it seems to me, at this present hour. Man is as he is in sin, and the world is as it is,
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:43.520]   and undergoes all these agonies and turmoils for one reason only, and that is because it is being
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:51.680]   deceived. According to the Bible, that is the essence of the human tragedy, the tragedy of the
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:58.720]   world. Everything against which we are battling, all our troubles and problems, I say, have
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:08.240]   resulted from one thing, and that is that man at the beginning was a fool, deceived, beguiled
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:19.120]   by Satan. To be strictly accurate and to be scriptural, I should say that Eve was, the woman
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:26.960]   was, as the serpent beguiled Eve, says this same apostle in his second epistle to the Corinthians,
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:32.720]   chapter 11. Now, this is the whole case of the Bible. The Bible is a book about life, it is a
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.920]   book about this world, it is a book about all our tragedies and problems, and it says here is the
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:46.640]   explanation of it all, that man at the very beginning allowed himself to be deceived by Satan.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:52.480]   Satan was the deceiver from the beginning. Those are the terms that are used about him, his
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:59.840]   subtlety, his deceitfulness, his cleverness. And he came as an angel of light, and he's continued
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:05.200]   to do so ever since. And he deceives men and women. Here's a term that is used so often about
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:13.360]   sin, the deceitfulness of sin. That is the most horrible thing about it, the way in which it
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:22.400]   deceives us and invades us into its positions, and we're not aware of it. The deceitfulness of sin
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:28.560]   it comes, and thus with its vain words it deceives us. Well, now, this morning I'm
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:36.560]   particularly anxious to show you that these words were never more true than they are at this present
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:45.200]   hour. Let us look at the situation. Modern men glories above everything else in what he calls
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:56.800]   his knowledge, his learning, his understanding. He believes that he rarely has understood life,
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:05.920]   and that he has a true view of life. And in that connection, there is nothing perhaps
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:11.200]   on which the modern men, the typical modern men, so prides himself and congratulates himself,
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:18.800]   as on the way in which he has emancipated himself from religion. Religion, he says,
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:27.440]   is of course a kind of superstition, belongs to the infancy of the race, characteristic of men
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:34.000]   in its primitive condition. And the accompaniments, the concomitants of religion always have been
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:42.720]   the spirit of fear, the spirit of slavery. Men under religion is the creature of taboos
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:50.800]   and fears, which have all been imposed upon him. But now the modern man feels that he's grown up,
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:56.800]   and he's grown out of all that, he's shaken off all this incubus, he's got rid of these taboos,
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:03.600]   he's got a scientific, healthy, manly view of life, he uses his intelligence and his learning.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:09.760]   And thus, I say, he congratulates himself on the emancipation which he has achieved.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:17.520]   What is the result of this? Well, the result of this is
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:28.720]   that he derides and dismisses the old standards, especially the old moral standards,
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:37.920]   and laughs at them, and ridicules them. Things which were regarded by everybody a hundred years
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:45.600]   ago, and even more recently than that, as sin beyond any question. The modern man not only
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:53.520]   does them, but he defends them. Indeed, he goes beyond defending them. He advocates them.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:01.440]   He actually goes as far as to say this, that a man who doesn't do these things is a man who's
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:10.000]   to be pitied. He's still infantile. He's still subject to the taboos of religion. He's still
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.240]   mid-Victorian in his outlook, that's a common way of putting it. He's a creature who is
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:22.720]   really underdeveloped, he hasn't grown up to full maturity. You see, of course, people in the past
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:27.200]   used to regard these things as wrong, and they used to regard them as sin, and they were not
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.840]   mentioned, and these things were taboo. But of course, they say, by now we've discovered,
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:38.240]   with our researches and our scientific development in particular, that man is a creature who's been
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:44.880]   made up and constituted in a certain way, and what he should really do is to give expression,
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:51.040]   to give evidence of these powers and propensities and faculties that are within him.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.600]   So they say, and this is their deduction, what used to be called sin is really nothing but a
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:03.520]   man expressing himself, really living a full life, not living a kind of mutilated, truncated life,
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:09.600]   as our forefathers did, but really a man coming to his own and living and expressing himself
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:14.880]   and giving evidence of that which really does belong to him and is part and parcel of him.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:24.080]   In other words, everything today is regarded as natural, and we are told more and more that
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:30.000]   we mustn't distinguish between things as being natural and unnatural. Everything is natural.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:37.280]   Everything a man does is ultimately natural. And therefore, I say the final conclusion is
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:42.400]   that not to be exercising or to be giving expression to these natural instincts and
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:51.840]   powers that we have, well, is, if there is such a thing, sinful. The greatest sin of today is
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:58.960]   not to express yourself, not to be natural. You see, we've reached a position which is almost
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:04.400]   the exact opposite of that which obtained, shall I say, about a hundred years ago.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:12.640]   Now, I'm analyzing all this because it is my object to show that it is this outlook and
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:18.960]   mentality that is responsible for all our major troubles, and indeed our minor troubles at the
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:25.840]   same time, because this outlook, this approach, leads to certain results. And here are some of
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:38.240]   them. There is this new tendency in life to explain what used to be called sin in terms
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:46.640]   of variations of the normal, or in terms of disease.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:52.560]   Now, the whole idea today is that there is no such thing, really, as sin,
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.640]   and that we mustn't say that people who do certain things are sinners and are sinful.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:05.600]   No, no, we are told, you must wait a moment, and you must recognize that we're not all identical,
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:11.920]   and that a man does what he does because that's his makeup.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:18.080]   Fundamentally, of course, we're all the same, but when you come to look at us
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:23.760]   in detail, we're not all the same. There are variations in temperament. One man's
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:30.160]   very active, another man is rather lethargic. One is mercurial, and one is phlegmatic. They're
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:35.920]   both men, and essentially, they're made up in the same way. But there are these variations
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:43.200]   within the normal. And you see, this kind of distinction is being pressed all along the line.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:49.920]   One man is more intelligent than another. One is more emotional than another. So,
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.560]   one is more highly sexed than another. Now, they say, it's all right, wait a minute,
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:18:00.480]   man was born like that, and therefore, a man is just to express himself.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:07.840]   And if he doesn't express himself, he is guilty of violating his own being and personality.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:14.880]   Now, they say, you mustn't say that a man who does certain things is a sinner. You've got to
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:21.280]   realize that he's made like that. You mustn't say that what he's doing is unnatural. It's natural
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.640]   for him. That's how he's constituted. The balance of his ductless cleanse is such that that is what
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:31.440]   is natural for him. Now, you mustn't say that that man is a sinner. You mustn't say that that man is
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:37.120]   guilty of a crime. No, no, the man's born like that, and therefore, he behaves like that.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:43.920]   And so, you see, the whole notion of sin has disappeared entirely. Or, as I say, sometimes
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:50.400]   they put it not so much in variations, in terms of variations in the normal, as in terms of disease.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:56.320]   And you must have noticed this creeping even into the arguments in the law courts.
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:04.080]   Now, a man commits a crime, yes, but the defense is this. He really couldn't help it at that moment.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:10.160]   He's in a diseased condition. You mustn't regard this man as a criminal. This man
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:16.960]   really shouldn't be taken so much to court as taken to a hospital. This is a disease.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:22.160]   I could elaborate this at great length, but I mustn't do so this morning. What I'm trying to
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:30.000]   show you is this, that the whole notion of sin and evil and wrong as over against right and truth
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.480]   is gradually disappearing. And with our modern outlook upon life and our modern ideas,
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.920]   all that was formerly regarded as sin and crime is just to be regarded either, I say,
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.880]   as a variation within the normal makeup, or else as an evidence of disease.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:54.720]   Now then, what does all this lead to? Well, this in turn, you see, leads to a relaxation
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:20:02.240]   in the whole notion of discipline. Discipline in the home, discipline in the school,
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:10.320]   discipline in the whole of life in general. Now, the old idea was that you made a child behave
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.480]   himself and that you taught people the three R's, whether they liked them or not, and whether they
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:19.520]   were interesting or not, but that that was the basis of education, and you drummed the three R's
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:27.600]   into them. But of course, we no longer believe in that. We believe now that really these problems
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:34.480]   must be approached psychologically, and the child must be the determiner as to what is to be taught
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.400]   and how is to be taught. Everything's to be made nice and interesting. And if he doesn't want to
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.600]   do arithmetic at the moment, well, you tell him a story and so on. And thus, you see, the whole
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:52.240]   idea of discipline and of ordering and of governing is disappearing. I'm not ridiculing the thing,
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:56.480]   I'm literally stating to you what's happening. This is what is really believed today,
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:02.880]   and it's being practiced in the home, in the school, in connection with work in prisons,
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:10.000]   and I say, with regard to the whole of life. The notion of discipline is disliked today.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.320]   It's regarded as wrong. This idea of freedom comes in, and that men must be allowed to express
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:21.680]   himself, and that there are all these variations. And then, of course, the next step is,
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:27.600]   and it's quite logical, that the whole idea of punishment is going out.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:35.680]   We no longer believe in punishment. Again, in the home, in the school,
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:43.040]   in connection with crime and misdeeds. You needn't take my word for this, you've just got to read
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:49.760]   your newspapers. Everybody is becoming increasingly concerned and alarmed about the increase in crime,
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:56.000]   although I hear that some of the experts are even doubting that, and even trying to explain that
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.640]   away. But in any case, how are they proposing to deal with it? Well, they say, we must not
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:10.720]   only have more prisons, but now we must elaborate and enlarge our means and methods of treating
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:16.960]   these people psychologically. You don't punish them, you treat them psychologically.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.480]   You begin to analyze them, you put them through this deep analysis, you discover
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:27.360]   the hidden springs and motives. They're not criminals, they're not criminals. They're either
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:34.000]   lacking in balance, or else they're actively diseased. So, you investigate it entirely from
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.520]   that standpoint. And now you try to rehabilitate them by getting them to read good literature,
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:46.000]   speaking kindly and nicely to them, and so on. The idea of punishment must be abolished, we are told.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:53.120]   Now, this has been in practice for some time. It's very interesting to notice the people who
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:58.080]   have been originally most responsible for this. It's not without significance, I think,
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:03.120]   that the prime mover in this kind of attitude was the man who was one of the prime movers in
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:09.600]   the appeasement of Hitler. And still they go on doing it, though they saw so clearly that it
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:16.160]   didn't work with Hitler. They still believe it will work with other criminals. But it's all the
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:22.960]   result of this attitude towards life, and towards sin and crime in particular. In other words,
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:28.640]   to sum it up, the whole situation is being regarded from the standpoint of psychology.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:33.040]   We are told that words like sin and crime and punishment
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.040]   are ugly words that ought to be banished out of our vocabulary.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:44.240]   The answer to all that is the sixth verse in the fifth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:51.200]   "Let no man deceive you with empty words." That's exactly what some of these people were trying to
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:57.840]   say at that time. They were trying to explain away what the apostle and the whole Bible describes
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:03.120]   as sin. They were saying, "But you mustn't make a fuss about these things. It's a part of man's
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:07.440]   life. It's a part of man's being. He's been made like this. There's no harm in this sort of thing.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:12.160]   Why not?" Those were the vain words. They were saying, "Look here, you believe in Christ,
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:16.400]   you're redeemed, that's all right. Don't be concerned about these other and lesser aspects,
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.240]   these are only temporary. Your soul is all right, what's it matter what you do in the body?"
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:26.320]   and so on. Those are the specious, vain, empty words with which some of these Ephesians
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:33.920]   were being deceived by these false teachers. As it was true then, it is true today.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:40.560]   All this modern talk, all this modern outlook sounds so clever, but it is nothing, I say,
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.760]   but the deceit of Satan. And I demonstrate it like this.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:51.520]   Is not all this really offensive even to the natural man's best instincts?
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:57.840]   Is there not something even in the natural man that is revolting against all this?
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:08.560]   And yet, you see, this is the thing that is being advocated today. All that I've been talking about,
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.240]   you will see set out at great length in the famous Wulffenden Report.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:18.480]   The main argument of the Wulffenden Report is this, that we must no longer talk about certain
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:23.920]   things as being unnatural. I mean these horrible perversions. They say, "You mustn't say they're
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:30.080]   unnatural, because they're natural for the men who do them." That's the whole basis of the Wulffenden
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:37.360]   Report and the movement to legitimize the practice of some of these horrible, howler, unspeakable
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:43.760]   perversions, even in private. That's the argument behind it, that they're natural for those people.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:50.160]   They're variations within the normal, or else they're disease. It is the explanation also,
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:55.200]   what you read in your papers this last week, that the Lord Chamberlain has at last sanctioned
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:01.600]   the playing of plays that deal with the subject of homosexuality as long as they conform to certain
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:09.840]   rules. Now then, I say, all this is surely offensive even to the natural men's best and
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:18.320]   highest instincts. Not only that, this argument eventually makes of men a beast and insults them.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:25.520]   These views are regarding men as just a collection of ductless glands, just a collection of impulses
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:31.040]   and forces and instincts. They forget this other thing called the soul and the spirit that is in
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:36.160]   men. They reduce men either to the level of a beast, or indeed even lower than that, at times
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:43.600]   almost to a machine. And you can manipulate men and his personality by putting in extra doses of
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:50.560]   this or withdrawing a certain amount of that. But finally, my argument would be this.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:56.880]   There is nothing which shows so clearly that all this is but the deceit of Satan and but
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:02.800]   empty, vain words as the chaos to which this outlook is leading.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:11.760]   Look at the state of the modern world. Look at the state of society. You see, these ideas have
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:16.800]   been in practice for some time. I have no doubt at all that when future historians come to write
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:21.920]   the history of this era in which we live, they will come to this conclusion, that the whole
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:28.240]   cause of our trouble was that unfortunately the authorities have allowed themselves to be
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:36.160]   influenced by this psychological attitude towards life at the expense of the scriptural view of
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:44.480]   life. Education, the home, the hospitals, the prisons, the whole of life, I say, is being
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:51.600]   governed by this false psychological view of men, which takes away the idea of men as a being
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:57.840]   created in the image of God, who is responsible to God and who is to obey God's holy laws.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:04.560]   However expressed, all that has been put aside and men is regarded in this new evolutionary,
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.560]   psychological manner. Very well, there is the first explanation.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:15.280]   The world is as it is on the international level and in the national level and in the groups within
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:24.560]   the nation because man is still being deceived by these vain words that are being put forward
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:29.760]   by Satan. He puts it, of course, very cleverly, as an angel of light. He puts it into the mouths
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:35.760]   of educationists, sociologists, and all these people. Yes, it sounds so good and so wonderful,
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:42.480]   it's so nice and so kind. It seems so much better than the old idea of discipline and order and
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:50.800]   punishment and the division into natural and unnatural and the division into truth and crime.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:29:00.080]   It's plausible. It seems very interesting and attractive, but the only word to describe it,
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:06.720]   I say, is the word of my text, vain, empty words. That's the first thing, but there's a second
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:13.680]   thing. The world is as it is, not only because it's thus being deceived, but because it doesn't
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:24.240]   know the truth about the wrath of God. "Let no man deceive you with vain words, for because of
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:32.400]   these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience." The world doesn't know
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:40.640]   that. And, of course, the sophists to whom I've been referring are particularly sarcastic about
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:46.320]   this notion of the wrath of God. "Ah," they say, "of course, that's it. That's so typical of
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:53.600]   religion. Frightening, alarming wrath of God." For they say, "Our fathers used to be terrified by
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:58.560]   that sort of thing, and as the preachers thundered from the pulpit about the wrath of God, they
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:03.040]   quaked and they trembled, and they decided, 'For Christ and your churches and chapels were full.'"
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:10.400]   But it doesn't work with a twentieth-century man. Twentieth-century men have seen through all that.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:14.000]   He's got this new understanding to which I've been referring. There is nothing, I say,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:21.040]   that the sophist is so anxious to ridicule and to banish as this notion of the wrath of God.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.240]   But there is nowhere, surely,
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:34.960]   where the blindness of modern man is more evident, and where he is being deceived by Satan
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:43.200]   is more obvious than just at this point. What do I mean? I mean this.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:49.280]   Look for a moment at the fact of the wrath of God.
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:56.320]   The fact of it is something that is asserted everywhere in the Bible from beginning to end.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:03.120]   It is something that was taught and preached by the patriarchs, by the kings, by the prophets,
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:09.440]   by the Lord Jesus Christ himself, and by the apostles, every single one of them.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:15.360]   If you don't believe in the wrath of God, I have only one thing to say to you. You don't
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:21.440]   believe in the Bible. You cannot believe the Bible without believing in the wrath of God.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:24.720]   If you take that out, well, then it's no longer the Bible, it's what you think.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.240]   You've made a Bible of your own. It isn't the Bible, it's something else.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:35.680]   But let's be clear as to what the wrath of God is. We mustn't think of it like man's wrath.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:42.400]   Man's wrath is something terrible and horrible. It's uncontrolled rage, it's temper,
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:48.000]   it's violence. No, no, it isn't that at all. There's nothing uncontrolled about the wrath of
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.680]   God. Do you know what the wrath of God is? It's this. It is his attitude towards evil and sin.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:32:05.920]   It is his displeasure at sin. It is his hatred of sin. It is his settled hatred of sin.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:15.440]   The wrath of God is God's declared determination to punish sin.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:20.560]   Now, that's not my idea. That's exactly what is taught in the Scriptures.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:29.920]   The wrath of God, I say, we must understand as the reaction, if you like, of the everlasting
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:36.000]   and eternal God, who is holy and everlasting in his holiness, to sin and evil.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:42.320]   To that which originated in the devil and which he has feisted upon the human race
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:48.000]   and brought into the life of the world. God hates it with all the intensity of his divine and
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.080]   eternal being. He can have no dealings with it. And he has revealed it from the very beginning
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:59.040]   that he is going to punish sin and evil. It is his settled attitude.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:08.160]   That is the meaning of the wrath of God. But now, here is the vital question.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:16.560]   How and when is this wrath manifested? And you notice the word,
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:27.680]   "For because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience."
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:34.080]   Now, I'm putting that to you as a question. How and when
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:40.720]   does this wrath of God come upon the children of disobedience?
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:50.320]   And here, it seems to me, is the terrifying relevance of all this to this particular morning.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:58.240]   When does the wrath of God come? When and how is it manifested? The first answer to the question is
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:07.120]   now, in the present. He doesn't say, you see, that the wrath of God shall come upon the children of
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:13.040]   disobedience. He deliberately uses the present tense. It cometh. It's a continuous present.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:18.080]   It includes the future, as I'm going to show you. But it isn't only the future.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:24.720]   It includes the present. And it is because the world doesn't understand this, I say,
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:29.680]   that it is as it is, and it goes on living as it goes on living. The wrath of God is something
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:35.200]   that comes in the present. How does it come in the present? Well, like this. The moment you sin,
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:42.720]   you have condemnation of conscience. The moment you sin, at once you feel it. That's a part of
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:48.800]   the wrath of God against sin. The feeling of remorse, what is it? It's a manifestation of
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:58.800]   the wrath of God. Then think of this. Think of the sufferings that come from sin, physical suffering.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:07.600]   The so-called mourning after the night before, it's a part of the wrath of God against sin.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:12.240]   It's God who's ordained that you misuse your body, you'll suffer for it.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.600]   You talk about your pleasure, I remind you of your pain. Physical consequences of sin and evil
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:26.800]   and wrongdoing, it's a part of the wrath of God. It is the God you see who, when men sin,
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:31.920]   cursed the ground and broilers and thorns came up and diseases appeared, that was a part of God's
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:37.200]   punishment for sin, and it's still continuing. You put your finger in the fire and don't squeal
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:44.160]   when you get the pain, and when you've got a sore and it festers. Sin and evil lead to
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.560]   consequences, and they're a part of the manifestation of God's wrath. And then think
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:55.760]   of the mental suffering, this remorse, I say. This agony of mind, think of the mental suffering
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:00.960]   caused to others. Think of the unhappiness in the world this morning because of sin.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:09.200]   Think of it in terms of family life, bitterness, the unhappiness, and the wretchedness.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:16.160]   That all come from sin. Think of the confusion in life, the moral muddle and confusion,
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.640]   and all that that involves. Indeed, I can sum it with the word of the Old Testament,
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:27.120]   "The way of the transgressor is hard." It's God who's determined it. And men chant sin and get
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:32.000]   away with it. No, no, the way of the transgressor is hard. Or listen to the other one, the word
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.320]   uttered by Moses, you remember, to those two and a half tribes that wanted to settle on the other
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:42.720]   side of Jordan. He said, "If you don't do what you say you're going to do, be sure your sin will
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:52.320]   find you out." And it does find us out. It may take years, but it always does. Be sure your sin
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:57.920]   will find you out. But not only that, there is active chastisement. Read your Old Testament,
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:04.400]   see how God punished individuals. See how he punished nations, even the nation of Israel,
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:11.600]   his own people. He punished them. He sent them into captivity. He punished kings. He brought
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:17.680]   them down. God has punished. It's here in history, and in the history of the world in general.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:24.800]   But of course, it is a doctrine and a truth that is taught explicitly in the New Testament.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:29.760]   For instance, at the communion service, there are those words that we read, "For this cause many are
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:34.960]   weak and many are sickly among you, and many sleep." "Because some of you people in Corinth,"
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:39.440]   says Paul, "haven't examined yourselves before coming to the communion table. Some of you are
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:45.040]   ill, some of you are sick, some of you have died." It's a part of God's punishment of sin.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:51.520]   Yes, says the twelfth chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews, "Whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth,
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:38:01.680]   and scourgeth every son whom he calleth." The wrath of God manifested in the present against
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:06.960]   sin and evil. But there is something I want to call your attention to on the national and the
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:11.920]   international level, indeed on the level of the whole world. I'm going to take you to the Romans,
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:19.200]   epistle to the Romans, chapter 1, and I'm going to read to you three verses. Verses 24, 26, and 28.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:31.520]   Verse 24, "Wherefore God also gave them up unto uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:38.240]   to dishonor their own bodies between themselves." Do you realize what that means? What he says is
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:45.440]   this, that because these people didn't glorify God, neither were thankful, but became vain in
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:51.360]   their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:56.640]   became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:02.080]   corruptible man and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things. Wherefore, because of that,
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:10.080]   God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonor their own
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:15.840]   bodies between themselves. Go on, "Who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:22.800]   served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen." Verse 26, "For this cause
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:32.880]   God gave them up unto vile affections." God gave them up unto vile affections, "For even their
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:39.360]   women did change the natural use into that which is against nature, and likewise also the men,
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:45.840]   leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another, men with men
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:53.520]   working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:40:00.560]   was meat." God did that to them. And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge,
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:09.040]   God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient,
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:13.680]   being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness,
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:19.520]   maliciousness, full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whisperers, backbiters,
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:26.080]   haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:32.880]   without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful,
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:38.480]   who, knowing the judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death,
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.680]   not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:52.720]   The apostle says all that to expound what he'd said in verse 18, "For the wrath of God is,
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:59.040]   has been revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men that
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:05.520]   hold down the truth in unrighteousness." He says that's why the ancient world was as it was,
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:11.360]   that's why paganism was the thing that it was, that's why you Romans were once like that until
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:17.680]   the gospel came to you. God gave you over, he gave the world over. Mankind rebelled against him,
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:22.480]   turned its back on him, thought it was wise, thought it understood. God gave them up. He took
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.960]   away his restraining grace and he's allowed them to wallow in their filth.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:34.560]   Didn't you feel as I read that terrifying passage that I might very well have been reading a
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:40.640]   description of the modern world? Of course it is. It's a perfect description of the modern world
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:45.600]   and that's why I'm calling your attention to all this this morning. The world is as it is today
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:52.160]   because it's sin and because God is punishing its sin. You see for a hundred years and more now
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:59.200]   man has been boasting about his cleverness. It all started back there about 1860, 1859 if you like,
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:05.040]   Charles Darwin and his origin of species, the scientific view. Man no longer a special
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:10.880]   creation of God but evolving apart of the animal. They turned their backs on God and on God's view
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:16.800]   of men and of life and of the world and they took up their own philosophies and they arrogantly
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:22.800]   rebelled against God. And what's happening with all our education and knowledge and culture?
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:29.600]   What's happening is that the world has again become as Paul describes there in that second
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:35.440]   half of the first chapter of the epistle to the Romans. That's what you're reading of in your
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:40.320]   newspapers and now you see they're going to make it legal through the Wilfredine Report if they put
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:45.760]   it into practice. It's all being justified and it'll get worse and worse and you can bring in
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:50.000]   your psychology and build your prisons and do all you like and you won't touch it.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:59.040]   God gave them over to a reprobate mind. It's one of God's ways of dealing with this world
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:03.920]   when he doesn't listen to the pleadings of his gospel. God abandons it, withdraws himself,
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:09.040]   and the world gets into a foul and horrible state that at last it's awakened and it begins
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:14.240]   to plead for mercy and it turns back to God. That's the message of the Bible.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:20.880]   And I'm just trying to show you see that all this is the one and only adequate explanation
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:25.840]   of the state of the world at this very moment. I don't hesitate to make this assertion.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:32.400]   I believe we've had these two world wars in this century
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:37.120]   as a punishment to the arrogance and the pride
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:42.400]   and the vanity and the folly of mankind from about 1864.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:49.840]   The whole world had ceased to believe in God. It believed that man was immortal,
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:54.800]   nothing he couldn't do. By acts of parliament he could legislate in paradise and God wasn't
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:59.840]   necessary and all this was dismissed and relegated to some limbo forgotten thing.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:06.880]   I believe that God, I say, has withdrawn his restraining grace
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:15.600]   and is allowing mankind to reap the consequences of its own arrogance, sinful rebellion.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:22.000]   God is showing man what he really is. He's showing him his size, he's showing him his
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.400]   moral nature, he's showing him that he's lost and doomed apart from him and his redeeming grace.
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:33.680]   The world doesn't know about the wrath of God
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.560]   and as long as it doesn't, things will continue from bad to worse.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:44.560]   How idle it is to try and be optimistic and to say that what we want is a spirit of love and
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:48.560]   of brotherhood and of friendship. Go back and think of the sacrifices of the great war,
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:53.520]   put that into industry, nobody will do it because man is sinful and selfish.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:45:02.000]   He's a rebel against God and he's got to be humbled. God's wrath is being revealed in this
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.520]   very generation in which we live against all ungodliness and righteousness of men. Yes,
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:12.560]   it isn't only present, it will be revealed in the future also. It's bad enough now,
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:17.680]   but there's more coming. What is it? The second coming of Christ, the end of the world,
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:24.880]   the judgment of the whole universe. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the neglected, the derided
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:30.000]   Savior will come back into this world. He'll be riding on the clouds of heaven
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.640]   and he will come back, I say, to judge the whole world in righteousness.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:41.680]   Listen again to 2 Thessalonians 1, beginning to read at verse 7, "When the Lord Jesus shall be
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:48.880]   revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:56.240]   not God and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall be punished with everlasting
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:46:02.720]   destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power, when he shall come
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:10.240]   to be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all them that believe in that day."
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:15.520]   The world ridicules this, I know. They call me a fool for preaching it. Let them say what they
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:21.760]   like. They ridiculed Noah. They ridiculed Lot before Sodom and Gomorrah. They ridiculed John
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:26.560]   the Baptist. They ridiculed the Son of God. They've ridiculed the prophets always.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:34.000]   That doesn't matter. This is God's Word and God's truth. Can't you see it, I say,
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.120]   being manifested upon the modern world and upon modern men? Well, if you do see it there,
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:47.440]   believe the rest. The world is under the judgment of God. His wrath is upon it,
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:53.920]   and Christ will return and he will destroy all evil and sin and all who belong to that kingdom.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:59.120]   "There shall be a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:08.320]   Those who belong to the kingdom of Christ and of God shall be made like him and shall reign
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:16.960]   with him in glory throughout eternity." This, you see, applies to all. "The wrath of God cometh
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:25.680]   upon the children of disobedience." If you were a child of disobedience, it will come upon you.
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:32.800]   It will come upon the mass of them, constituting the doomed, the rejected world. It's universal.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:42.160]   It is also individual. What then are we to do, says someone? It's quite obvious, isn't it?
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:47.760]   If you realize that all your suffering and pain and agony
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:52.000]   are due to the fact that you've disobeyed God,
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.720]   that you're a rebel against him in your heart and in your life,
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:03.840]   if you realize it and go to him and confess it and acknowledge it, which means repentance,
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:12.080]   and if you then tell him that you believe his gracious message concerning his only begotten Son,
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:18.480]   whom he sent into this world to deliver us from this present evil world that is under his doom
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:28.160]   and damnation, he will forgive you. He will receive you. You see, my friends, we're all of us,
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:34.960]   as I said at the beginning, either in the world and adopting its mentality and sharing its life,
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:39.840]   or else we have an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:48.240]   And if we are in that kingdom of Christ and of God, we have nothing to fear. Let the third world
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:54.800]   war come. Let hell come. Yes, let the final judgment come. We are safe. We already belong to
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:49:04.640]   him. There's no smugness about that. But if we are not there, I say we are here. We are in the world
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:10.160]   that is under his wrath, the world that is revealing his wrath more and more and will lead
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:19.760]   to that utter final ultimate doom. Oh, there's only one thing to do, I say. It's what the apostle
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:25.520]   tells these Ephesians to do in the next verse. "Be not ye therefore partakers with them."
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:33.360]   Don't stay there. Don't share their life. Realize what it's leading to. Turn away.
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.760]   Run from it. Flee from the wrath to come.
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:43.360]   Humble yourself before God in utter penitence and contrition.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:54.400]   Ask him to have mercy and pity upon you. Repent and believe the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:50:04.000]   And you will not only be forgiven, you will be given an inheritance in his glorious and everlasting
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:11.600]   kingdom. Oh, may God open all our eyes to the truth. And may we dedicate ourselves this morning
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:21.520]   to incessant prayer on behalf of the world that is being deceived by vain words.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:25.120]   Christian people, you and I are called to open its eyes,
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:32.400]   to show them the deceit and the folly and the vanity of their position and what they believe.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:37.120]   Let us pray to God then to give us power to do so. In other words, let us pray for a revival.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:43.920]   Let us pray that the Spirit of God may so descend upon the church, that she today,
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:51.600]   as God enabled her to do two hundred years ago, and indeed in 1859, to rise up with such power
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:59.920]   and to proclaim the truth in such clarion calls and terms that even the dead shall be awakened.
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:06.480]   You cannot reason with people who are deceived by the devil. It needs the trumpet call of God.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:12.000]   It needs the power of the Spirit. Let us, therefore, I say, dedicate ourselves to
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:19.840]   incessant, continued prayer for an outpouring of the Spirit of God, that we may make the truth
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:29.040]   known to the blinded peoples, the blinded nations, and their leaders, and so they may be saved
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:37.440]   from the wrath to come and begin to live a life to the glory of God. Amen.
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:45.840]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
