[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680]   Well, I'm going to ask you to turn back to Mark chapter 4, and there are quite a few
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.480]   things on my heart to say about this, and we'll trust the Lord to give us direction
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.800]   to cover the things that are most helpful.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.160]   This is another in our series of conversations with Jesus.
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.180]   This is a conversation Jesus has with His disciples, including the twelve, as is noted
[00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.920]   in the text that I read earlier.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:41.940]   And it's a very important conversation because it addresses an issue that had really struck
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.160]   them severely: the Messiah had come.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.640]   They knew Jesus was the long-awaited Messiah.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.140]   He had demonstrated His love for them.
[00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:03.100]   He had demonstrated His divine nature by daily miracles, power over demons, disease, death,
[00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.780]   and nature.
[00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:15.620]   And there were just no challenges that His miracles could not overcome, clearly supernatural.
[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:23.120]   The miracles drew massive crowds, even in this case such a massive crowd that they forced
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:30.600]   off the shore into a boat just to put a little distance between Himself and the pressing
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.560]   crowd.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.620]   He had basically garnered unparalleled popularity.
[00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.040]   Never anybody in Jewish history so popular as Jesus.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.440]   He banished illness from the land of Israel during the years of His ministry.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.100]   He also taught the Jewish community.
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.100]   He taught the Jewish community.
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.100]   He taught the Jewish community.
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.100]   He taught the Jewish community.
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.100]   And He taught with profound wisdom the likes of which no one had ever heard before.
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.000]   And the disciples are there for all of that.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.280]   And they, along with Peter, are convinced that you are the Son of God.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.480]   You are the Messiah.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.040]   You are the Lord.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.600]   And not only that, but you have the words of life.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.080]   This is the messianic moment that all history has been waiting for.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:32.320]   But what was so difficult for them to grasp was that the response of their nation was
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.940]   so superficial.
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.700]   It was actually a kind of exploitive response.
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:50.860]   They were willing to exploit Jesus as far as fulfilling their desires would take Him:
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.060]   feed us, heal us, and so on.
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.940]   They were willing to ask for more of us, but don't ask any more of us than that.
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.940]   Very superficial response.
[00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:10.540]   In fact, John sums it up: "He came unto His own, and His own received Him not."
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:22.160]   Their exploitation of Jesus, their superficial interest in Him grew to become hostility.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.040]   That hostility grew to become hostility.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.360]   That hostility grew to become hatred.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:35.320]   That hatred reached a point where they collectively said, "We will not have this man to reign
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.720]   over us."
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.040]   And they screamed, "Crucify Him!"
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.100]   Their hostility escalated all the way to the cross.
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.160]   It has already begun by the time you get to the third chapter of Mark, if you look back
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.020]   at verse 6.
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.100]   "For the Lord has said, 'I will not have you, and I will not have you, and I will not have you.'"
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.140]   And the Lord said, "I will not have you, and I will not have you."
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.140]   And they were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.140]   But they were afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.140]   They were afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.140]   They were afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.140]   And so, the Lord said, "I will not have you, and I will not have you, but I will have you,
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.140]   and I will have you, and I will have you, and I will have you, and I will have you, and I will have you."
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.140]   And they were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.140]   But they were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.140]   But they were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.

[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.

[00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.

[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.140]   They were not afraid of the Lord.
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:40.680]   So the church is suffering not unlike the disciples with trying to figure out what do
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:48.640]   we have to do to start this movement up at a level that we would like it to be.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:54.460]   How do we crank up Christian response?
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.100]   How do we actually change the world?
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.300]   How do we change cities and countries?
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.300]   What's happening?
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.300]   What's happening?
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:03.300]   What's happening?
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.300]   What's happening?
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.300]   What's happening?
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:10.180]   Well, this is the very question that the disciples were holding in their minds when Jesus spoke
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.980]   what He spoke in Mark 4.
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:19.300]   And this is a kind of a Magna Carta on the growth of the kingdom, a kind of a Magna Carta
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.860]   on how to do evangelism.
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:27.540]   And the things that He says here also appear in Matthew and Luke.
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:33.300]   So three times in the four gospels, this particular passage.
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.300]   "And the Lord said, 'I will give you a kingdom, and you will be able to do it.
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.300]   And I will give you a kingdom, and you will be able to do it.'"
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.300]   And this is the kind of a message that the disciples are trying to convey to the disciples
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.300]   that they're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.

[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:39.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.300]   They're not afraid of the Lord.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:23.300]   And it's explicit in verse 28, "The soil produces crops by itself," automatae in Greek,
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.500]   "automatically."
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:28.400]   The soil produces crops automatically.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:34.520]   That word is rare, but it's also used in Acts 12:10 where the angel came to release Peter
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:41.300]   from prison, and the door opened automatae, automatically, to let him out of the prison.
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:49.300]   All the farmer can do is show up in verse 29 when it's time to harvest.
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:56.520]   He has no role to play as the crop grows by itself, first the blade, then the head, then
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.240]   the mature grain in the head.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:03.100]   No farmer gives life.
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:07.200]   No farmer energizes cell division, multiplication.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.280]   It's all God's work.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:20.460]   We have no role to play but to wait and enjoy the harvest.
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:24.500]   So sow and sleep.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.280]   People ask me occasionally, "Do you sleep well?"
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.440]   The answer is, "I do.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.700]   I sleep very well."
[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.440]   But I'll promise you one thing.
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:37.580]   If I thought that anybody was going to be left out of heaven because of some failure
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:41.260]   in my strategy, I couldn't sleep at all.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.260]   I was not going to be left out of heaven.
[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.260]   I was going to be left out of heaven because of some failure in my strategy.
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.260]   I was going to be left out of heaven because of some failure in my strategy.
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.260]   I was going to be left out of heaven because of some failure in my strategy.
[00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:52.640]   The success of the gospel does not depend on our power to give life or to manipulate.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.780]   Life is divinely automatic.
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:00.720]   That's where we have to start.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:05.340]   It's going to happen because God has His power in His truth unleashed in the human hearts.
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.340]   It's going to happen because God has His power in His truth unleashed in the human hearts.
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.340]   It's going to happen because God has His power in His truth unleashed in the human hearts.
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:08.340]   It's going to happen because God has His power in His truth unleashed in the human hearts.
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.340]   I'm going to read a passage from the New Testament that I read recently.
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.580]   It's going to happen because God has His power in His truth unleashed in the human hearts.
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:12.860]   That is beyond us.
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:19.140]   We sow, and then we enjoy the harvest.
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:24.220]   So with that in our minds, I'm going to have you look back at chapter 4.
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:30.960]   And the Lord is going to give us four attitudes that we should maintain.
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:39.320]   The first is we are to approach evangelism humbly, humbly, because it's not in our power
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.840]   to change hearts.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:45.160]   It's not in our power to change hearts.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:56.500]   And that is proven in this parable starting in verse 3, parable of the sower and the soils.
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:04.000]   The sower goes out to sow, in verse 3, and some of it falls on the road, beside the road.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.800]   It's hard packed, and it doesn't penetrate at all.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.300]   And the birds come and eat it up.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:16.500]   Other soil is rocky soil, verse 5.
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:22.060]   And when seed falls on rocky soil, it can only go down a little bit because the soft
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.040]   dirt is only at the top, and below is bedrock.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:32.720]   Immediately it springs up because it has no depth of soil, so it looks responsive.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:39.280]   But after the sun has arisen, it is scorched because it has no root; it can't penetrate
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:43.460]   the water; it withers away.
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:48.400]   And then other seed fell among the thorns, verse 7.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:53.000]   The thorns, or the weeds, come up and choke it, and it yields no crop.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.580]   So you have three fruitless soils.
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:09.260]   And then you have the good soil, in verse 8, that has fruit that is abnormally productive:
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.240]   a hundredfold.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:13.120]   And that's shocking.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:17.340]   Those numbers are ridiculously beyond anything that would be expected.
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:25.780]   But the message here is the gospel has the power to do the things that are supernatural.
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:34.240]   The power of life transformed by God is far greater than we might expect.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.380]   So our Lord says in verse 9, "If you have ears, listen.
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:39.240]   Do you get it?
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.320]   Do you get what I'm just telling you?"
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.620]   I know all of you don't.
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:47.040]   He explains that in verses 10 to 12.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:53.280]   But to the disciples, verse 11, it's been given to understand the mysteries of the kingdom
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.460]   of God.
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:26:01.120]   Those who are on the outside, they just get parables, and it obscures the things that
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.740]   the disciples understand.
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.380]   How do the disciples understand them?
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:09.220]   Because they have ears to hear, and because the Lord explains them to them.
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:20.460]   And so in verse 13, He says to them, "Do you understand this parable?"
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.600]   How will you understand all the parables?
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:27.780]   In other words, this is the one that will help you to understand all the rest.
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:32.540]   So the Lord begins His explanation in verse 14: "The sower sows the Word."
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.540]   What is the seed?
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.540]   It is the Word.
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:35.900]   It is the Word.
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:37.400]   Who is the sower?
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.200]   Anybody who sows the Word.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.540]   Anybody who spreads the Word.
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:45.680]   The seed is the Word of God.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:52.480]   Luke 8:11, "The seed is the Word of God," in the parallel passage in Luke.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.440]   It is the gospel revelation.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.580]   You go into the book of Acts, starting in chapter 4 all the way through chapter 13,
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:04.860]   and repeatedly it says, "And the Word spread, and the Word of God spread, and the Word of
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:09.180]   God spread, and the Word of God went forth," etc., etc., etc.
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.220]   That's the development of the church.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:14.020]   That's the building of the kingdom in the book of Acts.
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.860]   It's the Word of God going forth.
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:21.740]   To those who are perishing, the Word of God is foolishness; but to those who are being
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:28.360]   saved, it is the power of God unto salvation, 1 Corinthians 1 says.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.620]   So the sower is anyone who sows.
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:37.180]   And please note, there are no adjectives to describe an effective sower; it's just a sower.
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.160]   There's no distinguishing.
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:44.660]   There's no distinguishing between the sowers, because the success of the seed does not depend
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.440]   upon the strategy of the sower.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:51.740]   It depends upon the nature of the seed, first of all.
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:56.580]   So nothing is to be said about the sower.
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:03.560]   So the sower needs to know one thing: the seed is the Word of God, and so that's what
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.840]   you sow.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.140]   It's not about you and your cleverness.
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:12.640]   It's not about you and your design.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.940]   It's about the seed.
[00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:22.960]   Anyone who throws seed, anyone who casts gospel truth is a sower.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.400]   The power is in the seed.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:34.080]   Seed is created by God, spiritual seed, in the Scripture, not to be altered, or you're
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.960]   going to come up with a mutation.
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.120]   Don't tamper with the gospel to make it more palatable.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:53.860]   Touch the seed in any way, alter the seed, and it has no power.
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.900]   So it's pretty simple when you think about how the kingdom grows.
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.040]   It grows by the Word of God.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:03.740]   Now the third issue is obviously the soil, the soil.
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:04.740]   What are we talking about?
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.780]   What is this soil?
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:09.100]   In the parallel text of Matthew 13, it says, "The soil is the soil of the earth, and the
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.100]   seed is the soil of the earth."
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:14.840]   And if you look at Matthew 13, it says, "That which is sown in the heart."
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.700]   So the heart is the soil.
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:21.480]   So I have a sower, seed, and the heart.
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:30.440]   We have someone who proclaims the gospel, the gospel itself, and the heart.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:34.300]   And there are several different kinds of heart conditions.
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:39.080]   First, there are fruitless heart conditions.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:43.140]   And then there are fruitful heart conditions.
[00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:49.680]   The fruitless ones we see in verse 15.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:56.920]   The ones who - the seeds that are sown beside the road where the Word is sown, when they
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:02.500]   hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the Word which was sown in them.
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:09.060]   This is as if they hear the Word, but it sits on the surface, easily snatched away.
[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:10.060]   And then there are the fruitless ones.
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:15.100]   They are the ones who are taken away by Satan who controls their lives with his lies.
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:20.020]   These are unresponsive people, callous people, hard people.
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:23.700]   This is the fool of Proverbs 1.
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:34.280]   This is the unplowed heart, the unprepared heart, the indifferent heart, the hard heart.
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.840]   And nothing is going to happen.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.040]   But secondly, there is the ungrateful heart.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:44.620]   This is the rocky heart in verse 16.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:50.680]   The ones on whom seed was sown on the rocky place - and that means rock bed below the
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:31:00.740]   surface a little bit with just a surface amount of soil - sown there, these who have
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:09.020]   it sown on their rocky hearts, when they hear the Word, immediately receive it with joy.
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.680]   But they have no firm root in themselves.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:19.260]   Because of the rock underneath the surface, the roots cannot penetrate to the water, so
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.180]   it's only very temporary.
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:26.820]   And when affliction or persecution arises because of the Word, immediately they fall
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:28.160]   away.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:34.940]   Now, these are people who are impulsive, emotional.
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:39.000]   This is a kind of a selfish response to the gospel.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.440]   This is the danger of appealing to people's problems.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.120]   Would you like Jesus to fix your problem?
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.760]   Well, I'd like somebody to fix my problem.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:52.500]   Jesus, I suppose, would be as good as anybody if He can do it.
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:58.880]   This is the danger in appealing to people's felt needs.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.040]   Would you like to be happy?
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.280]   Would you like a better marriage?
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.400]   Would you like a better job?
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.160]   Would you like purpose in your life?
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.660]   Would you like soul satisfaction?
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:08.980]   Would you stop being lonely?
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:09.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:10.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:11.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:12.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:13.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:14.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:15.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:16.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:17.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:18.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:19.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:20.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:21.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:22.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:23.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:24.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:25.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:26.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:27.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:28.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:29.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:30.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:31.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:32.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:33.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:34.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:35.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:36.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:37.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:38.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:39.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:40.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:41.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:42.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:43.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:44.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:45.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:46.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:47.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:48.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:49.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:50.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:51.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:52.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:53.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:54.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:55.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:56.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:57.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:58.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:32:59.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:00.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:01.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:02.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:03.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:04.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:05.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:06.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:07.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:08.980]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:11.680]   Would you like to be a better person?
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:19.920]   You can't take it, and so you become part of the deconstructing crowd.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:25.360]   Jonathan Edwards in his Masterful Treatise on Religious Affections, which he wrote in
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:33.700]   1746, said he was very concerned to make it known that fallen human nature is fertile
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:37.320]   ground for fleshly religiosity.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.960]   He said, "I'm not afraid of anything.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.180]   I'm not afraid of anything."
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:47.320]   Which is impiously spiritual and ultimately rooted in self-love.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:52.920]   It's like, do you love yourself enough and want for yourself something better than you
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:34:00.100]   have enough to come to Jesus so that He can give you what you want for yourself?
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:06.600]   That's the convoluted approach of the supposed gospel.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.940]   High emotional experiences, Edwards said.
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:16.240]   Effective, gushy religious talk, even praising God, even experiencing some kind of emotional
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:25.080]   feeling for God or for Jesus can be self-centered and totally self-motivated.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:33.500]   But in contrast to that, experiences of genuine renewal by the Holy Spirit are God-centered.
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:38.920]   You come not saying, "I want something for myself," but pounding on your chest.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:42.540]   Saying, "God, be merciful to me, a sinner.
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:49.500]   I deserve nothing."
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:59.100]   Genuine experiences, genuine repentance, genuine faith produces humility, Edwards said.
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:02.100]   Humility, not pride.
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:08.900]   Meekness, not self-satisfaction.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.080]   Humility, not self-sacrifice.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:19.800]   This is particularly true when the gospel is presented as if it was enough to move somebody's
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.860]   emotions.
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:26.340]   And in order to do that, they usually have to take out the hard parts of the gospel.
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:33.080]   So the person gets the promise of something that is going to give the sinner what the
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:37.760]   sinner already desires in his flesh.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:38.880]   And it's explained in a text.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.920]   It's explained in a totally inadequate way.
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:43.920]   And what does it do?
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:51.840]   It produces false conversions, which lead to deconstruction and hashtag ex-evangelicals.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:36:02.640]   No, the Scripture says you have to be willing to do this: deny yourself.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:07.120]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:09.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:10.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:11.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:12.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:13.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:14.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:15.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:16.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:17.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:18.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:19.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:20.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:21.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:22.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:23.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:24.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:25.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:26.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:27.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:28.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:29.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:30.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:31.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:32.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:33.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:34.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:35.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:36.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:37.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:38.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:39.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:40.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:41.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:42.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:43.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:44.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:45.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:46.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:47.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:48.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:49.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:50.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:51.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:52.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:53.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:54.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:55.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:56.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:57.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:58.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:36:59.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:00.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:01.860]   "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself."
[00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:02.860]   That's the starting point.
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:18.200]   You can be drawn to that attractive Jesus, but never have truly resisted self-will, personal
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:28.960]   desire, the hankerings of the flesh, and never have exercised genuine repentance.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:32.840]   Those things are hard, and that's why it's a struggle to do.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:37.800]   You have to genuinely enter the kingdom.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:44.220]   The third fruitless soil our Lord lays out in verses 18 and 19 weeds.
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:48.140]   The seed is sown.
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.960]   They hear the Word.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:55.200]   It looks like a response, but the worries of the world, the deceitfulness of riches,
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:58.280]   and the desire for other things enters in, chokes the Word.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.940]   It becomes unfruitful.
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:02.820]   This is another pathway to deconstruction.
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:13.200]   This is not so much just the emotional issues that we saw in the second soil.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:21.380]   This is the distractions of the age, the distractions of the world.
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:30.220]   It's dangerous, by the way, to import those distractions into the church, and think that
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:32.800]   if you can bring the world into the church…
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:39.460]   You can gain a hearing from people and then transfer them to the kingdom.
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:46.580]   The problem is if you seduce them by the distractions that are already dominant in their hearts,
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:50.700]   you've done them no favor.
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:55.740]   You've legitimized the very things that they must abandon.
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:39:02.780]   No, the proof of real salvation is not a speedy response.
[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:07.240]   It's not a quick response and somebody saying, "I feel happy now."
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:11.020]   Not temporary joy.
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:21.760]   No, it's when you have dug deep in your own heart, and the repentance is real, and you
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:31.060]   understand that salvation is not for your fulfillment, but for God's glory; and when
[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:32.760]   you turn your back on it, you understand that it's not for your fulfillment, but for God's
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.760]   glory.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.760]   It's a real conversion.
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:35.760]   You turn your back on the flesh and the world.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:44.600]   Edwards said, "True conversion is marked by humble, brokenhearted love for God."
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:53.980]   1 John, "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world; they have no
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:40:02.740]   part in the desires of a true believer."
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:05.740]   The desires of the saint are humble desires.
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:07.740]   "Humble hope," writes Edwards.
[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:12.820]   "Humble, brokenhearted joy that leaves the Christian more poor in spirit, more like a
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:16.840]   little child, more disposed to lowliness."
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:31.420]   True grace reaches to the very bottom of the heart, countering, forfeiting sin, depositing
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:32.720]   grace.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:37.720]   True grace is the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:40.720]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.720]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:46.720]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:49.720]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.720]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.720]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:58.720]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.720]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.700]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.700]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:06.700]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:07.700]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:08.700]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:09.700]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:10.700]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:11.700]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:12.700]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:13.700]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:14.700]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:15.700]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:16.700]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:17.700]   It's the greatest of all the things that are in the world.
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:25.220]   But then look at verse 20 in the good soil, quickly: "There are those on whom seed was
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:31.700]   sown on the good soil, and they hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit thirty, sixty,
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:38.820]   and a hundredfold." The good soil has to be prepared by the Lord. Listen to Deuteronomy
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:46.660]   30, verse 6: "The Lord will circumcise your heart to love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:51.700]   with all your soul, so that you may live." The greatest command: "Love the Lord your God with
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:58.020]   all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind." And God has to say, "He will circumcise your
[00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:06.660]   heart to love Him that way." That's why in the New Covenant text of Jeremiah 31 and Ezekiel 36,
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:15.620]   it says that God speaking, "I will give you a new heart. I will put My Spirit in you. I
[00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:24.420]   will transform you. I will write My law in your heart." Heart work is God's work.
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:32.180]   So the first thing we have to do in approaching the matter of advancing the kingdom is to do so
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:38.260]   humbly. Secondly, obediently, and these are very brief, obediently. What do you mean by that?
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:44.580]   Well, what I mean by that is precisely what in verse 21 our Lord says: "A lamp is not a lamp, but
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:52.260]   a lamp is not brought to be put under a basket, is it?" Or under a bed. "Is it not brought to be
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:43:02.180]   put on the lampstand? For nothing is hidden except to be revealed, nor has anything been secret but
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:09.060]   that it would come to light." Here's the second thing: "You are to present the glory of the gospel
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:12.660]   obediently." You're to let your light shine. "Get it out from under the basket, and let it shine. Get
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:12.660]   it out from under the basket, and let it shine. You are to present the glory of the gospel obediently.
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:12.740]   You are to let your light shine. Get it out from under the basket, and let it shine. Get it out from under the basket,
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:12.820]   and let it shine. You are to present the glory of the gospel obediently. You are to let your light shine. Get it out from under the basket, and let it shine.
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:15.620]   Get it out from under the basket, and let it shine. Get it out from under the bed."
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:26.100]   That's the point. Those things are absurdities. You don't put a lamp in a place where the light
[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:34.500]   can't be seen; you put it where it can be seen. So in our humility, we also have responsibility to
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:40.180]   obediently let the light shine. "Let your light shine, so that men may see your good works and
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:40.900]   glorify your Father who is in heaven." "Let your light shine, so that men may see your good works,
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:40.900]   and glorify your Father who is in heaven." "Let your light shine, so that men may see your good works,
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:40.900]   and glorify your Father who is in heaven." "Let your light shine, so that men may see your good works,
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:40.900]   and glorify your Father who is in heaven." "Let your light shine, so that men may see your good works,
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:44.500]   and glorify your Father who is in heaven." Matthew 5 and then Philippians 2,
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:53.220]   "You shine as lights in the dark and corrupt world." 2 Corinthians 4, "Let the light of the
[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:59.780]   glory of gospel of Jesus Christ shine through you." So this calls for obedience.
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:10.740]   Don't hide the message. Reveal the message with boldness, obediently proclaiming faithfully,
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:21.300]   communicating the message. That's verses 21 and 22. And that is our second attitude.
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:36.180]   And it should be obvious that this is so clear that he adds in verse 23, again, the reminder,
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:42.740]   "Are you listening? Did you get it? Did you hear? You do have ears to hear. Understand,
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:48.980]   you're supposed to make sure the message, the light is being seen."
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:57.700]   So we approach ministry in the advance of the kingdom humbly and obediently. Thirdly, diligently,
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:08.500]   diligently. Verse 24, "And he was saying to them, 'Take care what you listen to.'" Again,
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:15.620]   "Are you listening?" He keeps saying that. "By your standard of measure, it will be measured to you,
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:29.140]   and more will be given you besides." Diligently. We are to be diligent because we know
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:40.660]   that our usefulness is proportionate to our obedience. Our reward is proportionate to
[00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:46.340]   our obedience. Look back at verse 24. It's this simple, folks: "Take care
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:55.620]   to know this: you set the standard by which you will be measured." By your standard of measure,
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:46:01.060]   it will be measured to you. In other words, your eternal reward for advancing the kingdom
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:05.060]   will be in direct proportion to the level of your commitment.
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:14.500]   This is another truism. This is axiomatic. Usefulness in gospel ministry is proportionate to
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:23.060]   the seed sown. It's proportionate to the obedience. 2 Corinthians 9:6, "Sow sparingly, reap sparingly."
[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:31.940]   "The more you sow," verse 24 says, "the more will be given you besides."
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:42.660]   What do you mean? Your reward, your reward will be given based upon the measure of your commitment.
[00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:51.940]   And if you're not going to be faithful to proclaim the gospel,
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:55.860]   the Lord will bring in His elect by means of someone else.
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:47:01.060]   But in verse 25, He even goes further and says, "For whoever has,
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:08.020]   to him more shall be given." In other words, there's no limit. You've been faithful, you receive a reward.
[00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:08.020]   You've been faithful, you receive a reward. You've been faithful, you receive a reward.
[00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:08.020]   You've been faithful, you receive a reward. You've been faithful, you receive a reward.
[00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:08.100]   You've been faithful, you receive a reward. You've been faithful, you receive a reward.
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:08.180]   You've been faithful, you receive a reward. You've been faithful, you receive a reward.
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:08.260]   You've been faithful, you receive a reward. You've been faithful, you receive a reward.
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:08.340]   You've been faithful, you receive a reward. You've been faithful, you receive a reward.
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:14.100]   There's no limit. You've been faithful, you receive a reward. You be more faithful,
[00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:18.900]   you'll receive more reward, and more, and more, and more, unbounded.
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:28.100]   But on the other hand, "Whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him."
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:33.220]   What is this referring to, "whoever does not have"? Well, Luke puts it this way:
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:37.140]   "What he thinks he has shall be taken away."
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:38.020]   What is this referring to? "Whoever does not have." Well, Luke puts it this way:
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:38.100]   "What he thinks he has shall be taken away." What is this referring to?
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:38.100]   What is this referring to? Whoever does not have.
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:38.100]   What is this referring to? Whoever does not have.
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:38.180]   What is this referring to? Whoever does not have.
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:38.180]   What is this referring to? Whoever does not have.
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:38.260]   What is this referring to? Whoever does not have.
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:38.980]   What is this referring to? Whoever does not have. What does that mean?
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:38.980]   Whoever does not have. What is this referring to? What is this referring to?
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:40.580]   What is this referring to? What is this referring to? You remember Matthew 7?
[00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:44.340]   "Many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, we did this, we did that in Your name.
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:49.300]   We proclaimed the truth, we did many wonderful works in Your name.' And He says, 'Depart from Me,
[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:58.180]   I never knew you, you workers of iniquity.'" If you're a true disciple, and you're sowing the seed,
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:04.580]   in the measure that you sow, it will be measured back to you more, and more, and more, and more.
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:08.020]   But there's another category of people, again, the
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:15.940]   fruitless, false disciples. Even though they spoke the gospel, even though they
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:25.700]   used the name of Christ, as Matthew 7 says, there is no reward for them.
[00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:34.100]   They may think they have a reward coming, but what they think they have will be removed.
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:37.780]   They may think they have a reward coming, but what they think they have will be removed.
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:42.420]   Only condemnation. "Depart from Me, you workers of iniquity."
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:49.540]   And it's true. There are people who have come to Christ from a gospel message presented by a false
[00:48:49.540 --> 00:49:01.300]   Christian, a false prophet, a fraudulent preacher. But there's no reward for the fakes,
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:07.300]   only condemnation. So we sow and we sleep,
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:13.060]   and we advance the gospel humbly, obediently, and diligently, and finally, confidently.
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:17.860]   It sounds a little bit daunting. It doesn't seem to be working out that well.
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:23.940]   But that's not the final picture. Go to verse 30. Here's the final picture.
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:30.180]   He said, "How shall we picture the kingdom of God?" Where's it going to end up? What's the final
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:37.060]   picture? "How shall we picture the kingdom of God?" Where's it going to end up? What's the final picture?
[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:37.700]   "How shall we picture the kingdom of God?" Where's it going to end up? What's the final picture?
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:48.500]   Look like? By what parable shall we present it? How can I illustrate the end, the finale?
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:58.660]   It is like a mustard seed, which when sown upon the soil, though it is smaller than all the seeds
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:05.700]   that are upon the soil, yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:06.820]   plants and forms larger than all the garden plants and forms larger than all the garden plants and
[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:07.380]   forms larger than all the garden plants and forms larger than all the garden plants and forms large
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:17.540]   branches so that the birds of the air can nest under its shade. What is this saying?
[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:29.060]   We sow and sleep humbly because we know that the results don't depend on us. We sow and we do so
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:34.980]   obediently because we know that there is an eternal reward for our faithfulness. We sow
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:44.740]   diligently and diligently, and here He says we sow confidently because we know that God has already
[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:52.660]   determined a great outcome. You might not see it. You may not see it in your lifetime or in mine,
[00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:57.940]   but ultimately there's a great outcome. And He says, "I can illustrate it this way: a mustard
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:06.100]   seed. That's the smallest seed that was actually planted. It could grow to a fifteen-foot-tall bush,
[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:15.220]   six feet wide, dense, thick, out of one tiny little seed, and strong enough basically to hold
[00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:26.900]   birds in it. That one little tiny seed looked like nothing. The final outcome was way out of
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:36.100]   proportion with the size of the mustard seed. It's essentially microscopic, but it can produce
[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:38.820]   a great outcome. And He says, "I can illustrate it this way: a mustard seed. That's the smallest
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:41.860]   seed that was actually planted. It could grow to a fifteen-foot-tall bush, six feet wide,
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:42.580]   and strong enough basically to hold birds in it. It could produce a great outcome. It could produce
[00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:43.300]   a great outcome. And He says, "I can illustrate it this way: a mustard seed. That's the smallest
[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:43.700]   seed that was actually planted. It could produce a great outcome. It could produce a great outcome.
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:49.700]   He will become King of Kings and Lord of Lords. He will rule over the whole world.
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:57.620]   Every knee will bow to Him. He will subdue every king, every potentate, every ruler,
[00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:05.860]   every president, prime minister. All will fall before Him, and He will establish
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:14.340]   His earthly kingdom where He reigns supreme and rules with a rod of iron over the whole world.
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:19.460]   And then He will create a new heaven and a new earth."
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:30.740]   Just maybe a word from Daniel on this, Daniel chapter 7: "I kept looking in the night visions,
[00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:34.660]   and behold, with the clouds of heaven one like a Son of Man was coming.
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:40.180]   And He came up to the Ancient of Days, meaning God, and was presented before Him.
[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:48.660]   And to Him was given dominion, glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations,
[00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:56.420]   and men of every language might serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion,
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:53:05.380]   which will not pass away, and His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed." Christ will establish
[00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:11.140]   His kingdom. He'll establish it over the entire world, over the entire created universe, and then
[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:20.020]   forever in the new heavens and the new earth. So we sow and sleep humbly, obediently, diligently,
[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:22.500]   and confidently.
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:24.660]   So we sow and sleep humbly, obediently, and confidently. And then we'll see that He's not
[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:25.540]   going to be a man of the dead. He's going to be a man of the dead. He's going to be a man of the dead.
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:28.100]   So we sow and sleep humbly, obediently, and confidently. And so we sow and sleep humbly,
[00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:29.140]   and we'll see that He's not going to be a man of the dead. So we sow and sleep humbly, obediently, and
[00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:29.780]   confidently. And so we sow and sleep humbly, obediently, and confidently. And so we sow and sleep humbly,
[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:30.260]   and we'll see that He's not going to be a man of the dead. So we sow and sleep humbly, obediently, and confidently.
