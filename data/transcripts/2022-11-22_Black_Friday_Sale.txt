[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   Greetings friends, this is Joshua Sheets and today I'd like to let you know about a sale
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.720]   that I'm running on my consulting services.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.840]   Right now for a limited time I am celebrating a Black Friday sale on my personal consultations.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.580]   If you would like to book at a rate of savings of $150 an hour off of my normal rate, go
[00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.520]   to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.980]   That's where you book, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult.
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.000]   That will give you an automated booking page.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.220]   You can see the times that I'm available.
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.900]   You'll just simply choose the time, put in your email address, put in a credit card number
[00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.260]   and the system will bill you and we will be set up to speak at some time over the next
[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.260]   couple of weeks.
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.260]   I'm running the sale.
[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.920]   You guys seem to like the sales.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.260]   My rate over the last year and a half I have billed at a rate when I do consulting at $500
[00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.700]   per hour, which seems like a great rate but the calls trickle in but then when I run one
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.140]   of these sales you all flood in.
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:02.740]   I try to keep the sales moderate in terms of the number of slots but I do love it when
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.740]   I talk to you guys.
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.740]   I really enjoy it.
[00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.620]   I enjoy serving you and I know that many of you appreciate and value the service.
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.460]   The Black Friday sale, savings rate is $150 an hour off so it will be at $350 an hour
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.580]   instead of $500.
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.860]   So again, if you would like to book, go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult.
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.980]   I have opened up a total of 50 slots.
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.140]   There are 50 available slots.
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.740]   Once those 50 appointment slots are filled then the sale will be over and we will be
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.900]   back to normal affairs.
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.620]   Also I don't have any appointment slots available in the future.
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.580]   I'm not saying I won't do it again in the future but we finished up quite a bit of travel
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.580]   this summer.
[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.820]   We are expecting a baby in January and so I don't have any specific plans to bring back
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.820]   consulting in the coming year.
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.860]   So if you would like to talk to me this is the best way for you to do that if you would
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.780]   like to get my insight and my thoughts and my advice on your situation.
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.860]   Always remember by the way, if the consulting calls are outside of your budget or if you
[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.420]   don't mind talking about your affairs publicly, remember that you are also always welcome
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.340]   to call in on a Friday Q&A show.
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.980]   I handle those Friday Q&A shows in a fairly free and open way.
[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.900]   So if you just have a simple or quick question then you would join the Friday Q&A shows.
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.900]   That will be your best deal.
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.460]   But if you would like to talk with me in a comprehensive way, review detailed facts,
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.780]   figures of your situation, then book a consulting call.
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.020]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult.
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.380]   Limited time only, 50 slots available.
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.020]   When those are gone, they are gone.
[00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.260]   Let me share with you a little bit about some of the things that I can do for you that might
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.580]   be helpful and useful to you.
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.260]   So first of all, while I often minimize my personal financial planning credentials when
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.700]   I'm talking about things, I guess I value modesty and I probably should talk about it
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.700]   more.
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.780]   I am a highly credentialed financial advisor with a significant amount of professional
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.780]   experience.
[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.860]   Again, if you want to hear my ability or my advice, just listen to one of the Friday Q&A
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.660]   shows and that's my resume right there.
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.740]   But I do have a long list of formal credentials that are probably more significant than most
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.820]   financial professionals with whom you might interact.
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.860]   I have a master's degree in financial planning.
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.380]   I am a certified financial planner.
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.180]   I have a chartered life underwriter designation as well as a chartered financial consultant
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.180]   designation.
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.140]   I'm a chartered advisor for senior living, specializing in retirement and elder issues.
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.420]   I am a registered health underwriter with knowledge and experience in the health insurance
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.420]   space.
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.460]   I'm a registered employee benefits consultant and a chartered advisor of philanthropy.
[00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.260]   So those are my current formal designations.
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.100]   I haven't added any new ones over the last few years, but I need to get back to the books
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.100]   and add a few more.
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.300]   I have a list of three or four of them that I'm interested in.
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.900]   I may in the future add a CPA designation or an EA designation more likely, as well
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:22.220]   as a divorce consultant designation, as well as one of the college, I'm interested in one
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.460]   of the college planning designations that I think is pretty good.
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.700]   But I haven't added those yet.
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.700]   So we'll see.
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.740]   The point is that I do have a significant amount of professional education in the field
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.420]   as well as extensive practical experience.
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:40.900]   If you'd like to talk to a financial advisor who has a deep breadth, a deep level of education
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.900]   and experience in a wide variety of levels, I'm your man.
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.140]   The most interesting thing about talking to me, however, is that because of the way that
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:57.580]   I do these consultations, we can avoid the vast majority of conflicts of interest.
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.860]   I do not sell any financial products.
[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.980]   I no longer have an insurance license.
[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.060]   I no longer have any securities licenses.
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.300]   So I do not sell any financial products.
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.540]   The only thing I sell is my advice.
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.800]   And when you buy my advice, you buy it specifically on an hourly basis.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:25.660]   You can book as many hours as you like with me if you want to speak to me, but I do not,
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.140]   I'm not offering plans or even enrollment subscriptions or options or things like that.
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.940]   I work with a handful of private consulting clients that I do work with on an ongoing
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:42.660]   basis with regular weekly coaching calls, but that's not something that I make publicly
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.660]   available.
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.500]   That's something that I hand select the people to whom I offer that, who all enter the door
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.340]   with an hourly consulting call.
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.140]   So I very rarely offer that.
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.580]   So the vast majority of my work is just simply done on the basis of a one-hour consulting
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.620]   call.
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.580]   So what that means to you is that we can avoid the vast majority of the conflicts of interest.
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.420]   You can be confident that I'm not going to show up to sell you something that you don't
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.420]   need.
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:14.680]   I'm not, and I have no financial incentive to give anything other than my honest opinion.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:20.340]   And so the way it works is, the way consulting calls work is I give you my email address
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.900]   and you're welcome to email me in advance any notes that you want to do, want to make.
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:31.140]   Most of my consultees will spend some time writing out one to three pages of narrative
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.700]   about their situation, their background details.
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.400]   They'll provide me with a balance sheet.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.520]   Some people will provide me with account statements, things like that.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.460]   And I review all of that information prior to the call.
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.260]   Then we show up to a scheduled call.
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.460]   It happens on Zoom.
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.780]   And we show up to a scheduled Zoom call.
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.060]   And in that scheduled Zoom call, I am available to answer any questions, give any advice,
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:58.320]   give any comments, give any feedback, etc. about any area that is of interest to you.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.140]   You are welcome to record the call so that you can reference it later.
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.740]   You can make any notes that you like.
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.380]   And when the call is over, then we're done.
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:12.060]   And so it's a great and appropriate way to do it.
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:18.860]   As I've talked about in public shows where I've commented on hourly financial consulting,
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.860]   etc., I think that this is a very useful service to have available where it allows a financial
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.420]   advisor to give his opinion in a way.
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.140]   But it's not a huge moneymaker.
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:36.640]   And I know that sounds, if you're earning $30 an hour, I know it sounds bizarre and
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.620]   out of touch for me to say it's not a huge moneymaker when I bill normally at $500 an
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:42.620]   hour.
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.440]   It's not though.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.580]   And what I mean by that is the amount of other work that goes into this kind of business
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:54.740]   to attract those clients is so significant that while I'm certainly very grateful and
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:00.740]   honored to be able to earn a significantly above average salary, the easier money in
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.700]   financial services is selling products.
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.620]   But I've chosen to sell my advice instead.
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.620]   And I appreciate those of you who recognize that and who just want the advice.
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.500]   So the point is that I will provide you with my opinion.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.940]   I'll give you my advice.
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.180]   One of the things I'm very good at is telling you exactly why I think what I think.
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:26.100]   You're welcome to hear it or to reject it, however you like.
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:31.380]   But I'll always tell you exactly why I think this is the answer to your question.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.540]   And then you can judge it for yourself.
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.500]   So that's how it works.
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:41.580]   My experience having done this for a number of years, here are some of the most common
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:47.060]   areas that I hear, most common areas of discussion that I wind up having.
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:53.860]   Number one is I wind up providing a second opinion in many cases for other advisors'
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.540]   input.
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:01.820]   Very frequently when you are working with a financial advisor, especially with sizable
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:06.500]   accounts or large transactions or large purchases, it's nice to get a second opinion.
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:12.220]   And so I can provide and do provide a second opinion, an unbiased opinion.
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:16.960]   If you want to check up on your other advisors, then I'm happy to do that.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:22.100]   The only thing that I legally can't do because I do not maintain any securities licenses
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.660]   is I cannot provide any commentary on specific investments.
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:32.380]   I can't tell you to buy or sell a stock or a mutual fund that would approach the type
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.340]   of business that is necessary for licensure.
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.300]   And so I can't tell you specific, "Oh, sell this stock and buy that one."
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.300]   That's a licensed occupation.
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:45.420]   What I can do is provide general background on things like asset allocation.
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.260]   I can talk about risk profiles.
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:52.020]   I can talk about things in a generalized way without specifically telling you to buy or
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.260]   sell an investment, specifically a security.
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:01.820]   In addition, I can't tell you to buy or sell an insurance policy because I'm not licensed
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.780]   anymore to sell insurance.
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:09.180]   And again, that's an activity that is restricted to licensure.
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:14.300]   So I can provide background information, general ideas on insurance.
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:22.100]   I can explain to you everything from a very broad perspective and I can give you the background
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.420]   so that you can make your decision.
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.460]   I just can't tell to you, "Hey, you should sell this policy and go buy this one."
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:31.620]   I don't even provide any referrals to insurance agents to minimize that conflict of interest.
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.620]   I could.
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.620]   I've thought about it many times, but at the moment I don't provide referrals to insurance
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.300]   agents or brokers or anything like that.
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.700]   So it's just simple.
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.940]   So I can go pretty far.
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:44.220]   I just can't specifically make a buy or sell recommendation because that's something that
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:48.700]   you would need a license for and I no longer have those licenses.
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.900]   So it's common that I'll provide a second opinion.
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.300]   Another common area is talking through retirement planning.
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:11:01.180]   I find that a significant number of my audience members are interested in topics relating
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:05.240]   to early retirement or even just traditional retirement.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.360]   And so I have spent quite a lot of time consulting on these topics.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.640]   In my experience, a component of that is kind of a financial readiness index.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.560]   So we go through and we talk about, "Are you financially ready?"
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.600]   But I'll tell you, I'll just give it to you straight.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.400]   The vast majority of times when somebody calls me, they are ready.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:32.100]   What I have found that is more common is that I talk with people about unique ways to go
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.560]   far beyond being ready.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.480]   As you know, I'm not a big fan of retirement per se.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:44.480]   If by retirement we mean the traditional concept of just work until you're 65 and then quit
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.680]   and do nothing and watch TV.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.800]   Now obviously no one does that, but the point is that this is the idea that some people
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.800]   have.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.800]   My listeners don't.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:58.680]   Where I have really come to excel over the past years is with providing an alternative
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:05.720]   viewpoint to help people to see the freedom that they have and then use their life in
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.600]   a more productive way.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.440]   So sometimes that means personal pursuits of enjoyment, travel, etc.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.440]   I love to travel.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.400]   I've provided, you know, talked to people about travel sometimes.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.400]   But often it means ways of giving back or ways to structure your life so that you don't
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.400]   have to retire.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.640]   I've developed a real skill set in that area of really helping people.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:32.680]   Ironically, this has resulted in my being able to help people feel a lot richer earlier.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:37.200]   It's interesting how many people there are, especially in the United States and Canada
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.520]   and other wealthy countries.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.640]   There's so many people that have, you know, half a million dollars saved, a million dollars
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.640]   saved.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:51.440]   And they can't retire if by retire what we mean is quit and do nothing.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.200]   But what they can do is they can reinvent their life.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:59.000]   And I'm really good at helping you think through the issues, clarify what your desires are,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.240]   and then give a practical financial plan that will help you to do that.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.200]   So that's fairly common discussion.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.240]   And that can benefit people of all ages.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:14.240]   I've really enjoyed working with many people in their 30s and 40s and basically help people
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:20.240]   to get out of the trap of thinking that you got to work until you're 65 and you can reinvent
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.880]   things significantly.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:28.160]   Another very common area of discussion over the last few years has been the world of internationalization.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.600]   I never set out to become kind of an international consultant.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.920]   I pursued it because I was interested in it for myself.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.840]   And then I've shared with you on the show some of the things that I have learned because
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.560]   I believe that it solves a significant number of problems.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.480]   And I have sold a number of courses over the years.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.840]   I still have one, right?
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.840]   Internationalescapeplan.com.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.080]   That's available on the market right now.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.800]   And so that's available.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.660]   But what I have found over the years is that probably 20% of my calls now relate to something
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.600]   related to internationalization.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.800]   And while I don't profess to be the world's most knowledgeable expert, I admire and respect
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:12.100]   the people who have large businesses built in that scenario, I've developed quite a bit
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:17.320]   of practical expertise having done this stuff myself now for a good number of years and
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.400]   having studied it pretty intensively.
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:25.520]   So if you think there's any component of internationalization that could be helpful to your plan, your freedom,
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.520]   then I'd be happy to work with you on that as well.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.520]   What is internationalization?
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:35.320]   It often refers to getting second citizenships so you have freedom in case your country imposes
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.760]   a draft or comes out with some onerous law saying where you can travel and where you
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.000]   can't travel or what medical freedoms you have or don't have, things like that.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.880]   Relates to second residencies, getting the legal permission to go and live in another
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.640]   country so that you have multiple options, places you can live.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:58.160]   And sometimes those residencies turn into citizenships, etc.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.120]   Relates to international banking, how to set up international accounts, international bank
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:07.160]   accounts so you have diversification of your money, diversification of your currency.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.440]   Sometimes we get into gold storage, things like that.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:16.880]   We do a good amount of Bitcoin consulting with this course that Gabriel Custodia and
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.880]   I have developed.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:21.860]   We've done a good bit of Bitcoin consulting and how to buy Bitcoin privately and anonymously
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.720]   and that's a component of internationalization in some cases.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.960]   And then sometimes just international living.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:34.200]   How can you live well, get more bang for your buck, earn in dollars, spend in pesos, enjoy
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.640]   a more freedom-oriented and interesting international lifestyle.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.800]   And I often share personal details on consulting calls that I don't share in public just to
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.120]   protect the privacy of my family.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:50.760]   And so that's a component of things as well.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.480]   And it's been fairly popular and I really have enjoyed that.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.440]   And another benefit is I don't have any, I don't make any commissions, I don't refer
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.160]   business, I don't have lawyers that I'm working with, etc.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.920]   I don't think that's a problem for those who do.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.640]   I'm just telling you I don't.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.120]   And so I respect the many good consultants who have gone out there and developed those
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.680]   relationships and brought those specific things to perspective.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.000]   If that's what you're looking for then I encourage you to engage with another consultant.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.520]   I'll just tell you my hard-won experience from having spent tens of thousands of dollars
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:27.760]   tromping around the world with four children in tow and kind of setting this stuff up.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.760]   I have done it successfully.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:34.280]   I have over the last, coming up on three years, no more than three years now, over the last
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:41.120]   three years of tromping around the world I've set up multiple residencies, multiple citizenships,
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.240]   multiple bank accounts diversified around the world.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.680]   I've done it.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.360]   And there's something about having done it that gives you a little bit more perspective
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.360]   on it.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.720]   And so that's another component.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.120]   There are many other things as well.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.200]   I tell you who I don't get the, I do a good amount of career planning.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:02.240]   In the past I've sold a course on career planning and it's not a huge component but I wish there
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.240]   were more.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.440]   I have often wished for, one of the things I love about running a sale is it makes my
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:15.240]   services more accessible for people who are perhaps not yet mega wealthy or who are not
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.680]   accustomed to paying kind of normal professional rates for financial advice.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.680]   And so from time to time I'm thrilled when I get a call from somebody who is young, who
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:28.600]   is getting started, somebody who maybe is doing fine but wants to go to the next level
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:36.200]   because we can really get into next level career advice, really focusing on how do you
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:41.160]   turbocharge your career, interesting kind of national global opportunities, changing
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.600]   industries, etc.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:49.640]   So if you earn money, you know in my career and income course the entire focus is on tax,
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.720]   10xing your income in 10 years or less.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:57.440]   And I can personalize that advice for you in a really effective way.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.560]   And I promise your money will be very well spent.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:07.720]   So there's more I'm sure but again my work is, I mean it's all public right?
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.720]   You can assess for yourself.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.280]   If you're listening to this I don't know what I could do to convince you.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.600]   You can go and listen to my podcast.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.320]   If you can't afford the money then just go and listen to the 900 episodes of Radical
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.560]   Personal Finance, it's all available for free and most of the great ideas are probably sprinkled
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.560]   in there.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:28.960]   If you want the right place for consulting, quick lesson for you on how to engage properly
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.160]   with services.
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:36.000]   When you are young, there are two aspects of it.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.800]   Number one has to do with age and time versus money and the other thing has to do with spending
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.880]   money to cut out time.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:50.000]   So first, when you are young, most young people have quite a lot of time and not a lot of
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   money.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.360]   And so when you are young, one of the best things that you can do is be careful with
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:00.800]   your money and focus on frugal options to absorb information.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:06.640]   This is why for young people we encourage extensive reading, extensive listening of
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.880]   free materials, podcasts, YouTube videos, etc.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.440]   Gain the information that's out there and then think about applying it to yourself.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.360]   As you get older, your time starts to get much shorter and your money starts to get
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.020]   more significant.
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.960]   And as your income increases, one of the secrets is to always take your income and invest it
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.640]   back into yourself.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.800]   And so it's hard to come up with a proper number but I would say something like 5% of
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:35.880]   your income is what should be invested into yourself and into your own knowledge and skills
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.120]   on a regular basis.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:42.000]   You can go higher than that if it allows and I don't have a perfect formula for that but
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.880]   I've always aimed for about 5%.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:51.560]   And so what that means is if you're earning $50,000 then 5% of that is of course $2,500.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:58.160]   And so your annual budget, in my opinion, of investing into yourself should be about
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.160]   $2,500.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:06.840]   Now that money can be very effectively spent largely on group level courses.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:11.960]   Books are your best value in terms of information density per dollar spent.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:16.960]   You can get a $10 or $20 or $50 book and get massive information density for that.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:23.000]   And so maybe you spend $100 a month on books, that comes out to $1,200 a year.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   That's half your budget.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.480]   In most cases, for somebody who's getting started there, your other budget should be
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.160]   spent on things like classes.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:36.520]   Those can be digital courses, classes, seminars of various kinds.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:42.320]   And most of this should relate to your primary income generating activities.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:51.280]   And so your course selection should be connected to your job, your career, either your current
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.920]   one or the one you would like to move into.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:21:03.000]   And so you can pretty easily spend $2,500 a year on books and on courses, etc.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:10.640]   If you start hiring people at $500 an hour, that could be useful if those people are really
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.420]   good and can really deliver.
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.620]   But you can burn through money pretty quickly at that rate.
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:19.560]   Now as your income goes up, usually due to age, let's say you're earning $150,000 per
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:25.080]   year and you're targeting spending 5% of your budget on yourself and on your improvement.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.440]   That's $7,500.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:33.440]   Pretty quickly it becomes much more difficult to spend that on generalized advice.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:40.120]   And as you advance in your career, it becomes much more profitable to spend it on experts
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:45.120]   in specific focus industries and focusing on your life.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.540]   So you might still spend $1,000 a year on books.
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:53.240]   You might spend $3,000 a year on conferences.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:22:00.640]   But your budget still now needs to... now you're going to wind up hiring personal consultants.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.040]   And by the way, I use this term very broadly.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.120]   It shouldn't all be a financial advisor.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.880]   Financial advisor might be one component of it, but it might be a personal trainer.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.880]   It might be a therapist.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.040]   It might be a career coach.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:16.360]   It might be an industry expert who can advise you on something related to your career.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.400]   This varies depending on the person.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:27.000]   The point is as your income goes up, then now you can get more usefulness from personalized
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.280]   advice.
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:34.480]   The other aspect of this is your general knowledge will now allow you to better assimilate and
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.120]   act on personal advice.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:40.560]   Let's use a health and weight loss example.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:47.280]   If you have... let's say you're fat and you're out of shape and you want to improve your
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.720]   health and physique.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.760]   Well, probably just about any program will do.
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:56.720]   Meaning anybody who's gone together and put together a program, that'll do.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.440]   Any book you pick up from the bookstore is probably a good place to start.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:04.520]   And any generic thing is ideal for you.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:11.120]   But as your skills grow, then you need more and more specific advice.
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.120]   So compare...
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:15.200]   I don't know, who do we pick?
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.640]   The Rock.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:22.720]   So when Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson was a young lad, then he could just go to the gym, pump
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:27.840]   iron and make gains, go out with his buddies, eat normal food, etc.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:33.880]   As he got older and his income increased, then his body became a more and more crucial
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.400]   part of his personal brand.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:43.000]   And as his muscular development increased, then he needed more and more expertise to
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:50.040]   advise him on his personal muscular development.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:56.800]   And so at this point, he has the world's greatest personal trainer who is looking at his movie
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:04.480]   roles, thinking about his physique and designing very, very careful exercise regimes that are
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:13.160]   tailored specifically to his needs and his body's ability to grow muscle, to lean out,
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:17.280]   to fatten up, whatever it is that's appropriate for the roles that he's engaging in.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:21.440]   He's got at least, I mean, probably a team of doctors, but he's got personal doctors
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.520]   who are overseeing his personal health, all of his biomarkers.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:33.640]   He's got world-class doctors with chemical expertise who are supervising his supplement
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:38.280]   stack, his drugs, his, you know, the steroids and testosterone and everything.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.720]   And they're carefully watching it.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:44.840]   They're watching his liver results, trying to balance his, again, his drug stack with
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.040]   his personal health, etc.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:51.600]   He's got trainers that are people who are dedicated to making sure that he always has
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.800]   his gym set up, his personal assistant.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.240]   He travels with the gym when he goes on set.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.800]   He's got a personal chef who cooks all of his meals exactly to his macro requirements
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.360]   as laid out by his dietician, etc.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.520]   And the point is, you know, this is just one example.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.720]   It's no different from a professional athlete, etc.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.040]   But you don't need, he didn't need any of that when he first got started.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.520]   He needed that down the road, but he didn't need that when he first got started.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.720]   When he first got started, he just needed to be in the gym lifting weights.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:25.480]   And at virtually all levels of performance, you find the same themes.
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.640]   If we continue picking on The Rock, right, with his acting.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:32.360]   In the beginning, he was probably a very poor actor, certainly was a very poor actor.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.520]   And so he, any generic acting coach was appropriate for him.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:42.200]   And as he passed along, then he progressively moved up to better and better coaches.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.000]   And I don't know anything about his acting coaches, but no doubt he has the world's best
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.840]   team of them that are appropriate, some hired by him, etc.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:56.360]   And so as your economic engine grows, then the amount of money that you spend on things
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.160]   increases.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:05.400]   And what you do is you move from generalized advice to personalized advice.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:09.800]   And it's the same in virtually all areas of success.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:14.320]   Your physical coaches, your doctors, your trainers, etc.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:23.240]   Your mental coaches, whether it's a therapist, a business coach, a performance coach, etc.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:28.560]   Whether it's coaches and advisors for your specific industry.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:32.800]   In some cases, if you're in sales, then it's sales training and sales coaches.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.760]   If you're in science, then it's the world's greatest scientific minds and who's going
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.600]   to be my PhD mentor, etc.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.600]   Or who's going to be my post-grad mentor that I'm going to publish with, etc.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.240]   Every industry has its own wrinkles.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.760]   The point is that as you grow, you move from this generalized knowledge to the specific
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:52.760]   knowledge.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.120]   Now here's the other aspect, though.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:27:01.240]   The thing that I have never...I've never known exactly how to say or to model.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:06.000]   I haven't built the perfect mental model for it.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.880]   There's no doubt that when you're young, you have more time than money.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:20.580]   And yet, can a high-priced coach save you a lot of time so that you get more money faster
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:24.380]   when you still have the time?
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.080]   My answer is I think so.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.080]   I think so.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.640]   And I want to qualify that.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.000]   You need to look at it usually.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.320]   In many cases, the thing that the coach might say is, "This is not necessary."
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:46.960]   If you're not 55 years old trying to maintain the super-jacked superhero physique, or if
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:51.720]   you're not trying to put on 50 pounds of muscle in one month so that you can star in a role,
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:57.100]   you don't need the world's greatest chemical advisors on what drugs to put into your body
[00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.720]   to help that to happen.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:03.320]   You just need someone...and so that expert would say, "No, you're not at this level.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.320]   You don't need that.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.640]   You should just go to the gym and be in there three times a week and lift, etc."
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:15.620]   But along the way, paying for information and better advice will often help you make
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:17.280]   more progress.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:23.280]   And I like to believe, and I've got a good stable of satisfied clients who would affirm
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:30.800]   this, but I'd like to believe that I can help you cut a lot of years off of your journey.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.780]   What I think is not helpful, again, is those like, "Okay, every week."
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.680]   For example, I mentioned that I do some coaching.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.480]   I work with zero employees in that.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:43.580]   It's all entrepreneurs because employees don't have enough things they can do on a week-by-week
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.840]   basis to change things dramatically.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.360]   Entrepreneurs do, employees don't.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:53.960]   But the point is that even if you are just getting started, if you think that I might
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:58.220]   be able to provide you with some useful ideas, I'd love to help you shave years and years
[00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.760]   off of your success path.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:05.520]   I often wished that someone had come along and told me at 15 some of the things that
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.800]   I can tell a 15-year-old.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:12.600]   And I wasn't smart enough to go out and look for the information, so I wish different for
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.600]   you.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.160]   I think that sums it up.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:20.200]   The point is that as you're thinking about consulting, do what makes sense for you.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.560]   I guess I should add other things.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:26.160]   I do work with people on occasion who are in financial duress.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:30.080]   In most cases, people who are in financial duress, if your situation is small and simple,
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:35.320]   you should just go and pay your bills, increase your income, decrease your expenses, pay off
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.160]   your debts.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:42.560]   But if you're in a real bind, many times there are things that you can do, whether it's making
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.680]   a plan to play hardball with your creditors so that you can get your feet back under you
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.680]   or whatever it is.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.760]   I have worked on occasion with people in that situation.
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.080]   So when I put this on sale, it's a good value for you as well.
