[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.220]   I do have a question about recovery and it's one that I think most people are familiar
[00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.540]   with themselves, which is soreness.
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.900]   We think of it as a muscle soreness, but I was trained early on in my scientific career
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.940]   to always question the seemingly obvious.
[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.300]   So a couple of questions about soreness.
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.500]   First of all, what does soreness really reflect?
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.500]   Is it really muscle soreness?
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.020]   It feels like it's in the muscles, but what other organ systems and tissues and cell types
[00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.580]   does it involve?
[00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.780]   And then I'm particularly interested in this concept or this experience that many of us,
[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.380]   including myself, had, which is delayed onset muscle soreness.
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.460]   Why would it be that when we are less in shape or when we perform a movement that is extremely
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.660]   novel to us, the soreness seems to arrive after a reasonable delay of maybe even a day.
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.180]   You know, we're fine the next day, but then 48 hours later, we are exceedingly sore.
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.940]   And as we get more fit or more familiar with the movement, the soreness seems to arrive
[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:07.940]   earlier.
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.100]   So I realized I just asked you about three questions or more.
[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.980]   First of all, what is muscle soreness at a cellular level, which cells, which organ systems
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.460]   and so forth?
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.500]   What does it mean if we are sore is something I know we'll get into a little bit later.
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.180]   And then why the delayed onset muscle soreness?
[00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.740]   It's actually one question.
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.740]   So it's totally fine.
[00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.780]   You answered all, you asked all three because I'm going to actually answer number three,
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.260]   which will answer number two, which will actually answer number one.
[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.340]   I'd love to tell you that I set it up that way intentionally, but I'm just happy to hear
[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.900]   that where I was unable to be concise, you are able to be concise.
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.900]   Thank you.
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.900]   Yeah.
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.560]   We are still learning a lot about this area.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.540]   It's actually really difficult to perform these studies.
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.220]   Anytime you ask a question about something like pain or soreness, you're immediately
[00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.900]   talking about perception.
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.140]   And there is obviously a physical component to that, and there's also perception.
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.020]   And so teasing those things out is extraordinarily challenging.
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.060]   That said, there has been a lot of work in this area.
[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.580]   And in fact, probably you may have a show already out on pain or maybe one's coming
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.660]   down the road.
[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.480]   We did an episode on pain a while ago, but it's definitely time to revisit that literature.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.480]   I also have some amazing colleagues at Stanford who work on pain, both from the cellular and
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.520]   molecular side, but also from the psychological side about how our understanding of pain and
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.400]   what we believe about pain shapes the experience of pain and pain relief.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.400]   Amazing.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.760]   That stuff is incredibly important, and I'm glad we flagged that, and maybe we'll just
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.760]   call that good for now.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.320]   They can come back later for another one of your shows.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.960]   So that being said, why does it happen 28 to 48 hours after you exercise?
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.520]   Well, that actually should give you some clues into what's happening.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.120]   So the traditional dogma of delayed onset muscle soreness is what this is called, is
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.920]   that it is a result of "micro tears" in the muscle.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.760]   And so you can sort of think, I challenged the muscle, there were some small tears in
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.400]   there and I'm feeling the results of that.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.680]   Well, in fact, that certainly does happen, and it can happen.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.200]   That is not what's explaining your muscle soreness, and in fact, you can be quite sore
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.040]   from exercise and have no measurable amount of muscle damage.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.360]   And so much like anything else, when we're in this idea of pain, it's not a one-to-one
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.980]   explanation.
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.960]   There are multiple factors that are probably causing your perception of pain.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.800]   Muscle damage can be one of them.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.080]   It is not the only one, and it is probably, in my opinion, though this is yet to be shown
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.660]   definitively, probably not even the leading cause of it.
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.760]   And so what's actually happening?
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.320]   Well, the reason it's taking you 24 to 48 hours is you can actually find various papers,
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.400]   literature reviews dating back a number of years now, over a decade, that show these
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.000]   wonderful curves of an inflammatory and immune response, and we don't need to necessarily
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.880]   go through the entire physiology right now, but effectively what's happening is those
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.160]   things have a little bit of a time delay.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.120]   And so some of those steps happen immediately, like right when the exercise is there, and
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.840]   then some of them are delayed 6 to 24 to 48 hours.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.520]   If you know a little bit about this physiology, you have a combination of neutrophils and
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.860]   macrophages and a bunch of things happening, and this has a time sequence.
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.500]   So what happens is by the time we get to this 28 to 48-hour window, now the muscle soreness
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.640]   kicks in, which, wait a minute, if this was a result of my muscles being torn and that
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.800]   happened immediately, wouldn't that pain start immediately?
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.520]   Well, the answer is it would.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.840]   And so that is your first clue that that's not responsible for it.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.640]   When we look at that immune response and we see that that has actually peaked 24 to 48
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.520]   hours later, and then that's the same time the pain kicked in, that's calling you in
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.520]   at the problem.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.360]   So we have this immune response happening in inflammation, then all of a sudden we start
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.060]   getting fluid accumulation, and now there are what are called nociceptors, and you're
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.620]   probably very, obviously you're very familiar with these, and these are your pain receptors.
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.340]   What's actually interesting is we don't necessarily know a lot of information about how many pain
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.740]   receptors are in muscle.
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.740]   They're not really in the belly.
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.040]   In fact, this is why I can perform my muscle biopsies and they don't really hurt.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.460]   You mean in the belly of the muscle?
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.460]   Correct.
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.460]   Yeah.
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.680]   We do have pressure sensors though, and so if you change the volume of the tissue, you
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.300]   will respond to that very, very quickly.
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.580]   So by enhancing swelling in the actual muscle, that is immediately putting pressure on those
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.300]   pressure receptors, if you will.
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.300]   That's the signal.
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.260]   So what's probably happening here, and I just hate to give you another bone, but a lot of
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.620]   delayed on some muscle soreness is probably just a neural feedback loop rather than it
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.620]   is actual muscle damage.
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.620]   Yeah.
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.620]   It makes a lot of sense.
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:53.540]   There's a lot of interactions between the types of neurons that control touch sensation
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.380]   and pain sensation and itch sensation.
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.500]   In fact, a lot of people kind of collapse itch and pain together.
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.500]   Bingo.
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.500]   Yeah.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.900]   You know, that something is painful and it itches is a familiar thing for people, mosquito
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.020]   bites and such.
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:13.740]   And of course, there's the classic gait theory of pain, which people will be familiar with
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:20.140]   and then I'll explain why I'm explaining this, which is if something hurts, you bonk your
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.780]   knee or you stub your toe.
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.460]   We tend to grab that body part and try and rub it totally.
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.260]   And that rubbing is not a coincidental thing.
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:36.860]   It activates a set of touch sensors that are that respond to kind of broad, dull touch.
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.860]   And that actively inhibits through the release of an inhibitory neurotransmitter, the fibers
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.560]   that control the pain signal.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.800]   So anytime we rub a, you know, like a Charlie horse, our leg, or we, or we stub our toe
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.380]   and we, you know, we wince and then we grab the toe and we got like squeezing it a little
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:58.940]   bit, that's actually deactivating or partially inactivating the pain mechanism.
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:06.380]   So the idea that a swelling response would then trigger a neural response that then would
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:13.020]   recruit the pain receptor response here, I'm using broad, broad brush strokes here to explain
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.580]   this makes very good sense to me now.
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.840]   And only now that you've explained how this process works.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.200]   I can actually even add more to that.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.820]   So if you remember how muscles work, so we have to have some sort of signal from the
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.720]   nervous system that has to actually go in and tell the muscle to contract.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.320]   Well, remember there a few episodes ago, we covered the physiology here of what's called
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.320]   a motor unit.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.320]   Okay.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.920]   Well, what I didn't explain to you are called muscle spindles.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.300]   And we have talked about proprioception in an episode of before as well, but we never
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.300]   tied this picture together.
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.180]   So let me walk you through that really quickly.
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.760]   And it's going to tie this loop into a nice bow.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:58.440]   So what happens is this motor unit is coming in from what's called an alpha motor unit.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.920]   And that's going to be innervating your muscle fibers and that's going to tell the muscle
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.580]   fibers to contract.
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:08.600]   Those are typically spread out throughout the all sides of the muscle in interior, exterior
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.600]   all over.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.280]   On the outside though, there is another type of muscle called a muscle spindle.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.640]   Now these are non-contractile, so they don't have that actin and myosin and they don't
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.080]   produce force.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.920]   They are responsive, they are proprioceptive.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.680]   So what that means is they sense stretch.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.200]   And this is why, for example, if you were to stretch a hamstring, stretch any muscle
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:33.400]   group, it doesn't really matter, or muscle, its innate response is to fire back to close
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.400]   that distance.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.520]   And this is what keeps you from, say, if you're leaning to the right, you can imagine that
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.960]   the example we give is if you're standing on one foot and you start swaying to the right.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.800]   All right, let's say you're standing on your right foot, and let's make this easier for
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.800]   folks.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.040]   And you start swaying to the right, like you're going to fall on your right ear, will hit
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.280]   the ground.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.280]   The inside of your right calf muscle will start being stretched.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.000]   The outside will start being compressed, right?
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.400]   So the stretch on the inside of the right calf muscle will sense that stretch and it
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.880]   will respond by contracting.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.500]   That pulls you back to the middle and stops you from falling.
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.600]   That's proprioception.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.640]   And muscle spindles sense stretch and tell you to contract.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.800]   The way that they work is through gamma motor neurons.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.000]   And so these are sensory things.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.320]   So what's happening is, unlike when you tell your muscle to contract, it goes alpha to
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.240]   the muscle, contract.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:28.920]   These muscle spindles work such that it is, "Oh, I've been stretched," sends signal back
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.680]   to some central point, typically in the spinal cord, and we don't actually want to go all
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.680]   the way up to the brain.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.080]   We've got a time delay.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.460]   This is why these are subconscious, autonomic, right, versus somatic.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:43.500]   So that gamma is going to go back to the central location and then come back through the alpha
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.820]   motor neurons and tell it to contract.
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.060]   So you have this wonderful mechanism of sensing stretch going back.
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:56.700]   Well, one theory that's been put forward regarding muscle damage is that the pressure is actually
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:01.860]   being applied to those nerve endings of the muscle spindles.
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.400]   And that's actually responsible for the pain signal that's going back and coming up to
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.360]   your brain and you're registering that as pain rather than it is actually in the contractile
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.120]   units, so the muscle fibers.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:20.520]   That's a very intriguing idea because it would suggest that stretching muscles in order to
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.200]   alleviate soreness might be the exact incorrect thing to do.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.680]   Now, I'm not saying that's for certain.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.980]   I'm just building off the mechanistic logic that we've laid out here.
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.980]   Yeah.
[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.140]   Really that you've laid out here.
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:38.700]   There is a more effective principle based on exactly that, which is this is generally
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:43.340]   why low level movement is effective at reducing acute soreness.
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.340]   Because that's low level contraction of the muscles.
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.060]   And you're going to contract and get tissue out and get fluid out.
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.060]   Wow.
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.740]   You're literally pumping it out of the cell.
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.740]   Yes.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.200]   In our previous episode where we were talking about programming or confusing the we, but
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:04.200]   let's be fair here, where you were educating us, including me and the audience about different
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:11.360]   structures for programming, exercise for specific adaptations, et cetera, the month, week, year
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.360]   scales, et cetera.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:20.240]   We had a brief discussion about the fact that if one trains legs very hard with resistance
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:25.920]   training, some heavy squatting or dead lifting it, and there's some soreness that oftentimes
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:34.080]   doing some "lighter cardio" or some low impact work the next day or any number of different
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:40.840]   things that involve not high intensity contractions of the muscles, but that do require contractions
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:45.700]   of the muscles, that it can alleviate soreness more quickly than if one were to simply lie
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.920]   around and watch Netflix or something.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.200]   Yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:55.400]   The, to go back just a little bit as well, if that's really the case, the question is
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.120]   like, where is this inflammatory signal coming from?
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:05.400]   And while there's much to be learned there, there is a little bit of information right
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:10.240]   now that suggests it's potentially coming from free radicals released from the mitochondria.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.680]   Again that may or may not hold up as more research comes, I'm not sure.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:18.160]   But if you remember back to our conversation on endurance, so we talked about the electron
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.440]   transport chain and aerobic metabolism, regardless of whether or not you're getting energy from
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:29.080]   glycolysis or carbohydrates, remember they have to be finished through aerobic metabolism.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:34.600]   So even if you're lifting weights and you're using carbs for your fuel, you have got to
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.320]   finish that metabolism by running it into the mitochondria and performing oxidative
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.320]   metabolism.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.240]   As a result of that, that electron transport chain runs.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:47.520]   So theoretically, if free radicals, which are hyperreactive oxygen species, basically
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.480]   they're oxygen molecules that are missing an electron so that they react to a lot of
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.480]   things.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:57.600]   They're the opposite of antioxidants by the way, this is oxygen molecules with extra protons
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.480]   so they can balance the charge.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:03.640]   If those leak out, that in and of itself is going to be a massive inflammatory signal
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.740]   and that's probably what signals the cause of these neutrophils and macrophages and kicks
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.680]   off this entire cascade.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.600]   Again I believe we need more research there.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.080]   I need to look into it, maybe it's more definitive than I know.
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.580]   But that's probably what's happening, potentially what's happening rather, that causes that
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.520]   cascade in signal.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:28.720]   Also what you have is this combination of, well if that's the case, why am I not getting
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.920]   tremendous amount of muscle damage when I do more aerobic based exercise?
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.640]   Well because you don't have the mechanical tension pulling on the fibers that's actually
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:43.360]   causing damage to the cell wall that allows these free radicals to escape the mitochondria
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.360]   and the cell wall.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.560]   It's the best we can postulate at this moment as to why those things are happening.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:55.200]   And then why, again, low level exercise tends to enhance, even things like percussion.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:00.520]   So using either instruments that put a low level of vibration into your leg or like pneumatic
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.300]   boots so you can massage, all these things are generally probably helping because they're
[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:12.160]   moving that stuff out, edema most specifically, so pressure comes off of those nerve endings
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.040]   and the muscle spindles and allows you to stop receiving that signal of pain despite
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.400]   the fact that you didn't actually regenerate tissue at all yet.
