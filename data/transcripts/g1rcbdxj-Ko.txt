[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.540]   Tax law is the tax law, right?
[00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.500]   It doesn't say like if an LLC, it's treated this other way.
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.260]   It's based on the tax entities and LLC is a legal entity, not a tax entity.
[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.680]   So just forming an LLC does nothing.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.080]   It doesn't make a business deduction, a business deduction.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.300]   The business deduction is either already a business
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.580]   deduction or it's just not.
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.740]   And running it through your LLC.
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.640]   It's kind of that procedure versus substance.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.400]   It's the procedure and it's not what's controlling.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.740]   So the substance is like, what did you spend it on?
[00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.960]   And do you actually have a business?
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.100]   I like to keep things simple if you don't have legal liability and you're
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.020]   not doing anything other than sole prop treatment, you probably don't need the
[00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.080]   LLC or at least recognize it's not providing a tax benefit.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.500]   S-corps, they work really well for businesses like service industry.
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.940]   Whenever there's not much equipment and not much third party debt, they work
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.800]   really well and then the minute you have more of a business with lots of vehicles
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.420]   and usually those vehicles are financed, right?
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.780]   Or real estate, all of those typically need to stay out of an S-corp.
