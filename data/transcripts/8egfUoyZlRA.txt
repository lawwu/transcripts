[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800]   We get a lot of very heavy marriage questions like this one today asking the following,
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.800]   "How do you care for marriages after the pain of adultery?"
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.080]   An anonymous woman writes in to ask it.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.640]   "Dear Pastor John, thank you for your podcast.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.600]   My husband and I have been married for several years and are walking alongside several other
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.640]   couples who are struggling.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.680]   We pray for them often and do the best we can to encourage them to seek the Holy Spirit's
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.600]   leading in their lives while also keeping healthy boundaries in what we can give.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.040]   Specifically, do you have any advice for couples impacted by adultery?
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.200]   These are the hardest questions for us to handle.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.020]   How can trust be rebuilt?
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.160]   From your pastoral experience, what are some biblical realities and hopes that we could
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.680]   use to serve couples whose marriages are falling apart due to the devastating sin of infidelity?"
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:10.500]   Two things about this question make me especially thankful, and it's not the pain of the adultery
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.960]   being addressed.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:20.320]   First, it's that this couple has enough courage and compassion to lean in to other
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.960]   people's sorrow rather than leaning away, which is the easy thing to do.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.520]   And second, they're not assuming that divorce is the right counsel.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.560]   We live in a day where people are trying, it seems to me, to see divorce as more legitimate
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.560]   rather than less legitimate, and I am thankful that's not the way this couple is leaning.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.040]   Some would say that adultery has been committed and that's a pass for divorce, so there
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.040]   you go.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.840]   Take your biblical pass and leave.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.440]   I don't think adultery is a biblical pass for divorce.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:07.640]   I think our counsel should always be to encourage the highest level of faithfulness, according
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.640]   to Jesus' words to Peter when he asked, "Lord, how often will my brother sin against
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.320]   me and I forgive him?"
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.320]   As many as seven times.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.160]   And Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times."
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.800]   Matthew 18, 21.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.160]   Seventy-seven is not meant to be a limit.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.540]   It's meant to say more often than you think, Peter.
[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.960]   And when Paul was asked his advice about Christians going to court against each other, he said,
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:49.400]   "To have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.100]   Why not rather suffer wrong?
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.080]   Why not rather be defrauded?"
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.640]   First Corinthians 6, verse 7.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:06.080]   And when God's wife, Israel, was unfaithful, the language of divorce in Jeremiah 3 and
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:14.260]   Isaiah 50 does not mean decisive divorce, followed by God's remarriage.
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:22.360]   We know this because four verses later, this so-called divorce in Jeremiah 3, 8, God says
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:29.080]   to his estranged wife, "Return, faithless Israel," declares the Lord.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.240]   "I will not look on you in anger, for I am merciful," declares the Lord.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.480]   "I will not be angry forever."
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.960]   That's Jeremiah 3, 12.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:47.100]   And we know it because God says in Isaiah 54, verse 5, "The Lord has called you like
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:57.120]   a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, even like a wife of one's youth when she is rejected,"
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.120]   says your God.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:07.240]   "For a brief moment I forsook you, but with great compassion I will gather you."
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.920]   In fact, God has only ever had one wife.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:23.060]   And the book of Hosea is the most daring description of his faithfulness to his adulterous wife.
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:31.480]   God tells Hosea, "Go, take yourself a wife of whoredom," harlotry, "and have children
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:41.120]   of whoredom, for the land commits great whoredom by forsaking the Lord," Hosea 1, verse 2.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.160]   So Hosea represents God in marrying an unfaithful wife.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:55.620]   And believe me, I have seen in my ministry this book, this picture of Hosea rescue couples
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:03.960]   in impossible situations who are this very day still faithful to each other years later.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.360]   And what will be the outcome between God and his adulterous wife?
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.360]   Here's one glimpse of it in Hosea 2, 14.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.880]   "Behold, I will allure her and bring her into the wilderness and speak tenderly to
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.980]   her.
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:27.520]   And there I will give her her vineyards and make the valley of Achor a door of hope.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:34.040]   And there she shall answer as in the days of her youth as at the time when she came
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.640]   out of the land of Egypt."
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.540]   So the whole point of God's history with Israel is that she was never deserving of
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.160]   his faithfulness to her, ever.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:52.920]   But he would eventually, with unspeakable longsuffering, by the power of the new covenant
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:59.800]   and the blood of Jesus, bring her to be the beautiful bride he deserves.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.800]   That's the point of Ephesians 5.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.620]   Husbands, love your wives.
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:13.560]   "Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her that he might sanctify her, having
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.400]   cleansed her by the washing of water and the word, so that he might present the church
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:25.880]   to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.440]   and without blemish."
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:38.140]   That is what God makes of his unfaithful wife by his longsuffering and sacrifice.
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:45.480]   So in answer to the question, what are some biblical realities and hopes when ministering
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:51.680]   to a couple where there has been the unfaithfulness of adultery, I would say this.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:59.980]   Two miracles are required for the will of God to be done in the preservation and renewal
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.460]   of such a marriage.
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:10.260]   One miracle is forgiveness by the one who was wronged, and the other miracle is repentance
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:17.780]   and longsuffering—longsuffering and patience by the one who has committed adultery.
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.380]   Let's take these one at a time.
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.820]   And remember, both are miracles.
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.320]   That is, they will seem, in the moment of your counseling and in the moment of their
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.900]   deepest darkness, they will seem impossible.
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.860]   They will say to you, "That's not going to happen.
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.540]   That cannot happen for us.
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.920]   It's too late."
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.900]   So we need to be clear about how such a miracle happens.
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:56.060]   Galatians 3, 5, "Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:00.020]   do so by works of law or hearing with faith?"
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.840]   Galatians 3, 5.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:09.700]   The key to how the miracles happen is hearing with faith—that is, hearing the Word of
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.700]   God and believing God that he can do the impossible.
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:21.380]   That's the channel through which the miracles that seem so impossible happen.
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.180]   The first miracle is forgiveness.
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:30.240]   Ephesians 5, 32, "Forgive one another as God in Christ forgave you."
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:38.500]   Only by being overwhelmed—I mean stunned—with our own forgiveness from Jesus at the cost
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:45.040]   of his infinitely valuable life will we be able to forgive such a horrible and painful
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.920]   betrayal as adultery.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:55.020]   And this is exactly the way Jesus explained the miraculous psychological dynamics of forgiveness
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.020]   in Matthew 18.
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:04.580]   "A servant owed his king ten thousand talents, and the talent was worth twenty years' wages."
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:10.820]   That's two hundred thousand years of wages.
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:19.880]   In other words, Jesus was saying every husband and every wife who is a Christian has been
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:26.380]   forgiven thousands of adulteries against God.
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:36.060]   Two hundred thousand years of wages means zillions and zillions of what we cannot pay
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.340]   back.
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:43.420]   All of that forgiven at the cost of the life of the Son of God.
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.860]   Oh, God, help us.
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.660]   Help us feel this.
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.800]   It will change us.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.340]   And when the king discovers that the servant would not forgive his fellow servant, he said,
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.980]   "You wicked servant, I forgave you that debt."
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.940]   Two hundred thousand years of wages.
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:10.380]   In other words, an incalculable debt, thousands of times greater than anybody's ever done
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.380]   against you.
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:17.020]   "I forgave you that because you pleaded with me, and should you not have had mercy on your
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.720]   fellow servant as I had mercy on you."
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:28.520]   So that's the first miracle that seems impossible for a marriage to survive and thrive again.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.720]   It's a miracle.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.040]   It's a miracle.
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.280]   Here's the second one.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:39.480]   Repentance and longsuffering on the part of the one who has committed adultery.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:44.400]   Repentance meaning a deep change of heart that hates the sin and turns toward utter
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.600]   faithfulness for the longsuffering that has to happen.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:11:00.200]   He or she recognizes that receiving forgiveness is not the same as receiving trust, nor should
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.840]   it be.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:10.840]   The rebuilding of trust requires a patient, humble, longsuffering endurance.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:18.440]   Being forgiven is not a right to be demanded, but a gift of grace to be received with humility
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.240]   and thankfulness and tears.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:29.080]   And trust coming from the spouse who has been betrayed is not like a stake you drive in
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.920]   the ground and walk past.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:40.880]   It's like an acorn you plant in the ground, and someday, God willing, it may be an unshakable
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:53.000]   oak tree of trust, but it will grow through tender stages by patient protection and watering
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:02.120]   and nurturing through storms that will threaten to kill the little sapling of trust.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:09.960]   Both these miracles, forgiveness and years of longsuffering, lived by faith in the promises
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:15.720]   of God, "I'll never leave you, I'll never forsake you, either of you," that kind of
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:21.560]   promise, all of those years, that's the way the miracle will happen.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:27.320]   I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you, I will not let anything befall
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:36.000]   you that I will not give you grace to endure, and I will make even the inevitable scars
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.520]   that will not go away, you cannot remove.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:47.800]   I will make them serve my grace, and I will keep you and bring you to your old age, one
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:55.640]   of my favorite images, the both of you sitting across from each other, holding your wrinkled
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.080]   hands and with tears and smiles saying, "We made it.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.840]   We made it."
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.840]   That is beautiful.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.840]   Amen.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:08.800]   Thank you for speaking into this really incredibly challenging situation, Pastor John, and using
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.360]   a vision of the future to do it.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.720]   And thank you to the anonymous woman who wrote in to ask this question.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.720]   It's a great one.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.720]   It's an urgent one.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.720]   Thank you for writing in.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.800]   Thank you for leaning in to these kinds of situations.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.120]   It's quite a servant's heart that you display.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.120]   Thank you.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.760]   Well, whether you listen in your car, at the gym, doing chores, thanks for inviting us

[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:51.960]   And speaking of challenging marriage questions, how can a spouse lead the home toward joy
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.280]   in Jesus when the other spouse struggles with depression?
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.320]   It's a super important episode coming up next time.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.720]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.880]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
