[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   Pastor John, here's an anonymous letter we got. "I pastor a church and I believe I
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.840]   have a healthy desire for God. However, I don't always have a healthy or robust
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.640]   desire for my people. They can make the ministry trying and unenjoyable." Pastor
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.900]   John, what advice might you have for a pastor in my position? Well, I have a long
[00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:35.680]   string of ideas, and probably I do because I am this guy. God calls a lot of
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:45.280]   introverts into the ministry, and these introverts must set themselves to love
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:54.540]   unrelentingly in the way they can love. And that's not going to look the same as
[00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.440]   the way an extrovert loves his people. And getting that clear can be very
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.000]   helpful and very freeing. An introvert has no excuse not to love his people,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.240]   but he cannot beat himself up that he's not like so-and-so, who's so
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.600]   unbelievably gifted in the way he moves among people, and therefore we watch him
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.140]   and we go home and we feel, "Shoot! If that's the way love is, do I have it?" I
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.400]   mean, that's what pastors have to deal with if
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.240]   they're not wired that way. So here's my several counsels. Ponder the way
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.560]   Christ views his people. Acts 20, 28, "Pay careful attention to yourselves and to
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.240]   the flock of God in which the Holy Spirit made you overseers. Take care for
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.640]   the Church of God," here it is, "which he obtained with his own blood." The point of
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.000]   that last statement is to awaken the cost of the purchase and the
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.560]   preciousness of what is purchased. We pastors have the stupendous privilege
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.600]   of serving the people bought at the highest price imaginable in the universe.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.840]   It's as if a king should call you a pastor and put you over a region of his
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.240]   kingdom that he just paid for at the highest price than any other region he
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.880]   ever bought, and he put you in charge of that position. So we should just stand in
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.480]   amazement that these people that we are called to serve are the purchase of God
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.000]   at the highest price imaginable. What an incredible privilege. Second, we should
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.240]   ponder not only the purchase but the aim. Ephesians 5, 25, "Christ loved the church
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.720]   and gave himself up for her that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.120]   by the washing of water with the words, so that he might present the church to
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.800]   himself in splendor with no spot or wrinkle or any such thing, and that she
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.200]   might be without blemish." So we should ponder that he didn't purchase a pretty
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:24.080]   girl. He has to wash her and remove her spots and her wrinkles and her blemishes
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:31.640]   and he says and other such things. He's doing all of this by his blood, by his
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.120]   word, and so it's okay to see the spots and wrinkles and blemishes. I mean we'd
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.680]   be stupid and naive to think that the church was anything other than a pretty
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:50.480]   beat-up and sick and wrinkled and blemished bride that we get the awesome
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:04:00.160]   privilege to join Christ in loving toward beauty. Toward beauty. Third, we
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:08.000]   should remember that Jesus died for those who made his life very hard. That's
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.080]   what love was. While we were still weak at the right time, Christ died for the
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.480]   ungodly. One will scarcely die for a righteous person, but perhaps for a good
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.440]   person one might even dare to die, but God shows his love for us in that while
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.280]   we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. So the love of a pastor for his people
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.200]   is a love that precedes their beauty, precedes their readiness to be loved, and
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:43.040]   and slogs through a lot of misery just like Jesus slogged through Calvary in
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:51.440]   order to save his his bride. Fourth, remember that our joy in God and our joy
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.600]   in people rises and falls without being inauthentic. I think sometimes we can get
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:05.080]   the idea that, well, if it's low today, maybe it wasn't even real before, but the
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.360]   Bible talks about, "Restore to me the joy of my salvation," so salvation's joy can
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.000]   diminish, almost fade away, and we have to cry out for it, and so can the love of
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.440]   people. I mean, Paul says in 2 Thessalonians, "The love of every one of
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.520]   you for one another is increasing." That means yesterday it was lower. Now should
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.720]   you feel inauthentic about yesterday's love because today's love is intense? I
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.600]   mean, we really get into that kind of emotional battle, and coming to
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.920]   terms with the fact that our joy in God, our joy in people, our love for people
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:48.800]   rises and falls means that we must beware of not calling the low seasons
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.200]   inauthentic just because they aren't the high seasons. Here's a fifth
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.960]   counsel. Beware of having a modern, romanticized, overly emotional view of
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.480]   love. We're told to reprove and rebuke and correct and discipline, most of which
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.960]   are experienced by people not as very loving, especially wayward people. They
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.320]   don't like to be rebuked and corrected, and yet they are forms of love, so beware
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:21.360]   of a modern, romanticized, overly emotional view. Six, I often took heart in
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.960]   the ministry from Matthew 24, 45, where Jesus said, "Who then is the faithful and
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.600]   wise servant whom his master has set over his household to give them their
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:38.360]   food at the proper time? Blessed, blessed is that servant whom his master will find
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:44.320]   so doing when he comes." And I want to say to the pastor, "Did you feed them? Did you
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.280]   feed them at the proper time with good food?" And Jesus says, "If you feed my
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.640]   people, I'm gonna find you loving them." So you feed your people and you pray that
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:02.200]   your people would be well nourished by what you give them, and God's favor rests
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:10.800]   on you. Seven, judge your authenticity and love not by the general feelings, how you
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:18.200]   feel toward people, but by your specific affections in specific instances where
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.280]   you're reaching out to help those in need. This is something I just discovered
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.760]   very personally over the years. If I tried to think in general terms, "Now do I
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.000]   love Bethlehem Baptist Church?" Well, I mean that's just so vague and so
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.080]   impersonal. What kind of emotions are you supposed to spot in your heart when you
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:43.320]   talk that vaguely and generally? But if I get a phone call when I don't want to go
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.560]   to the hospital and I have a crisis and someone is on the brink of death, and I
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.200]   get in the car and I go not wanting to go and therefore wondering, "Do I love
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:59.200]   this person?" Almost every time that I have actually walked through a real door,
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:07.200]   taken a real hand, bent down over a real tube-laden face after a heart attack, at
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.720]   that moment, as I have said, "I'm here. I'd like to pray with you. May I share with
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:18.760]   you some hope-giving truth. God has caused my heart to well up with affection
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:24.000]   for that real live person." And I've been over some pretty cantankerous dying
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.120]   folks, and it has been sweet to me to have the Holy Spirit bear witness with
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:36.120]   my spirit. You are really loving those people by my power now. So beware of
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:41.720]   passing judgment on yourself in those vague general moments. Number eight. I got
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:48.200]   I got ten. How long is this gonna go? These are short. Pray for the people who are
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.720]   most irritating that God would bless them. Jesus said, "Pray for those who abuse
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.360]   you." When you pray for somebody to be blessed, who you are finding a hard time
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.320]   liking, very often it rises in your hearts that you can actually start to
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:08.360]   feel an affection for those people. Number nine. Pray for a clear and deeply
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:15.080]   felt wonder and amazement at your own salvation, your own being loved by Christ
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:21.560]   at the cost of his life. Be amazed that you are loved in spite of your sins, and
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:26.680]   you will more easily than love others in spite of their sins. And the
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:34.640]   last thing I would say is ask God for joy in your people and love for your
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.920]   people like Paul does when he prays, "My prayer for you is that your love may
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:46.840]   abound more and more with knowledge and all discernment." So pray, "God help me. Love
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:52.360]   my people more and more." Love is a fruit of the Holy Spirit, so plead to God that
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:57.520]   you would be filled with him. Amen, that's gold. Thank you, Pastor John. And with
