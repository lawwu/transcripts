[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.320]   Today on the show we dig into compound interest and
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.980]   We go through the lessons that we can learn from the magic penny
[00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.760]   You've heard the example right the magic penny that doubles in value
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.400]   What are the actual lessons of that?
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.920]   Welcome to the radical personal finance podcast. My name is Joshua sheets, and I'm your host and today is Monday, February 23
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.740]   2015
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:10.420]   If I offer you two choices one is a million dollars cash today or is it a million dollars cash tomorrow?
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.300]   You're gonna have to answer that question. It's a personal choice, but it's a personal choice for you
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.300]   So you're gonna have to answer it for the rest of your life, but if you're thinking about it for the rest of your life?
[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.300]   You're gonna have to answer it for the rest of your life. So if I offer you two choices one is a million dollars cash today
[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.620]   Or the other is a magic penny that doubles in value every day for a month
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.620]   Which of those would you choose and why?
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:44.760]   Now I would guess that for most of you that's not the first time you've ever been asked that question
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.000]   People listen to this show generally are not new on they didn't just fall off the cabbage truck or the turnip truck or this isn't
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.300]   Your first rodeo or whatever. I don't know what you call that in language, whatever saying you want to apply from the South
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.280]   So we talked about turnip trucks and cabbage trucks and rodeos. I don't know what you New Yorkers talk about
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.920]   But people listen to the show. They're not new to these concepts. And so I'm certain that you've seen this illustration
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.460]   But my next question is what are the lessons that you've taken from this illustration?
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.960]   What are the lessons that you've learned I
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:23.800]   Want to walk you through five specific lessons in today's show that I think that you can learn from this illustration
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.600]   Now before I get into the specific lessons
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.960]   I do want to mention to you the numbers involved because it may have been a while since you've actually looked at the numbers involved
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.040]   I'm gonna run through this quickly on the on in audio format
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.920]   Any I'm doing I'm taking the risk anytime I go through numbers. I take the risk of being boring in an audio format
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.840]   But I think it's important and I think I can do it quickly enough that it's not boring
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.040]   but how much money is your magic penny worth at the end of a month a
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.640]   31 day month any idea
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.440]   Well, let's do the math
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.600]   If you start with one cent on day one and double it each day on day two
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.840]   You have two cents day three four cents day for eight cents day 5 16 cents day 6 32 cents day
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.720]   764 cents
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.960]   Day eight dollar twenty-eight next 256 five dollars twelve ten dollars twenty four
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.880]   $20 48 forty dollars ninety six and day fourteen. You're up to eighty one dollars and ninety two cents
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.640]   163 84 3 27 68
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.640]   655 36
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.240]   1310 dollars and 72 cents on day 18
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.360]   19 is 2006 21
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.200]   5242
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.840]   10485 on day 21
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.520]   20,971 on 22
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.640]   41943 on 23
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.640]   $83,886 on day 24 day 25
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.400]   $1,772 this is the time in the illustration at which if your friend took the million dollars
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.480]   You're still looking pretty jealously at your friend with a million bucks and you're almost out of month and you've only got a hundred and sixty
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.280]   Seven thousand seven hundred seventy two dollars in your account
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.240]   But day 26 you have three thirty five
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:23.160]   Five forty four three hundred thirty five thousand five hundred forty four dollars day 27
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.360]   $671,000 and finally on day 28 you cross the million dollar mark
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:36.360]   You're at 1 million three hundred forty two thousand dollars and now it gets good day 29 2 million six hundred eighty four thousand
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.320]   day 30 five million three hundred sixty eight thousand and
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.440]   On day 31 your magic penny is now worth ten million
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.080]   seven hundred thirty seven thousand four hundred and eighteen dollars and twenty four cents
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.360]   Ten million seven hundred thirty seven thousand four hundred eighteen
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.360]   dollars and twenty four cents
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.160]   Amazing, huh? Isn't that incredible?
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.760]   Isn't that absolutely incredible
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.760]   now I
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.680]   Don't want to just spend time thinking about how incredible it is
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.840]   But truly is I want to talk today about what are the lessons that we can learn from this illustration because sadly it's only an
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.120]   illustration
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.000]   I'm not aware of any investment in the world that I can find to participate in that will double my money
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.880]   Every day for a month. So this is primarily a thought experiment
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:34.720]   But certainly there are lessons from this that we can learn and that's what I want to share with you. Lesson number one is
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.680]   rate of return matters
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.880]   Rate of return matters big-time
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:49.640]   To go from one cent to ten point seven million dollars in 31 days is only
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.800]   Possible in a world where your money doubles every year
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.480]   Now can I tell you that
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:02.560]   There's an investment that you can buy a mutual fund a stock in which your money will double every year
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.280]   certainly not
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:12.840]   At least not for 31 consecutive periods. But are there things that you can do financially that will double your money? I
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.320]   Believe there are and you want to make sure that you're taking advantage of those things
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.920]   one of the
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.200]   trends in our society that I see that really concerns me is
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.040]   people have
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.440]   simply assumed that you cannot beat the market and
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:37.080]   They've assumed this with good reason by the way much of the academic research illustrates that almost nobody can beat the market
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:44.080]   the problem with that scenario, however, is that that's primarily limited to stock market returns and
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:51.000]   That is the data is all based upon mutual fund stock market returns because that's where the most reliable data is
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   but there are problems with that data and
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.080]   Also, the other problem is not that nobody can beat the market because that's not what the data says
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.760]   the data says that you can't reliably predict in advance who is going to beat the market and
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:10.560]   You can't be confident that their market beating performance is going to persist over a long period of time. That's what the data says
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.520]   What's interesting is however, there are a bunch of flaws in it and I'm not gonna go into that today
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.600]   But what's happened what I've seen happen in our society as many times people have just simply said well
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.520]   I'm not gonna bother to try then I'm not gonna bother to try to find good investments and
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.960]   This is death to your wealth building. Let me give a couple examples
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.840]   Instead of focusing on the magic penny. Let's do a little math here and let's focus on a let's put in a 40 year
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:40.760]   Investment time horizon. So 40 years and let's run some different interest rates. Let's say we invest
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.680]   Let's do a Roth IRA contributions. Let's just do let's do $5,000 a year just under the Roth IRA contributions
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.960]   So we're gonna put in $5,000 annually into an investment portfolio over 40 years
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:59.840]   Starting with nothing and we're gonna calculate what a different rates of return our money is worth at the end of 40 years
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:06.120]   So let's start with a 4% rate of return 4% rate of return $5,000 invested annually at the end of 40 years as
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.120]   $475,000
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.320]   That's big money, isn't it? I don't know. I mean that's big money
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.840]   Which should give you hope that even if you invest at a relatively low rate of return
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:26.160]   You're still can wind up wealthy if you have enough time, but that's lesson number two, so we'll come back to that in a moment
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.460]   What if we raise this from 4% to 6% now at the end of 40 years instead of 475 we have
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.520]   $773,000
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.440]   What if we go from 6% to 8% at the end of 40 years now we have 1 million
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.960]   $212,000
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.880]   Let's pop this up to 10% and see what we have
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:49.320]   Well now we have 2 million two hundred and twelve thousand dollars big difference
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.480]   between
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:56.240]   $475,000 at 4% and 2.2 million dollars at 10%
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.440]   Now question what about 15%
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:08.440]   8.8. It's gonna 8.9 million dollars. It's 8 million eight hundred ninety five thousand dollars
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.440]   What about 20%
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.120]   20% it's 36 million dollars
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.240]   Rate of return matters
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:24.920]   Now can I tell you how to get a 20% annualized rate of return in the stock market?
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.920]   I don't have a clue how to do that
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:32.720]   But I guarantee you there's something in your life where you can get a 20% rate of return
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:41.800]   It'll be different for everybody but there's something somewhere someplace that you can get a massive rate of return
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:48.200]   It may simply be a 20% discount on some of the services and expenses that you are already incurring
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.720]   It may be avoiding 20%
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.440]   interest rate credit card debt
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.840]   If there's something in your life where you can get a 20% rate of return
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.360]   Can you do that every year for 30, you know for 40 years?
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.000]   I don't know probably not but there's some people who have
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:13.800]   And that's the key some people have usually this is in private enterprise and the growth of business
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.960]   But leave that for another day rate of return matters
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:26.320]   Don't ever forget that and don't ever stop looking and saying where is the most efficient place that I can allocate my capital
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:33.880]   Right now, where can I put my money to work for me right now in the best most efficient arrangement possible?
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:41.920]   That's the first lesson from the magic penny. Those numbers are so incredible because of the rate of return in a world of 100%
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.760]   Annual increases it's hard not to get wealthy
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:51.760]   Look for those places in your life and take advantage of them
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:59.080]   Don't ever walk past the 50% off sale and you know be thinking to yourself. Well, that doesn't matter
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.720]   No, look at it and say that's 50% off. That's the magic penny
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:09.960]   Don't ever walk past the ways that you can increase money substantially and say it's no big deal
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:17.720]   That's the magic penny put that to put that habit to use in your life in every area and it will serve you well
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.880]   next lesson is
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.360]   The amount of time you invest matters
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.400]   You can't escape the influence of time
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.080]   the power of compound interest is driven by
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:40.200]   What is the rate of return and how long can we get those returns and how much do we start with?
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:47.200]   Now what's fun about the magic penny scenario is it pulls out that third variable how much we start with and it focuses on the rate
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.000]   Of return and how long we get those returns, but let's go back to
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.760]   the
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:12:00.280]   Days, let's go back to 21 days. We're three weeks into this month 21 days and we're up to ten thousand four hundred eighty five dollars
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:06.400]   We're falling behind here aren't we that's not much money comparatively speaking
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.960]   Compare ten thousand to a million. There's a big difference there
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:18.160]   Day 25 were up to a hundred and sixty seven thousand, but it's only in those last four days where we break a million and
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.040]   Then the magic happens
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:29.120]   Day 27 is six hundred seventy one thousand then on day 28. It's 1 million three hundred forty two thousand day
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:36.960]   Twenty nine two million six hundred eighty four thousand day thirty five million three hundred and sixty eight thousand and day thirty one
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.600]   ten million seven hundred thirty seven thousand dollars
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:46.500]   What would have happened if this had been the month of February instead of the month of December in our example?
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.280]   Well, you'd have 1.3 million dollars and is that
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.280]   Measurably better than a million dollars. Yes
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.360]   $300,000 for 28 days of sitting around I'll take it
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:02.280]   but it's nowhere near as dramatic as ten million seven hundred thirty seven thousand dollars and
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.720]   That's a key lesson
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:11.840]   Now there's another example that's often used when teaching people about compound interest that I both like and dislike
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:16.560]   And that's the example of two different individuals who start investing at different ages
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:24.160]   And what how this example is usually presented is as an example of two investors side by side and one investor
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.280]   begins investing let's say
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:32.120]   $2,000 per year at the you know at the age of 18 is often what it is and the other investor waits until the age of
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.800]   30 and then starts investing
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:40.000]   $2,000 per year what you find is that the person who's waits till a later age winds up with
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.120]   investing more money and
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:48.600]   With less dollars, excuse me, usually the in the person who starts at 18, they usually start investing and then stop
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.040]   So let's let's run a little math here as an example
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.120]   Let's say that you have an 18 year old investor and for this example
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.200]   I'm going to use a 10% interest rate and this person starts
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:03.800]   $2,000 per year if you started at $2,000 every year from 18 to 65 at a 10% interest rate
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.760]   You would have 1.9 million dollars
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.840]   But now if you compare these two things in this way look at the difference of numbers
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:21.900]   If our initial investor begins at 18 with $2,000 and contributes for 10 years from 18 through the 23 year 27
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:29.440]   He or she invests a total of $20,000 then the money continues to grow and at 65 this person has 1 million
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.680]   $260,000 in
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:39.120]   Scenario B. This investor starts investing at 28 invest $2,000 per year every year from 28 to 65
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.760]   they invest a total of
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.600]   $76,000 and
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.800]   They have in their portfolio only six hundred and sixty thousand dollars
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.560]   Time matters
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.560]   That extra ten years of compounding is huge now compare that to the magic penny
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.320]   That extra four days of compounding is huge
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.840]   Time matters
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.400]   Now what was always frustrating to me about this example
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.920]   And I was inspired by this example when I was young and I started investing when I was 18 years old and said hey
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.280]   I got to put my money aside got to put my money aside got to put my money aside
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.640]   But what's frustrating to me about this chart is no one gives the other side
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.840]   And so I'm gonna do that for you now. Let's say that you're 28
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.320]   What do you need to do to catch up?
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.880]   Well at age 28 investor a the one who started at 18 now has
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:32.360]   $37,000 in their account and then they stop contributing all you need to do if you're 28 to catch up
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.760]   Save $37,000
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.200]   So if you're 28 years old and you're listening to this
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:42.520]   Episode and you're about to go out and buy a
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.640]   $37,000 card don't
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.080]   Invest the $37,000
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:53.800]   Or if you're age 38, where is investor a at age 38? Well investor a at age 38 has
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.320]   $96,130 in their portfolio
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.320]   If you're 38 years old and you're feeling behind all you got to do is catch up is invest
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.320]   $96,000 now, is that a lot of money? Sure. Can you find it? Yes
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.080]   If you haven't saved it get started
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.860]   That's the point because from age 38 to age 40
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:18.720]   Investor a who started with $2,000 for 10 years the growth in their portfolio goes from
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.240]   $96,000 to
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:26.760]   $116,000 let's say that you at age 38 want to wake up and say I got to save some money and you want to you know
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.760]   Get this thing going for you. Well
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.120]   116,000 divided by 3 is
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.920]   $40,000
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.160]   Can you find a way to save $40,000?
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.800]   Maybe not
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:44.240]   But let's say between 44, you know, and I mean you can run the math, you know forever if you've got eight years
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:50.280]   Can you save 20,000 a year? The point is get started and if you want to catch up
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.640]   It's relatively easy to catch up on this interest chart
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.160]   If you just simply identify where you are and where you want to go and put more money after it
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:07.040]   Time matters so run these examples of the two individuals the one who has the longer time period and
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.680]   Try to get that time period working on your side
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.200]   And if you're behind don't worry about it just catch up
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:20.820]   Easy for me to say right lesson number three in the beginning
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:24.840]   It's easy to spend and that's what most people do. So let's go back to this magic penny
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.480]   after 10 days of investing
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:34.520]   One penny doubling each day one cent two cent four cents eight cents sixteen thirty two cents sixty four cents a dollar twenty eight
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:39.980]   Two dollars fifty six five dollars twelve on day ten. You have five dollars and twelve cents
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.900]   What amiss most people do when they accumulate five dollars and twelve cents?
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.840]   They spend it
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:51.020]   To go to their local fast-food store and they buy a value meal
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.900]   It's easy to spend isn't it?
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.640]   What if we go another ten days?
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:03.760]   So five dollars goes to ten dollars twenty four twenty forty eight forty ninety six eighty one ninety two one sixty three eighty four three
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:08.740]   twenty seven sixty eight six fifty five thirty six one thousand three ten seventy two
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:14.500]   Two thousand six twenty one and on day twenty now we have five thousand two hundred and forty two dollars
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:19.500]   What do most people do when they have five thousand two hundred forty two dollars and eighty eight cents piled up?
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:25.280]   Spend it and they drop back 20 days in their interest chart
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:31.840]   Now, I don't know necessarily what they spend it on five thousand bucks to me sounds like a round-the-world trip ticket
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:36.420]   That's what I would spend it on some people. It's a down payment on a fancy card some people
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.420]   It's I don't know half of a down payment on a house
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:44.600]   But they spend it you're a day 20 and you have five thousand two hundred forty two dollars
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.580]   And you spend it not recognizing that in 11 days
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:56.200]   Five thousand two hundred forty two dollars will grow to be ten million seven hundred thirty seven thousand four hundred eighteen dollars and twenty four cents
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:05.640]   Every dollar matters in the beginning every single dollar matters in the beginning
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:10.540]   And the Bible in the book of Zachariah says do not despise the day of small beginnings now
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.720]   that's completely taken out of context, but it's become a
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:18.580]   Common phrase because it's so useful do not despise the day of small beginnings
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:24.680]   Don't despise five thousand dollars of capital don't despise five dollars of capital
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:32.280]   That is your seed capital for your fortune. That's the seed capital for your empire. Don't despise that and squander it
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:37.320]   Don't despise the day of small beginnings
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.960]   Many people do that and especially if you're interested in building wealth
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:49.420]   Remember if all your friends took the million bucks and are spending it you're sitting over here with your five thousand dollars
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.680]   You look a little foolish, don't you?
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.560]   You look a little foolish
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:59.600]   You look a little foolish when you're driving your you know, your cheap car
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:05.960]   You're you're I don't know what you're living in your small apartment or you're building your business. You look a little foolish
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:13.640]   But don't worry about it stay focused because in the beginning every dollar is important
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:19.880]   So easy to spend in the beginning and that's what most people do but that's not you you're not most people
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:26.320]   Now in the later years you can really siphon off some money without too much damage to your portfolio
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.200]   And this is the corollary
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:35.100]   Both of these things are exciting and the fullness of time assuming you're around to enjoy the growth of your investments
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:41.060]   You can siphon off some money. Let's say that on day 27 now, you're up to six hundred seventy one thousand eighty eight dollars
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:45.380]   You're well on your way to being a millionaire, you know the next day if you don't take any money off
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:49.160]   It's gonna be 1 million three hundred and forty two thousand dollars. You're well on your way
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:54.880]   Now you want to buy a new car and you want to pull off thirty thousand dollars. Does that measurably impact?
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.400]   Your financial plan not really not comparatively speaking
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.040]   So if you're older and you've got this compound interest working on your side
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:12.720]   Spend some money. It doesn't you can spend some money and increase your lifestyle without it measurably impacting your investment results
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.560]   It's a big deal
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.400]   But you can't do that when you're young I
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:23.020]   Like to read biographies and autobiographies and I remember it
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:27.480]   Well, which one to use let's use as an example Warren Buffett the book snowball
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:31.200]   Which was one of the more recent comprehensive biographies. It was written on Warren Buffett
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.680]   I like to use Warren Buffett just simply because he's well known in our society and it's good to use learn lessons from him
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:42.760]   In many ways though. He's kind of pull a very polarizing figure, but he's an easy person to pick on since everyone knows about him
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:47.800]   it's a little harder to you know pull something from the life of Benjamin Franklin or Thomas Edison and and
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.920]   Henry Ford or Andrew Carnegie or
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:56.300]   Rockefeller and be able to apply the same lessons, but because Buffett is this living figure
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:00.320]   I often will use him but because people know a little bit of his history
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.760]   But one of the things that really has impressed me about
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.060]   Buffett
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:12.280]   When I read snowball and I think I read another biography I can't remember the name of it as well but is
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:19.240]   Buffett's always been rich since he was a kid now not accusing him of
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:24.600]   You know being handed money he wasn't
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.600]   But he's always been rich
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.560]   he just never bothered to spend it and
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:35.680]   He's simply old now and has had lots of years of compounding. That's why he's as rich as he is
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.600]   If you go back and you read his biography, it's fascinating how at a young age
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.400]   What was it? I think it was cokes or something like that
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:48.840]   He was buying bottles of cokes for 10 cents and selling them to his friends at school for 15 cents
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.920]   He was running a paper route. He and a buddy of his started
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:57.440]   I think it was a pinball machine business when they were in high school by the time he went to college
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.160]   He had lots of money compared to everyone else around
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.520]   But he'd earned it all himself and he'd saved he just never spent it
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:08.040]   Another thing most people don't realize is that he was rich all through his life
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.080]   he just was focused on his investment earnings and
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.080]   keeping his capital to invest
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.200]   so
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.420]   Which I respect him for that. That's awesome
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.040]   That's what all of us should be doing
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.520]   But if he had just earned all his money on a paper route and it never top piled any of it aside
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.280]   Then when he goes to college, he's got tens of thousands of dollars
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.720]   Well, he would have had to figure out a way to earn those tens of thousands of dollars again
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.840]   And if he hadn't been rich when he got married
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:37.480]   He would have been in the situation that many of us are in or we're not rich and now we're figuring out
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.280]   How do we juggle family responsibilities and building money?
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:47.920]   Some building capital so much easier if you hang on to your to your to your money at a young age and build that that money
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:53.280]   But in the end again doesn't matter a bit to Warren Buffett's net worth if he you know
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.640]   Buys planes and yachts and all that stuff. It doesn't make a dent
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:05.040]   So understand where you are in the compounding cycle number four in the beginning the amount you save matters more than the interest
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:11.400]   In the beginning the amount you save matters more than the interest
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.080]   This is kind of the corollary of in the beginning. It's easy to spend
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.760]   In scenario in any scenario and in the scenario of
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:25.360]   This comp magic penny and again, I talked about if you're behind, but he did just save the other extra five bucks
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:31.680]   What if instead of starting with one cent this person has started with in this magic penny this person started with one dollar
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:38.080]   Let's just see what that does stick a dollar in here. Well the end of 30 day 31 days there would be
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:45.080]   Billions, okay. So 1 billion seventy three million seven hundred forty one thousand dollars. It's a big difference
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.880]   from one cent to a dollar
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.560]   We'll come to that at the end of the show
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:53.120]   We'll talk a little bit about large numbers and how hard they are for us to conceive of
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:25:00.840]   My major point here is just simply that in the beginning of building wealth the amount that you save matters more than the interest
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:08.400]   if you are getting started focus single-mindedly on how much you're saving and
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.520]   Figure out the interest how you're gonna invest it
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.240]   next
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.240]   This matters hugely
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:21.520]   One major mistake that I see a lot of times in personal finance is that
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:27.840]   Young people who aren't saving that much money are spending all kinds of time and focus on figuring out
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.680]   How do I eke out a better rate of return? I discovered this in college
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:36.320]   When you know friends are figuring out how do I trade futures or how do I?
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:43.560]   Trade options or how do I buy this magic stock that's gonna break through the barrier. Does that matter it does if it works
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:49.960]   But comparatively speaking to saying how can I earn more so that I can save more that should be the first focus
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.920]   now on the flip side
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:58.980]   This is actually number five in the end of a compounding growth. The interest matters more than the amount you save
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:05.200]   So this has its own lessons, but the major personal finance lessons number four is
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:09.680]   Focus at the beginning on piling up a big nest egg
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:14.080]   Because remember you can it's relatively easy to catch up to compounding for the first half of the chart
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.120]   On the back half of the chart is hard to it's hard to catch up
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:23.040]   So focus first on the amount now on the flip side number five in the end the interest matters more than the amount and this
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:27.920]   Is another mistake that I see a lot of times people making in their wealth building portfolios
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.920]   Let's assume that
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:35.120]   You are 65 years old and
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:44.440]   Let's assume just for the sake of having a clean point of comparison. Let's assume that we can pull you have an extra million dollars
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:51.440]   Because many of you who are in this audience do have an extra million or you will have an extra million at the age of 65
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:59.440]   the challenge with growing older is often that you're advised to have your portfolio structured more conservatively and
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:04.640]   That is correct. If that portfolio is funding a specific income need
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:10.500]   You have to have a portfolio's risk tolerance matched to the needs of income from it
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:17.000]   So if you just have a million dollars and that's gonna be your entire portfolio to last you through a 30 or 40 year retirement
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.480]   Man, you it's hard
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:23.520]   You can't afford to take a lot of risk now depending on how we're finding risk in terms of inflation risk or market risk
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.520]   Conversation for another day point is we can't take much risk
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:33.420]   That's why you see these things these, you know, generic standardized ideas that as you get older make your portfolio more conservative
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.360]   What's the problem?
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:41.160]   you're in those golden years at which you've got a massive portfolio and
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:48.360]   The single biggest factor that's going to affect the growth of your portfolio is not whether you're pinching pennies at the $2 buffet
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:52.820]   It's what's the interest rate at which my portfolio was invested
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:57.480]   Let's give an example. So now let's go you're at 65 years old
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:01.320]   So let me give you a 30 year investment time horizon a million dollar portfolio
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:07.920]   So let's put in a million dollars for our present value. Let's put in a let's say a 5% rate of return to start with
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.880]   Zero payments and what's that worth at the end of 30 years?
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:16.360]   So zero payments because you're not contributing any more to it four point three million dollars at five percent interest
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:23.000]   That's what the ending value of your portfolio would be and I could do these calculations where you're pulling off income and show the income
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.520]   Growth but I want to keep it simple for podcast math here 30 years one million dollars at five
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:34.360]   What I use five percent five percent grows to four point three million dollars. Now, let's say that you could in ten percent
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.080]   What's the difference there?
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.080]   with the event of 30 years
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:43.400]   You have 17 million four hundred and forty nine thousand dollars
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.280]   at ten percent
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.000]   Why?
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Because you're starting with a million bucks
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.040]   The 30 years still matters, but you're not starting with zero like you were in a younger age
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:01.320]   You got a million dollars and this is fundamentally one of the biggest mistakes that so many people are making with their portfolios is
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:06.760]   Automatically going it's quote-unquote safer more conservative giving up potential return
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:13.120]   With their portfolios now safety matters. Don't don't hear don't mishear me safety matters
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:19.560]   You've got to match the income from a portfolio to the income cash flow requirements that you need in your life
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:26.240]   But if you have an extra million bucks and you don't need to automatically give up potential return
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:34.420]   Think of the impact that can make on your family. Think of the impact that can make just think of the impact the money can make
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:38.040]   It's why the rich get richer all the time
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:43.160]   It's because you reach a certain point at which you can't possibly spend all the money
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:49.760]   Well, I guess maybe it's a little excessive you reach a certain point at which it's very hard and it takes great dedication and effort
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.760]   to spend
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:59.680]   Twelve percent I want to put this in here. Let's say twelve percent on my example thirty years of investing thirty million dollars
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:04.560]   So you say why is it that you know all rich people don't just simply hire
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:09.680]   Put all their money in an index fund like Jack Bogle says maybe they should who knows all let them decide
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:14.360]   But if you can get from ten percent to twelve percent or let's just say fifty. So let me
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:21.840]   Maybe run this so I'd make sure I get my numbers precise ten percent here future value of ten percent million dollars invested over thirty
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.880]   Years is seventeen point four million dollars twelve percent
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:28.760]   Invested over thirty years. It's thirty million dollars
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.520]   fifteen percent
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.040]   over thirty years
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.280]   Sixty-six million dollars so it starts to get a little bit laughable
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.880]   But the point is towards the back end of your investment career
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:45.360]   However long that is the rate of return matters far more than the amount of money you put aside
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:49.680]   So now if you take this to society and you compare this lesson
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:54.800]   What is the mistake that you see you see at a young age many people squandering all of their investment capital?
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:31:01.280]   Using it up in consumption instead of an investment. And again, I'm guilty of this myself in so many ways
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:04.800]   We all have to decide how are we gonna apply these lessons?
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:08.360]   But just as a general rule, what do young people do at the beginning of their life?
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.120]   They consume
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.040]   They consume
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:15.040]   Whether it's you're a teenager and you can as I was a fool
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:22.720]   you know and consume all my money on a movie ticket and you know stuff or whether you consume it all on on travel or
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:29.560]   Being a heavy drinker and going out every Friday and Saturday night and you know blowing 150 bucks on your weekly bar tab
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:34.480]   Whether you consume it on a fancy-looking car or whether you assume consume it on a fancy-looking house
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:41.720]   Or whether you consume it on exotic vacations or whatever most of the time in our society when people have money they consume it early
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.280]   They consume it
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.360]   That's the time at which it needs to be invested
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:53.760]   Now the other major mistake, let's say that you've accumulated some capital. What do many people do with capital?
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.080]   well, they pull back on their potential rates of return and
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:05.120]   That destroys the potential of that capital and they walk away many people from millions of extra potential dollars
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:09.000]   Just recognize that
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.840]   None of these things can be applied in a vacuum of an individual situation
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:18.760]   But it's useful to have as a mental construct when you come and you look at your situation
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.760]   You say where am I and what can I do?
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:24.920]   And that's the key is the app is how to apply it
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.560]   the key is
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.360]   Get compounding and get compound interest working on your side
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.480]   no matter how
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:40.040]   The cool thing is compounding and compound interest is already working on our sides. We're all enjoying the benefits of compounding
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:45.040]   We're all enjoying it already, let me give you an example
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.240]   This is why it frustrates me that we don't recognize it
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.440]   I'm just starting to read and I actually want I'd wanted to do this show before I read the books
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.200]   I knew that if I read the book I was my opinions were gonna be colored
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:58.840]   But I'm just starting to read Peter Thiel's new book. Excuse me, Peter Diamandis
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:03.040]   Do you mean I don't know how you say his last name Diamondis is D. Amanda's his last name
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.520]   he's the guy who
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.720]   started the
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:09.680]   the X Prize not Peter Thiel, excuse me, and
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.720]   Peter D. Amanda's has this new book called
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:19.840]   Bold how to go big create wealth and impact the world and what's interesting to me is it's very fascinating because it's very technologically focused
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.820]   So I just was I got the book and I was flipping through it
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:28.900]   Just look real quick at a quick overview of what it's about and he has this really interesting chart that fascinates me
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:34.240]   And it's basically the application of Moore's law Moore's law, which is over a certain period of time
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.960]   the computing power of
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.240]   chips of the
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:45.520]   Microprocessor doubles and and the price halves. I think it's 18 months. I forget what's what the specific specifics of it are
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:49.660]   But basically everything over time gets cheaper and with everything technology related
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:52.080]   gets cheaper and
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:58.800]   Better with a massive scale and this has been held consistent for decades now and it's fascinating but
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:03.080]   He puts in here a chart and evidently this is from his book abundance
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:10.520]   And he says that there are over nine hundred thousand dollars worth of applications that come free and included in every smartphone today
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:16.300]   And think about this the majority of you listening to me are listening on a smart device of some kind smartphone
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.000]   Think about all these applications
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:24.320]   Number one video conferencing and today's dollars it today's world. It's free. It's free
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:30.240]   It's included whether it's on Skype or whether it's in FaceTime or whatever the I don't know what the Android equivalents of that are
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:32.600]   in 1982
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.840]   compression labs video conferencing had a
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:39.760]   MSRP of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars if you bring that forward into
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:46.120]   2011 dollars, that'd be five hundred eighty six thousand dollars was how much it costs to do video conferencing in 1982
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.600]   GPS today included in your phone free
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:56.520]   Nav star in 1982 sold it for a hundred nineteen thousand dollars adjusted for inflation is two hundred eighty thousand dollars

[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:08.020]   Sony PCM in 1978 sold it for twenty five hundred dollars and a two thousand eleven dollars. That's equivalent of eight thousand six hundred eighty seven dollars
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:10.400]   digital watch

[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.320]   He total all that up and in inflation adjusted dollars and it's worth over nine hundred thousand dollars
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:09.280]   And those are just the applications that come standard in a phone
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.280]   Isn't that incredible
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:15.160]   Now you still obviously still have to buy the phone
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:18.200]   So it's not technically free you have to buy the device
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:24.840]   But if you noticed how cheap those devices are getting and how the performance is going up. That's the application of Moore's law
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.680]   I'm sure I'm gonna I mean
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:30.880]   This is a subject that fascinates me because I see it happening all through our society and changing anything
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:35.000]   That's touching being touched by digits is is is subject to Moore's law
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.120]   It's getting cheaper and better constantly cheaper better constantly cheaper better cheaper better cheaper better cheaper better cheaper better
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.360]   And it doesn't show any signs of slowing
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.320]   It's revolutionizing the world we live in
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:51.560]   Why did I go into that reason I went into that was because we're all already enjoying those benefits
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:58.280]   The fact that you're hearing me right now on a podcast this was not possible without great
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:02.040]   technological acumen five years ago today
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.400]   Free and easy every one of you knows how to go to the App Store
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:09.760]   Everyone I want to be knows how to tell someone go to the App Store and search radical personal finance
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.760]   And you can listen to my voice no matter where you are
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:18.800]   So enjoy the benefits of company that are happening in society and compounding happens in every area of life
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.080]   We focus primarily on money, and I think that's valuable
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:28.020]   But as I close I want you to think about applying this to other areas of your life after I prepared this
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:32.080]   This outline I went and pulled
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:38.360]   Book off my shelf by Darren Hardy called the compound effect, and this is one of the best simplest little books
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.880]   That was so helpful
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:44.800]   And I went and pulled this because I thought he did a good job in here and what's funny is he started with the magic
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.040]   penny
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:51.600]   He started with the magic penny, and then he went into this example here of how compounding happens in every area
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.600]   I'm gonna every area of life, and I'm gonna read to you
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:38:01.800]   It's about six five pages here from this book where he's talking about the impact of compounding in other areas other than finance
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.520]   This happens in your job this happens in your knowledge happens your health
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:11.360]   There's so many areas of which we can experience compounding, but consider this and consider those examples
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.240]   I'm reading from page 11 highly recommend this book to you a lot of you
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:17.520]   I need to prepare a recommended reading reading list. This is a great one
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:21.000]   It's just called the compound effect get it and read it, but page 11 here
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.320]   Three friends let's take three buddies who all grew up together
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:29.800]   They live in the same neighborhood with very similar sensibilities each makes around fifty thousand dollars a year
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:35.440]   They're all married and have average health and body weight plus a little bit of that dreaded marriage flab
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:40.760]   Friend number one let's call him Larry plods along doing as he's always done
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:45.880]   He's happy or so he thinks but complains occasionally that nothing ever changes
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:49.560]   Friend number two Scott starts making some small
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.800]   seemingly
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.800]   inconsequential positive changes
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:39:01.680]   He begins reading ten pages of a good book per day and listening to 30 minutes of something instructional or inspirational on his commute to work
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:06.120]   Scott wants to see changes in his life, but doesn't want to make a fuss over it
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:12.720]   He recently read an interview with dr. Mehmet Oz and success magazine and chose one idea from the article to implement in this life
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.880]   He's going to cut
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:18.240]   325 calories from his diet every day no big deal
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:22.960]   We're talking maybe a cup of cereal less trading that can of soda for a bottle of seltzer
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.880]   Switching from mayo to mustard on his sandwich
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:31.400]   Doable he's also started walking a couple thousand extra steps per day less than a mile
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:36.280]   No, grand acts of bravery or effort stuff anyone could do
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:44.240]   But Scott is determined to stick with these choices knowing that even though they're simple he could also easily be tempted to abandon them
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.760]   Friend number three Brad makes a few poor choices
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:53.560]   He recently bought a new big-screen TV so he can watch more of his favorite programs
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:40:00.640]   He's been trying out the recipe he's recipes he's seen on the food channel the cheesy casseroles and desserts are his favorites
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:01.720]   Oh
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:08.240]   And he installed a bar in his family room and added one alcoholic drink per week to his diet nothing crazy
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:12.640]   Brad just wants to have a little more fun at the end of five months
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.800]   no
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:19.560]   perceivable differences exist among Larry Scott or Brad
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:26.960]   Scott continues to read a little bit every night and listen to audios during his commute Brad is enjoying life and doing less
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:30.640]   Larry keeps doing as he has always as he always has
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.880]   Even though each man has his own pattern of behavior
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:40.200]   Five months isn't long enough to see any real decline or improvement in their situations
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:45.800]   In fact, if you charted the three men's weights, you'd see a rounding error of zero
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:53.240]   They'd look exactly equal at the end of ten months. We still can't see noticeable changes in any of their lives
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:41:00.720]   It's not until we get to the end of the 18th month that the slightest differences are measurable in these three friends appearances
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:06.600]   But at about month 25, we start seeing really measurable
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:14.200]   Invisible differences at month 27. We see an expansive difference and by month 31 the change is startling
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:19.440]   Brad is now fat while Scott is trim by simply cutting
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:24.920]   125 calories a day in 31 months Scott has lost 33 pounds
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:34.520]   The math here 31 months equals 940 days 940 days times 125 calories a day is a hundred and seventeen thousand five hundred
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:42.240]   Calories saved hundred seventeen thousand five hundred calories saved times one pound which has thirty five hundred calories is thirty three and a half pounds
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.600]   That's the math
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:48.760]   Brad ate only 125 calories more a day in that same time frame and gained
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:52.240]   33.5 pounds now he weighs
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:58.840]   67 pounds more than Scott, but the differences are more significant than weight Scott's invested almost
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:05.140]   1,000 hours reading good books and listening to self-improvement audios by putting his newly gained knowledge into practice
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:08.680]   He's earned a promotion and a raise best of all his marriage is thriving
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:13.360]   Brad he's unhappy at work and his marriage is on the rocks and Larry
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:19.680]   Larry is pretty much exactly where he was two and a half years ago except now he's a little more bitter about it
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:27.140]   The phenomenal power of the compounding effect is that simple the difference between people who employ the compound effect for their benefit
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:32.240]   Compared to their peers who allow the same effect to work against them is almost inconceivable
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:36.900]   It looks miraculous like magic or quantum leaps
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:44.960]   After 31 months or 31 years the person who uses the positive nature of the compound effect appears to be an overnight success
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:51.280]   And reality his or her profound success was the result of small smart choices
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:54.180]   completed consistently over time
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:59.320]   The results in the above example seem dramatic. I know but it goes even deeper than that
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:05.680]   the reality is that even one small change can have a significant impact that causes an unexpected and
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.880]   Unintended ripple effect. Let's put one of Brad's bad habits under the microscope
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:17.760]   eating rich food more frequently to better understand how the compound effect can also work in a negative way and can create a ripple effect
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.760]   That impacts your entire life
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:23.380]   Brad makes some muffins from a recipe he learned from the food channel
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:27.880]   He's proud and his family loves it and it seems to add value all around
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:35.520]   He starts making them and other sweets frequently. He loves his own cooking and eats more than his share, but not so much that anyone notices
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:39.340]   However, the extra food makes Brad sluggish at night
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:46.080]   He wakes up a little groggy which makes him cranky the crankiness and sleep deprivation begin to impact his work performance
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:51.560]   He's less productive and as a result gets discouraging feedback from his boss by the end of the day
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:55.640]   He feels dissatisfied with his job and his energy level is way down
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:44:02.560]   The commute home seems longer and more stressful than ever. All of this makes him reach for more comfort food
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.360]   Stress has a way of doing that
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:11.900]   The overall lack of energy makes Brad less likely to take walks with his wife like he used to he just doesn't feel like it
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:15.600]   She misses their time together and takes his withdrawal personally
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:20.540]   With fewer shared activities with his wife and an absence of fresh air and exercise
[00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:26.480]   Brad's not getting the endorphin release that had helped make him feel upbeat and enthusiastic
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:34.400]   Because he's not as happy he starts finding fault with himself and others and stops complimenting his wife as his own body starts to feel
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:40.040]   Flabby, he feels less self-confident less attractive and becomes less romantic
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:45.320]   Brad doesn't realize how his lack of energy and affection toward his wife affects her
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:52.080]   He just knows that he feels funky. He starts losing himself in late-night TV because it's easy and distracting
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:56.960]   Feeling his distance Brad's wife starts to complain then becomes needy
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:01.720]   When that doesn't work, she emotionally withdraws to protect herself
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:09.000]   She's lonely. She pours her energy into her work and spends more time with her girlfriends to fulfill her need for companionship
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.400]   Men start flirting with her which makes her feel desirable again
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:16.760]   She would never cheat on Brad, but he has a feeling something's wrong
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:23.160]   Instead of seeing that his poor choices and behaviors are at the root of their problems. He finds fault with his wife
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:29.960]   Believing that the other person is wrong rather than looking inside and doing the work necessary to clean up your messes
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:35.240]   Basic psychology 101 stuff and Brad's case. He doesn't know know to look inside
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:40.520]   They don't offer self-improvement or relationship advice on Top Chef or his favorite crime shows
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:46.520]   However, the thought may have occurred to him that if he had read
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:51.960]   The thought may have occurred to him that if he had read the personal development books his buddy Scott reads
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.840]   He might have learned about ways to change negative habits
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:59.520]   Unfortunately for Brad the small choices he made on a daily basis
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:04.000]   Created a ripple that wreaked havoc on every area of his life
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:12.760]   Of course all that calorie counting and intellectual stimulation has had the opposite effect with Scott who is now reaping the bounty of positive
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:15.120]   Results, it's that simple
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:20.080]   With enough time and consistency the outcomes become visible
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:23.040]   Better yet. They're totally predictable
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:28.080]   The compound effect is predictable and measurable. That's great news
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:32.240]   Isn't it comforting to know that you only need to take a series of tiny steps?
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.440]   Consistently over time to radically improve your life
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:43.600]   Doesn't that sound easier than mustering up some grand show of bravery and heroic strength only to wear yourself out and have to drum up
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:47.440]   All that energy again at a later date for another try which will likely be unsuccessful
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:51.680]   I'm exhausted just thinking about it, but that's what people do
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:59.720]   We've been conditioned by society to believe in the effectiveness of a great display of massive effort. It's downright all-american
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:06.200]   The most challenging aspect of the compound effect is that we have to keep working away for a while
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:09.120]   consistently and efficiently
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.240]   Before we can begin to see the payoff
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:15.080]   Our grandparents knew this though
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:22.200]   They didn't spend their evenings glued to the TV watching infomercials about how to have thin thighs in 30 days or a real estate kingdom
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:27.000]   In six months, I bet your grandparents worked six days a week from sunup to sundown
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:32.080]   Using the skills they learned in their youth and repeatedly throughout their entire life
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:35.720]   They knew the secret was hard work
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.720]   discipline and good habits
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:41.920]   It's interesting that wealth tends to skip a generation
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:47.400]   Overwhelming abundance often leads to a lackadaisical mentality which brings about a sedentary lifestyle
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:50.400]   Children of the wealthy are especially susceptible
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:55.000]   They weren't the ones who developed the discipline and character to create the wealth in the first place
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:48:02.360]   So it makes sense that they may not have the same sense of value for wealth or understand what's necessary to keep it
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:06.760]   We frequently see this entitlement mentality in children of royalty
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:13.240]   movie stars and corporate executives and to a lesser degree in children and adults everywhere
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:18.120]   As a nation our entire populace seems to have lost appreciation
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:23.040]   For the value of a strong work ethic
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:27.920]   We've had two if not three generations of Americans who have known great prosperity
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:30.800]   wealth and ease
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:34.320]   Our expectations of what it really takes to create lasting success
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:41.680]   Things like grit hard work and fortitude aren't alluring and thus have been mostly forgotten
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:48.920]   We've lost respect for the strife and struggle of our forefathers the massive effort they put forth and still discipline
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:54.920]   Chiseled their character and stoked the spirit to brave new frontiers
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:59.280]   The truth is complacency has impacted all great empires
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:05.780]   Including but not limited to the Egyptians Greeks Roman Spanish Portuguese French and English. Why?
[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:09.280]   Because nothing fails like success
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:16.000]   once dominant empires have failed for this very reason people get to a certain level of success and
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.440]   Get too comfortable
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:24.400]   Having experienced extended periods of prosperity health and wealth we become complacent
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:28.360]   We stopped doing what we did to get us there
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:32.760]   If we want to succeed we need to recover our grandparents work ethic
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:39.640]   It's time to restore our character if not for the sake of saving America at least for your own greater success and achievement
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:42.320]   Don't buy into the genie-in-a-lamp idea
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:47.760]   You can sit on your couch waiting to attract checks in your mailbox rub crystals together walk on fire
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.920]   Channel that two thousand year old guru or chant affirmations if you want to but much of that is hocus-pocus
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.880]   commercialism
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:58.360]   Manipulating you by appealing to your weaknesses
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:02.360]   real and lasting success requires work and
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:10.000]   Lots of it. I have a quick real-time story to illustrate this nothing fails like success concept a great new restaurant
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.400]   Opened up close to my home on the beach in San Diego in the beginning
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:19.080]   The place was always immaculate the hostess had a big welcoming smile for everyone the service was impeccable
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:23.600]   The manager came over and assured it and the food was sensational
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:28.200]   Soon people started lining up to eat there and would often wait more than an hour to be seated
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:33.000]   Then unfortunately the restaurant staff began to take its success for granted
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:39.440]   The hostess became snooty the service staff disheveled and curt and the food quality hit or miss
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:42.480]   The place was out of business within 18 months
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:50.360]   They failed because of their success or rather because they stopped doing what made them successful to begin with
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:54.460]   Their success clouded their perspective and they slacked off
[00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:57.720]   Understanding the compound effect will rid you of
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:05.760]   Insta results expectation the belief success should be as fast as your fast food your one-hour glasses your 30-minute photo processing your overnight mail
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:09.880]   Your microwave eggs your instant hot water and text messaging enough, okay?
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:16.400]   promise yourself that you're going to let go once and for all of your lottery winner expectations because
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:23.200]   Let's face it. You only hear stories about the one winner not the millions of you losers
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:29.040]   The person you see jumping up and down in front of the Vegas slot machine or at the Santa Anita horse track
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:36.600]   Doesn't reveal the hundreds of times that same person lost if we go back to our mathematical chance of a positive result
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:43.480]   Again, we have a rounding error of zero as in you have about zero chance of winning
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:52.240]   Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert author of stumbling on happiness says that if we gave lottery losers each 30 seconds on TV to announce not I
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:58.560]   Won, but I lost it would take almost nine years to get through the losers of a single drawing
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:04.720]   When you understand how the compound effect works you won't pine for quick fixes or silver bullets
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:10.220]   Don't try to fool yourself into believing that a mega successful athlete didn't live through regular
[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:13.760]   Bone crushing drills and thousands of hours of practice
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:18.520]   He got up early to practice and kept practicing long after all others had stopped
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:22.800]   He faced the sheer agony and frustration of the failure
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.440]   loneliness hard work and
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.940]   Disappointment it took to become number one
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:35.000]   By the end of this book or even before I want you to know in your bones that your only path to success
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.080]   Is through a continuum of mundane?
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:40.520]   unsexy
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:45.440]   Unexciting and sometimes difficult daily disciplines compounded over time
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:52.200]   Know too that the results the life and the lifestyle of your dreams can be yours
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:55.360]   When you put the compound effect to work for you
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:02.600]   It's probably a good sales pitch for the for the book right if you can't tell it's a good one
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:06.000]   Haven't read it in at least three or four years probably since it came out
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.920]   I bought it right when it came out and I just pulled it off the shelf this morning and said I want
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:12.540]   X I remembered his example and I wanted to find it
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:17.840]   It's a good it's a good book highly recommended that's the compound effect
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:22.380]   Now just knowing it isn't enough, you know, I've known that for a long time
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:24.960]   But you know for me
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:32.000]   When I apply I am applying the compound effect and radical personal finance and some of my business ventures in lots of things
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.660]   But is it just because I apply it in one area doesn't mean I'm applying in all the other areas for me
[00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:41.720]   My weakness is my own physical health, you know fat and flabby and weak
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:47.600]   I'm working on that. I've got been getting some help and I'm working hard on that to apply it
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:53.320]   But I've realized even for me and I'm just sharing with you as one person who's learning alongside you
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:57.040]   I'm not an expert on these things. I'm an amateur and
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:00.800]   even for me just simply recognizing that
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:04.800]   Nothing comes in 30 days
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:12.780]   I'm learning even more I've learned a little bit over the years, but I'm learning even more to train myself to completely ignore overnight
[00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:15.640]   So called success stories
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:18.280]   Because I can't control that
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:23.640]   Yeah, maybe somebody else can lose 80 pounds in 60 days and build 50 pounds of muscle
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:27.440]   But I'm not sure that I can control that maybe I can this goes back to
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:33.400]   This goes back to just the principles of investing you have to hold these things together. They're seemingly disconnected, but they're together
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:39.960]   All I can control is do I work do I save do I put my money in and do I make wise choices?
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:46.800]   And am I making as wise of a choice as I possibly can I can't necessarily control this one
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:50.220]   Investment is gonna multiply a hundredfold. It's possible
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:57.140]   All I can control though is that I'm making wise choices and I'm putting money in and I'm investing same thing in any area of life
[00:54:57.140 --> 00:55:02.280]   Maybe we do respond better and that's when you do get the overnight successes so-called
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:07.560]   But as he points out the athlete who walks into a 10 million dollar contract, they didn't walk in there
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:12.400]   There were years of hard work in their backstory
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.880]   years
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:19.840]   Learn the lessons of the magic penny apply them in your own life and get compounding working to you
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:24.720]   That's the core of what I wanted to cover in today's show. I hope it's useful to you
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:28.000]   I hope you can take these concepts and build on them
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.640]   Remember we all don't feel bad if you're behind in something
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:38.080]   I hate that how oftentimes people look at these charts or hear about compound interest they throw up their hands
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.320]   The point is not to throw up your hands, but to start wherever you are
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:44.080]   You know going on my health example. I've failed for years
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:48.120]   At health I've waffled all over the place. Does it do me any good?
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:52.240]   To sit back and focus on that doesn't do me a bit of good
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:57.240]   What does me good is to wake up and say I'm gonna start again, and I'm not gonna quit
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:00.560]   Same thing for you whether it's money health marriage career
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:03.880]   Anything in life
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:09.620]   Grows over time and as example with Larry and the other two guys Brad and whomever
[00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:12.400]   You can't see it the effects in the first place
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:17.960]   You know with the show I can't see the effects all I can do is show up and do my best
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:22.560]   But over time I get better people hear about it. You start to get the compounding effect
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:25.240]   So what is it? Where are you applying the compounding effect in your life?
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.880]   That's the core
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:32.960]   So that's it. Thank you so much for listening if you have gotten benefit from this
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:37.380]   I would ask you to consider supporting the show on patreon as of right now
[00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:41.120]   We are up to 44 patrons and six hundred and three dollars per month
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:47.800]   So we're over 25% of the way there to our initial goal of two thousand dollars per month at two thousand dollars per month
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:50.800]   We swap out the intro music probably keep this for the outro
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:56.560]   Can't beat it right, but I'll swap out the intro music for a better intro
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:59.480]   We're on our way to six thousand dollars per month by June 1
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:04.040]   That's the major goal if we can get six thousand dollars a month for the show by June 1. I will avoid
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:06.720]   advertisers and corporate
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:11.240]   Sponsors and interests for the duration of the show if we can't get to sit there by June 1
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:15.240]   I will need to go ahead and bring on some sponsors to make the show pay for itself
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:18.360]   A little bit better so that I can continue doing it
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:22.880]   Or at least doing it with the regularity and the frequency that I'm currently applying towards it
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:26.040]   But I really love to avoid that if every listener to the show gave two bucks a month
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:31.560]   We'd be done we'd be at six thousand a month. So consider going to radical personal finance comm slash patron and
