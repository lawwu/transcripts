[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.540]   Welcome back to the podcast. We have a special episode to close out of the week.
[00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.500]   It's an update, and we're gonna take a moment to look back and look ahead, and
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.140]   that is because our fiscal year comes to an end in 12 days, at the end of June, and
[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.620]   it's a good time to stop and look back at God's providence over the past year,
[00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.900]   to thank him for his kindness, to see what we can learn from him, and then to
[00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.780]   ponder our planning for the year to come, and particularly for the summer ahead for
[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.780]   you, Pastor John. So as we start, what would you want people to know?
[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.940]   Well, Tony, just right off the bat, my guess is that a lot of people wonder, at
[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.460]   least I did, why we have a fiscal, a financial year that is different from
[00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.020]   our calendar year. That just seems to complicate things. It does for me when I
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.340]   try to think about this, and one of the answers is this. December is far and away
[00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.500]   our biggest month of support from our donors, and the scope of that month's
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.700]   giving shapes the planning for the future of what we're able to do, and
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.620]   therefore we can't be doing the serious, detailed planning in the very last month
[00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.900]   of the year when that's the month that is shaping the planning. So it makes
[00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.640]   sense to me now, a little more than it used to, as to why we do it that way, so
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.300]   that we can formulate our goals for the fiscal year starting in July, based on
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.680]   what we saw happen in December and then in the beginning part of the year. So
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.760]   just, I think it's good to begin with that kind of clarification of, "Why in
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.620]   the world are you doing this in the middle of the summer?"
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.460]   That's good, and it reminds us that so much of what we plan and pursue at
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.380]   Desiring God, it hangs on the amazing generosity of those who love this
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.100]   ministry. And I know, Pastor John, you and I, we both feel the blessing of that,
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.540]   especially in doing this podcast, right? Week in and a week out. We wouldn't be
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.500]   doing APJ without your support, and so we hope that you rejoice with us as God
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.540]   continues to show his favor on us. And speaking of his favor, we are nearing a
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.780]   huge benchmark that we've had our eye on for a few years now, huge for us anyways,
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:22.540]   and that is 200 million all-time episode plays. 200 million episodes played over
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.860]   the course of our nine-year history. It is amazing. I mean, we are on pace to hit
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.540]   that benchmark sometime in late July, maybe early August, but we're just weeks
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.540]   away from that. So 200 million plays. Thank you to everyone who listens in a
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.300]   podcast app or listens in the APJ app or who listens in YouTube. YouTube
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.340]   represents about 40 million of those plays alone, which is just incredible to
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.500]   me. That is weird, you know, people go to YouTube to watch. No, they don't. They
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.060]   listen. Well, they're listening right now, so thank you, YouTube audience, for
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.900]   listening through YouTube. And there are no signs of slowing down. We still get
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.580]   dozens of questions every day. We continue to record and try to keep up
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.220]   with at least some of those questions. It's a wonderful work that we get to do
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.820]   in partnership with our listeners and our donors. It has been a gift to us that
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.380]   APJ is the kind of ministry that is possible to pursue right through all the
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.660]   limitations that come in a pandemic, like the one that we're emerging from. It has
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.860]   been a year like really no other in our lifetime. Right, especially here in
[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.500]   Minneapolis. Yeah. The effects of COVID-19 and the violence that we experienced that
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.980]   was stirred up last summer because of the killing of George Floyd, these two
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.900]   realities have created a kind of wartime mentality here in Minneapolis for the
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.580]   past year or so. There never has been a time before when I would sit with my
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.140]   wife each evening and she would read to me the casualty statistics of the
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.940]   pandemic in Minnesota. I mean, it's as if we were sitting here in a war and she's
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.300]   reading me the statistics from the front lines of the war. This many people
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.460]   infected, this many people in intensive care, this many people have died. During
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.580]   the German bombing of London in 1940, I'm reading a book about this right now,
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:20.500]   there were austerity measures. Black out your windows so no light gets through to
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.700]   show the bombers where to drop the bombs. Drink your tea sparingly because you
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.820]   only get three ounces of rationing each week. Carry your gas mask to work. And
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.620]   that's the way it's been with the pandemic. Closed restaurants, closed
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.060]   theaters, closed schools, closed churches, and all the while here in Minneapolis
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.180]   boarded up coffee shops two blocks from my house and boarded up restaurants and
[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:50.180]   wondering where the next simmering unrest is gonna break out. So yeah, it's
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.820]   been an unusual year for everybody. Very unusual, but it sure hasn't seemed to
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.700]   slow you down or even slow the ministry down at all. No, in fact, if anything, I
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:09.780]   would say the pandemic increased my output. Yeah. I mean, that's just the
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.860]   nature of my job. If a pandemic says to me, "You have to stay inside, Piper," that's
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:22.180]   like a fox saying to a rabbit, "I have to throw you into the briar patch." Oh no, no,
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.940]   please don't throw me in the briar patch. That's where I live. Ironically, I say to the
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:35.700]   pandemic, "What a painful gift you have been to me. You said to me, 'Stay there at
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:42.300]   your desk, Piper, and do your 252 look at the book episodes to finish the book of
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.540]   Ephesians.'" I mean, that was a gift to me. I mean, I loved finishing the book of
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:53.260]   Ephesians, the second greatest letter in the world, and we did 252 look at the book
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.820]   episodes on it. And then, "Stay there again, Piper, and get going on 1 Thessalonians."
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:03.260]   And so I've done, goodness, as we're recording this, I've done about 50 more
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.900]   episodes on 1 Thessalonians. And while you're at it, stay there and work with
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.900]   Crossway of Desiring God and Westminster Books to launch this big red book on
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.060]   Providence. And oh, while you're at it in quarantine, take a couple of weeks and
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.580]   write a book on coronavirus in Christ and apply the doctrine of Providence to
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.740]   that particular trouble. And then, from another angle of my life, it was a
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:33.100]   tremendous privilege and pleasure to teach preaching in the fall and the
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.060]   spring at Bethlehem College and Seminary. I think we only missed one class in
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:43.740]   person because of COVID. I love, Tony, I love being in class with these future
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:51.740]   preachers. It is such a delight. So, no, the COVID-19 has not slowed me down or
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.900]   slowed down Desiring God. The teaching team with David Mathis and John
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.660]   Blum and Marshall Siegel and Greg Morris and Scott Hubbard and Joe Rigney, they
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:07.100]   didn't miss a beat in the steady stream of articles that they produced. And David
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:12.380]   finished his book called "Humbled," which is supposed to be, I believe, out this
[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:19.100]   fall. And as far as I can tell, COVID didn't slow you down. I believe you
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:25.220]   finished your book, "God, Technology, and the Christian Life." And I think our
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.700]   listeners would love to hear about that. What are you trying to do in that
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:36.180]   major book, and when can they look for it? Yeah, January is when it
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.560]   launches from our friends at Crossway Books. I've always wanted to write a big
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.980]   book on technology and really get into the weeds of things like genetic
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:49.100]   engineering and nuclear power and space travel and robotics and self-driving
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.780]   cars and artificial intelligence and medical advances and anti-aging
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.420]   innovations, which are really taking off now. And to look at all of that and
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:02.460]   really ask, "Where did all that come from?" And does it all violate what God
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:07.860]   intended for his creation, or does it fulfill it? Have we discovered new
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:12.620]   powers that God never intended for us to ever find? Are these new technologies a
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:17.580]   sort of forbidden fruit we were not supposed to find or touch? And so, you
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.540]   know, back in my book on smartphones published in 2017, I wrote a little
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.900]   12-page introduction as to how I think of tech broadly, knowing that that little
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:30.060]   introduction would eventually need to become a big book one day on technology.
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.900]   But the large book idea was really only a distant dream of mine for many, many
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.940]   years. And so I started to write out some messages and pick away at it. I
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:42.300]   delivered a few messages on tech to friends of ours at DG, at donor
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.380]   gatherings, to many of our friends who live and work inside the tech industry.
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.700]   And I delivered those messages to those small gatherings. One was in Phoenix, a
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.980]   few were in Seattle, and then the virus just closed everything down, all of our
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:58.100]   travel. And it was like, "Well, I guess fiscal year 2021 is gonna be the year
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.660]   that I have the time now to read and to research and to finally write this big
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.380]   book on technology." So I did it, it's done, it's ready for a January release, and
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:12.060]   you've written the book on Providence. And this is basically my little attempt
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.620]   to help Christians appreciate God's providence over big tech, over Elon Musk,
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:21.420]   and over Silicon Valley, and to really show how God, through his Word, leads us
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.660]   to embrace a God-centered worldview over all of it, so we're not left with a
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:30.380]   godless worldview where he doesn't factor in at all to big tech. And I fear
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:34.140]   that that's really where many Christians live, with a view of technology that's
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:39.140]   pessimistic and dystopian, because at root it's simply a godless view of
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.380]   it all. God is nowhere to be factored into the equation, for whatever reasons.
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.780]   And I think that's problematic for a lot of reasons. And so I'm thrilled with
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:52.980]   this book, and I hope it's as enjoyable to read as it was to write. But as we
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.740]   look ahead for the summer, we will continue to press on with APJ episodes
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.380]   here, and you continue to plan to press on with Look at the Book episodes.
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:06.100]   Anything else we should have on our radar? Well, Desiring God in the new year
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:10.820]   is gonna—new fiscal year—is gonna pour a lot of energy, a lot of resources into
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:17.800]   the global dimension of our ministry, the global reach of our resources. Indeed,
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:23.620]   as we did last year, coronavirus and Christ set the bar so high—I don't know
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:29.420]   if we'll ever reach it again—with 31 languages. Almost overnight we translated
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:34.900]   that little book into those languages, working with translators in those various
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:41.740]   cultures. An even more coordinated effort is underway with the Providence book for
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:47.340]   translation into, I think, nine major languages right now, simultaneously, and
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:52.980]   Desiring God getting behind those in a big way. But on my front burner is a
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:59.340]   writing leave in July and August to work on a book on the Second Coming. I've
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.540]   wanted to do this for a long time. I think I would say that my goal for the
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:12.380]   book is that more people would come to love—love—the Second Coming of Christ,
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:19.580]   because Paul said in 2 Timothy 4:8, "There is laid up for me the crown of
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:25.700]   righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:35.340]   day, and not only to me, but to all who have loved his appearing." What an amazing
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:41.260]   privilege to have time and resources to work on a book like this. So, Tony, we
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:48.540]   can't say it too often to our friends on this podcast that you're working on APJ
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:53.700]   and God Technology and the Christian Life, and my working on a book like the
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:12:00.380]   Second Coming of Christ is happening because people have come to love what we
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:07.100]   live for at Desiring God. The glorifying of God through being more satisfied in
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:11.260]   God than anything else, even in our suffering, through the teaching of the
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:16.620]   truth and beauty of all that God is for us in Christ, with everything rooted in
[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:22.460]   God's infallible scriptures, the Bible. That's what we're about, and we are
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:29.180]   thankful to those of you who share these convictions with us. Amen. So very
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.540]   thankful. It really is an amazing privilege. Thank you all for listening
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.220]   and for watching and reading DG Resources. Thank you to everyone who
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.860]   prays for the ministry, and thank you to all our ministry partners who
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:44.060]   financially support us so that we can make all of our resources and translate
[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:49.220]   them into many languages and spread them all over the world free of charge. It's
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:53.260]   an incredible work, and if you want to join us in the labors, you can today at
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:59.380]   DesiringGod.org/donate. That's DesiringGod.org/donate.
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:05.180]   Thank you so much for listening, and we will see you back here on Monday. Bye-bye.
