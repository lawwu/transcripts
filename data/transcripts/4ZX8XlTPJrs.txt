[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   This has been one of the hottest growing areas of financial services.
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.760]   Adyen is not just a normal payment provider.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.800]   While payment usually is a very unsexy piece of our industry,
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.040]   you guys made it sexy.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.720]   Growth on our platform has been very significant.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.800]   We're investing for the future.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.240]   If you work with newer technology, you get to better quality.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.840]   We completely rebuilt the infrastructure that typically is run by banks.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.720]   And by doing that, we come to much better conversion rates for our customers.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.280]   Ladies and gentlemen, the Co-CEO of Adyen, Ingo Dar.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.680]   Hi, good to see you.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.120]   Let me give just a little brief overview for a second.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.720]   So Ingo has been with Adyen since 2011.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.400]   First as the CFO and now as Co-CEO since May of 2023.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.000]   Adyen is based in the Netherlands, founded in 2006,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.200]   and is one of the largest payment processors in the world today.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.680]   In 2023, Adyen processed nearly a trillion euro in payment volume.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.840]   They had net revenue of 1.6 billion euros and an EBITDA,
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.320]   Jesus Christ, EBITDA of 743 million euros, a 46% EBITDA margin.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.640]   Incredible.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.920]   It's a capitalist conference.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.840]   We applaud for EBITDA margin.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.680]   Can you just say it one more time slowly?
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.400]   EBITDA.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.920]   The company reported a 24% year-on-year revenue growth in H124.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.240]   They just expanded into India, which is really interesting.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.960]   I want to talk to you about that.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.920]   Your market cap is today, actually, I just checked, about 45 billion American dollars.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.040]   So it's one of the most successful, not just European tech companies of all time,
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.160]   but frankly, tech companies of all time.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.160]   So welcome, Ingo.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.440]   Thank you. Thank you for having me today.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.280]   You're a former CFO.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.280]   I'm going to put you on the spot.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.320]   You're no longer the CFO, nor the co-CEO of Adyen.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.920]   You're an analyst at an investment bank.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.040]   And J-Cal, your managing director, says,
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.920]   "Put together a spread trade.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.000]   You can be long or short one of Adyen and Stripe."
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.760]   How do we construct the business case?
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.880]   That's a really good question.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.000]   Just the parameters of how we construct the case.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.120]   I would say, if you look at this industry,
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.760]   for ourselves and Stripe, there is a lot to win.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.400]   Because I think we are the only two companies globally
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.080]   that are investing in technology, in financial technology.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.600]   And if you look at where most of the business currently is,
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.360]   it is with the traditional players.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.560]   It's the banks, it's incumbent players.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.560]   So I would certainly go for long for both of us,
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.760]   because I believe that we, together,
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.880]   are going to change this industry.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.280]   That's how I look at Adyen versus Stripe.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.600]   We come from different angles,
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.760]   but what I really appreciate about them
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.400]   is the fact that they also innovate,
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.720]   and competition is good.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.720]   We're a company of a lot of athletes.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.920]   We like to compete, and competition is good.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.080]   So when you do compete in the marketplace,
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.400]   are you competing then with Stripe,
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.000]   or are you competing more with incumbents
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.120]   where traditional players are looking for payments?
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.440]   - Yeah, I would say, of course,
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.000]   there are areas where we compete with Stripe.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.120]   But if you see where we win most of our business,
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.800]   it's with the traditional businesses.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.000]   So indeed, the incumbents, the banks,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.560]   that's where volume comes from.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.800]   - And what do they find?
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.520]   They find both the cost is too high,
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.040]   and then they find the technology's too brittle
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.360]   for what you need to do today.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.200]   - Exactly, I think if you look at this industry,
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.360]   banks, incumbents haven't invested for ages.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.080]   We build everything from the ground up,
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.320]   so we have a single platform globally.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.880]   And what we can do is we can basically
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.640]   lower total cost of payments,
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.840]   and increase the authorization rates.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.080]   And that combination is very powerful.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.400]   And the reason why we can do that
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.480]   is because we have lots of data in a single platform.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.320]   - Now, at the end of the day,
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.840]   you guys still sit on top of these fundamental rails, right?
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.280]   Meaning, is there a way where we are in a world
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.360]   where the traditional payment infrastructure,
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.720]   and then the traditional credit card rails,
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.720]   is there a world soon where all of that disappears,
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.680]   or is there enough?
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.840]   - Specifically, the networks like Swift,
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.880]   the banks themselves, what role do they--
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.080]   - Why do these people still exist?
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.920]   - Well, it's a good question.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.800]   I think, indeed, what we try to replace
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.160]   is the fundamental infrastructure.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.000]   So in the US, we have our own access to the Fed.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.680]   We have a banking license in the US.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.800]   So we don't need commercial banks to be successful.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.320]   And I think that's very crucial in our development.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.480]   If you take long-term, also on the platform side,
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.720]   a lot of small businesses, they struggle to work with banks.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.000]   And a lot of the software service providers,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.960]   they, of course, build banking as a service.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.320]   And there are only a few companies globally
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.920]   that can offer this.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.560]   We want to be that player, that partner
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.040]   for these type of companies
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.440]   to help them sell financial products.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.200]   So that's also why we have expanded from payments
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   to broader financial technology.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.800]   - Do you, have you ever had a conversation internally
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.000]   which said something along the following lines?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.280]   Ah, 46% EBITDA, that's a lot.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.280]   We don't need that.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.840]   How much of that 743 million would grow the business
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.600]   if we just took it to zero?
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.520]   Told our investors for the next few years,
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.960]   like, could I grow twice as fast?
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.440]   Is that better in the long run?
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.360]   How, why, why be this profitable, I guess, maybe?
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.000]   - Yeah, I think profit is for me the same as value.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.200]   So if we deliver value and also have premium pricing,
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.240]   merchants are willing to pay a premium
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.000]   and pay basically for the value that we bring.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.040]   And I would be afraid
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.760]   that if we would just go for the lowest price,
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.200]   because I think we potentially could.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.080]   We run at the lowest cost as an infrastructure.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.520]   You would basically destroy a lot of value
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.880]   that's in, still in there.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.400]   And I'm not sure if you would just go for price
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.760]   that you have the right conversations
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.880]   about the value that you bring.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.400]   So that's the reason why we haven't done that so far.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.600]   But it's of course a question
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.880]   that you should always ask yourself,
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.480]   like, can you invest more in the business
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.480]   to accelerate growth?
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.720]   And that's still the trade-off that we're making every day.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.040]   Our main focus is on revenue growth.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.680]   If we can invest, if we see an opportunity, we will,
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.360]   but we have a long-term view there.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.720]   - What's it like building a company
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.680]   based in the Netherlands?
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.560]   What is it like hiring people?
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.120]   Where do you hire people?
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.520]   Do you make them come to the office?
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.360]   How does the culture change?
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.320]   - Yeah, so building a company in the Netherlands
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.920]   or starting in the Netherlands, at least,
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.200]   at least makes you aware
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.640]   that you need to go international from day one.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.680]   Like, the Netherlands is a super small country.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.840]   You can never build a very successful business
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.960]   just based on population there.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.600]   So we immediately went international,
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.760]   but in the beginning, we hired mostly into Amsterdam.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.400]   So we had a very strongly focused Amsterdam operation,
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.960]   and that shifted like 10 years ago.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.080]   So 10 years ago, we went to the US,
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.160]   we started to build our team here.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.440]   There's a very significant base here now in the US.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.280]   We have more than 800 people working in the US.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.000]   So it's our largest market outside of Europe.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.760]   Growing fast, it's already 1/3 of our total revenues, the US.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.160]   And I find that very interesting to see also
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.600]   how that has changed our company.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.360]   We have a different perspective
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.000]   on how we should serve merchants.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.640]   I think not being local in the beginning
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.280]   did not help to solve the real problem.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.560]   So you need to have product and engineering
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.560]   very close to where customers are.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.200]   And I think when we made that shift,
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.240]   we got more traction.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.840]   And with the current setup,
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.840]   with like over 1/3 of our revenues already in the US,
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.680]   we see that we win a lot of domestic brands.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.200]   And I think we're also proving
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.680]   that payments is not a commodity because--
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.280]   - Do you find it, is there differences in employee issues,
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.800]   employee quality between America and Europe?
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.800]   - I think there are very talented people in both markets.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.160]   I think the, honestly, the technology market, of course,
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.880]   in the US is way more competitive than in Europe.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.520]   I think we benefit from the fact that in Europe,
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.400]   we are one of the few companies.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.400]   - Top dog.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.120]   - Yeah, it's relatively easy.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.800]   Our brand awareness in Europe is higher than in the US.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.600]   That's one of the things that we're working on right now
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.360]   to make sure that more people get to know us.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.360]   In the end, we're a business-to-business brand,
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:51.200]   so that requires additional push to show what we do,
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.880]   but we work for the largest companies globally,
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.720]   whether that's online, we work for Google, Meta,
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.280]   Microsoft, for retail, H&M, Nike, Gap.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.040]   So we work for the best brands,
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.120]   and by also having them as referral customers,
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.720]   it is better to get into a country like the US.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.000]   - If we were sitting here--
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.840]   - Sorry, some of the challenges with being based in Europe,
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.000]   maybe not on the commercial side,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   but just on the shareholder side.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.200]   American investors, kind of public investors,
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.600]   private investors are mostly investing,
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.720]   mostly in private American and public American companies.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.960]   Is it hard to attract a shareholder base?
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.840]   Does that affect the valuation?
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.240]   Because it's challenging to do so,
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.800]   and if you look at the valuation difference
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.080]   in the private market for Stripe
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.320]   versus your public valuation, there's a gap,
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.920]   there's a difference in the multiples, your metrics.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.400]   - It's a 2x gap on numbers that look very similar.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.760]   - And your numbers are similar,
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.680]   some of your metrics are much better.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.320]   Maybe, I don't know if you wanna explain
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.480]   the valuation gap difference,
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.760]   or maybe just talk about the challenges
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.720]   of building a shareholder base
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.720]   and shareholder interest as a European company.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.560]   - Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.000]   Like when we, our biggest private round was in 2014,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.240]   and then we realized that we want
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.760]   to have global investor base.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.000]   That's when Iconic, General Atlantic,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.480]   but also Temasek from Singapore came on board.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.960]   They're still, they have been very supportive
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.120]   in the years up till the listing, we listed in 2018.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.440]   And when I worked on the listing,
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.280]   we were quite convinced that we would list in the US,
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.720]   given the fact that most of the technology stock list here.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.360]   But when we looked at valuation,
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.640]   and also index inclusion, et cetera,
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.680]   we realized that listing in Europe
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.000]   was as easy as the US, or even easier.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.080]   And that from a valuation perspective,
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.440]   also if we benchmarked it to other IPOs at that time,
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.920]   that we even got a premium for listing in Europe,
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.600]   because we have a fully US,
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.120]   almost like 60, 65% at the listing, US investor base,
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.080]   so it was almost like a US IPO.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:52.960]   And we got a premium for being a SCARE tech stock in Europe.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.000]   And I think that combination worked really well for us.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.960]   There is a difference, I think,
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.080]   between public and private markets.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.280]   And I think that explains for me a bit
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.800]   the difference in valuation.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.840]   - You mean that'll get rationalized over time?
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.880]   - I think so, ultimately, if--
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:08.720]   - The spread trade?
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.760]   - If we're both public,
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.280]   you're gonna compare the same numbers,
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.440]   and it's a combination of growth rate and profitability.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.280]   - Would you ever do a deal lifting?
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.600]   Would you lift in the US as well?
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.760]   - If I would list in the US?
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.360]   If there would be no liquidity in Europe,
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.760]   I would list in the US,
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.280]   but there is sufficient liquidity in Europe.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.280]   So you need to have certain size, but we have the size.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.720]   There is liquidity, so it's not needed.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.240]   - Yeah, these valuations will merge at some point
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.680]   when the people who are betting on promise
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.440]   versus performance,
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.200]   the public market is performance,
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.800]   and the private market is promise.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.480]   - These EBITDA margins are bananas.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.400]   - Yeah, it's fantastic.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.440]   So if we were sitting here 10 years ago,
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.440]   this entire conference would be centered around crypto
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.280]   and this amazing impact
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.400]   and how your business would absolutely be destroyed
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.840]   by crypto, and there would be no need for banks
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.200]   or for countries or for nation states,
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.320]   and everything was gonna be on blockchain.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.880]   Yeah, it was just everything was gonna be solved
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.560]   by blockchain, and everything goes away.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.880]   And obviously, none of that has happened,
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.600]   but one thing that has happened that's really promising
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.520]   or interesting is stable coins.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.200]   You have Circle in the United States doing really well,
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.520]   going public.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.560]   I believe they're still on track to do that.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.800]   Then you have Tether,
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.240]   obviously banned in a bunch of countries,
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.400]   bunch of problems,
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.160]   and being used for a lot of illegal activity.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.000]   I'm curious what your thoughts are, though,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.320]   on the concept of stable coins
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.680]   and their impact on the industry and the business,
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.160]   'cause it does seem to be working,
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.440]   especially internationally.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.120]   We don't see it here in the United States,
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.400]   but in other countries, Tether and Circle,
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.200]   these things are being used for lots of transactions,
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.080]   and people believe they'll ultimately be used
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.120]   for business transactions in a major way.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.040]   What are your thoughts on stable coins?
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.760]   - Yeah, so I think the question is,
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.600]   are you looking at, indeed, domestic payment flows?
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.000]   And then, of course, I don't think that there is a high need
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.280]   for stable coins in well-developed markets,
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.120]   and ultimately, we are processing
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.840]   well-developed markets at the moment.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.760]   If it's about, indeed, cross-border type of transactions,
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.600]   we still work with relatively old systems like SWIFT,
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.920]   with all their challenges.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.480]   They try to innovate.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.080]   That's the area where I would see
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.440]   there is a future for stable coins, indeed, if you need to.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.720]   - Would you ever consider launching one?
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.160]   - No, I think we would consider working with stable coins.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.000]   - So you might partner with a server or something.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.520]   - Partner, exactly. - Yeah.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.560]   - That's always been our model.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.680]   We want to bring financial technology to our customers,
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.960]   but also working together with the partners that we have,
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.520]   because they are ultimately also making a lot of success,
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.040]   and that's where we want to help them.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.760]   - Ingo, one of the things that we talk a lot about
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.200]   is censorship, but beyond idea censorship,
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.480]   there's an even more, probably, corrupting thing,
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.840]   which is financial censorship and deplatforming,
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:59.520]   and the way that I think it came on our radar
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.400]   was there was these truckers in Canada
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.280]   that were protesting COVID a few years ago,
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.560]   and they effectively got deplatformed
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.120]   from financial services.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.080]   How do you balance that as a company
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.360]   that becomes this critical artery
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.880]   to send money back and forth and process money
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.480]   for millions and millions of people?
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.520]   - Yeah, I think one of the ways how we want to do this
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.560]   is work with a lot of platforms
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.640]   that basically have these truckers,
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.640]   as an example, as a customer,
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.440]   and I think the unique thing of these platforms,
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.040]   they have a lot of knowledge about these people,
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.920]   and I think combining that knowledge
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.760]   with providing financial technology is a very good outcome,
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.360]   because they have their knowledge about the industry,
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.240]   about the business data of these people,
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.480]   combined with what we know is needed
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.680]   in the financial industry,
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.440]   everything around money laundering prevention,
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.760]   terrorism financing, if you combine that,
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.240]   I think you have a very strong proposition,
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.680]   and I think that's the answer
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.400]   to the more traditional players,
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.120]   like the banks that also don't always have the knowledge
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.800]   to do this at scale.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.600]   I think that's what we have been automating from the start,
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.840]   like everything around AML, machine learning,
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.640]   we've invested highly in that
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.280]   to build something very scalable,
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.480]   and that's what we want to offer to our companies.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.440]   - Is it complicated being a European company
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.200]   more than an American company in that context
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.600]   where there's a lot of points of view that Europe has,
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.240]   and do they try to exert that pressure or not really?
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.560]   - No, I think we have really shifted
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.360]   from being a European company to a global company,
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.800]   and we need to comply with local regulations everywhere.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.120]   We see ourselves as much as a U.S. company
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.880]   as a European company.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.600]   If you look at the operations that we've built here,
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.360]   we want to make sure that we can compete
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.720]   with each and every competitor here in the U.S.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.760]   on the same level, so it's needed
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.080]   that you comply with local--
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.400]   - Tell us, you're moving to India.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.680]   I mean, not you personally, but the company.
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.520]   - No, yeah, so--
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.320]   - The exposure in India is incredibly dynamic, as you know.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.520]   Lots of varying regulations
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.800]   that you also have probably dealt with.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.320]   Tell us about the journey in India.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.760]   - Yeah, it's a long journey.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:13.080]   I think we started to work on this in 2018, 2019,
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.040]   and one of the most difficult things
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.240]   is all the data localization rules in India.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.280]   So if you have a global platform,
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.320]   we have distributed database around the world,
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.960]   and then you realize that you can't store data
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.560]   of Indian people outside of India,
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.600]   so we had to really re-platform
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.440]   the data infrastructure that we have, but we did that.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.160]   We have local data centers now in India.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.200]   We got all the licenses,
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.880]   and we're one of the few international companies,
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.640]   maybe the only one right now,
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.600]   that can offer this to international companies
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.080]   that want to go domestic,
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.200]   or international companies that want to go cross-border.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:57.200]   And of course, this is a relatively niche play in India.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.960]   Today. - Today.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.920]   - But it's a high need of our biggest customers.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:01.760]   - I totally agree.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.320]   - And that's what we've always focused on.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.840]   We follow our customers.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.640]   If they want to go into a new country,
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.960]   we make sure that we're ready for it.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.240]   And this is a long-term investment,
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.560]   so this is already six years going on.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.600]   - I mean, to me, India is like China circa 2005,
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.360]   so if you just closed your eyes
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.680]   and just bought the entire country index in 2005,
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.000]   you'd look back in 2000, even now,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.520]   and you'd be way, way ahead.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.600]   And I think India's on the verge
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.520]   of that multi-decade kind of renaissance
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.720]   with less regulatory risk on the back end.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.360]   - Yeah, well, at least the regulatory rules
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.600]   are very clear from the start.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.440]   - Exactly. - And I think
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.440]   that's what we appreciate.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.040]   Like, ultimately, our company is a combination
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.960]   of technology, regulatory knowledge,
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.840]   and the right banking licenses.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.600]   And if we play that out well,
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.520]   we are in such a unique position.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.480]   - So everybody is, you know, blathering.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.640]   Oh, sorry, go ahead, go ahead, Jason.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.880]   - No, no, finish.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.320]   - Everybody's talking about AI,
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.640]   and you have to have an AI answer,
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.320]   but what's the real on-the-ground experience
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:00.320]   of trying to build stuff with machine learning and AI?
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.200]   Is there anything in production that really matters?
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.040]   - Absolutely.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.400]   - And how do you think about the future?
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.240]   - So one of the things,
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.760]   so there are, I think, two angles to this.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:13.760]   The first one is how we optimize transaction routing.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.560]   We just also launched a new way
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.800]   of US debit routing in the US,
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.480]   where AI helps us to make the best trade-off
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.160]   for merchants to lower the cost.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:33.160]   So you get a 20% plus lower cost if you route that well.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.680]   And at the same time, higher authorization rates.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.480]   - So the router is intelligently figuring out
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.160]   these rails are cheaper in this moment process over here.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.440]   - And it's, yeah, and it's, of course,
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.320]   a trade-off with the authorization rates.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.160]   - Right.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.080]   - And yeah, we work with eBay, Microsoft, et cetera,
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:51.080]   to launch this, and very good results.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.200]   - And that's in production?
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.040]   - That's in production.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:53.880]   That runs.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.720]   - Wow.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.120]   - The other part, the other angle is, of course,
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.080]   what we do internally for our support functions.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.320]   That's more on Gen AI.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:03.000]   We've always built a company around open source.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.400]   Also here, we're open sourcing the models.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.720]   But we have a lot of data, of course,
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.920]   internally that we can use for that.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.320]   - Have you found enough motivation to displace
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.980]   or reason to displace the humans
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.320]   that do the equivalent work?
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.440]   Has that not happened yet?
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.520]   Or will it happen, do you think?
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.200]   Or does the business just grow and everybody stays?
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.040]   - It's just growing.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.520]   And we've always had such a high focus on automation.
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.280]   If you ask where does the EBITDA margin come from,
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.880]   that's because we, if you look at our volumes
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.320]   and the number of people that we employ,
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.680]   it's a really low number, relatively.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.160]   And we will continue to do that.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.040]   So AI is gonna help us to further scale.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.880]   And I don't think that we are--
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.040]   - Oh, come on, okay, Ingo, I have to push you.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.720]   I mean, do you look at these American companies
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.480]   burning this kind of money to do a business
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.600]   that's smaller than yours?
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.960]   Do you scratch your head thinking,
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.000]   how did they, what is going on over there?
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.360]   Do you think that?
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.800]   - These are huge investments.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.240]   And we are closely following it,
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.640]   like where can we benefit from it?
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.880]   But we're always a bit of a smart follower.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.320]   I think that's always been our strategy.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.240]   Like what can we use
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.320]   and what can we actually apply in production?
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.080]   We are so much focused on execution.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.040]   I think that's also the only way to prove to,
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.000]   like we started the company with enterprise merchants.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.880]   The only way to prove to the biggest merchants out there
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.600]   is to show that you can do it.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.880]   And just talking about it,
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.600]   it's also not really European, just to talk about it.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.200]   We are doers, we like to build things.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.560]   And that's how we've created it.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.640]   - Ingo, I'm wondering how you look at
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.160]   authoritarian countries, dictatorships, monarchies,
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.800]   whatever, and providing services inside of those.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.760]   This has been a very polarizing issue.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.120]   Obviously, some companies have chosen to not operate,
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.080]   for example, in China because of human rights issues
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.400]   and having to hand over dissidents
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.520]   in the case of a social network, let's say,
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.040]   where they're outright banned in them.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.360]   And then you have this alliance starting,
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.280]   the BRICS has expanded and added a bunch of countries.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.560]   And there's talk about, hey, maybe SWIFT,
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.720]   we're gonna get off of SWIFT
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.520]   and we're gonna create our own BRICS version of SWIFT.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.160]   Are you operating in those countries?
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.400]   How do you think about that?
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.800]   And there's a lot of hand-wringing about,
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.680]   oh, we're gonna be off the US dollar and off of SWIFT.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.720]   What are your thoughts on that entire space?
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.720]   Take it where you'd like.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.560]   - So the way how we approach it is that we ultimately
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.640]   look at what are the markets that we want to be active in.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.520]   China, as an example, I think the Chinese domestic market
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.240]   is a super difficult market to be active.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.880]   But we have a huge team in China
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.040]   selling basically to Chinese merchants
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.440]   that want to go here in the US.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.280]   And that's a very successful route.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.920]   So we try to be pragmatic here.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:51.360]   Ultimately, if we can comply with the local rules, we will.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:55.040]   And it's a trade-off, like, can you do business somewhere?
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:59.720]   There are countries where we have chosen not to go so far,
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.560]   also because the demand is limited,
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.560]   but also maybe it's an unstable country.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:08.120]   We do it on a country-by-country basis at the moment.
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.320]   - Now, what about this sort of anti-SWIFT movement,
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.280]   America has too much influence,
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.040]   the West has too much influence over the movement of money.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.520]   They can do things like sanctions,
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.920]   as David's talked about on the podcast a couple of times.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.240]   Is that real?
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.640]   - Yeah, is there really gonna be an alternative to SWIFT?
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.640]   - I think there is a likelihood
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.360]   there will be alternatives, yeah.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.400]   And also, I think to your example on stable coins,
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.040]   like, that could be an alternative longer term,
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.880]   also if there are issues with SWIFT.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.840]   - It just may not be a legislative alternative.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.320]   It may be more technological, like yours or others.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.040]   - Yeah, yeah, but I think there are companies
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.440]   that also try to solve this,
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.600]   like to have less dependence on SWIFT
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.680]   even in this Western world, yeah.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:53.280]   - Do you guys run sentiment inside of all these payment flows
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.940]   or getting a sense of the economic health
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:56.840]   of certain countries?
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:00.320]   And has there been any thought to sort of sharing those
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.120]   so that, you know, like in America,
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.480]   we go through these things, Europe too.
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.240]   Unemployment rate comes out, you revise it.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.800]   GDP numbers come out, you revise it.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.160]   And nobody can actually act on these things
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.680]   until you're looking back six months,
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.440]   which is a ridiculous way to run an efficient.
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.640]   But I'm sure companies like yours, Stripe, Shopify,
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.200]   have you guys ever thought of working together
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.920]   to create a more dynamic view of economies?
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.920]   - It's certainly something that we wanna do with the data.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.400]   I think currently what our challenge is
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:32.680]   that most of our growth comes from share of wallet wins.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.520]   So it's very hard to separate this
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.440]   from the underlying growth.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.000]   The moment we become a more stable company
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.520]   and that's years away,
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.120]   and then I think that's more possible.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.440]   But it's like the data set that we sit on,
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.360]   like we have, I think over a billion unique shoppers
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.200]   in our platform.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.760]   So it's-- - A billion humans.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.960]   - Yeah, that's a-- - That's an incredible story.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.520]   - Yeah, so there's certainly more to tell.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:01.120]   And that's an absolutely interesting topic.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.840]   - Do you ever see PayPal in the market?
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.440]   I'm just curious whatever happens to it.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.160]   - There's no delaying.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.880]   - Well, PayPal is an important partner of us.
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.240]   So we work closely with them also offering,
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.960]   we just did a press release on their new Express checkout
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.800]   that we do together with them.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.440]   So we see them more as a partner than a competitor.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.320]   I think that's how we see them.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.120]   - Last question.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.280]   We've made a lot of fun of this whole thing this past week,
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.160]   founder mode, manager mode, whatever.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:36.640]   But precisely for you, you work as a co-CEO.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.960]   Which is a bit of a unique setup.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.760]   But when it works, it can really work.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.520]   And can you just describe to us
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.080]   how you guys have built such a great business
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.880]   and how you divide and share and conflict resolve?
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.520]   And what does it mean founder mode versus manager mode?
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.720]   - Yeah, so I think the way how we built a company together.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.360]   So Peter is the founder.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.480]   He focuses currently more on culture of the company.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.880]   And is doing a lot of founder conferences,
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.440]   meeting our merchants.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.720]   We all meet our merchants quite often.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:08.320]   I see a couple of merchants on Thursday in San Francisco.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.680]   And so that's an important part.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.440]   I think that's how we do this.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:16.440]   But it's a partnership already like for 13, 14 years.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.520]   Like that's the time that I know Peter.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.560]   So it's a very natural way of doing things.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.040]   And we have both our strengths
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.280]   and we have both our weaknesses
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.560]   and we know it from each other.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:28.080]   And I think that makes it a successful combination.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:28.920]   - Thank you.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.680]   Guys, please join me in thanking Ingo for joining us.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.520]   - Thank you.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.120]   (audience applauding)
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:33.960]   Thanks.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.540]   I really appreciate it, thanks.
