[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   [Music]
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.080]   Can an elect person die without ever having heard the gospel?
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.400]   Or is this impossible? It's a question from a listener named Christy.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.680]   "Hello Pastor John, can someone who is elect die without ever hearing the gospel and believing?" I suspect not.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.340]   I understand that people are born elect, but they are not born saved.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:33.600]   So the hearing will happen, it must happen, and our sharing of the faith is essential because God uses human means to bring people to
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.920]   himself.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.600]   However, if people die without getting the chance to hear and respond to the gospel, I suspect they were never elect. Is that right?
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.860]   I am a seminary student and will be going overseas as a missionary upon graduation.
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.560]   I feel the missionary urgency and yet I cannot shake this question.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.800]   If the people who don't hear were not elected,
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:05.620]   what is the urgency of sharing the faith? Do you see how that logic would deter the missionary impulse?
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.100]   Yes, I do see how that logic would deter
[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.760]   the missionary impulse.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.000]   But it's a faulty logic and
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.620]   it is
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.960]   unbiblical. So let's begin
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.740]   by just making sure our listeners know what we're talking about. I mean, Christy is referring
[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.020]   to the crucial
[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.880]   biblical doctrine of election. For example,
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.840]   we see it in Ephesians 1, 4, "God chose"—
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.840]   that's the word where we get election—"He elected." God chose us
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.080]   in Christ before the foundation of the world.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.920]   So that's the doctrine of election, that we should be holy and blameless before Him in love. He predestined us—
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.460]   there's election and then there's the destining of the elect—
[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:08.640]   He predestined us for adoption to Himself as sons through Jesus Christ according to the purpose of His will,
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:18.780]   to the praise of the glory of His grace. That's Ephesians 1, 4-6. Here it is again in 1 Corinthians 1, 26-29.
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.060]   "For consider your calling, brothers, not many of you were wise according to the worldly standards,
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.460]   not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth, but God chose"—
[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.940]   so there's election—"God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise. God
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.500]   chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong. God chose
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.100]   what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not to bring to nothing, things that are, so that
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.340]   no human being might boast in the presence of God." So the point of God's
[00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.460]   choosing
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.460]   before we existed and
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:06.100]   choosing against all ordinary human expectation is to prevent us from boasting in anything
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.180]   but God's free grace.
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.980]   That's why it's called
[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.580]   unconditional
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.700]   election.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.540]   God doesn't look into the future and choose people on the basis of
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.260]   their meeting any conditions. We see that in Romans 9, 11,
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.620]   where Paul describes
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.700]   Jacob's election over Esau when he says, "Though they were not yet born and had done nothing,
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.980]   either good or bad, in order that God's purpose of election might
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:49.620]   stand, might continue, not because of any of their works, but because of him who calls." So God's
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.420]   sovereign
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.620]   choice and call is the basis, not anything we do or perform.
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.540]   Now Christie is asking
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.980]   why this might not lead to fatalism with regard to missions.
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.540]   Specifically,
[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.020]   since everyone must believe on Jesus in order to be saved,
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:20.340]   so she gets that right. You have to hear and believe the gospel, and that's based on Romans 10,
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.420]   13. Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved,
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.380]   but how can they call on him of whom they've not believed, and how can they believe in him whom they've never
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.420]   heard, and how will they hear without someone preaching? So she's right to draw out of that the
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:43.580]   inference, and so she's asking, since everyone must believe on Jesus in order to be saved,
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.660]   and since there's
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.060]   no salvation without hearing and
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.260]   believing,
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.620]   anyone who dies without hearing—she's right in saying—
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.580]   without hearing and believing the gospel,
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.740]   we may assume we're not among the elect,
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:12.500]   because there's no second chance after death for them to be saved. So you have to hear the gospel and
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.780]   believe in order to go to heaven. If you don't hear the gospel and believe, you're not going to go to heaven, and if you
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.980]   don't go to heaven, you weren't among the elect. So Christie asks,
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.540]   "If the people who don't hear were not elected,
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.260]   what's the urgency of sharing the faith with them?"
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.740]   And I said it's faulty logic to let this deter
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.660]   aggressive world
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.940]   evangelization. Now why? Why is it faulty logic?
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.660]   Because
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.860]   the logic contains a mistaken inference. It infers
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.700]   that God did not
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.580]   correlate in eternity
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.540]   his election of a person and our
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.340]   evangelizing of that person. But in fact, God always
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.780]   correlates in his eternal decrees
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:15.060]   the election of a person and the evangelization of that person, just like
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:20.940]   he correlates events that he has decreed and the necessary prayers
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.700]   for those events. Now that correlation
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.220]   means that the decreed event
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.780]   won't happen
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.900]   without our decreed prayers.
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:40.620]   "You have not because you asked not," James says. "And the elect person
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.180]   won't be saved."
[00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.980]   Now get this, the elect person
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.540]   won't be saved
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.780]   without our decreed
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:58.180]   evangelizing of that person. The correlation is fixed in God's mind, and
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:05.940]   when we contemplate the urgency of our witness, what we should feel is this, "It is
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:12.540]   absolutely essential for the sake of the elect that I do my evangelism."
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.700]   Now if you think that's an odd way to think, listen to the Apostle Paul.
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.140]   Here's what he said in 2 Timothy 2.10.
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:26.540]   "I endure everything for the sake of the elect,
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.860]   that they
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.380]   may also obtain the salvation
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:39.300]   that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory." Isn't that amazing? He did not say, "Well,
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:43.940]   they are either non-elect or elect, and so
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:50.180]   nothing I do will make any ultimate difference." That's totally not the way he thought.
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.980]   Instead he said, "I do
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:08:01.540]   everything I possibly can to get the elect to eternal glory, because
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:10.740]   God has ordained the means as well as the end, and without the means the end does not
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.220]   happen."
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:20.880]   That's the missing piece in the logic that becomes fatalistic. And just briefly, I said that letting election
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.060]   deter
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.900]   evangelization is not only bad logic, it's unbiblical.
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:31.820]   Now we've already seen that in 2 Timothy 2.10, but one other observation.
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:37.060]   Paul saw the doctrine of election as not
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:44.500]   hindering his evangelism, but emboldening it. For example, in Acts 18.10,
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.740]   Jesus says to him, "Don't be afraid, for I am with you.
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:56.140]   No one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city."
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:00.460]   In other words, my elect are here.
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:07.220]   Keep preaching. My sheep will hear my voice. I will bring them. Or Acts
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:13.140]   13.48, he says this, Luke says this when he's writing about their evangelism,
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.380]   "When the Gentiles heard the gospel, they began
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:24.860]   rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life
[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.220]   believed."
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:33.060]   This was the ground of the success of the preaching of the gospel. As
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:40.820]   many as were appointed unto eternal life believed, and if there had been no gospel, there would have been no
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.380]   salvation. Paul knew
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:50.420]   that he had been sent to do what only God could do. He said in Acts 26, "I am
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:56.020]   sending you," he's quoting Jesus, or Luke is quoting Jesus, "I am sending you
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.340]   to open their eyes,
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.340]   so that they may turn from
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:07.220]   darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:13.740]   sanctified by faith in me." Only God can open the eyes of the spiritually blind, but Paul is sent
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.260]   by God to do it.
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:23.500]   God knows whom he will save. He knows whom he's chosen, and he knows whom he has
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:30.300]   appointed to be his instrument for the impossible opening of the eyes of the blind.
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.780]   So, oh, how I
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.100]   hope that there will be
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.620]   hope-filled, bold,
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.220]   yearning
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.260]   emissaries who follow the Lord into world
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.420]   evangelization.
