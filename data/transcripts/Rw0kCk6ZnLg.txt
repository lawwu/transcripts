[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]   Stocks versus real estate.
[00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.080]   What is the best way to build your wealth?
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.120]   Today, we are putting them head to head to find out.
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.280]   If you look at the past 150 years of data on an unlevered basis,
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.960]   stocks have definitely delivered the best nominal returns.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.840]   It's really one of the fastest, easiest ways to get into investing.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.320]   If you want to maximize your wealth, especially early in your career,
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.120]   real estate investing is by far the best way to do it.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.920]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and this is All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life,
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.200]   money and travel. Today, we have two of the biggest players in investing.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.240]   Joining me in a head to head debate.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.400]   We have Jason Moser and Matt Argesinger from The Motley Fool going up against
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.280]   Scott Trench and Dave Meyer from Bigger Pockets.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.120]   I am excited to be your moderator to talk stocks versus real estate.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.040]   Let's get into it.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.880]   Welcome, everybody, I am so excited to be hosting this.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.600]   Let's just kick it off right now.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.000]   I want to jump to the Bigger Pockets team, the Motley Fool team.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.640]   Thank you for being here.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.120]   Can you guys just start on each side explaining to the audience
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.440]   what stock investing and real estate investing is?
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.760]   Maybe define it for people.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.360]   Sure. So I'll start on that one.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.600]   Real estate investing is the act of purchasing real estate investing.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.280]   To me, the act of investing in real estate is purchasing real property,
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.120]   holding on to it and operating it at its highest and best use
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.400]   in order to generate cash flow and benefit from long term appreciation.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.120]   You can also, in the act of doing that, experience tax benefits
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.280]   and amortization of debts of debt if it was used to finance the purchase.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.360]   All right. I guess I'll do the stock side.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.280]   That was nice and succinct.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.120]   I will say I think it's easy to think of stock investing as
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.840]   trading a bunch of green and red numbers on a screen.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.600]   Prices, ticker symbols, many of which we don't even understand,
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.680]   jumping around every day and in some days jumping around a lot.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.680]   But I think the key thing to remember with stock
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.800]   investing is what those symbols and prices really are.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.920]   They are pieces of real businesses.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.200]   You as an investor, as a stock investor, can own pieces of real companies.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.240]   Yes, you can own a piece of Apple.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.840]   You can own a piece of Nike.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.720]   If you want to invest in artificial intelligence,
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.880]   you can own a piece of Nvidia or Microsoft.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.600]   So and by owning a pieces of those businesses via shares
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.920]   in your brokerage account, you are at least indirectly
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.480]   entitled to a portion, however small, of the profits generated by that business.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.440]   In many cases, you're directly given a portion of those profits via dividends.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.520]   Or cash payments directly to you in your brokerage account,
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.440]   usually on a quarterly basis.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.880]   So you're not buying bits of data on a screen or random ticker symbols.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.480]   You're buying equity in real companies that earn profits
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.240]   and hopefully grow over time. Awesome.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.280]   All right. So so the goal here today is to have a fun and healthy
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.040]   spirited debate talking about these two areas.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.200]   We both set out the outline of what they are.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.080]   I'm going to give you guys each a minute.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.960]   Either side go first on why you think your type of investing
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.720]   is the best way to build wealth.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.440]   Well, I'll jump in in regard to stock investing, at least.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.120]   I mean, there are a lot of benefits that really come from it.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.800]   I mean, you look at things from capital appreciation, right?
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.440]   I mean, stocks, ultimately, they have the potential
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.120]   to increase in value over time, you know, as companies grow,
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.280]   as they improve, as they get better, as they do more things.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.040]   That gives you the opportunity to to see the value
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.800]   and in the business that you're invested in, you know, continue to grow.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.120]   You know, another thing that that stocks do a lot of well-established companies,
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.480]   they'll pay dividends in order to return value to shareholders.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.040]   And so for you look at companies like Starbucks, for example,
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.520]   they they will continue to reward shareholders
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.120]   through holding those shares over long periods of time
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.480]   by returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.400]   There's compounding, right?
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.800]   I think that's something that probably doesn't get enough attention.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.360]   But the longer you own certain companies and that comes with dividends
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.960]   and also capital appreciation stocks go up in liquidity.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.840]   I mean, hey, listen, I mean, if you if you own stocks, you can buy and sell.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.680]   Right. That's a great thing.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.320]   It's not so hard to buy and sell stocks, which is a nice part of it.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.440]   And then obviously there's the diversification part of it. Right.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.000]   Real estate is a great way to invest, but stocks are, too.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.200]   And ultimately, what we what we believe
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.760]   the fool here is that you should own a little bit of a lot of this stuff.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.640]   And so whether it's real estate or whether it's stocks,
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.880]   I mean, holding a lot of that stuff together makes a lot more sense.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.440]   Diversification really makes a lot of sense, because as we've seen here
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.560]   over the last several months and really over the over the last few years,
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.680]   it becomes a little bit more difficult to predict exactly
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.120]   what asset classes are going to make the most sense for investors.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.720]   And so owning stocks is a great way to sort of, you know,
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.640]   look at what's going on in the world today and say,
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.240]   well, we we had that that that sort of exposure
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.000]   to companies that are are sort of leading the way
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.640]   towards where we are going.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.960]   And they give you the opportunity to stay well diversified.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.920]   All right. That was that was great, Matt.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.920]   I saw you raise your hand.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.240]   I'm going to give you 15 seconds to chime in before I jump over to Scott
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.320]   to talk about real estate.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.560]   Yeah, I just want to put a quick finer point on something Jason said,
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.720]   which is long term returns.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.080]   If you look at, say, the past 150 years of data on an unlevered basis,
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.240]   stocks have definitely delivered the best nominal returns.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.080]   10% annual annualized for 150 years.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.960]   You can't really get that with real estate bonds, gold or what have you.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.520]   So stocks have been kind of the winner in that specific regard.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.480]   That sounds pretty good.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.800]   Scott, let's hear you make a case for real estate.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.440]   First, I want to say I completely agree that unlevered
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.040]   stocks are going to outperform real estate.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.960]   The reason I'm not, you know, and I think you should own both right long term.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.560]   But since we're in a Mortal Kombat style, duke it out.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.800]   Real estate versus stocks debate here.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.600]   I'm going to make the case
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.760]   for why I think you should start with real estate on your financial journey.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.280]   And a couple of reasons here.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.040]   First is that leverage component.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.520]   Long term leverage against long term appreciation
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.440]   makes a huge difference in returns.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.640]   You can integrate real estate into your lifestyle through house hacks
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.680]   or what's called a live in flip.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.560]   And that can generate huge long term returns that are really tax advantaged.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.880]   You can generate more cash flow from real estate.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.960]   And so if you want to retire early or use that to fuel your lifestyle,
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.080]   that can be a huge advantage.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.560]   Real estate is often less volatile than stocks.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.760]   And so that brings us back to the concept of leverage,
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.000]   which I'm sure we'll get into multiple times throughout this debate.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.040]   And then I think I've already mentioned this from other tax advantages,
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.680]   but that makes a huge difference over time.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.480]   A lot of that cash flow can be completely tax free during
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.880]   the early years of a hold period, and especially if you're levered.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.720]   And also just wanted to mention, particularly right now,
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.680]   the fact that real estate tends to be an excellent inflation
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.080]   hedge is also pertinent.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.360]   Yeah, Scott, I like how you said
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.600]   you're going to advocate for real estate being a way to start.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.880]   I'm curious if you guys could talk a little bit about the barriers to entry
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.120]   for someone to just get into this.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.560]   What does someone need to have?
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.520]   What kind of capital? What kind of experience?
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.720]   Maybe we'll start with stocks.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.800]   Well, stocks are super easy to get into, but I would say
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   stock investing takes very little time other than the minor hassle
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.720]   of opening a brokerage account, which today is like as simple
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.520]   as downloading an app and pressing a few buttons on your phone
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.040]   and connecting your bank account.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.960]   I mean, that's really it.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.480]   And I mean, in some cases, it's almost too easy today
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.400]   to start to open a brokerage account.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.320]   But once you've opened a brokerage account,
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.120]   you can buy and sell stocks in a few seconds and boom, you're done.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.400]   You can start earning those profits, those dividends
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.280]   that Jason was talking about, and really without lifting a finger
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.920]   more than maybe a few times a month or a few times a year.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.880]   So it's really one of the fastest, easiest ways to get into investing.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.200]   And you don't have a lot of need, a lot of capital.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.280]   You can buy a hundred dollars with a stock today.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.200]   And that's probably a good start for a lot of people.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.000]   Real estate, though, it seems like it could be expensive, right?
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.960]   There are greater barriers to entry, I think, for real estate investing
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.880]   because it tends to be a more capital intensive asset class.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.880]   You can't just open an app and buy rental properties for ten dollars,
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.800]   although there are some funds and some modern crowd
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.480]   funding platforms that do allow you to do that.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:32.120]   But generally, I think of real estate investing as more entrepreneurial
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.400]   than buying equities and buying stock.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.320]   And so in addition to capital, you need money for a down payment.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.240]   You need to have solid, predictable income, typically,
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.760]   to get leverage on a property and take out debt.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.320]   You need decent credit.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.320]   So you do need all that to get started.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.920]   And you also need a bit of an entrepreneurial spirit.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.880]   You are starting a small business.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.080]   And so you're going to need some level of business acumen and expertise
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.400]   to be able to operate that business successfully.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.640]   Yeah. And I'll just piggyback on Dave's great point by saying that expertise,
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.880]   I think, comes in the form of several, maybe at least a several dozen,
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.560]   maybe several hundred hours of self-education on the topic
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.040]   because you need to know how to screen a tenant.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.520]   You need to know that when a tenant is applying for your rental property
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.240]   and puts down the phone number as a reference for their previous landlord,
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.680]   that that might be their buddy.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.720]   And you need to back channel that
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.680]   and make sure you're actually calling the previous landlord
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.720]   and getting the referral from them.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.560]   Like there's so many little tips and tricks like that that you need to be aware of.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.320]   Or if you don't learn them upfront, you will learn them downstream
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.440]   in a much more painful and more expensive fashion later on in that journey.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.840]   So in addition to those things that, you know, credit, income, down payment,
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:45.240]   you also need this expertise that that can be a real investment of time
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.720]   that is probably not needed,
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.080]   especially for like index fund or other stock investing approaches here.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.800]   Although I think the Motley Fool guys will put in just as much time and energy
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.480]   as many of the real estate investors who take it very seriously
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.360]   in trying to find that that alpha.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.200]   I don't know if that's true, but we'll take the compliment for sure.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.200]   There's a question, Matt.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.760]   You said, you know, 10% average returns on the stock market,
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.080]   highest returning unlevered asset class.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.200]   I'm curious, how much work does it take for someone to kind of be in that group?
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.280]   Because the way Scott and Dave put it, you know, real estate can take a lot of work.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.160]   But and you made it seem, oh, you just open a brokerage account.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.240]   Is it that simple? Just open a brokerage account.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.200]   And boom, you get those returns.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.160]   You know what it actually is.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.360]   And I'll explain why it doesn't it shouldn't it shouldn't be that way.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.720]   But what most investors should do if they're investing in the stock market
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:36.920]   is simply by and Scott mentioned in an index fund ETF, S&P 500 index fund.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.600]   Right. Right off the bat.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.520]   You're probably outperforming 95% of active investors if you do that.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.800]   It's simple. It's cheap.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.600]   The fees are really low.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.560]   And yes, you're going to if you do that, you're matching the return
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.120]   of the overall market, which I said, you know, going back more than a century
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.120]   is about a 10% annualized return.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.320]   So that is what you can do.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.560]   Now, we stock investors like to make things complicated when they shouldn't be.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.760]   So we tend to, you know, buy individual stocks.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.120]   We think we can outperform the market.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.760]   We think we can be the next Warren Buffett.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.440]   So we're doing things we're trading.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.240]   We're sometimes doing leverage, which is really dumb in the stock market.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.760]   And we're losing our shirts.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.840]   But really opening, like I said, downloading that app,
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.840]   clicking a few buttons, buying an index fund, maybe putting 100 bucks in there
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.760]   a month if you're 22 years old out of college or something is an amazing way
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.920]   to get started.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.600]   And it is about the easiest thing you can do.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.840]   But here's a question for you, Scott and Dave.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.280]   Matt talked about 10%.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.160]   You guys talked about how it might take a little bit of work.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.640]   We talked about leverage.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.280]   If you start to think about the leverage you can bring into real estate,
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.040]   what kind of returns do you think we've seen or people can expect
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.440]   in their real estate investing?
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.040]   So this gets kind of complex here.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.600]   I'll take a stab at this.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.280]   So let's say that we assume that real estate is going to appreciate
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.440]   at an average of 3.4% per year, right?
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.000]   And if you lever that five to one, right, at least in the early years,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.880]   you're going to get an appreciation rate that multiplies 3.4 times five.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.640]   So that's what? 15 plus another 20, 17% from appreciation.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.040]   You're going to be amortizing your debt during that debt service on that
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.920]   for the 80% of the the property value that is levered.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.040]   And then you're going to hopefully be producing some cash flow as well.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.200]   So you add those up, you should be looking at upper teens returns,
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.640]   maybe low 20s returns.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.080]   And if you can't get there, you should invest in stocks
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.760]   because it's totally passive and you don't have to spend all this time
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.280]   thinking about how to buy real estate at the beginning.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.600]   Now, over the 30 year period, you're slowly deleveraging,
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.200]   assuming things go reasonably well, right?
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.680]   You're paying down the loan.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.400]   The property is appreciating.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.520]   So your equity balance grows.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.960]   And once it's paid off, now you're getting the unlevered real estate
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.080]   return of like three point four percent, plus maybe a four to five percent cap rate.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:45.840]   This is the 45% cash flow component of the total equity value.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.320]   So at the end of that hold period, in a typical you throw a dart at the wall
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.320]   and pick a rental property, a true actual rental property across the United States.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.920]   You're probably looking at a seven and a half to eight and a half percent
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.720]   unlevered return at the end of that hold period once you paid off the debt.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.320]   And you're looking at more than that in the early part of early parts of it.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.880]   It can get more complex from there if we want to talk about tax
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.880]   benefits and those types of things.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.560]   But that's what you should expect.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.760]   And that's what you have to kind of keep in the back of your mind
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.280]   as you're investing over the years and decades in real estate there.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.680]   And if you can't get it again, I would I would go to stocks.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.920]   Well, let's talk a little bit about volatility, right?
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.760]   That that's a you know, averages, right?
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.680]   You gave a scenario of an average, Matt.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.880]   You gave a 10 year or a century long average.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.080]   What do you think it looks like year to year?
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.240]   And what kinds of volatility can people expect?
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.720]   How much risk are they taking?
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.720]   What could they lose?
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.680]   And and maybe even as far as what is just an amazing year look like?
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.960]   Sure. Well, I will say for the stock market, which we know is much more volatile.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.240]   Let's use the most recent bear market as an example.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:52.080]   2022, the S&P 500, the broad market index at its lows was down about 27 percent.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.240]   That's a that's a pretty big hit for a lot of people.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.720]   And if you were investing in technology stocks,
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.600]   the Nasdaq was down about 40 percent at one point, typically in a bear market,
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.560]   which we know happens roughly once every five years.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.240]   The the average loss is about 30 percent.
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.080]   And one of those is always around the corner.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.560]   So that's what you can look forward to with stock investing.
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.120]   What you can also look forward to, though, is,
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.800]   you know, the gains can be pretty high in the good years.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.720]   If I look at, like, for example, the last 20 years, five of the last 20 years,
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.880]   the stock market was up more than 20 percent.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.120]   The average return was 26 percent.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.440]   And so that's a pretty good year.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.560]   Imagine compounding your your asset, your net worth by that amount.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.840]   So the highs can be really high.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.360]   And as Jason mentioned, stock stock market tends to go up over time.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.720]   And so that's great.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.280]   But you have to be ready for those
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.440]   those nasty bear markets that come that are inevitable.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.240]   And the next one's always around the corner.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.280]   Dave, what do you think about real estate when it comes to volatility
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.240]   and kind of downside upside?
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.840]   Well, I think that is one area where real estate does stand out versus equities.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.800]   Of course, many people listening to this, myself included,
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.400]   all remember the great financial crisis and the sharp declines
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:04.560]   where we saw home prices on a national basis go down somewhere around 20 percent.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.320]   But that is somewhat anomalous in American history.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:12.040]   That's not saying that it won't happen again, but that is unusual
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.840]   to see large drops in home prices like we saw.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.360]   And so to me, the real name of the game with real estate
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.400]   and the way you mitigate against volatility is just time.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.560]   This is not a quick get in and get out strategy.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.920]   But with real estate, if you can manage to hold on to properties,
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:33.800]   you are very likely to be able to wait out any short term volatility.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.960]   And the risk of principal loss is actually,
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.560]   I think, significantly less than in the stock market.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.080]   You talked about time. What about diversification on real estate?
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.600]   Are you are you suggesting just worry about time?
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.200]   Don't worry about multiple properties.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.800]   No, I think I would absolutely recommend
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.400]   diversifying into multiple properties and even doing multiple strategies
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.320]   within real estate investing.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.000]   You can, you know, invest in long term rentals.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.760]   You can do short term rentals.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:09.160]   I personally diversify across geographies into different markets
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.720]   to take advantage of different market fundamentals.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.240]   But I think ultimately, not to be overly simplistic,
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:21.920]   but the name of the game in real estate investing is to avoid forced selling.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.560]   And for selling is just basically what we say is like when you get in a situation
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.400]   where you can't hold on to your property and you are forced to sell
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.840]   at what might be an inopportune time in real estate investing.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.280]   If you get to choose when you're going to sell, you are almost always
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.480]   going to make money.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.600]   And so the way I think about being defensive and mitigating risk is one time,
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.960]   you know, just try and hold on for as long as possible.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:51.080]   And the way to hold on is to generate, in my opinion, positive cash flow,
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.280]   because if you're able to make sure that your properties generate
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.440]   even two, three, 4% cash flow after all of your expenses,
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:02.400]   after all of your capital expenditures, then you get to sit back.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.880]   You're still at worst.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:08.520]   You're making a couple percentage points off of your cash flow and your amortization.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.440]   And then you don't want to necessarily try and time the market on the buy.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.360]   But then you do get to time the market when you're selling.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.640]   And in those situations, it's pretty difficult to lose money in real estate.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.840]   Jason, I'm curious what you think about risk mitigation in the stock market.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.960]   Right. What is someone who's kind of nervous about a 20, 30% drawdown
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.800]   do other than just wait?
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.120]   Yeah, you know, I think there was a great point
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.800]   that was just mentioned there in regard to forced selling, right?
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.720]   That's something that applies to real estate.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.360]   It applies to stocks.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.640]   It applies to a lot of things in life.
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.200]   But you just you never want to be a forced seller, right?
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.640]   You never want to be forced to sell anything.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:52.160]   And that's one of the things we love about investing in in stocks
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.200]   here at The Fool is that, you know, taking that longer view,
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:01.280]   you can sort of ignore the near term noise
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.800]   and let yourself sort of watch the story play out.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.640]   And and I will say in regard to real estate, that's another
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:14.560]   another really beautiful thing about real estate is you don't have to sell.
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.080]   Right. And I think that's that's one of those things.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:20.240]   It's always worth remembering is in real estate.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.400]   Sometimes that can be a situation where you're in a little bit more of a
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:29.440]   situation where you might not have the options.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:34.040]   Whereas in regard to stocks and the way we look at stocks,
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.120]   you know, we're buying we're buying shares into businesses
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.720]   where we feel like these businesses have the opportunity
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.800]   to perform over the long haul, over over 10, 20 years,
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.160]   hopefully much longer than that.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.000]   And so I think in regard to diversification,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.600]   making sure you put yourself in a situation where you don't own assets,
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.240]   where you feel like you need to sell anything. Right.
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.880]   That that's a big difference.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.760]   I mean, that that that that can really make a big difference
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.760]   in how you view your portfolio
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.320]   and in ultimately the the allocation there.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.480]   The stock guys, Matt, Jason, you talked about how you can buy an index fund
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:18.120]   and have access to lots and lots of stocks in a very simple vehicle.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.320]   Scott, Dave, when it comes to real estate, how can you diversify
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.480]   without having a massive amount of capital to get going and buy lots of properties?
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.640]   It feels like that would be a huge barrier
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.080]   to entry to diversification for the average person.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.200]   So when I got started in real estate, I didn't diversify. Right.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.240]   One duplex was five or six times my annual income.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:42.680]   I was highly levered and concentrated on a single asset in a single market.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.680]   And all of my properties today that I own and operate
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.080]   personally are in the Denver metro area.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.840]   So I'm making I not have a diversification in my real estate portfolio.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:57.200]   I'm highly my returns will be highly correlated with the Denver metro market.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.120]   And I want to chime in on the last point here around, you know, risk here.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.040]   Difference between stocks and real estate is that the stock can never force you
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.560]   to sell. Right.
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.080]   Like something like your personal life could force you to sell.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.360]   But in real estate, it absolutely can force you to sell.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.920]   People who do not have reserves set aside, do not produce cash flow
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.240]   and have some sort of problem in their portfolio.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.240]   They call this a disaster.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.520]   Investors who are well-capitalized call it a capital expenditure.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.280]   And you want to be on.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.760]   There's a clear side of that equation that you want to be on
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.680]   if you're in the real estate investing world.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.760]   And so, look, my my portfolio is a highly concentrated,
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.760]   not diversified investment and bet on long term appreciation
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.520]   in U.S. housing prices and rents and specifically concentrated
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.840]   on Denver, Colorado prices and rents.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:48.280]   So it is absolutely in the way I do it and the way that most real estate
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.000]   investors in this country do it, at least in the residential space.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.440]   They're not in REITs or these other types of commercial assets.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.840]   It is absolutely you're giving up some of that diversification
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.280]   across all these different asset classes for a concentrated bet.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.480]   Matt, I saw you had a follow up.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.360]   I just well, let me let me.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.440]   Scott, here's throwing a bone to the stock investing guys.
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.400]   Let me throw a bone back and say, you know, the one advantage
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.720]   of the big advantage of real estate, even though you're super concentrated,
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.440]   is that those those Denver properties aren't getting priced or repriced every day.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.840]   One of the things we fight against here at the Motley Fool and just stock
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.720]   market investors in general is that they're seeing the value
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.760]   of their portfolio change on a minute to minute basis.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.120]   Stocks going up and down, you know, minute to minute, day to day,
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.040]   sometimes with big movements, especially during earnings season
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.720]   and other periods of time.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.240]   And that's a big challenge.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.960]   Getting some of the things Jason said was being being forced to sell.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.640]   We deal with a lot of more emotional roller coasters here on the stock side.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.040]   I love the fact that real estate is not repriced every day,
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.400]   so you can make your own decision.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.040]   I think Dave said that, which is you can time your exit there with with lots
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.800]   of foresight, stock market, you know, can push a lot of people out quickly
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.440]   because they just get they see their portfolio down 20, 30% during a bear market.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.600]   They see the headlines in the news about recession
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.400]   and all these bad things that are going to happen.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.000]   And it can it can cause people to panic.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.840]   And the fact that they can see their stocks and all the red in their portfolio
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.760]   and it can make them make an emotional decision.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.800]   So I like the sort of pacifying
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.560]   patience and generating nature of real estate versus the stock market.
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.120]   Now, Scott just mentioned REITs.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.760]   Jason, no one's made this case yet.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.440]   I'm curious.
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.160]   Couldn't you just invest in real estate through your stock brokerage account
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.400]   and not have to worry about any of the other work?
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.600]   You absolutely can.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.480]   And I think that's a great way to do it, actually.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:30.200]   I think, honestly, that's that's probably the best way for most people
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.960]   to get real estate exposure is to rather than,
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:37.640]   you know, buying and selling properties or trying to become landlords.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:41.240]   I mean, there are plenty of opportunities out there and in things like REITs,
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:45.800]   real estate investment trusts where you can you can invest in real estate
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.400]   without necessarily having to have that direct exposure.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.600]   That direct exposure in real estate is just really difficult. Right.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.160]   I mean, I think we can all agree that one of the most
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.800]   one of those difficult parts about investing in real estate,
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.400]   it's it's sort of the it's it's the getting into it, right.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.120]   It's it's there.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.440]   There are barriers to entry in just needing the capital to get in there.
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.440]   And that's what real estate investment trusts and things like that
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.600]   helped to break down.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.200]   And so I think in regard to investing in real estate,
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.440]   real estate investment trusts represent a terrific opportunity for investors.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.400]   If that's your thing, right.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:30.880]   If you're invested, if you're interested in that real estate opportunity.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.160]   OK, Scott, Dave, Jason just said REITs.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:37.080]   Great way for people to get started in real estate.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.120]   Completely different from the the path you laid out.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:40.840]   What do you think?
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.960]   Look, I think I think that rental real estate that I directly own
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.280]   and operate has the advantage to give me that leverage.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.680]   But it also gives me tax advantaged cash flow,
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.720]   which to me is super important.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.760]   And index funds of REITs or stocks really just don't produce
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:59.840]   the same levels of cash flow that I believe I can get from rental real estate.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.840]   And my goal in all of this is early financial freedom.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.160]   Everybody has different goals when it comes to investing.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.960]   But I I can't like I'm not going to sell off
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:15.160]   chunks of equity in my stock or REIT portfolio to fund my lifestyle.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:19.560]   Like mentally, I just will not make that leap in my mind as a, you know,
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.560]   a guy in my 30s, a long time horizon ahead.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.320]   I will spend a chunk of my cash flow
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.000]   that is being pulled off by my my portfolio.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.440]   And to me, like, that's the that's the trump card for real estate
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.640]   in my portfolio at this point in my life for that.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.560]   And why I like it a lot is because it offers that opportunity.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:42.200]   And I feel like it's much harder to do that without dramatic trade
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.320]   offs in the equities markets at the highest level.
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.840]   One other thing I wanted to talk about and one benefit to real estate
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:53.120]   that we haven't even discussed is this concept of value add investing,
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.040]   which isn't for newbie investors necessarily.
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.520]   But this is similar to the concept of flipping houses.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.640]   But you can do this with long term rental investing as well.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.840]   When you buy a property, you fix it up and you're able to drive up
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.880]   the value of that property directly,
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:14.600]   ideally by more than what you put in to fix up that property.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.880]   And that's just not something that you could do with REITs.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.640]   It's not something that you can do with equity.
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.360]   If you're an experienced, good real estate investor,
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:26.280]   you have more direct control over driving your own profits
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.920]   than than the stock market or REITs, because they're just inherently more passive
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.440]   and you don't really have a say in the operations of those businesses.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.720]   How much time does that take?
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.680]   Well, it depends.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:41.000]   I mean, you can go everywhere from a, you know, down to the studs renovation.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.360]   I've never done that myself.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:46.280]   I have a full time job, so I would not take on a project like that.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.520]   But I do what they call cosmetic upgrades,
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.280]   which are, you know, paints, floors, renovating kitchens and bathrooms.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.600]   For me, maybe takes two or three hours a week.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.000]   If I was doing something like that for the contractor, I pay to do it.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.240]   I hope they're working full time on it, but sometimes I'm not sure.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.400]   Yeah, I think the term is semi passive.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.640]   Yeah, I think about cost basis and we've got to include our time in there.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.480]   I know. I know.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.680]   I know none of our financial statements often do.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:17.120]   But Matt Jason, how much time are you spending maintaining your stock portfolio?
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:21.000]   Well, this is a great this is a great thing to bring up, right?
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.400]   Because I mean, I have the experience myself personally.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.560]   I know Maddie does, too, of being a landlord.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.840]   And when you're a landlord.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.400]   You know, you go into it thinking, holy cow, man,
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.600]   I hope I don't have to really deal with too terribly much, right?
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:39.200]   Let's let's hope this is as easy as it can possibly be.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.640]   But inevitably, I mean, things come up, right?
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.480]   If you're going to be a landlord, if you're going to own real estate,
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.960]   if you're going to rent it out, I mean, things are going to come up.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.000]   It's going to require a part of your time.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.320]   It's going to require a part of your life.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.200]   And that's not always so easy to to budget,
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.240]   particularly when there's so much uncertainty.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.840]   Now, when it comes to stocks, I mean, you kind of go into it thinking,
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:08.080]   well, there's going to be uncertainty just in buying shares in this company.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.440]   I'm buying shares in this company.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.360]   I don't know exactly what's going to happen with it.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.520]   And so, I mean, you know, a year from now, five years now,
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.000]   maybe things will be different.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.840]   But but it is something, right?
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.640]   I think when you when you look at investing in equities,
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:27.160]   it can be it can be certainly a lot of
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:31.680]   it can be a much less stressful situation, right?
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.680]   Then investing in something like real estate, particularly if you're going to
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.480]   invest in real estate with the with the intention of being active
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.480]   in being a landlord, in renting that property out.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:45.600]   And I mean, just my experience, I mean, and I had a great experience.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.920]   Trust me, I had a great experience renting property.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.240]   I could have been a lot worse.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.160]   But I certainly it made me realize
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:57.360]   that there were situations that could have been a lot tougher.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.600]   And there were situations that I didn't necessarily look forward
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.000]   to wanting to deal with, so to speak.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.520]   So that was kind of one of those things that made me think, well,
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:13.200]   you know, investing in stocks, I mean, that that is absolutely an easier way,
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:18.000]   a more passive way to let my money kind of compound and grow over time.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.280]   So, you know, it goes to say like there are
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.320]   you're going to make money either way, right?
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.840]   If you make wise decisions, whether it's stocks or whether it's real estate,
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.040]   there are plenty of opportunities there.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.600]   But it's just it's worth remembering if you're if you're taking that real estate
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.200]   angle and and you're looking to,
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.200]   you know, be a landlord or be a little bit more active
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:47.840]   in that that style of investing, it there's a lot to say
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:52.120]   in that that time sense, right?
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.000]   I mean, time time is money, as they say.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.640]   I don't disagree with that.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:01.680]   Being a landlord is more time and it probably is more stressful.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.120]   But I also still think it's worth it.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.640]   If you think about the difference in returns Scott was talking about,
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:12.960]   just the difference between a 10% compounded return and a 12% compounded return
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:18.200]   over 30 years, the difference between that is one point two five million dollars.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.680]   That's an one hundred thousand dollar initial investment.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:25.320]   And so for me, is it worth putting in a little bit of effort
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.360]   every couple of every couple of weeks?
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.280]   And it does come in waves for that increased return.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:35.720]   Yes, because that's just the difference between 10% return and 12% return.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:40.120]   If you're doing real estate well, you could be getting 15, 17, 18% returns.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.760]   And so I personally do think it's worth it.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.360]   And the other thing I'd say is that, especially in the beginning,
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.280]   I recommend to all people who want to go into real estate
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.360]   investing to do that stuff yourself.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.920]   It is it's not fun all the time, but you learn a lot.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.280]   And I think maybe Scott can comment on this, too.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.200]   But for me, over time, as I've built my portfolio,
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:05.520]   I do less and less, even though my portfolio has gotten bigger and bigger.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.080]   And I actually have a rule that I use.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:12.560]   I won't spend more than 20 hours a month on my real estate portfolio.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.600]   So I'm willing to put in five hours a week in an effort
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.000]   to get that outsized return.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.680]   And over time, I just the stress goes away.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.600]   You just get used to it.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.280]   Once you've seen it all, man, you don't get surprised by anything.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.280]   And you just you just roll with it.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.600]   Yeah, I'll just chime in here and say that there's, you know,
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.200]   I go back to that startup cost for real estate investing,
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.280]   which includes not just capital, but time.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:39.240]   And where I think the real estate really pays incredible dividends
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.520]   is like, let's say someone's worth making $100,000 a year.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:47.080]   Their time is worth $50 an hour, assuming they work a 2,000 hour year.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.760]   So the startup cost of 250 hours to learn real estate is $12,500
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.920]   for that individual.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:57.640]   Well, a doctor making $600,000 a year is going to have a dramatically
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:01.120]   higher startup cost because them investing 600 hours is dramatically
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.480]   different from an entry level financial analyst.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.160]   And so that's the kind of fun thing about real estate is for me.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.440]   That cost was so low 10 years ago when I was getting into it
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:12.080]   and just kind of obsessing over learning all the ins and outs of real estate.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.520]   And now I'm going to reap the dividends of that or the cash flow
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.080]   because we're talking about real estate, not stocks on this one
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.280]   for the rest of my career.
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:24.520]   And because I put in that, I still have to put time in on a continuous basis,
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.840]   but not that enormous upfront investment.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.360]   Matt, Jason, I'm curious.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.840]   Dave said 20 hours a week, a little bit of extra work
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.800]   generates over a million dollars.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:37.600]   How are you guys using your saved 20 hours a week
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.240]   to either generate more returns for your portfolio
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.040]   or or, you know, increase the value of your life?
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:48.040]   Well, I don't know about Matty, but I'm using that time to work
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:51.040]   for the Motley Fool, right? That's my employer.
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:54.000]   They're the ones that are paying me week in and week out.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   I think that's one of the things I mean, just given my experience,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.480]   having having served as a landlord and investing in real estate,
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.880]   I'm a homeowner today.
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.680]   I mean, I understand the dynamics of homeownership
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.880]   and the the the benefits of that investment.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.720]   It just it really does boil down to time to me.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.600]   And in certain cases, I think,
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.200]   you know, you look at investing in stocks in that as a way
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.880]   to help your money grow without necessarily having to commit
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:31.120]   so much time, so much attention on an ongoing basis,
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.960]   whereas with real estate, you know, you may be
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.080]   you may be a little bit more committed.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.840]   Scott earlier said that one of the great things about real estate
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:42.440]   is it spits off cash flow and it's way easier to use your cash flow
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:46.080]   to fund your life than it is to use sell stocks to fund your life.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.080]   Matt, Jason, whether it's selling stocks or dividends,
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:52.600]   do you find that that same problem or is it actually easy?
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.480]   Yeah, that's that. I think it's a great point.
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.200]   I mean, I have a much better time
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.600]   spending income and dividends than I do selling stock,
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.120]   because that's when I have to make a decision.
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.400]   I hate making decisions about selling stocks.
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.320]   And so that's that's I think that is a clear advantage for real estate.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.920]   It's much easier to spend cash flow.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.000]   I feel the same way.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.240]   I just want to get back real quick to the whole time conversation as well.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.080]   I think any incremental time that Jason and I have.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.680]   I mean, I talked about the cheat code of investing in the market ETF
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.440]   and getting that 10% annualized, right?
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.040]   Any incremental time we have is all about beating that number, right?
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.040]   Because otherwise, what are we doing right at the Motley Fool?
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:30.000]   So that that's kind of where we're spending our time is what
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.520]   what additional hours can we do to find the stock that's going to go up
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.160]   10, 15 X over the next five to 10 years?
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.760]   And that's there's many examples of that, of course.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.600]   That's where we were dedicated a lot of our time, because that's
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.280]   that's where we make the difference for our members, for those who read
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.280]   and subscribe to our services. Right.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.400]   And one word answer.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:51.600]   Do you think that you could beat Dave's return on his 20 hours
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.680]   with that stock research? Yes or no?
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.680]   I don't think so.
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:58.080]   I don't think so, because he's got no, I mean, he's got tremendous advantages
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:02.520]   with, like you said, with with leverage, knowledge of that asset, adding value.
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.840]   That's hard to do. That's hard to do in the stock market.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.160]   So I'm going to give him props for that one.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.280]   Well, since you're throwing some bones to us, I'll give I'll give one back here,
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.240]   which is like in real estate.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:15.920]   You're never going to 20, you're never going to get a 10 bagger in real estate
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:19.360]   like by and not have to do anything but research, right?
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.280]   Like that's just never going to happen in our world.
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.640]   That's a really good point.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:25.520]   A few topics, maybe they're a little a little nerdy, a little in the weeds,
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.200]   but I think we need to hit on them.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.240]   We briefly touched on leverage.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:31.600]   Anything else important to talk about leverage,
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.800]   especially when it comes to the stock market?
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:37.960]   Because if real estate has lower returns, but levered, it gets higher.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.560]   Can't you just lever the stock returns and get a better return overall?
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.840]   Right. But it's the clearest way to go bankrupt if you're a stock market investor.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.160]   I mean, most of the time, even even well-heeled investors
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.920]   can only get about 2X leverage
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.520]   compared to the 5X leverage that, you know, that Scott talked about,
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.000]   because most companies, most brokerages aren't just going to give you that.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.360]   But even still, even doing that 2X leverage is incredibly dangerous, right?
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:04.040]   I talked about the the bear market where the stock market went down 27%.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.720]   Well, imagine you've levered that up to X and all of a sudden
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.720]   your portfolio is down 60%, right?
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.840]   And that's that's can be a devastating hit to someone,
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.400]   especially who might be near retirement and needs those assets.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:17.280]   And so leverage is a dangerous game in the stock market.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.400]   I think it's a tremendous advantage in real estate.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.240]   And, you know, Jason mentioned
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.440]   where actually we have experience being landlords as well.
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.520]   And I will say this, this is probably the biggest bone
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.840]   I'm going to send back to the bigger pocket scene, which is
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.080]   I've made the best returns investing in the stock market.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.120]   Personally, I've made the most money investing in real estate
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.320]   purely because of the leverage factor.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.800]   It's an incredible advantage.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.400]   I've done well.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.000]   And, you know, as you say, if you make the right investments
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.120]   and add the right value with your time, I'll chime in here on on leverage here.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.440]   Like I think that any investor like I plan to invest in both stocks
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.480]   and real estate for the next 50 years, right?
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.120]   Ideally, I live that long.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.200]   At least we'll see how things go.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:36:01.480]   But, you know, I think that the stock market like I know it will crash 50%,
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:05.920]   at least once, maybe twice during that time period, maybe even more at a higher,
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.640]   maybe even more frequently or at or larger.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.760]   And I also know that real estate will likely crash
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:15.640]   probably once or twice in that same time period, at least 30%
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:19.160]   in there, probably not 50%, although that is possible.
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:22.000]   And I think if you're investing in either of these asset classes,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.200]   you're not planning on those happening.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.680]   Like you're going to get wrecked
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.200]   if your portfolio is always dependent on that not happening.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:31.200]   So I think that that's like a part of the thing that you have to be ready
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.240]   for defense here.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:34.880]   And if you're levered in real estate, you have to be much more defensive
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:38.680]   than you are in stock and stocks, because if you just lose half
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:42.320]   what you have, that's you know, that's very bad in the stock market.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.560]   But it's not like, oh, now my properties are underwater
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.560]   and I can't cash flow them because I can't find a tenant like that.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:52.880]   So there's there's risks in both of these that you have to be really prepared for.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.760]   The advantage of real estate's lower volatility
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.560]   and the fact that it doesn't swing as much as stock market is, again,
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.720]   that you can leverage it, as we've discussed several times.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.200]   Two other things.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.640]   Let's talk liquidity.
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.000]   I think that's an important thing for a lot of people listening.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.360]   Life is unexpected.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.360]   Sometimes people need access to capital.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:13.880]   How do these two types of investing give investors access to their capital?
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.720]   I think it's my turn to throw you guys a bone.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.800]   I haven't thrown one yet.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:20.800]   So this is really one of the better advantages for the stock market.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.880]   Real estate is relatively illiquid asset class.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.840]   There are ways to get some liquidity,
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:32.280]   you know, through cash out refinances or there's sometimes options
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.720]   for lines of credit.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:38.160]   But I think for real estate investors, the key is really to use your capital
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:41.920]   elsewhere in your portfolio to maintain some liquidity.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.240]   So that's whether that's keeping personal emergency funds
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:50.200]   in terms of cash or cash reserves for every property or on a portfolio level.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:55.440]   It's important that you have some liquidity outside of the actual capital
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:59.600]   that you're putting into an asset, because right now it's relatively easy
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.360]   to sell real estate, but there are times when it could take months
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.200]   or even years to sell assets.
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.840]   So it's really important to make sure that you have easily
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:11.160]   accessible capital elsewhere in your financial life
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.120]   if you're going to be investing in real estate.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:16.640]   Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, when you look at real estate
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:20.680]   versus something like stocks, I mean, obviously stocks are more liquid.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.600]   Like if I need to sell a stock today, I can do that.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.960]   If I need to sell real estate, that may require a little bit more time.
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:31.440]   And, you know, we mentioned earlier in the show
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:34.680]   here sort of that concept of being a desperate seller.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.720]   You never want to be a desperate seller.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:40.760]   And so, you know, trying to realize those returns from real estate
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.320]   doesn't always work out on our timeline.
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.840]   Now, the flip side of that is, you know, as a real estate owner,
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.960]   and I think is it, you know, I'm a homeowner.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.840]   I think some of us are, at least if not all.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:55.960]   But but you build that equity and you're able to borrow against that.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.800]   And that really does make a big difference,
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.960]   particularly in a lower interest rate environment,
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:03.680]   which we used to be more familiar with than we are today.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.600]   But hey, listen, we don't have any control over that. Right.
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:11.160]   But it's really nice to be able to borrow against that equity
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.960]   to do other things right that enables all sorts of things,
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:20.480]   whether it's funding college education or, you know, upgrading to a new house.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:25.360]   I mean, there are a lot of things that owning a home can really facilitate
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.880]   in regard to equities, in regard to stocks.
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.400]   Sure. I mean, they're much more liquid.
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.920]   You can buy and sell them at the drop of a hat, and that's great.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:38.080]   But that doesn't necessarily always work out so well
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:41.840]   because you're still subject to vagaries of the stock market.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:45.240]   OK, we got one big topic that came up briefly,
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.200]   but we didn't really drill into it.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.720]   Let's talk about taxes.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.920]   Let's talk about the tax advantages each of you get from your style of investing.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.280]   We're going to start with real estate.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:58.760]   Yeah. So, you know, the real estate is a business.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:02.680]   So all the like on a rental property, all the expenses like interest,
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.920]   a property management, if you hire that out, maintenance,
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:09.200]   those types of things can all be expensed.
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:14.040]   The land, the not the land, the structure and any improvements made to it
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.520]   can be capitalized and then depreciated.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:20.240]   And that depreciation can offset cash flow on the P&L,
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:23.240]   which means that if you get a five, six, seven percent yield on your cash flow,
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:28.000]   you often are actually having a tax loss show up on your income tax returns.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.960]   So you're not paying any income tax on that cash flow for a long period of time.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.200]   And then when you go to sell the property,
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.000]   you have to recapture that depreciation, which is a trap that investors
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.840]   who think that they'll never have to do that sometimes run into.
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:42.880]   But there are options to continuously defer those taxes
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.120]   through what's called a 1031 exchange,
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.680]   where you can kind of continue to buy bigger and bigger properties
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.560]   using the equity in your portfolios.
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:52.840]   And some real estate investors like to play that game indefinitely,
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.840]   never pay taxes by deferring them indefinitely, die,
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:00.400]   pass on their properties to their heirs at a stepped up basis and go from there.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.800]   This is wonderful in theory and practice.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.440]   Investors sometimes run into challenges with that for that reason.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.840]   However, real estate's not really a good option, in my opinion,
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.120]   for people to invest in like their 401k.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.920]   So real estate, if you want to get into it
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.840]   and you're not trying to move out of your house
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.960]   and move into a new rental property with a really low down payment,
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.840]   you got to accumulate liquidity outside of that 401k and outside of your home,
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.600]   probably to the tune of $50,000 to $100,000
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.680]   in most markets to begin to put in the down payments.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.040]   That's a challenge there.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.000]   I'll speak for the stock side.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.640]   We're not going to win this argument when it comes to taxes.
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.320]   I agree. I think real estate has a lot of tax advantages.
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:38.400]   I think when you look at the stock market, what we get,
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.880]   well, our advantages are in deferral.
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:43.640]   In other words, whether it's through retirement accounts, Roth IRA, 401k.
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:47.400]   I know there's certain vehicles, real estate, you can put into a self-managed IRA.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.920]   Those processes are hard, though.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.600]   But with stocks, it's easy.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:54.040]   So you can defer taxes by never selling or rarely selling
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.880]   or by putting in the retirement accounts, which are advantages.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.600]   But I would say you're not going to get sort of the very juice
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:05.160]   leveraged tax advantages you get with real estate in the stock market.
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.480]   And plus, in the stock market, even though dividends are great,
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:12.320]   they're double taxed and we're paying 15% rates or higher on those as well.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:16.760]   So that's a disadvantage for us, except for those investors who, again,
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:22.440]   take a long term view of it and buy a company and don't sell it or have to sell it.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.800]   You can defer those taxes for a very long time in stocks.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.520]   I think we're at the point that I want you guys to stop throwing bones
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.280]   to each other's side, stop arguing for the other person.
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:33.320]   I'm going to have you guys do your closing arguments,
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:37.560]   like pretend you're on the courtroom floor, really trying to convince the listeners.
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:42.320]   I'm going to let real estate go first this time.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.360]   And Dave, you want to take that?
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:48.240]   Yeah, my closing argument is that if you want to maximize your wealth,
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:54.080]   especially early in your career, real estate investing is by far the best way to do it.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:58.560]   If you have the energy to put five or 10 hours a week to get started in,
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.520]   you can literally generate returns
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.520]   that are double that of the average of the stock market.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.000]   And yes, it does take work.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.840]   But if you have a good entrepreneurial spirit, the total return method
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:14.800]   of real estate investing, which includes cash flow, appreciation, amortization,
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:19.640]   value add and tax benefits is really unmatched in any other asset class.
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:22.640]   All right, Matt, you want to take it from the from the stock side?
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:28.720]   Sure. I will say, listen, if you want to invest easily via an app
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:32.040]   on your phone, as I talked about earlier, and you don't want to get the 2 a.m.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:35.280]   phone call from a tenant whose toilet broke and you got to go there and fix it.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.480]   Check out stocks.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:42.680]   Like I said, the unlevered return is probably the best in the world that you can get.
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.680]   And it's simple.
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.080]   It's highly liquid.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.320]   You can buy something today and sell it five minutes later
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.720]   and get your cash out if you want to.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.120]   Not that that's recommended.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.280]   So I just think if you're starting out, you have a little bit of money.
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.080]   You don't have enough for a down payment or big capital
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.080]   to become a big invest real estate investor.
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.680]   And you don't have a lot of time.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.360]   Stock market investing is probably the way to go.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.560]   I'll let the listeners decide who won this debate.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.840]   I'm not going to make any make any judgments here.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:10.320]   But I heard the entire time, I think every single one of you at one point
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:14.200]   mentioned that you've dabbled in the other one's sport of investing.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:18.400]   So how do you guys think broadly about real estate and stocks
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.880]   fitting into your overall investment portfolio?
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:25.400]   I didn't hear anyone advocating for a portfolio exclusively of one or the other.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.120]   Yeah, I'll jump in there right now.
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.200]   Just say, listen, I own a lot of both. Right.
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.760]   I mean, we have we we're homeowners here in northern Virginia.
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:36.640]   We have equity in our house.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.720]   We've utilized that equity in our house.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:42.960]   We're big investors in stocks and ETFs.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:46.120]   So we're big participants in the equity markets.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:50.680]   I mean, to me, this really all boils down to sort of diversification.
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.840]   I don't think it's one or the other.
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:56.640]   I think that's the beauty of this system is you can participate in both.
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.440]   It's just a matter of how you do it. Right.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:03.040]   And if you want to be more active on the real estate side
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:08.480]   and act as a property owner and a landlord, then that's great.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:09.680]   Do that. Try that.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:10.640]   I mean, I've tried that.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:13.360]   And it's there. There are a lot of things you learn from it.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:14.880]   It can be very rewarding.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:19.520]   But but regardless, whether you're a landlord or just a homeowner,
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.680]   building up that equity can be tremendously valuable.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:27.440]   By the same token, you can still invest in equities at the same time. Right.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.080]   You can you can continue to build that retirement portfolio
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:34.720]   and just sort of ignore all of that short term, short term noise
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:37.840]   that that we always criticize. Right.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:41.640]   And just sort of let the equity sort of do their thing.
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.280]   Let those companies continue to grow.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:46.160]   So to me, it's not a one or the other thing.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:49.640]   It's really the beauty of the system is you can participate in both.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:52.080]   And they can be very they can be very powerful
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:56.560]   to ultimately getting to where you want to go in regard to your financial freedom.
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:59.280]   Yeah. One of the things I always think about is I call it the
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:03.920]   the middle class trap, right, where what I don't want to do with my portfolio
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.960]   is I don't want to have all of my wealth in my home equity
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:11.680]   and then my 401k balance and not have any liquidity outside of that.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:13.080]   No cash flow, no optionality.
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:16.000]   So every couple of years, I take out a piece of paper
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.360]   and just literally a piece of paper and I draw a circle and I think, say,
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:22.440]   this is how much wealth I'm going to have in three, five, seven, ten years.
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.600]   You pick a number. Right.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:27.120]   And I say, OK, what do I want my portfolio to look like at that point in time?
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.400]   I just slice it out into different pie chunks.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.440]   Right. Probably financial advisors are crying about how simple
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.560]   and stupid this exercise is, but it works for me.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:37.920]   And I say, OK, what do I want it to look like at that point in time?
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.640]   And if I'm not on that track, I start changing my behavior,
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.840]   even if that means I'm doing slightly inefficient things
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:48.120]   like not maxing out my 401k to save more for real estate, for example.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:51.240]   So for me, I want a third, a third, a third, a third in real estate,
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.440]   a third in stocks and a third in private business.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:56.080]   That's what I'm looking for for my long term portfolio.
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:00.280]   And I keep looking at it and every once in a while say, am I on the right track?
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:00.960]   I need to course correct
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.720]   a little bit with where I'm allocating the cash coming into my life
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.320]   in order to make that true.
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:09.400]   And so I think it's that simple for me as an exercise and that hard
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:12.800]   to make those big, challenging tradeoffs about where to direct your cash flow.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:17.520]   I think in getting me and Scott to represent real estate here,
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:21.600]   Jason and Matt, you're getting the two most maybe stock friendly
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.280]   personalities in the BiggerPockets network.
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:28.520]   I have a lot of friends who are 100 percent in real estate investing.
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:34.480]   But I typically my my target allocation is like 60 40 real estate.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:38.080]   And I would split my real estate in half for passive and active.
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:42.160]   So I try and do like 30 percent into actively owned rental properties,
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:46.440]   30 percent and more passive opportunities, 40 percent stocks.
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:48.600]   And as Scott said, it's never perfectly there.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.280]   But that's sort of what I shoot for.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:51.560]   Matt, any final thoughts?
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:52.880]   Yeah, I'll just say I'm glad we did this,
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:55.000]   because I think these are the two, in my view, the best
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.960]   the two best asset classes out there. Right.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:00.480]   We're going to talk about bonds or gold or God, crypto.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:03.560]   These are these the best.
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:07.840]   And I think, yeah, for me as well, I think everyone here has a good mix of both.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.080]   I'm obviously more weighted stocks and real estate.
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:13.600]   But I see I see so many advantages to both.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.600]   And I plan to invest in both for the rest of my life.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.280]   All right. Well, I think we've we've convinced everyone,
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:19.880]   at least of what the two best asset classes are.
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:22.480]   If you want to go a lot deeper on the real estate side,
