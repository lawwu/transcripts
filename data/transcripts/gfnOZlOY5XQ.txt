[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Last time in episode number 349, you encouraged folks who were considering adoption with your
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.320]   own story of adopting Talitha when you were 50 years old.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.080]   Pastor John, do you have any more encouragements or guidance as couples ponder this huge life-shaping
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.200]   issue?
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.160]   Adoption is huge.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.720]   It was especially huge for us.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.520]   At least it seemed at the time just overwhelming to me that my wife wanted to adopt this little
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.320]   girl and I was 50 and that wasn't in the plan and God had to do a deep work on my life.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.880]   We had raised only sons.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.440]   She was going to be now the first daughter.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.880]   She was going to be African-American and I'm an old man and this seemed, "Whoa, why are
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.840]   we doing this?"
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.840]   And God wonderfully turned my heart around.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.400]   So I'm aware of how huge this can feel for a mom or a dad and they've got to get on the
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.160]   same page about that.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.400]   And I want to nudge folks in this session toward taking the risk.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.600]   Adoption is one of the most glorious truths in the Bible, right?
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.880]   I'm thinking of God's adoption of us and it is glorious not only because of what it means
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.760]   vertically between us and God but also because of what it means horizontally between us and
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.760]   our family.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:35.920]   I mean the horizontal effects of a vertical experience of being adopted are phenomenal
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.080]   in the Bible and should be in our lives.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.100]   But vertically, this is one of the greatest realities in the Gospel.
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:52.560]   Something that God the Father planned, Jesus the Son achieved, and the Spirit of God applies.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.840]   In other words, it's a Trinitarian event.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.740]   Let me give you a text for each of those.
[00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.920]   So here's the Father in action in adoption.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.200]   He predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, Ephesians 1.5.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.660]   So the Father thought this up and planned it and destined it.
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.600]   This whole concept of us being adopted into the family of God.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.300]   And then in Galatians 4, here's the action of the Son.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.760]   When the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.720]   law, to redeem those who are under the law so that we might receive adoption as sons.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.480]   So Christ died so that I might be adopted into the family of God.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.660]   And then here comes the Spirit's role in Romans 8, 14.
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.660]   For all who are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God.
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.180]   For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.340]   the spirit of adoption.
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.620]   The sons by whom we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.500]   So every time a Christian feels welling up in his heart, "Father, God is my Father.
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.500]   I love you."
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:10.300]   God Himself applying his predestined work and the Son's purchased work in our experience
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.920]   of adoption.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.980]   So it's simply amazing how powerful, precious, deep, and wonderful this is.
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.160]   So the Spirit comes and he cries, "Abba, Father."
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.100]   And when John the Apostle pondered this, he was just staggered.
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.860]   He said, "Look, look what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.380]   called the children of God."
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.300]   And so we are, beloved, we're God's children now.
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.700]   And what we will be has not appeared, but we know that when he appears, we'll be like
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.700]   him.
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.060]   John just, it seemed to me, in that kind of language, is blown over by the kind of love
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.020]   that would look at a sinful human being, send his son to die for us, so that sinners and
[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:07.620]   rebels could not just be saved, but be folded into the very family of God.
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.980]   So the Spirit bears witness with us now of what?
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.980]   That we have a spectacular inheritance.
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.460]   This is one of the greatest things.
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:27.100]   If it's wonderful to belong to God as his child, which it is, it's beyond words wonderful,
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.860]   then to ponder its implications, like the Spirit bears witness with our spirit that
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.540]   we are the children of God, and if children, then heirs of God, fellow heirs with Christ,
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:45.820]   who by the way owns everything, provided we suffer with him, that we may be glorified
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.300]   with him.
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:56.980]   So when we ponder the reality of our own adoption, we remember it's an awesome thing.
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:04.460]   Not only because it is showing God's indescribable love, but also because it's an evidence of
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:12.260]   his predestining care for us, it's an evidence of Christ's purchase at infinite cost, it's
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:19.460]   an evidence of the Holy Spirit's effort to make it an experienced reality in our lives,
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.980]   and it's a proof that we're going to have an inheritance that makes every rich person
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:30.580]   in this world, Bill Gates, Buffett, whatever, they don't own anything compared to what we
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.380]   own by inheritance.
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.260]   So this is what God did for us.
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.660]   He adopted us.
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:44.420]   So you parents who are considering adoption are about to do something like that.
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.140]   Take a deep breath and say, "You're about to do something like that."
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:55.740]   So be encouraged that not only is it a beautiful thing to imitate, but that your own experience
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:03.700]   of it is the guarantee that God your Father will be there for you in every single chalice
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.260]   you face in adoption.
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.900]   There's the connection between the vertical and the horizontal.
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.860]   Because of our experience of the vertical, we can now take the massive risks of the horizontal
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.380]   knowing that He's going to be there for us in every way.
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.380]   Beautiful.
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.180]   Thank you for making those theological connections for us, Pastor John.
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.180]   And in case you missed it, this is the second part of a little three-part series on adoption.
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:33.380]   Be sure to check out yesterday's episode number 349 to hear the story of Pastor John, who
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.940]   chose to adopt at age 50.
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.720]   So assuming a couple does adopt a small child, how do you explain adoption to them?
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.900]   How early do you start?
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.900]   What do you say?
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:48.300]   Tomorrow in episode 351, we will hear from Pastor John on how he and Noel very thoughtfully
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.540]   introduced this topic early on to their daughter, Talitha, and some things they did to make
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.180]   the conversation a natural part of their home.
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.180]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.380]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:03.380]   [END]
