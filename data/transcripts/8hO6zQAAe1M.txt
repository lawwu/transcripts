[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   somebody who uses a lot of nootropics. So they're constantly using caffeine, but maybe on the side,
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.160]   like multiple times a week, they're also using Adderall, modafinil.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.400]   I don't personally like it, but I've never seen the evidence that it's negatively correlated with
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.920]   success. So I would try to put it out of mind. I sort of personally get a queasy feeling. Like,
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.080]   you really know what you're doing? Is all this stuff good for you? Why do you need this? That's
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.440]   like my actual reaction. But again, at the intellectual level, it does seem to work for
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.520]   some people, or at least not screw them up too much. You don't drink caffeine, correct?
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.400]   Zero. Why? I don't like it. And it might be bad for you.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.640]   Oh, really? You think so? And people get addicted to it also.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.280]   You're not worried it might make you less productive over the long term. It's more about
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.520]   you just don't want to be addicted to something. Well, since I don't know it well, I'm not sure
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.560]   what my worries are. But the status quo regime seems to work. I observe a lot of people who end
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.960]   up addicted to coffee, Coke, soda, like we know is bad for you. So what's the problem I need to
