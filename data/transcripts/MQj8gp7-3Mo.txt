[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.520]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:17.960]   the first psalm, and in the last two verses of that psalm, verses 5 and 6 in the first
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.440]   psalm.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:27.200]   "Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.680]   of the righteous.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:36.440]   For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly shall perish."
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:44.880]   "Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.240]   of the righteous.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:55.880]   For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly shall perish."
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.040]   We are considering this psalm and its message for the fourth time.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.400]   The word "therefore" at the beginning of verse 5 connects it, obviously, with what
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.240]   has been going before it.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.720]   And we have been, for the previous three Sunday nights, looking at this great and wonderful
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.440]   message that is here in this very first psalm, which is a kind of introduction to the entire
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.840]   book of psalms, and in many ways can be described as an introduction to the whole of the biblical
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.840]   message.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.160]   Now, these two verses come at the end of the psalm.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.400]   They are the conclusion, and in a sense they are also a climax.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.880]   What this man is doing here, as I have been showing, is to teach us and to instruct us
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.800]   as to the one and only way in which happiness or blessedness can be found.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.600]   And the method he has adopted is the method of comparison and contrast.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.160]   You see, this is his statement, "Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.000]   the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful; but
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.800]   his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.480]   He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.800]   his season; his leaf also shall not wither, and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:32.760]   The ungodly are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.760]   Therefore, the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.280]   of the righteous.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.040]   For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly shall perish."
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.040]   Well, as I've shown you again by reading the psalm, he puts this message concerning
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.040]   blissedness or happiness before us by painting these pictures.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:02.720]   Two men, two types of men, godly and ungodly, two ways of life, the godly life, the sinful,
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.680]   or the ungodly life.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.160]   And his point is, as I say, to show that the only hope of real true happiness is that we
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.320]   be godly.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:21.440]   This he says depends ultimately upon our relationship to God and upon what we are as a consequence
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.680]   of that.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.720]   But now we are looking at the last two verses.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.040]   He comes to the end and to the climax.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.600]   And this in and of itself, it seems to me, is something which is very typical and characteristic
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.240]   of the Bible.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.120]   The Bible always gives us a complete statement.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.800]   It always gives us a whole view.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.260]   The Bible never stops short.
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.320]   It never leaves anything unfinished.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.760]   If it sets out to deal with a case, it tells you everything about the case.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:05.000]   And so in these last two verses, we find this man following what he's been saying, therefore,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.640]   he says, he follows it to its climax and to its ultimate and inevitable logical conclusion.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.960]   His message for me, to summarize it for those who have not been here the previous Sundays,
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.520]   is something like this.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:25.800]   He says happiness, true happiness, is possible and is obtainable in a world even such as
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.280]   this world.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.720]   It is something that can be obtained immediately, at once.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.440]   It's not contingent upon other things.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.520]   It depends upon this one thing only.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:46.240]   He goes on to say that it is a happiness which lasts, which continues, a happiness that enables
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.880]   us to meet all possibilities and eventualities and contingencies.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.320]   We've considered all this.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.140]   But now here he goes further.
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.720]   It is a happiness, he tells us, that goes on forever.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.280]   It doesn't stop even at this world.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.480]   It goes on even into the next world.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.040]   You see, he tells us about the nature of the happiness, the continuation of the happiness
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:19.600]   in spite of everything, and the fact that it is an eternal happiness, a happiness that
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.880]   can even meet the last enemy and what lies beyond him, a happiness that goes on throughout
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.280]   the countless ages of eternity.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.960]   And by contrast, of course, he's been telling us that that godless, worldly, sinful life
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.440]   is a very poor thing in and of itself.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.440]   It's nature.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.440]   It's what is it?
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.640]   It's just chaff, a heap of chaff.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.640]   Nothing but that.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.640]   It's a poor thing.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.640]   It's no character.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.640]   There's nothing about it.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.080]   It's a complete contrast with this tree that he describes.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.160]   And he tells us that it's never of any real value or profit to us.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.280]   Never.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.520]   The sinful life is always a profitless life.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.520]   There's nothing to be said for it.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.520]   Chaff.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.800]   The wind blows away.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:14.640]   But, and this is the thing that he comes to in these last two verses, it is something
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:20.120]   that always leads finally and eventually to nothing but disaster.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:29.320]   Now, we are concerned tonight only, of course, with this end.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.200]   That's the thing that he puts before us in these two verses.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:42.640]   And I want to try to show you how this consideration of the end is the thing that makes the biblical
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.200]   teaching, the biblical message, so unique.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.480]   It's the thing that marks it off from every other type and kind of teaching that is offering
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.480]   itself to the human race at this very moment.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.120]   Now, let me put it to you like this.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:06.120]   The ultimate trouble with the man who is ungodly or sinner or scornful, call him what you will,
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.160]   these terms are all used about him here, and they're used elsewhere in the Bible.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.680]   But the ultimate trouble with the sinner is, of course, that he's just a fool.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.160]   Why do I say that he's a fool?
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:24.600]   Well, he's a fool for this reason, that he tends to live only for the present.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.920]   He never looks ahead.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.840]   He lives for the present.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.040]   He's concerned about the happiness of the moment.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.720]   He doesn't consider consequences.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.040]   He doesn't consider effects.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.040]   He doesn't consider results.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.200]   All he wants is this thing now that he can get.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.800]   The Bible has a term for all that.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   It calls it inordinate, inordinate affections.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.800]   It can't wait.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.200]   It must have it now.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:52.960]   Now, this is what the Bible tells us everywhere about the Bible, about this sinner, that he's
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:08:05.120]   a man, I say, who has this small view of life, present only, self-centered, selfish, small.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:14.960]   And he refuses to go on and to look at and to face the end of life.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:21.360]   He not only doesn't do that, but even if you try to persuade him to do so, he argues against
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.360]   you.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.080]   He dislikes it.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.920]   And he dismisses it.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.640]   He says the thing to do is to live for the present.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.960]   Why go and anticipate the future?
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.880]   It'll be here soon enough.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.760]   Why go and meet troubles?
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.760]   Live for the moment.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.760]   Enjoy yourself.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.240]   Let us eat, drink, and be merry.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:44.480]   Now, that's the typical attitude, and it dislikes any thought or suggestion or teaching that
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:51.200]   it should look ahead and consider what's going to happen and what it's all leading to.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.480]   The tragedy, I say, about the ungodly is that he lives from day to day, hand to mouth, lives
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:02.360]   in the present and thinks only of present happiness and satisfaction and enjoyment.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:08.920]   And even further, when you remind him of the fact that he's, after all, mortal and that
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:13.240]   he needs, must come to an end, oh, he says it's all right.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:17.560]   I'm not concerned about that, because he says that when a man dies, that's the end and there's
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.880]   no more to be said about it.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.720]   Now, that's the modern attitude.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.680]   It doesn't believe in the unseen.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.680]   It doesn't believe in the spiritual realm.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.360]   It doesn't believe in general in a future life.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.360]   This world only.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:38.320]   Now, I say that this man who holds those views is a fool for this reason, that he has no
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.120]   proof at all for what he's saying.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.480]   He can't demonstrate anything.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.160]   He can't prove that this is the only life and the only world.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.640]   He doesn't know.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:55.840]   But in spite of any proof, in spite of any sanctions for his position, in spite of his
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.720]   inability to demonstrate the rightness and the correctness of what he's saying, he risks
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:07.360]   all upon a conjecture, upon a mere theory, upon a mere supposition.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.640]   In a spirit of bravado, he doesn't care, he says, and he's not prepared to listen.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:18.120]   Well, now, I say there's only one word to use with respect to a man who's in that position,
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.520]   and that is that he is a fool.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.440]   The world doesn't like to face and to consider the future, but the Bible everywhere pleads
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:33.280]   with us to do so, reasons with us to do so, is always appealing to us to do so, exactly
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.160]   as this man does here in this first psalm.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.040]   Now, let me summarize its essential teaching with regard to this matter.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:47.320]   The Bible, in other words, always emphasizes what I've called the wholeness of the unity
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.320]   of life.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:54.160]   The Bible says, "Don't stop at considering your past and your present.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.160]   Anticipate the future.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.600]   Look ahead."
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.000]   The Bible never gives us a sort of piecemeal message.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.040]   The world, of course, does that with its pleasures.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.960]   It's not interested in your thinking ahead, "Have a good time now.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.420]   Have this enjoyment now.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.080]   Have this thing that appeals to you now."
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.000]   "No, no," says the Bible, "look ahead.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.840]   Don't enjoy this until you've considered what it may lead to.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:19.560]   Don't go and do anything until you've considered possible effects and results and consequences."
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.880]   Life, says the Bible, is a whole.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.760]   And whether you like it or not, it is a whole.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.760]   It is a unity.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.020]   It is past, present, then future.
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:35.080]   It is youth, middle age, old age.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.080]   It is being born.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.080]   It is living.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.080]   It is dying.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.080]   There's a unity.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.080]   There's a whole.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.360]   "Well, consider it all," says the Bible.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.800]   "Don't stop short at any point."
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.580]   That's its first emphasis.
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.160]   The second is this.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:55.240]   It just proclaims that death is not the end.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.920]   That when a man dies, it is not the end.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:05.640]   This is its message everywhere, right through Old Testament and New.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:12.560]   That this is only a temporary world, that we are only pilgrims and strangers here, journeymen,
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.480]   travelers.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.480]   And that beyond this life and this world, there is another, and we go on into that.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.640]   The Bible proclaims this.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.120]   Death is not the end.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:29.400]   Indeed, in the third place, it always tells us that after death there is a judgment.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.460]   The ungodly shall not stand in the judgment.
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:38.120]   This is one of its great fundamental facets, as I'm going to show you.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.080]   Death is not only the end, death leads to judgment.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:52.160]   And fourthly, and this is the vital thing, our everlasting and eternal destiny, our endless
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.640]   life in that spiritual realm to which we go when we go out of this world, our destiny
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:06.640]   there is determined by our life and our attitude in this world.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:14.480]   What happens to us there is the inevitable outcome, the logical outcome of what we are
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.640]   here, what I think, what I believe, how I live.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.640]   That's the point this man is making.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.600]   You see, this comparison between the godly and the ungodly, what they are, how they live,
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.240]   and so on, therefore, this is the end of it all.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.640]   Here's the final contrast.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:35.480]   Well, now, here is, I say, this great central message of the Bible with respect to life.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:40.280]   And you see what this man is saying can be put in this form.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:47.880]   The only man who is truly blessed and happy is the man who is catered for all and who
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:55.160]   is ready for all, the end, death, and what lies beyond it included.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:01.960]   Now, that's the secret, says this man, of happiness and of blessedness.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.320]   You cannot atomize life.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.800]   You can't divide it right off into segments.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.280]   You've got to take the whole.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.760]   It's a moving something like a stream flowing along.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:19.360]   And if you want to be really blessed and happy, says this man, well, then, you've got to consider
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.040]   the end as well as the beginning.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.960]   You've got to get the whole view.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.600]   It's all one piece.
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:33.080]   And what's going to happen to you there is determined by what you are here and now.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:41.240]   Very well, then, here is this message which this man puts before us.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.560]   The author of the epistle to the Hebrews tells us that many people in this world are all
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:54.320]   their lifetime subject to bondage because of the fear of death.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:15:03.840]   Shakespeare agrees, "Thoughts of that unknown born from which no traveler returns."
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:09.160]   You can't get true happiness in this world unless you've got a faith that sees through
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.360]   death.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:17.560]   It's impossible because however happy you may be at this moment, you never know.
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.560]   There's always the threat.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.160]   There's always the possibility.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.560]   You can't relax, as it were.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.480]   All their lifetime subject to bondage because of the fear of death.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.660]   So this man says, "All right, that's perfectly true.
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:35.000]   You must have a view of life that caters for the beginning and the end, all inclusive.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.800]   And then and then alone are you truly blessed.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.360]   Oh, the blessedness of the man."
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.360]   That's how he starts off.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:48.960]   Well, now, then, let us consider this matter of the end, and I'll put it to you in order
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:56.160]   to simplify the teaching into some three main propositions.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.800]   The first thing which we have to be clear about is the fact of judgment.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:08.680]   "Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment."
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:15.280]   I've said already that this is a part of the essential biblical message, that man is a
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:20.400]   responsible being, that he's not an animal.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:26.600]   He's a responsible being, and as a responsible being he's held accountable, and he will have
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.920]   to give an account to himself, the judge.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:36.280]   This message says that all men and women, everybody who's ever been into this world
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:40.240]   will have to stand in a final judgment, in a final assignment.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:45.840]   But, of course, the moment I say that, I know that I'm saying something that is utterly
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.680]   repellent to the modern men and to the modern mind.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.600]   Fancy, he says, still saying that.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:57.880]   I know he says that a century or so ago, and perhaps even until fifty years ago, preachers
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:02.320]   used to make great business with this judgment and used to frighten people into becoming
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.320]   religious.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.920]   They terrified them with thoughts of hell and punishment and judgment to believe the
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.000]   gospel and to live a good and a godly life.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.560]   But, of course, by now we know that this is all wrong.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.880]   There's nothing in it, there's no such thing.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.920]   And their reason for saying that, they say, is that if you believe in God at all, if you
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:23.560]   believe in a God of love, well then judgment is a sheer and utter impossibility.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.600]   You can't have it both ways, they say.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:33.800]   If you do believe in a God of love, well, judgment is something that is utterly incompatible
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.360]   with such a God and with such love.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.600]   Well, I don't want to argue about this tonight.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.040]   I've got something much more important to do.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.800]   But I do want to suggest this as I hurry along and as we pass along.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:51.120]   All this objection to judgment, you see, is based ultimately upon completely false views
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.520]   of God and of the love of God.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.520]   Let me just ask you a simple question.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.200]   What do you really know about God?
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.240]   What right have we to postulate things about God?
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:09.120]   What right have I to say, well now I say that if God is God and if God is a God of love,
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.000]   he cannot at the same time be a just and a righteous God, he cannot be a judge.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.160]   What right have I to say that?
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.200]   What do I really know about God?
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:24.920]   And the answer is that all we know about God is what God has been pleased to reveal concerning
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.920]   himself.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.400]   And the only knowledge we have concerning God's revelation of himself is what we have
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.400]   in this book.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.040]   Oh, I know you've got it in nature.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.760]   Thank God for it.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.600]   I see his wisdom, I see his power, I see his design.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:44.000]   Oh, I can see God not only in nature, I can see him in history, I see him in providence,
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.320]   I know.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:52.560]   But still, you see, the God you know in those ways is an unknown God.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:57.840]   Only to know the character of God, you've got to come to this book.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:03.600]   Here is the record of God's revelation of himself to men.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.360]   These men don't say, "This is what I think about God."
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.920]   They say, "No, God spoke to me.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.880]   God gave a revelation to me.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:14.160]   God called the men like Moses up on top of Mount Zion and began to speak and said, 'This
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.160]   is true.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.000]   I am.'"
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.680]   We are entirely confined to this book.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.160]   And therefore, my dear friend, if you say you don't believe in a judgment because you
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.640]   can't understand it, because you can't reconcile it with what you think God's love is, well,
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:40.000]   I say you are just basing your whole position on ignorance and upon speculation, upon what
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.600]   you hope, what you'd like to believe.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.480]   You've got no basis for it at all.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:50.080]   Over and against all this modern rejection of the notion of judgment stands the Bible
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.080]   itself.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.520]   And if there's anything that's plain in the Bible, it is judgment.
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:58.160]   When God made men and put them in the garden, he said, "Now then, if you break my laws,
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.160]   out you go."
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.160]   And out he went.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:07.320]   As I am never tired of pointing out, our world is as it is tonight because of judgment.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.960]   The world is as it is in sin because of God's judgment upon sin.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.480]   He cursed the ground.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:18.440]   He drove men out of paradise and put the flaming sword and the cherubim to prevent his coming
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.440]   back.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:24.000]   That's judgment in practice, in operation.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.160]   The Old Testament is full of it.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.040]   You get it in the case of individuals, you get it in the case of the whole nation of
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.320]   Israel, even his own people.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.680]   He sends them into the captivity of Babylon because of their sin.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.680]   Judgment!
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.680]   He said he would do it and he's done it.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:46.520]   Our Lord, when you come to the New Testament, you find the same thing.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.160]   The first preacher that appears before us is John the Baptist.
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.640]   He preached a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.600]   And as he addressed the congregation of Pharisees and scribes and others, he said, "Who hath
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.240]   warned you to flee?"
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.240]   From what?
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.240]   "From the wrath to come."
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.400]   That's the first note in the New Testament.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.280]   Why is this a gospel of salvation?
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.280]   Why is it good news?
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:10.640]   There's only one reason for calling the Christian message a gospel good news.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:18.360]   It is this, that it saves us from the judgment and the wrath to come.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:23.280]   John the Baptist, the precursor, the forerunner, he preached it.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.200]   But our Lord preached it.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:30.840]   Did you hear what we read just now from the fifth chapter of John's gospel?
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:35.080]   The day is coming, he says, when all who are in the graves are going to rise and they're
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.840]   going to rise to judgment.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.120]   It's either going to be life or damnation.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.360]   You talk about love.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:47.040]   Does anybody know anything about love in comparison with the Son of God, our Lord and Savior,
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.040]   Jesus Christ?
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.960]   He's the very incarnation of love.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.760]   He's come into the world because God is love, because God so loved the world.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:54.760]   And yet that's his teaching.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:59.160]   There it is from his own lips, judgment.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:08.560]   And it's one or the other, a judgment of damnation or a judgment which just proclaims that we
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.560]   are the people of God and that we go on to everlasting bliss.
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.760]   There it is, I say, in the teaching of our Lord, and it's in the teaching of all the
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.760]   apostles.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:21.800]   "Save yourselves," says Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost, the
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.080]   first sermon, rarely under the auspices of the Christian church.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:31.280]   "Save yourselves from this untoward generation."
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:36.920]   The apostle Paul preached the same thing, standing on Mars Hill in Athens.
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:41.640]   He said, "God now commandeth all men everywhere to repent, for he hath appointed a day in
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:46.840]   which he will judge the whole world in righteousness by that man whom he hath appointed, whereof
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:52.120]   he hath given us assurance in that he hath raised him from the dead."
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.560]   Judgment!
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.600]   Then says the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, "We are to give the more honest heed
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.840]   to these things that ye have heard, lest at any time ye let them slip."
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:01.840]   Why?
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:07.440]   "Well, how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?"
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.440]   Escape?
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.440]   Judgment?
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:16.960]   "It is appointed unto all men once to die," he says later on, "and after death the judgment."
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.240]   Peter agrees the day of the Lord will come.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.240]   It's bound to come.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:26.320]   A thousand years are but as one day with the Lord, and one day is a thousand years, but
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.520]   the day of the Lord will come.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.680]   It must come, the day of judgment.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.680]   It's everywhere.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.360]   The book of Revelation, what is it?
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:42.440]   Oh, it's but a preview of this ultimate, final judgment of the whole universe, the
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.440]   entire cosmos.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.560]   That's the answer to all the modern objection.
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:51.520]   I leave it at that, the fact of the judgment.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.240]   It's the solemn fact which is held before us everywhere in the Bible.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.760]   "Don't leave any house," says the Bible, "don't follow the ungodly."
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.760]   Why?
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:03.000]   "Well, because you've got to face a judgment."
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:11.600]   But let me go to the second principle, which is this, the nature of the judgment.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.960]   The character or the nature of the judgment.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.400]   It's a judgment that takes place partly in this world.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.760]   Sin produces a certain amount of punishment even in this world.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.560]   I won't keep you with that.
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.320]   That can be bad enough.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:36.080]   The soul that sinneth, it shall die, yes, but the way of the transgressor is hard.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.440]   The sinner always gets into trouble.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.840]   You can't break God's laws and just go on as if nothing had happened.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.960]   You've got to pay for it.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:54.400]   Remorse, self-castigation, damage perhaps to your physical body, harm done to your faculties,
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.400]   God-given faculties.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:59.160]   There's a judgment, there's a punishment even in this present world.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:03.520]   But the great message of the Bible is, of course, to tell us that it's at the end the
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.360]   judgment really comes.
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.400]   All these other things are but adumbrations of the judgment.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:13.280]   All the judgments in the Bible, indeed, are but foreshadowings of the final judgment preparing
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:19.840]   us for its signpost, fingerpost, pointing to what is bound to come at the end of the
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.840]   age.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.520]   Well, what is its teaching?
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:29.760]   The teaching is this, to put it as simply as I can, that everybody will have to appear
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:36.440]   before God in the judgment, the whole world, those who are still alive, those who have
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.560]   died, and those who've been drowned in the sea.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:45.880]   Everything's going to give up its depth, the graves, the oceans, the elements everywhere.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:51.240]   The dead shall rise.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:26:00.040]   All who've ever lived in this world will appear before God in the judgment.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.240]   What else are we told about it?
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.400]   Well, it is God's judgment.
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:08.840]   "Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, for the Lord knoweth the way
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.520]   of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly shall perish."
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:17.480]   The judge is the Lord himself, the judge of all the earth, as Abraham described him.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.480]   He is the judge.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:25.200]   He is the judge because it is his will, because he made it, because it belongs to him, because
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.960]   he set it going, because he's laid down the conditions.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.680]   He is the judge because he alone is just and righteous.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:38.320]   He is judge, if I may put it with reverence, because he alone is fit to be judge, and as
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.320]   the right to judge.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:45.080]   Don't you notice that our Lord there in the fifth of John has taught us that the judgment
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:50.720]   has been committed to him because he is the son of man, to make it yet more fair.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:55.040]   Men might say, "Ah, but what does God know about life lived by a man in this world?"
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:59.640]   The answer is, the Father has committed the judgment to the Son, and the Son has become
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.640]   a man.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.640]   The word was made flesh.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:06.200]   The Son has lived in this world, has been tempted in all points, like as we are.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.520]   He understands us.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.040]   He knows all about it.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.440]   He is the judge.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.040]   Judgment is committed to him.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:21.640]   The Apostle Paul, as I've reminded you, taught the same in his sermon on Mars Hill in Athens.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:26.300]   So the picture is, you see, of a day which is to come when the Son of God, the Lord Jesus
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:33.120]   Christ, will return to this world and will judge it in righteousness.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.720]   What are the terms of the judgment?
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:40.440]   Well, the terms of the judgment are made quite clear in the Bible.
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:44.160]   We will be judged according to the thing this man has talked so much about, the law of the
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.680]   Lord.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:52.240]   He tells us of this godly man that his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:56.080]   does he meditate day and night.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.080]   The law of the Lord.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:02.100]   Now, the law of the Lord is simply this.
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.600]   It is what God has said to men about himself.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.400]   I mean about men.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:12.400]   It is what God has been pleased to tell men in different ways and at different times as
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.680]   to what he expects from him.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.880]   You see, God made him, and he has told us that he has made men in his own image and
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.880]   likeness.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.600]   That's his object.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.040]   That's the object and purpose of his creation.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.160]   He is to be a kind of reflection of God in the world.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:33.160]   God has made everything, but he's made men a kind of under-lord.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.000]   He's Lord of creation, under God.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.320]   So God made him.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:42.400]   God having made us, put certain laws into us, and gave us certain laws outside.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.160]   And he said, "Now this is how I want you to live."
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:52.720]   So from time to time he's given us some very explicit statements of this law.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:58.480]   And the clearest in the Old Testament, of course, is the Ten Commandments.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:03.880]   The Ten Commandments are but God's statement as to how he expects men to live and what
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:09.440]   he demands of men and what he will finally and eventually expect of him.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.640]   Men will be judged by the Ten Commandments.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.000]   God has said, "Well, nobody needs to claim ignorance any longer.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Here it is.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   I put it before you.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   This is what I want.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.320]   That's how I'm going to judge you."
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.520]   Men will be judged by the Ten Commandments.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.840]   God has said, "Well, nobody needs to claim ignorance any longer.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:26.840]   Here it is.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:27.840]   I put it before you.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.840]   This is what I want.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.400]   That's how I'm going to judge you."
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.680]   You've got it in the teaching of the prophets, expounding this law.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:38.440]   And then our Lord in the New Testament, in the Sermon on the Mount, he expands it still
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.800]   more perfectly.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.800]   The Sermon on the Mount is an exposition of God's law.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.800]   This is what God demands.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.760]   This is what God expects.
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.440]   If you like, I'll sum it all up for you.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.200]   Our Lord has done so.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:54.980]   "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy mind
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:30:02.900]   and all thy strength and thy neighbor as thyself."
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:07.560]   And you and I, my friends, will be judged by that law.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:15.940]   "Thou shalt have no other gods beside me.
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.800]   Thou shalt not make any graven image and bow down to it.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.940]   Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain.
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.940]   Thou shalt not take the day of the Lord in vain.
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.140]   Honor thy father and mother.
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.140]   Thou shalt not kill.
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:29.140]   Thou shalt not steal.
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.140]   Thou shalt not commit adultery.
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:36.660]   Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his ox, nor his ass," and so on.
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:42.860]   And remember, all that is specially as interpreted in a spiritual manner by our Lord himself
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:47.820]   in the Sermon on the Mount, which shows that it isn't the actual deeds alone that matter,
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:51.820]   but the thoughts, the desires, the things we feel.
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:56.340]   God knows them all.
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:00.340]   Very well, those are the terms of the judgment, but what is emphasized here in particular
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:05.300]   by this man in these two verses in the first Psalm is what I may call the thoroughness
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.300]   of the judgment.
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.260]   Have you ever noticed that?
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.260]   Listen.
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:17.860]   "The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly shall perish."
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.500]   The thoroughness of the gospel.
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.100]   The Lord knows.
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.100]   He knows everything.
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.100]   He is omniscient.
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:30.100]   There is nothing that he doesn't know.
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:34.740]   "There is nothing against," says the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, "that is hidden
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:41.900]   from his sight, but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.660]   to do."
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:47.580]   The Lord knoweth.
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:48.580]   God is omnipresent.
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.580]   He is everywhere.
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:54.420]   You can't send behind a shut door as far as God is concerned.
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:55.420]   It's impossible.
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.420]   He is everywhere.
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.460]   He knows everything.
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.940]   The Bible teaches this in many different forms.
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:08.860]   The psalmist complains, "Poor men, thou knowest," he says, "my down-sitting and my uprising.
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.340]   Thou understandest my thoughts are far off.
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.740]   I can't get away from you."
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:17.580]   That's how he puts it.
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.300]   And the New Testament puts it in this way.
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.540]   It tells us that there are great books, if you like.
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:26.380]   It's a picture of great ledgers kept in heaven.
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:30.500]   And every one of us has got a page in that ledger.
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:34.860]   And everything that every one of us has ever done or thought or said, it's there recorded,
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:40.540]   written in the book, so that in the judgments the books are produced.
[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:43.420]   And everything is known about us.
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:47.180]   The thoroughness of the judgment.
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.540]   Nothing can be hidden from the sight of God.
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:54.260]   The very fact that God is God makes that inevitable, of course, but this is the thing that we forget.
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:58.340]   We are so clever at doing things without knowing one another in this world.
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.940]   We can deceive one another and we can lie and get out of it.
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:05.060]   And we rather admire the men who can always get out of it.
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.900]   But nobody can get out of it with God.
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:11.420]   The Lord knoweth.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:14.420]   Nothing is hidden from his sight.
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:16.900]   But you know there's another terrible way in which that is put here.
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:17.900]   Did you notice it?
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:25.020]   "Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.020]   of the righteous."
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.020]   What's this?
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:30.260]   Well, this is the most terrifying thing of all.
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:32.300]   The congregation of the righteous.
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.620]   What's that?
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:38.260]   Well, if you take the similar use of this word, "congregation," as you find it in the
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:44.220]   Bible, you will find the congregation means exactly the same thing as the church.
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:48.500]   Or you'll find that sometimes it stands for God's people.
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:52.140]   The congregation is God's people, God's own people.
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:53.140]   It's the church.
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.140]   Very well.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:34:01.380]   But what he says is that the sinners shall not stand in the congregation of the righteous.
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:06.220]   You see, what he means is this.
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:13.900]   That while you and I are in this world, we can be in the congregation of the righteous.
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:21.820]   You and I can be members of Christian churches, and we confess as godly and as Christian people.
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:25.660]   What he's telling us is this, that because God knows everything, it doesn't follow that
[00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:30.300]   we're going to continue in the congregation of the righteous after the judgment, because
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.660]   God knows all about us.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:36.660]   And there is going to be a terrible sifting and a terrible dividing.
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:42.180]   There is a gathering, a congregation, and they all fondly imagine that they're God's
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:47.860]   people, and then he will come in the judgment and he'll sift, he'll divide.
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:53.180]   Now, lest anybody may think that this is just Old Testament teaching, let me give it to
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:57.300]   you in its New Testament garb and out of the mouth of the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:03.340]   Here he is again, let me give you the exact words in the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:05.340]   He's ending the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:10.020]   And you see, he generally ends his sermons on this note of judgment, and he puts it like
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.020]   this.
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:16.900]   "Not every one that saith unto me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter into the kingdom of heaven,
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:20.260]   but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:25.380]   Many will say unto me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name,
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:30.420]   and in thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works?'
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:37.500]   And then will I profess unto them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work in
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.500]   iniquity.'"
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.380]   But Lord, they say, "We are members of the congregation.
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:43.620]   Haven't you been in our streets?
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:47.380]   Have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have cast out devils, and in thy
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.220]   name done many wonderful works?"
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.100]   We belong to the congregation.
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:56.060]   The word will come, "I never knew you."
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:58.740]   You are not to stand in the congregation of the righteous.
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.620]   You don't belong to them, you never have done.
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.700]   You insinuated yourself amongst them.
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.340]   You wanted to get all the benefits.
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:09.860]   But God knows everything, and I know everything.
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:17.660]   "And as if that were not enough, he spoke three parables," and the same thing you'll
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:22.100]   find them in the 25th chapter of Matthew's Gospel.
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.460]   There he is in chapter 24 dealing with the end of the world, the judgment.
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.300]   Somebody said to him, "When's the end of the world coming?"
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.900]   He said, "Don't you worry about when.
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:31.940]   You concentrate on what will happen when it does come."
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:32.940]   And he spoke three parables.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:33.940]   Do you remember them?
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:36.940]   Here's the first, "Ten virgins."
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:40.700]   Yes, but the same division as we have in our psalm.
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:44.900]   Five were wise, five were foolish, but they all appeared to be the same.
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:50.140]   Ten virgins, they'd all got lamps, they were all going to a wedding feast.
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:51.700]   "There's no difference," you say.
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:57.900]   Ah, the answer is, they're all in the congregation.
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:04.460]   But when the bridegroom comes, there are only five in the congregation, and there are five
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:08.780]   hammering at the door, trying to get in, but they're not given admission.
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:09.780]   They're outside.
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.300]   They thought they were all right.
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:15.140]   The whole point of the parable is to teach that the danger, the terrible danger of thinking
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:18.300]   and assuming that you're in the congregation because you've got a lamp and because you
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:23.940]   want to go to the feast, but they had no oil, none of this vital spirit of life.
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:29.300]   When they're outside, the next parable, you remember those three men and their talents.
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.040]   It's exactly the same point.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:35.960]   And the last one, the final judgment of the nations, the sheep and the goats.
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.380]   You see, the assumption was that they were all the same.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:45.120]   The whole point of the parable is to say, "No, he will divide sheep and goats, standing
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:49.200]   in the congregation of the righteous, not standing in the congregation of the righteous."
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.480]   Oh, the thoroughness of the judgment, my dear friends.
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:58.240]   We are dealing with one to whom all things are naked and open.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:02.920]   All things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:08.480]   The Lord knoweth.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.400]   We are not dealing with men.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:16.320]   We are dealing with the omniscient, almighty and everlasting God.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:22.840]   And that brings me to my third and my last principle, which is this one.
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:29.960]   The consequences of the judgment, the fact of the judgment, the character, the nature
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:36.360]   of the judgment, and finally the consequences of the judgment.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:42.320]   And here it is, of course, in this graphic, tremendous phrase, "Therefore the ungodly
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:50.000]   shall not stand in the judgment, nor in the congregation of the righteous."
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   What's he mean?
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:57.120]   Well, shall I put it here into the colloquial language of today?
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:03.960]   What he's saying is this, that the ungodly in that final judgment will not have a leg
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.280]   to stand on.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.600]   That's how we put it.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.120]   He'll not stand in the judgment.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.920]   He hasn't got a leg to stand on.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.280]   His whole case is demolished.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.440]   What's it mean?
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.600]   Well, it means this, that he'll be speechless.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.320]   He won't have a word to say.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.560]   He won't have a reply to offer.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.560]   What will be the charges?
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.200]   Well, here they are.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.400]   He's never given God a thought.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:29.440]   He lived as if there were no God.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:36.120]   He'd been made by God for God's own pleasure, and that he might glorify God and enjoy him
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:40.120]   forever.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.640]   But he hadn't thought of God.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.800]   He'd lived his life as if there were no God.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.520]   He'd gone his own way.
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:49.840]   And if God were mentioned to him, he hated the thought.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:50.840]   He didn't love God.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:54.000]   He's supposed to love God with the whole of his being.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.120]   But he hated God and felt God was against him, and he reviled the name of God.
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:01.120]   That's one thing.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:05.000]   Secondly, he hasn't lived, as I say, to God's honor and glory.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.480]   He hasn't kept the law of God and the commandments of God.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:13.200]   Instead of delighting in the law of the Lord and making it his meditation day and night,
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:17.560]   he has hated it, he's cursed it, he's spat upon it, he's ridiculed it.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.600]   He says, "That's just keeping a man down.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.760]   I believe," he said, "in self-expression.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.600]   I don't believe in curbing myself.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.920]   I let myself go.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:27.200]   If I want a thing, I have a right to it."
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.920]   He's spurned the voice of God.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:35.120]   He's trampled on the decencies and the sanctities, and he's gloried in it.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.880]   He's made a beast of himself and has been proud of himself as he's done so.
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:46.200]   He says, "That's to be a man and not some namby-pamby, miserable Christian."
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:52.600]   That's the sort of thing that'll face him.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:58.960]   And in the same way, he will be examined and questioned as to his view of himself, his
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:04.840]   view of man, his view of the soul.
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:09.080]   He's lived in this world saying that man is nothing but a reasoning animal.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:11.160]   He doesn't believe in a special creation.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.480]   He doesn't believe that man was made in the image of God.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:16.760]   Man, he says, is just an animal that's evolved.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:20.760]   And thereby, of course, he's insulting his own nature and insulting the God who made
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:21.760]   him.
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:29.000]   And he's lived a life that corresponds to it, this life of chaff.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:36.840]   And as he stands there in the judgment and sees the Son of Man, sees the Son of God who
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:42.280]   became man and has given us a representation of what manhood means and what man is meant
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:50.240]   to be, he'll be speechless.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:54.080]   And then he'll be examined with regard to the quality and the value of the life that
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:58.700]   he has lived.
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:04.040]   And he'll see that it's utterly and entirely useless.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.320]   A balance sheet will be struck.
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:11.200]   What's the end result of the things to which he's given himself?
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:15.520]   The things for which he's lived, the things on which he's gloated, the things which he's
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.520]   enjoyed.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:17.520]   What's the end result?
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.520]   What's the value?
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.520]   Chaff!
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.520]   Useless.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.520]   Chaff.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:28.720]   But you know, he doesn't stop at that.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:34.160]   He will try now to justify himself and say, "But I didn't know.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.040]   I didn't realize."
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.040]   And he's silenced again.
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.680]   He isn't a leg to stand on.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.040]   There is no excuse.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.440]   The knowledge has been given.
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.240]   The revelation is here.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.240]   The Bible is full of it.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:49.920]   God has spoken.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:50.920]   There is no plea.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.440]   Ignorance of the law is no excuse.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:57.960]   Here it is that a man should make himself acquainted with it, and God has made it plain
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:02.680]   in his Word, in his prophets, in his apostles, in his preachers.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:06.560]   God is speaking to men, warning them, telling them what he demands.
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:07.560]   There is no plea.
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.560]   There is no excuse.
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:18.640]   Ignorance is inexcusable because God has given the revelation.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:24.880]   But you know the final thing that will demolish this poor man and leave him without a single
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.520]   leg to stand on?
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:31.760]   And there he'll be like a heap of chaff in the judgment, not standing.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:32.760]   Why?
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:41.320]   Because he'll be confronting the Son of God himself.
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:44.240]   If he turns to him and says, "But the standard was too high."
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.600]   Who could live that?
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:49.360]   Who could love God with all his heart and mind and soul and strength and his neighbor
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.640]   as himself?
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.800]   Who could live only to the glory of God and to his praise?
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.560]   Who could keep the Son and of the Mount?
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:57.360]   Who could live the Ten Commandments?
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.360]   It's asking impossibilities.
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.360]   It's unfair.
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.560]   And the answer will come back.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:06.680]   Look at me.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:12.760]   I left heaven and came into your world in order to save people like you.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:18.000]   I came not to save and to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.280]   My teaching was that they that are whole have no need of a physician but they that are sick.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.640]   The Son of Man, I said, has come to seek and to save.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:30.440]   And listen, he'll say, "Publicans and sinners heard me and came after me.
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:34.320]   Men and women fallen into sin to the very depths and dregs.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:39.520]   They listened, they came, they believed, and here they are standing in the judgment.
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:43.440]   There is no excuse left."
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:49.960]   The final condemnation is that God's offer of free salvation in Christ Jesus was spurned
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:53.840]   and refused and rejected and despised.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:45:00.280]   "Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.280]   He's demolished.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:06.840]   He hasn't a leg to stand on, but alas, it doesn't stop at that.
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:14.200]   The way of the ungodly shall perish."
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:19.520]   Finding himself without a word of explanation and without a single plea, without a leg to
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:27.320]   stand on, he will be sent into the outer darkness.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:32.200]   I'm quoting our Lord's words, "outer darkness."
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:39.320]   To a place where there worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched, still his words.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:44.760]   To a place where there is weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, still the words of
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:48.120]   the Son of God.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:56.640]   "The way of the ungodly shall perish, everlasting destruction, from the presence of the Lord."
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:07.840]   My dear friend, that is the end and the inevitable outcome of the life of the ungodly, the sinner,
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:15.880]   the squanderer, the chaff, the man that rejects God and his holy law and his Son.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:21.080]   That's the end.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:25.720]   Why is all this written?
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:30.840]   And the answer is, it is written because God is love.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:35.840]   It is written to warn us while there is yet time.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:39.640]   It is written to save us.
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:47.080]   It is written to show us that there is a way of deliverance, a way of escape.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:50.960]   That is the whole message of the Christian gospel.
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:56.840]   That is why Christ, the Son of God, came into the world, because we are all by nature ungodly,
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:03.880]   we are all sinful, and if we die like that we'll go to that destruction, to that everlasting
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:08.640]   punishment of hell.
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:17.200]   But God has sent his message, and it is a message that calls us to repentance, to an
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:22.000]   acknowledgement and a confession of our sin.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.240]   Repent and believe the gospel.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.440]   That's the message.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:29.920]   Nothing else.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:34.060]   See the blindness and the madness and the iniquity of it all.
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.560]   See the end to which it leads.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:41.320]   Acknowledge it, repent, fall before God and confess it and admit you haven't a leg to
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.480]   stand on.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:50.520]   And then believe his gospel, in and through his Son, our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.520]   Here it is.
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:55.160]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:57.800]   Today is the day of salvation.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.280]   The door is not shut.
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.000]   There is no need to go to that end.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.760]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:09.640]   Though all this is true of the ungodly, if he believes that Christ, the Son of God, came
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:15.560]   into the world to live and die and rise again for his reconciliation with God, immediately
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:21.600]   he is forgiven, he is received by God, he becomes a child of God, he becomes like this
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:28.360]   tree and the Lord knoweth his ways and he'll go on into the everlasting bliss and glory.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.360]   That is the message.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:35.200]   That's why this is written, to warn us, to call us to repent and to return to God and
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:44.120]   to believe the gospel of his dear Son.
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:51.000]   Have you believed all this, my friend?
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:59.040]   Have you seen the need of the coming of the Son of God into this world?
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.760]   Have you visualized the judgment?
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.320]   Can you stand?
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:12.080]   Will you be able to stand at that great day?
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:16.600]   If you have seen tonight as you've never seen before that you'll not be able to stand, I
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:25.080]   am here and it's my great privilege to tell you, God calleth yet.
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:30.560]   Today is the day of salvation.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:37.760]   Believe it and say with me, today, "Thy mercy calls me to wash away my sin, however great
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:46.560]   my trespass, whatever I have been, however long from mercy I may have turned away, thy
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:56.920]   blood, O Christ, can cleanse me and make me white today."
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:02.120]   Or if you prefer it, put it in these words of Count Zinzendorf, translated by John Wesley,
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:08.920]   "Jesus, thy blood and righteousness, my beauty is my glorious dress.
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:14.240]   Midst flaming worlds in this arrayed, with joy shall I lift up my head.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:23.280]   Bold shall I stand in that, in thy great day, for who ought to my charge shall lay, fully
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:32.000]   absolved through thee I am from sin and fear, from guilt and shame."
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:41.080]   Or would you prefer it in the words of Augustus Toplady, "When I soar through tracts unknown,
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:54.800]   see thee on thy judgment throne, rock of ages cleft for me, let me hide myself in thee."
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:57.840]   Believe on this law.
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:01.760]   And then you will be able to believe the apostle Paul when he says, "Who shall bring any charge
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:03.840]   against God's elect?
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:05.920]   It is God that justifies.
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:07.280]   Who is he that condemneth?
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:11.880]   It is Christ that died, yea, rather that he is risen again.
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:17.520]   For he is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us."
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.520]   You are safe.
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:25.600]   No one can bring any charge against you.
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:30.200]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and turn to him and say something like this if you
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.080]   have never said it before.
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:42.400]   "O Christ, in thee my soul hath found and found in thee alone the peace, the joy I sought
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:47.440]   so long, the bliss till now unknown.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:53.920]   I sighed for rest and happiness, I yearned for them, not thee.
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:58.880]   But while I passed my Saviour by, his love laid hold on me.
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:04.360]   I tried the broken cisterns, Lord, but ah, the waters failed.
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:09.320]   Even as I stooped to drink, they fled and mocked me as I wailed.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:13.760]   Now none but Christ can satisfy me.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:15.600]   None other name for me.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:21.040]   There is life and lasting joy.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:26.900]   Lord Jesus, found in thee."
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:29.680]   It comes to this, my dear friend.
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:31.520]   There is no other way for happiness.
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:33.480]   There is no other way to stand.
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:38.320]   But if you believe in Christ, you will be able to say, "Bold shall I stand in thy great
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:41.720]   day, for who ought to my charge shall lay.
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:50.600]   Fully absolved through thee I am from sin and death and guilt and shame."
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:59.140]   In Christ you need not fear the judgment, for the terrors of law and of God with me
[00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:02.020]   can have nothing to do.
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:11.700]   My Saviour's obedience and blood hide all my transgressions from view.
[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:18.660]   On Christ the solid rock I stand.
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:22.180]   All other ground is sinking sand.
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:25.180]   You can't stand on anything else in this world.
[00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:29.260]   You won't be able to stand in the judgment on anything else.
[00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:33.180]   The sinner shall not stand in the judgment.
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:36.980]   Like the chaff he'll be blown away.
[00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:45.980]   But on Christ the solid rock I stand.
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:51.380]   All other ground is sinking sand.
[00:53:51.380 --> 00:54:00.220]   My dear friend, are you standing on the rock of Christ Jesus?
[00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:03.900]   Is he your only hope tonight?
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:14.300]   Do you say honestly, "My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:27.820]   I dare not trust my sweetest friend, but wholly lean on Jesus' name, on Christ the solid rock
[00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:28.820]   I stand."
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:37.860]   All other ground is sinking sand.
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:57.860]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved now.
[00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:00.860]   Amen.
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:04.860]   Amen.
[00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:28.860]   Amen.
[00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:29.860]   Thank you.
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:39.860]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
