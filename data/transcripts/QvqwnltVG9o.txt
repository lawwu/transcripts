[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.440]   Actually, I want to shift towards the more practical world of controlling your time.
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.940]   And the occasion of me talking about this is the recent publication of the second edition
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.040]   of my Time Block Planner.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.860]   So if you're watching this, this is episode 261 at the deeplife.com or you can find it
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.280]   at youtube.com/kellennewportmedia.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.120]   And I am holding up to the camera the new and improved second edition of my Time Block
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.120]   Planner.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.800]   So I thought this was a good occasion to do a refresher on time blocking.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:44.120]   It is at the core of my ability to fit in seven jobs without working past 5.30 on most
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.120]   days.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.100]   Time block planning will double the amount you're able to get done in a day or alternatively
[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.520]   cut in half the time it requires you to accomplish the work you're already doing.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.380]   So to celebrate the new edition of my planner being available, I want to do a quick review
[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.400]   of time block planning and why it works.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.540]   Then I'll show you the new features of this planner.
[00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.140]   And then I have four new pieces of advanced time blocking advice that I will share.
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.040]   So for all of you veteran time blockers out there, I have four new pieces of advice to
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.960]   offer to up your time blocking game.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.800]   All right, so what is time blocking?
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.800]   Time blocking is my approach to managing my time on the scale of days.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.320]   So if we're going to think about our deep life stack concept, this is really right in
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.680]   the core of that control layer, that layer of controlling your time so you have the space
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.720]   to think and figure out what you want to do.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.720]   How it works, and this is pretty straightforward, is during your working hours, you give every
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.920]   minute a job.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.760]   So you are blocking off the actual hours of your day into blocks that are dedicated to
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.080]   specific activities.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.200]   I'm going to pull up a screenshot here for those who are watching online.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.400]   This is actually, this is taken from the website for my planner, timeblockplanner.com.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.920]   So if you're listening, you can at your leisure go to this website and you'll see what I'm
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.920]   talking about.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.120]   Okay, so I'm at this website and I'm scrolling up here.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.240]   I want to show you a sample time block plan that's on this website.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.360]   Okay, so you should see this on the screen.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.040]   So what you'll see if you're looking on the screen over here on the right is a schedule
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.080]   that's been blocked out.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.920]   So you see from 9 to 1030, I've blocked off, drawn a block for that 90 minute interval
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.880]   and it says finish report.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.400]   From 1030 to 11, the number one is written to that block and then over here on the right,
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.880]   that number one is replicated because it's actually representing a list of small things
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.840]   to do and those things are listed under it.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.340]   Then we have an hour blocked off for client research and 90 minutes blocked off for lunch
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.560]   with Sam and a half hour blocked off for email, et cetera.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.040]   So that's a time block plan.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.320]   You're blocking off the hours of your day and giving specific tasks at specific times.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.600]   Now if you'll notice in this example I have on the screen, starting at 11, the plan is
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.920]   crossed out and in the column next to it, a new plan is written from that point down.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.320]   So that's the other key of time blocking is that if you fall off your plan, which you
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.720]   will because it's hard to estimate exactly how long things take, you just wait until
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.440]   you have a moment free and you create a new time block plan for the time that remains.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.320]   So in my planners, for example, I currently have one, two, three, four columns.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.360]   So you can march over and make a corrected time block plan three different times after
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.680]   your original plan.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.360]   So the goal is not to predict perfectly at the beginning of your day exactly how long
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.360]   things are going to take.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.200]   It is instead to have some sort of intention behind what you're doing with your time at
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.480]   any moment during the day.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.480]   So that's time block planning.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.120]   You make a plan for every hour of your day.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.680]   You have a clear shutdown for when that plan is done and then you switch from time blocking
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.920]   mode into a much more relaxed mode.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.120]   So why does time blocking work so well?
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.040]   And again, my claim with time blocking is it's two X more efficient.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.440]   You give me an amount of work.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.760]   How much time does it take you to get that work done without time blocking?
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.320]   Cut that in half if you're using time blocking.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.320]   So why does it work?
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.880]   Well, there's three things that are going on here.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.240]   One, you make a better use of your available time in a given day, right?
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.600]   Because you actually see the whole picture.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.160]   I have a meeting here, a meeting there.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.680]   Oh, there's a, this block of time in the morning maybe is more valuable than I would have realized
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.680]   if I wasn't time blocking.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.680]   Let me get started here.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.440]   Oh, I have these slivers of time between these meetings.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.320]   Let me consolidate my task.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.400]   That's the best usage of it.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.840]   So when you're considering your whole schedule for the day as a whole, and you're holistically
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.920]   saying of the different things I'm going to try to get done today, what's the right way
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.200]   to assign this work to the various free time?
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.440]   You just make better use of that free time.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.120]   Then the alternative of just saying, I don't know, I'm going through my day.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.120]   I have a to-do list.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.120]   I have my email.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.840]   I'm just sort of thinking, what should I work on next?
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.680]   You're going to, with that alternative default approach, you're going to make much less efficient
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.640]   use of the time that's available.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.200]   The second reason why time blocking works so well is that it helps you focus.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.360]   When you know, okay, at this moment, I am in a block to be working on this and this
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.460]   block last one hour, that clarity allows you to focus.
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.720]   That's what I'm doing during this hour as I'm working on this report.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.600]   And then you focus on that.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.800]   If you're working alternatively in a more ad hoc or haphazard fashion, what happens
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.320]   instead is you say, okay, I'm more or less working on this report, but why not also check
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.240]   email or why not also jump over here and work on this other thing for a while and I'll come
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.400]   back to it.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.040]   You're making a decision moment to moment of should I keep working on this?
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.040]   Should I stop?
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.040]   Should I take a break?
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.440]   Time blocking takes all those decisions out of the question.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.840]   This is what I'm doing in this current block.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.840]   Let's execute.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.020]   And the final reason why time blocking works so well is that if you do it for a while,
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.860]   you gain a much more realistic understanding of how long things actually take.
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:14.480]   And this is usually hard one wisdom because at first, some sort of reoccurring task that
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.640]   shows up in your life quite a bit, you'll probably not be giving it enough time and
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.840]   you'll have to have that painful feedback of redrawing your plan as you blow past your
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.960]   plan every time this piece of work comes up.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.920]   So over time, this feedback mechanism means you learn, oh, this really takes three hours,
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.920]   not one.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.840]   Oh, cleaning my inbox or checking my inbox.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.240]   I need a whole hour for that.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.640]   I can't put that in a half hour block with five other tasks.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.240]   So you learn through experience with clear feedback, how long things actually take.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.640]   And once you know how long things actually take, you can much better control your workload
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.160]   because you have a much more accurate assessment of how much work is really on your plate and
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.120]   you will start things at appropriate, appropriate times.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.840]   You'll say, this is harder than I think I'm going to start it a week in advance.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.800]   So by gaining this knowledge of how long things actually take, you become much more efficient
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.080]   at managing and scheduling your workload.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.640]   All right, so that's time block planning and that's why it works.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.760]   So where should you actually do time block planning?
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.440]   Well, for the last few years, I have been selling a time block planner that implements
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:22.000]   exactly the format in which I do time block planning available now for the first time
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.640]   is this second edition of the time block planner.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.240]   So if you're buying this on Amazon, make sure you're looking at the second edition, which
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.640]   has the spiral binding.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.400]   The first edition is still going to be available until that sells out.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.320]   So you want to make sure you're buying the right edition.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.040]   Let me do a quick overview of what we changed because this was just took a lot of time.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.000]   I have six different dummy planners we went through trying to get this just right.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.640]   Here's a quick reviews of what we have updated.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.280]   It is a slightly smaller trim size.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.040]   So it is smaller than 8.5 by 11.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.960]   So it's a little bit more handheld, a little bit more portable.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.040]   You can fit it into more things.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.560]   I think it feels a little thicker and it's just a better size.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.420]   It's felt more planner size to me.
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.920]   Number two, and probably the most important difference, high quality double wire spiral
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.040]   binding.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.120]   So this piece just lays completely flat open.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:20.160]   You can lie it right there next to where you're working and have it there to reference, just
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.300]   have it open to add things to your task list, have it open to see what's going on your time
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.760]   block plan.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.720]   This was the biggest request people have and it's fantastic.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.560]   I have loved having this feature.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.040]   We have a new cover with the spiral binding, sort of a nice thick material.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.440]   No more of the bending of the cover that happened with the first edition over time.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.640]   This is a good substantial cover that just lies flat, keeps this thing really solid,
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.600]   really solidly closed.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.440]   On the interior, the paper was updated.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.760]   I love the paper in the new planner.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.360]   It is optimized for my pin of choice.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.700]   So I hate to be selfish about it, but I optimized the paper for the pin I use, which is the
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:09.080]   Uniball Micro 0.5 millimeter ballpoint pen.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.960]   The paper has a little bit more absorbency than the last one.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.400]   It soaks the ink up nicely, but at this flow rate does not blot.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.600]   It's fantastic paper.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.920]   I love the paper.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:24.000]   The final thing we did is I changed how weekends are handled.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.080]   The first edition of the time block planner had full time block spreads, full time block
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.040]   grids and capture for Saturday and Sunday.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.520]   However, I typically advise people not to time block your weekends.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.800]   Time blocking is hard.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.560]   You can't be in time block mode all the time.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.760]   So to reflect that in the new planner, we now have something called weekend pages where
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.960]   what you'll see, and it's a little bit hard to see on the screen, but I'll hold it up.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.360]   It'll probably be reversed because it's the camera, but you'll see there's just a, there's
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.400]   a open space for Saturday and Sunday on the same page.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.640]   It's enough space to have a quick schedule of what you're doing those days and the metric
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.680]   track if you track metrics, and then a big capture for things to come up during the weekend
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.680]   that you can then process when you get the Monday.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.720]   This is right across from the weekly plan page.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.560]   So now you have the weekly plan page right next to your weekend planners.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:19.360]   So when you plan your week for the week ahead, you can process anything off of here and that
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.860]   weekly plan is ready to go.
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.180]   Not only is this better match how we used a planner, it saved a lot of pages.
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:30.360]   So now there is four months worth of planning in here instead of three.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.320]   So it's a full semester.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.380]   You only need three of these per year.
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:39.280]   It can match the academic calendar, sort of fall, winter, early spring, spring, summer,
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.600]   if that's the way you choose to do it.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.160]   So anyways, if you want a time block plan, you can do it however you want to do it.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.200]   I used to do this in black and red notebooks or red and black notebooks, whatever they're
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.200]   called.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.900]   But this is basically my version of time block planning.
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.040]   This was built for me.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.800]   It's exactly the format I use, the exact right paper, the exact right trim size, all of it
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.360]   right here.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.960]   You can hold this thing substantially.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.040]   It's an analog thing you can bring with you at your computer screen, away from your computer
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.040]   screen.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.080]   It's open on your dresser at home.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.200]   So if you have ideas, remember stuff, you can just jot it down on the next day's capture
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.800]   page and know you're not going to forget it.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.800]   I love it.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.400]   I love the new format.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.160]   So you can buy that at Amazon or Barnes and Noble.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.720]   But remember, it's the second edition.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.720]   All right.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.720]   So that's out.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:30.940]   I want to get four new advanced time blocking tips.
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.020]   So you'll see in my planners, I have this big long introduction in the beginning that
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.800]   explains time blocking and has some tips.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.560]   I'm adding four to it.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.880]   All right.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:46.880]   Number one, pre-block important or timely work on your calendar.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.120]   So what happens with time block planning is when you make your time block plan for the
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.260]   day, you look at your weekly plan, you look at your calendar because you're going to transfer
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:58.540]   from your calendar any meetings or appointments you have onto your time block plan.
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:04.080]   What I suggest is if something is timely or important, once you know about this thing
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:09.880]   on your radar, consider going ahead in your calendar and actually adding non-appointment,
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:16.040]   non-meeting blocks onto your calendar for when you're going to get that work done.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:21.960]   Right now, for example, I'm reviewing copy edits for my upcoming book, Slow Productivity.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.280]   It's very important and very timely.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.040]   I have a very short amount of time to turn these around.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.400]   So what I did is when I knew what date these were coming back, I actually went in advance
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.840]   and took three big blocks of time and just scheduled it on my calendar like a meeting.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.560]   And now when I got to those days, I just transfer that work over to my time block plan for the
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.560]   day.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:45.700]   So pre-blocking time, once you're in a time block discipline mindset, pre-blocking time
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.780]   is a great way to make sure that you don't, for example, over clutter your schedule in
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.440]   times when a lot is due.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.440]   All right.
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.440]   My second tip-
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.860]   >> So that's a little different than autopilot, right?
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:56.860]   >> It's different than autopilot.
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.320]   It was a good question.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.920]   Autopilot is you're pre-scheduling work that occurs on a regular basis.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:09.120]   So if you know, I always have to file a report on the last Friday of the month, you can figure
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:14.340]   out when and how you do that work and just set that repeating on your calendar into perpetuity.
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:17.340]   With pre-blocking, it's for one-off projects.
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.860]   So you're not finding a regular time to work on copy editing because it only happens once
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.360]   every few years, but you know that's really important and it's going to have a short turnaround.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.520]   So you go protect that time in advance.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:30.400]   And then because you time block, you know when you get there, that'll be safe.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.400]   All right.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.200]   Second tip, time block relaxation into your workday.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.200]   Right?
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:41.640]   So at first you might just be putting in a half hour break.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.320]   It's in your time block plan.
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.840]   And when you get there, you know, okay, I'm going to just completely turn off work.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:53.600]   But once you're in the habit of time blocking relaxation, you'll tend to get more aggressive
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.600]   about this.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:00.040]   Because see, this is the advantage of time blocking from a sustainability point of view.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.080]   A critique, which I think is flawed of this approach is that people say, well, this is
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.880]   all about just optimizing every minute of your day.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.600]   But time blocking can actually help you much better do the opposite.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.600]   Once you're in the habit of, I put breaks into my day and you have control over your
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.160]   time.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.240]   Now as your workload gets under control, you can get more aggressive about that.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.680]   And you can say things like, you know what?
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:27.320]   On Wednesday, I'm going to make very efficient use of the morning and then block off three
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.920]   and a half hours to go see Oppenheimer in the afternoon.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.200]   You can now do that with confidence because you're controlling all of your time.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.840]   So when you can control your time, not only can you get more work into your time, into
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:41.160]   your day, you can also get more relaxation the day without it causing trouble.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.840]   So just introduce the habit of many days during the week.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.920]   I put little breaks into it.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.080]   Once you have that habit, as you get to periods where your workload's a little less, you can
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:54.920]   lean into completely guilt-free, unnoticeable larger breaks.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:59.280]   And that type of variation of work pacing is something that's going to make work much
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.280]   more sustainable.
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.380]   So you're not just trying to fit in work.
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:09.280]   Use time blocks to also fit in relaxation because you can trust that relaxation is fine,
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.840]   it's scheduled, you know when the other work's going to happen, nothing bad's going to happen
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.920]   if you turn off for a while.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.180]   All right.
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:19.840]   Another advanced tip is when doing admin blocks.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.480]   So I'm a big believer of admin blocks.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.680]   I talk about this in the introductory material of the Time Block Planner.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:32.560]   For tasks, you want to have one block in which you execute multiple things, consolidate tasks.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.560]   All right.
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.440]   That's standard time blocking.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:41.520]   What I've been experimenting with recently is having smaller admin blocks, theming the
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:46.460]   admin work by cognitive context.
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:53.700]   So what I mean by that is if you have five different tasks to do that are all related
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:58.180]   to different projects or different types of work, it can be more difficult than you think
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.760]   to go one, two, three, four, five and execute those.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:06.300]   And the reason why it's difficult is because as you switch from one task type to another,
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.560]   your brain has to switch its cognitive context.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.760]   Oh, we're thinking about this type of project.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.840]   Now we have to think about like my kid's little league and some social event.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.960]   Well, that's a completely different type of context.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.760]   And you will notice the difficulty of this context switching.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:24.680]   You will notice it subjectively as a feeling of resistance, of mental fatigue.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.360]   So if you instead theme tasks so they're in the same cognitive context, what you'll realize
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.820]   is you get through them much faster.
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:36.760]   So if I'm doing four things related to social planning for the family, those four things,
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.340]   if I do them one in a row, it's going to go much more smoother because once I switch into
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:44.760]   that context, now I can do the three, four, five other tasks and it's going to come without
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.480]   that subjective resistance.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.240]   And then maybe I have another small block later with a bunch of things surrounding a
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.920]   particular type of project I'm doing for work.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:56.080]   Oh, I have a lot of things surrounding a conference I'm organizing.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.520]   Let me put a 20 minute block over here where I'm just going through a bunch of those in
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.560]   a row.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:07.560]   So shorter blocks of themed admin tasks is way more comfortable than having bigger blocks
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.300]   where you mix together different types of admin tasks.
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:15.060]   This is why the single hardest batched admin tasks that most people do on a regular basis
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.980]   is cleaning their email inbox.
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.020]   Because if you're just going through your inbox one by one, why is that so hard?
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:25.380]   Because you are switching context from message to message.
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:30.380]   So even your email inbox, you can break out into themes and say, okay, during this admin
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:36.300]   block, I'm doing some family related tasks and I'm responding to all emails related to
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.300]   family related tasks.
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.180]   And then later in the day when I'm doing tasks that are just related to this conference I'm
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:46.140]   organizing, I will then go through my inbox and handle all the emails related to that
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.140]   conference.
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.820]   And what you're going to find is those encounters with your inbox are going to go so much more
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:56.340]   smoothly because you are not behind the scenes trying to keep switching your cognitive context.
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:03.060]   All right, my fourth bit of advanced time blocking advice is whenever you put a meeting
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:09.940]   of any significant length or complexity onto your time block plan, add a short block after
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:16.460]   it for just postmortem organizing what you learned, making a plan for what to handle,
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.220]   getting the information for that meeting into your systems.
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:26.260]   Never let a interaction based time block be immediately followed by another time block
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.760]   focused on something different.
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.180]   You have to close down to work of meetings.
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.300]   You need 15 to 30 minutes to do this.
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:38.380]   Okay, the meeting is over but I have 15 to 30 protected minutes to go transform my notes
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:42.100]   and the tasks and to put reminders on the calendars and if there's follow up emails,
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.580]   let me just do them right now.
[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.860]   Now I can completely shut down that thing.
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:49.260]   I don't have a ton of open loops hanging in my head as I jump from this meeting to the
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.260]   next.
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.080]   I don't have a ton of open loops in my head as I jump from this meeting right into trying
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.300]   to do deep work.
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.220]   So that should just be instinct.
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:00.460]   When you write a meeting time block, you put another block under it and you can even just
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.380]   I'll sometimes just shade it in.
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:08.580]   This little shaded in block under each of my meetings and that's the catch your breath,
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.860]   process everything that just happened in that meeting.
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.660]   Again it's going to make the whole day go smoother.
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:18.580]   That extra 15 or 20 minutes after every meeting makes the whole rest of the day actually make
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:19.580]   sense.
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.580]   All right.
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.580]   So that's my-
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:22.580]   >> That's the same concept.
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:23.580]   >> No, go ahead.
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.500]   >> That's the same concept that you always suggested with students and answering all
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.540]   their questions like after a lecture and stuff.
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.100]   >> Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.100]   Right.
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:36.500]   I used to recommend the same thing for students that when you're taking notes in lecture,
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.980]   you clearly mark everything you didn't fully understand.
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.380]   And as soon as lecture is over, you see how many of these things can I resolve?
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:47.420]   I mean, I guess the first- so this is from my book, How to Become a Strategist Student.
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:51.780]   And I say there's multiple lines of defense for filling in these question marks.
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.300]   The first line of defense is you ask questions right away.
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.460]   Wait, I didn't get that.
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.460]   Can you say that again?
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.820]   The second line of defense is you go up to the professor right after class.
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:01.820]   I don't understand this.
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.260]   Can you explain it to me?
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:10.580]   The third line of defense is some combination of TAs, textbooks, office hours, and asking
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.580]   classmates.
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.660]   And the key is do that as soon as possible.
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:18.340]   Do not let the questions- don't let the questions just sit there as I don't understand this
[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:19.340]   math technique.
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.860]   I guess I'll deal with that when I'm studying for the test a month from now.
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:23.860]   Close that down.
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.060]   You want to try to close down and consolidate your understanding of lectures as soon as
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.500]   possible after you encounter the lecture.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.500]   So this is kind of similar.
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.260]   If you have a meeting, process everything related to it right away.
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:37.100]   Don't just let that sit and maybe tomorrow I'll remember what to do about it.
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:41.980]   Closing loops I think is really important for having sustainable cognitive work.
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:45.860]   All right, so that's time block planning.
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.860]   Good to revisit it.
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:48.860]   Enjoy the time block planner.
[00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:52.860]   If you want to find out more, I have a website, timeblockplanner.com.
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:57.300]   That has a video where I really go through and show you a lot of examples of exactly
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.300]   how time blocking works.
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:02.940]   You can go watch that video there and it has links to where to buy the second edition from
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:03.940]   Amazon.
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.900]   But I'm just- look, whether or not anyone buys it, and a lot of people are, but whether
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:13.140]   or not anyone buys this, I am so happy to have it because it is just a perfected tool
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:18.140]   for exactly this method of time management that I have so long sworn by.
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.860]   All right, so here's our plan for the rest of the episode.
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:24.580]   I have a bunch of questions to get to that one way or the other all have some relation
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.140]   to time block planning and time management.
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:32.700]   And then after that, we have a something interesting segment where it's actually going to react
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:39.900]   to a news article that, believe it or not, somehow connects Oppenheimer to digital distraction.
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:40.900]   So stay tuned for that.
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.020]   I think that is going to be interesting.
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:49.860]   But first I want to mention a brand new sponsor of the Deep Questions podcast.
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.500]   And that is our friends at MOSH, M-O-S-H.
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:22:00.460]   And in particular, I want to talk about the MOSH Bar.
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:06.300]   So with six delicious flavors, each MOSH Bar includes 12 grams of protein and is made with
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:12.740]   ingredients that support brain health like ashwagandha, lion's mane, collagen, and omega
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:13.740]   threes.
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:18.180]   It's 160 calories per bar, but only one gram of sugar.
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:23.500]   So MOSH protein bars are the guilt-free snack your brain and body will crave.
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:27.220]   You know, Jesse, I ate through all the ones they sent me almost immediately because these
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.220]   taste great.
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:32.060]   Like let's put aside the fact that they're sugar-free and they have a lot of protein
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.440]   and they're supporting cognition.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.820]   They taste really good.
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:40.020]   It's a mixture of soft and crunchy, which I love.
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.140]   And the flavors are really great.
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:49.260]   The way I think about these type of bars is if I am in a busy time block day, I'm going
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.900]   from thing to thing, taking advantage of my time block schedule.
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:57.960]   And I know that I need a little bit of energy recharge to keep myself from crashing.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.700]   The MOSH Bar is exactly the type of thing I want to grab.
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.340]   Tastes great, bunch of protein, no sugar to crash you.
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:07.900]   You have some lion's mane or omega threes in there, and you're able to keep that cognitive
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.840]   energy going.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:15.420]   This is an interesting backstory on these bars.
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:22.160]   They were founded, so this company was founded by Patrick Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.480]   So MOSH is actually a mission-driven brain health and wellness company that donates a
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:31.900]   portion of all proceeds to support women's brain research through the women's Alzheimer's
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.700]   movement at Cleveland Clinic.
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:42.320]   So you also have, there's a little bit of social action built in to this company, but
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.600]   essentially this is a great choice if you want to have a snack you don't feel guilty
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.960]   about to keep your brain operating as you move through a hard schedule.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:54.480]   So don't settle for a mediocre snack when you can nourish your body and mind with the
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.440]   fuel it needs to succeed.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.640]   So whether you're at the gym, on the go, or just living your best life, MOSH protein bars
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.920]   will keep your brain and body fit, fueled, and feeling good.

[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:33.480]   I also want to talk about our longtime friends at 80,000 Hours.
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:40.760]   80,000 Hours is a nonprofit that aims to help people find careers that aim at solving the
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:44.840]   world's most pressing problems.
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.920]   People know, my longtime readers and listeners know, I'm not a big fan of simply telling
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.440]   people follow your passion.
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:56.000]   If you just follow your passion, you'll love your job and you'll live happily ever after.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.720]   Careers are more complicated than that.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:02.000]   And the philosophy of 80,000 Hours is what you could do with your working life instead
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.040]   of just following your passion is actually use the 80,000 Hours the average person is
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:15.000]   going to spend at work to make as much positive impact as possible on the world.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.560]   This is what 80,000 Hours does.
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:20.440]   It is a nonprofit that aims to help you find a career that is both fulfilling but also
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:23.680]   makes a big positive difference.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.040]   They have done over 10 years of research along academics at Oxford University into how to
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:32.520]   find a fulfilling career that does a maximum amount of good.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.600]   I've known these guys for a long time.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:39.760]   80,000 Hours got started right around the time I published my career book, So Good They
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:40.760]   Can't Ignore You.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.160]   So we've had conversations.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.160]   I've known philosophers there at Oxford and the people at 80,000 Hours.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.760]   I've known them for a decade now and they really are locked in.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:54.000]   How can you use your career to do as much good as possible?
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.200]   Now there's a few different things.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:01.240]   If you go to their, there's a few different things you can get by going to their website,
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:05.720]   which is 80,000hours.org/deep.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:13.500]   So 80,000, which is spelled out as the numbers, 8-0-0-0-0-hours.org/deep.
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:18.720]   If you go to your website, they have all sorts of articles about how to find the most important,
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.720]   impactful job, things to look at, how that actually works.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:27.120]   You'll also learn there about their newsletter, fantastic way to get this information sent
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.120]   to your inbox.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:33.320]   You can find out they have a job board there that can help you directly find impactful
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:37.040]   jobs and you can learn about their podcast in which they bring on some of the world's
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.520]   smartest thinkers and get into really deep conversations.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.160]   I really recommend their podcast a lot.
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:49.800]   So just go to 80,000hours.org/deep, that's 80,000hours.org/deep to learn more about how
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:53.520]   to use your career to make a big difference.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.920]   All right, let's move on to some questions.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:01.080]   Jesse, I think all the questions we've chosen today have at least a tangential connection
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.880]   to time blocking or time management.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:09.960]   So let's get our productivity geeks hats out and put on and get rolling here.
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.560]   So what's our first question?
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.560]   Here we go.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.760]   First question is from Piyumi.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:21.360]   I live my day using time blocking combined with autopilot scheduling for my mornings.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.880]   Every morning I do two hours of my work on my research.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.880]   Sometimes, however, I have to stay up late and I miss my morning blocks.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.800]   I want to know how to deal with these setbacks.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:35.600]   I feel guilty for the whole day for not executing my autopilot schedule because I slept in.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:41.160]   Well, we have two different related concepts to differentiate here.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:45.080]   I think that's going to help you find a solution.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:50.480]   So autopilot scheduling, which is what you referenced in your question here, is where
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:58.800]   for regularly occurring work, you have a set time on a set day and typically a set location
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.120]   for which you do that work.
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:06.680]   The whole idea is to take the decision of working on this out of your day to day decision
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.680]   making process.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.560]   It's just there on your calendar.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:13.880]   Tuesdays at 10, I go to this library and work on my problem set.
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.320]   That's just when I do that.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.600]   So that's autopilot scheduling.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.680]   Now what you're doing is maybe not exactly autopilot scheduling.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:24.680]   What you're trying to do is start each morning with two hours of research.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:30.080]   So it feels like an autopilot schedule because like, oh, it's work I do on the same, the
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.720]   same time every day.
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:38.920]   But I would say what you're really doing instead is what we might call a heuristic autopilot.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:46.720]   So a heuristic autopilot is not a calendar appointment that is set to show up on a regular
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.360]   basis and you treat like any other calendar appointment, like a dentist appointment or
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.360]   a meeting.
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.560]   A heuristic autopilot is a rule.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.680]   It's something you're going to write down on the top of your weekly plan.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:03.560]   For example, a rule that you think about when you're creating your schedule for each day.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:07.880]   So I think what you're really doing here is you have the heuristic autopilot that says
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:14.060]   when possible, spend the first hour or two of each day working on research.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:19.640]   So some days that's not possible because you you're up late and you have to sleep in, but
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.720]   you're not violating an appointment on your schedule.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.440]   So if this was an actual appointment on your schedule, this was a true autopilot schedule.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:29.940]   You would treat this like a real appointment, like a meeting with your boss and you wouldn't
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:31.640]   say to your boss, yeah, sorry, I didn't show up.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.640]   I slept in.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.740]   You would have to go to that.
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.200]   But what you're doing here is more flexible.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.460]   So that's why I call it a heuristic.
[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:41.040]   It's a general rule for how you get a certain thing done.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:46.840]   Another example of a heuristic autopilot is sometimes when I'm deep in the problem solving
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.600]   phase of a theoretical computer science paper, I'll have a heuristic that says, okay, the
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:56.320]   drive to work every day for the next week to the extent possible, use that to think
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.480]   about the problem.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.240]   It's not something that's on my calendar.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.440]   When I actually drive to work might differ based on the days, but it's a heuristic.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.800]   Keep this rule in mind each day when you're planning out your day.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.080]   Another heuristic autopilot.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.720]   Sometimes I have a lot of tasks that are floating around for something that's coming up.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:20.000]   I'll say 20 minutes every day dedicated only to working through tasks related to this upcoming
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   thing.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   That's a heuristic autopilot.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.480]   And then when I get to each day, I'll say, okay, I have to find where this is going to
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.720]   fit, but I'm going to try to find 20 minutes where I can work on tasks and try to do that
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.720]   every day this week.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.840]   So I think that's going to help you here.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.640]   You really have a heuristic, not a hard autopilot schedule.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.840]   And once you know that you shouldn't be so worried that occasionally you don't get to
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.920]   do research in the morning.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.400]   What matters is you're following a heuristic rule of when there's time in the morning you
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.080]   do.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:50.980]   Now if you find that you're almost never actually applying this rule, that almost always you're
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.680]   sleeping in too late to get this research done.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.160]   Well then you need to change something, right?
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.600]   That's no longer a good heuristic.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.200]   You need to change where the research happens or you need to change your habits so you're
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.200]   not sleeping in.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.200]   That's possible.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.460]   But if what we're talking about here is once a week, you don't do morning research the
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:10.040]   other four days you do, I think it's a perfectly fine example of a heuristic autopilot schedule.
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:13.160]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:19.400]   Is that similar to when you were in writing mode last summer, you would write?
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.400]   Was that heuristic?
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.400]   Or was it a little different?
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.600]   No, I think that's a fair point.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.820]   Last summer when I was writing slow productivity, it was, you know, try to write first thing
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:32.920]   before we go out and do activities, you know, try to write first thing every day if possible.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.600]   And we were on vacation.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:38.820]   So last summer, we were up in Vermont, the Mad River Valley.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.960]   Some days it was look, we got to get going early in the morning because we're taking
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.760]   the family out to see something as a couple hours away.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.920]   And I just want to write that day.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:46.920]   But it was okay.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.640]   The default is try to just write every morning.
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.480]   And Julie was understood that schedule.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.240]   So she's a lot of mornings like, yeah, we might go do something in the morning, I might
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:58.240]   take the boys to do something brief before we do our larger trip.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.800]   And you're right, it was a heuristic.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.980]   And I couldn't do it every day.
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:03.880]   But most days I tried to write first thing.
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.560]   So that was a heuristic autopilot schedule.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:10.240]   And again, yeah, it's very different than these days, these hours, this location, I'm
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.200]   always doing this work.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.200]   Okay.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.520]   All right, moving on.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.780]   What do we have next?
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.960]   Next question is from Moritz.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:26.520]   You say that a defining feature of slow productivity is that no one day or hour is critical.
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:30.640]   How do you reconcile that with the urgency implicit in time blocking?
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.320]   Well, I think it is a good question.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:40.760]   It seems like a contradiction, but it's actually really core to thinking about slow productivity
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.120]   and multi-scale planning.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:48.440]   So time blocking, Moritz is absolutely right here, generates urgency.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:52.380]   I have a time block schedule, I need to stick to the schedule.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:57.540]   If this is the block I'm in, and this is how much time I have, I want to try to focus intensely
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:00.040]   to get this work done in the time I have.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:05.920]   This is why time blocking leads to such a large increase in efficiency, because it's
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.480]   really focusing your attention and it does feel very urgent.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:12.880]   Meanwhile, the defining feature of slow productivity, as Moritz says, is this sense of if I was
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:16.280]   sick tomorrow, it's not a big deal.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.720]   No one day is urgent.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:22.080]   What matters is I'm making regular progress on something important, and that will add
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.160]   up over time to a really big accomplishment.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.520]   It doesn't matter if this week I was doing something else, so long as most weeks I am
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.120]   making progress on it.
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:33.440]   It sounds like a contradiction, but I actually think they fit together quite well, because
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:41.840]   what this is saying is when you choose to work, do that work with urgent efficiency.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:46.120]   So from the slow productivity scale, that means, okay, if I'm going to write today,
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.480]   when you write, block that off and write intensely.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.480]   Give it your full concentration.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.720]   Then when you're done, be done.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.880]   And if I'm not going to write today because something came up or I'm not feeling well,
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.300]   which is slow productivity says is perfectly fine, then you're just not putting aside any
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.320]   time to write, and that's fine as well.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.640]   So really what the urgency of time blocking is saying is not that you should always be
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:08.040]   urgent, but that if you're going to work, work with focus.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:11.460]   If you're going to work, work with urgency.
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:12.460]   Do it all out.
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:13.460]   Be done when you're done.
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:16.600]   Now, when you work and how much you work and what you work on, those are all decisions
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:20.480]   that slow productivity can help you make more sustainably.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:24.840]   This is why, for example, I say time block relaxation, have some days be shorter than
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:25.840]   others.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:29.360]   Don't time block your weekends, because when you're executing a time block schedule, you're
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.760]   executing with intensity and urgency, and that can get draining after a while.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.200]   So you want to use this tool.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.720]   You want to use it carefully and make sure that it's balanced off with non-time blocking
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:38.720]   time.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.720]   But I don't think there's any scenario.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:43.840]   If we flip this around, I don't think there's any scenario where it makes sense to say when
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:49.880]   you work, do so haphazardly and without intention.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:52.760]   That's not going to make you feel more relaxed.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.120]   It's going to make your work take longer.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:59.240]   It's going to make your work feel more stressful because you can't get your arm around everything.
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:04.640]   It is not going to make you more relaxed to have a more relaxed attitude to the execution
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:05.640]   of work.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.960]   And then maybe that's paradoxical, but it's not really.
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:11.280]   So being very structured and intentional about when you work, when you work actually can
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:18.400]   support much better at larger scales, a more natural pacing, up, downs, up periods and
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:22.240]   down periods, busy weeks and non-busy weeks, busy days, non-busy days.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:28.080]   So the urgency in the moment, I think, allows for more peace and relaxation over the long
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.080]   haul.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.080]   All right.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:34.840]   What do we got next, Jesse?
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.880]   Next question is from John.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:42.040]   How would you suggest consuming internet articles mindfully as a busy working parent?
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:48.080]   I don't use social media and I try to time block my consumption to 1.5 hours in the evenings,
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.800]   three evenings a week.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.480]   There's so much high value content coming in every day.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:57.440]   I can't keep up with these blocks and the growing list of unread articles in my queue
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.400]   stresses me out.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.720]   Well, John, maybe this won't surprise you.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.680]   I think Jesse knows probably what I'm going to say.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:14.960]   I'm going to say you don't need to spend four to five hours a week reading internet articles.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:21.680]   And what I would suggest is let's take a 30-day exercise here, a 30-day exercise where you
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.920]   essentially read no internet articles.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:24.920]   All right.
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:28.320]   This is an experiment I'm going to suggest that you do.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:34.080]   So if you want to keep up with the news, listen to a news summary podcast, that's fine.
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.800]   And you can keep listening to podcasts.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.800]   That's fine.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.120]   Like when you're driving somewhere or walking, you can listen to interesting podcasts like
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.120]   ours.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.160]   That's fine.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.200]   But don't read any articles.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:48.400]   No social media posts that have gone viral, no New York Times piece that a lot of people
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.160]   are emailing around.
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.560]   Just I'm not reading internet content.
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:58.000]   Listen to podcasts when I have free time and put that energy instead towards reading stuff
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.800]   that's less current, reading books, spending time and going slower with deeper ideas that
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.360]   have been more thought through.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.160]   Here's what I think you're going to find after 30 days.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:12.720]   You are absolutely fine having not read all those four hours or five hours a week of online
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.480]   time.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.560]   That you're informed enough and you don't need all these other takes, that you're less
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:23.840]   stressed, that you're more relaxed, and that your brain actually feels much more improved
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:29.360]   having spent time instead with the slow consumption of media.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:34.400]   Spending a whole week just reading one book and just enjoying one idea and thinking it
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.400]   through.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:39.520]   I mean, I think the issue here, the issue here that we're combating, this is very common
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:43.840]   mindset that I think John is expressing quite clearly.
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:49.520]   This very common mindset that we need to be fast consumers of many multifaceted streams
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.240]   of information.
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:56.800]   And I reject that as actually being fundamental to having a fulfilling and effective intellectual
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.080]   life.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:01.680]   Now if we look to someone like Neil Postman, a cultural critic like Neil Postman, we'll
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.080]   see warnings about this.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:08.080]   What does Neil Postman argue, for example, in Amusing Ourselves to Death?
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:15.960]   He says the dominant media technologies of a given era will change the way we conceive
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.960]   of cognition.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:21.480]   It will change the way we conceive of our place in a information landscape.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.100]   And this is exactly what's happening now.
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:31.480]   Social media platforms and the online attention economy more generally is built on this idea
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.640]   of high velocity of content.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:37.440]   High velocity of interesting content is what keeps people engaged, is what allows them
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:41.240]   to show more advertisements to you and to gather more data about you.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:45.000]   And so as we shift to that media landscape, we changed our conception of what it means
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.160]   to be a consumer of information.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.760]   We say, well, this is what it means to be a consumer of information.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.640]   You have all these fragmented constant streams of information.
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:57.440]   It's like you're a producer at a news program that has to constantly be checking on all
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:01.600]   the wire services to see what breaking news is happening, what you need to know.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:08.240]   But you go back even 25 years and this would be seen as idiosyncratic and eccentric.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.960]   Why are you jumping around to all these articles?
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.400]   This is not how we consume information.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:16.120]   We see the daily news and read books.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:20.460]   And so keep in mind this thought that I have to keep up with all this fragmented streams
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:21.600]   of information.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:26.760]   That is an artifact of particular tools that were introduced in the last 10 to 15 years
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:29.120]   as more effective ways to sell advertisements.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.120]   Ignore that.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:36.120]   I think you're going to be perfectly happy and comfortable returning to a prior generation's
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:43.320]   understanding of information, which is slower, better, and more consolidated.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.040]   I read a book.
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:51.920]   I just took in the news of the day from one source, a newspaper, a news podcast.
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:56.280]   Instead of reading 10 articles, I listened to one 90-minute podcast.
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:58.240]   So slower but better.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:05.920]   Slow media consumption is what we did until essentially a minute ago as consumers of media.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.320]   So you'll be completely fine returning to it.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.320]   So do this experiment, John.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.720]   And I think you'll find, "Oh, I don't need to be looking at all this internet information
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:12.720]   anyways."
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.000]   And you are going to be more relaxed.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.300]   You're going to feel less cataclysmic.
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.880]   You're going to feel less as if everything's falling apart.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.880]   You're going to feel just your heart rate start to settle.
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:27.920]   And your brain's going to wake up to, "Oh, I really like devouring information carefully
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:28.920]   and slowly.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.400]   This is a little bit more comfortable for my neural apparatus."
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.960]   So try this experiment.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.560]   I think you're going to find a slower, better approach to media consumption to be something
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:42.440]   that is much better, a much better experience for you.
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.000]   What about New Yorker articles?
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.320]   New Yorker articles are good.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.320]   I like that.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:54.440]   You follow my rule of at least one article from each week's magazine.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.000]   Hard copy or internet, doesn't matter.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.560]   You can read it online, right?
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:00.960]   Yeah, you can do it either way.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.920]   Subscribe to the hard copy if you can.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:09.120]   Otherwise, if you're a subscriber, so now I'm in promotion mode, Jesse, because I just
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.000]   upped my contract for another year to be a contributor at the New Yorker.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.440]   So now I'm sales mode.
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:19.520]   If you're a subscriber, you can sign up for an email that says, "This week in the magazine."
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:22.760]   And it shows you, "Here's the articles in the magazine," and you can, all linked.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:24.240]   So you can read them online.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:28.720]   And the other thing you need to follow is anytime I publish an article.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:32.040]   And when I publish an article, you should read that and share it.
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:36.080]   And I don't want to put too much of a burden on you, but share it with like 700 or 800
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.300]   of your closest friends.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:42.540]   And demand that they read it a couple times from different browsers so that it registers
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:44.880]   as unique reads.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:45.880]   I'm joking about that.
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:49.880]   Actually, I have no idea how many times each of my articles get read.
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.680]   It's one of the great things about the New Yorker is it's just write the best article
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.400]   you can that you're interested in.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.640]   And we're happy that you did that.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:42:00.040]   You don't even, there's no discussion of what was your readership number.
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:04.320]   But anyways, slow media, better, slower.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.320]   It really is.
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.320]   It's just a nicer way.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:10.800]   I mean, could you imagine Jesse, four hours a week of just constant short articles?
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:14.680]   I mean, that must be 500 articles.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:15.680]   I don't know.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.680]   Could you imagine?
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:20.560]   Because online stuff is so short and the skim is so massive.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:25.200]   Well, I think it, when I first read that, I love that question, by the way.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:31.760]   When I first read it, I was thinking, oh, I read some of the New Yorker articles online
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:35.420]   and that can take an hour or whatever, depending on how long it is.
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:37.240]   Like that Gagosian one was like 20 pages.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.440]   I read that hard copy, but whatever.
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:44.800]   So I didn't know he was necessarily talking about short articles because you could read
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:47.120]   a lot of long form stuff too.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.120]   But it's right.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.200]   I mean, it could go up.
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:54.720]   I think a good long form strategy, I think the mindset that John has, which is common
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.320]   right now, is this breadth mindset.
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:01.080]   I need to read everything that's interesting to me.
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:02.080]   And I like the depth mindset.
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:07.600]   So if you just choose a, let's say you choose a magazine, I choose the New Yorker.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.200]   You're like, I want to read one really good article a week.
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.320]   This is not a strategy of, I want to make sure I've read everything good and interesting
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.320]   that came out this week.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:18.940]   It's a strategy of, I want to have the experience of reading a really good article each week.
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:21.120]   It's not focused on breadth, it's focused on depth.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.960]   So you could pick another magazine.
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:30.460]   Maybe you're a Harper's person or maybe you're more into fiction and so it's like McSweeney's
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:33.320]   or something or whatever it is.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:34.800]   But maybe you pick a publication.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:41.080]   I want to just take one article, I'm going to print it and sit outside and spend 30 minutes
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.960]   and read it once a week.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:43.960]   That's a depth strategy.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:48.840]   You're like, I want to make sure I encounter multiple great things each week.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.480]   And it's a very different mindset than, I want to make sure that I read everything that
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:52.800]   could potentially be interesting.
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:58.280]   And again, social media, I think, changed our culture to create that media landscape
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:02.280]   in part because the form of social media is many things coming at you.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:08.840]   But also in part is that the way that it subtly monetizes information.
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:14.920]   So even if you were not a professional social media influencer, it changes your relationship
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:19.900]   to information of, I want to stockpile as many interesting ideas and articles and takes
[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:23.120]   as I can because that's valuable because I could be posting that and I could be getting
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.420]   likes for that.
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:29.820]   And it gives us this idea of, you want to accumulate interesting ideas and links as
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:31.820]   you would gold as a prospector.
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:34.280]   And the slow media consumption model is very different.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:39.260]   This is what you're prioritizing is not stockpiling as many interesting takes as possible.
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:44.480]   It's having as many experiences of deep encounters with ideas as possible.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:50.620]   And a deep encounter with an idea might be you're reading a 7,000 word New Yorker piece
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:51.620]   and it takes you an hour.
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:56.140]   And it's one article you read, but it's not the amount of content that matters.
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:45:01.300]   It's the duration of this experience of having a deep encounter with something.
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:02.300]   Yep.
[00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:07.140]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:08.700]   Next question is from Nate.
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:11.380]   I'm trying to implement time block planning.
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:16.380]   It works to some degree, but I often find myself struggling to really stick to my plan.
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:20.700]   The reality is I have no short time deadlines or people checking on my progress.
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:25.660]   So it's hard to mentally give my plan binding force when there are no consequences for not
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:27.140]   sticking to it.
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:32.020]   Well, this is one of the other advantages of time block planning that I actually didn't
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:36.700]   list this in the opening segment, but I think it's really critical.
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:41.420]   It consolidates where you need discipline.
[00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:45.180]   So if you're not using time block planning, if you just have a to-do list and, "Hey, what
[00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:47.700]   should I work on and try to make progress on things?"
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:54.460]   You have a independent disciplined relationship with all the different type of work you do.
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:59.620]   So maybe you're pretty successful at answering questions from your boss.
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:02.740]   Okay, so when you're telling yourself, "I want to go answer questions from my boss,"
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:06.260]   because you don't want to disappoint her, you're thinking, "Okay, I'm pretty disciplined
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:07.260]   in doing that."
[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:12.460]   But when it comes to working on a long-term optional project that over time might really
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:17.460]   help your career, but no one's forcing you to do it, you may find that your disciplined
[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:20.820]   relationship with that type of work is much worse because you keep saying, "Look, it doesn't
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:25.500]   matter if I don't do it today," and it sort of feels good to procrastinate on it.
[00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:30.540]   Time block planning consolidates all of that discipline to a single decision.
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.960]   Do I follow my time block plan or not?
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.420]   That's the single decision you have to make.
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:40.740]   Am I someone who follows my time block plan or do I not?
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:44.220]   And once you have trained yourself, and we'll get to that in a second how to do that, but
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:50.040]   once you have trained yourself to reliably follow your time block plan to the best of
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:55.980]   your abilities, you now get to apply that developed discipline on all the different
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:59.460]   type of work you do because blocks are agnostic.
[00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:02.540]   So this block might be answering emails from your boss, this block might be working on
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:05.620]   this really big project, this block might be exercising.
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:06.860]   You just execute your blocks.
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:11.940]   You do not have to have a separate conversation with yourself, a separate negotiation with
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.980]   yourself for each of these different activities.
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:18.200]   The only negotiation you had is I'm a time blocker or I'm not.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.860]   So it focuses your disciplined efforts.
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:23.540]   Now when you're focusing your discipline on one thing, following a time block plan or
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:27.180]   not, it's much easier to train and develop.
[00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:30.020]   There's just this one habit that you're trying to actually develop.
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:31.640]   And how do you actually train it?
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.220]   Get a physical time block plan.
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:36.360]   You can use my planner, use whatever, your own notebook.
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:39.200]   Have a physical artifact for your time block plans.
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:44.140]   Have a simple metric that you track every day right there on top of your plan.
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:49.580]   So if you're using my time block planner, here I'll show this on the screen, every day
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:53.140]   has a metric tracking space at the top.
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:58.460]   Just have a simple metric like TB checkmark or something like this or TBX.
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:03.940]   We put TB checkmark if you more or less followed your time block plan and TBX if you didn't.
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:07.320]   Or a checkmark in a circle if you followed your time block plan and X in a circle if
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.380]   you didn't.
[00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:13.260]   And just have this simple bit of clear feedback.
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:14.960]   So you have a, here's where I do the time blocking.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:15.960]   This is with me every day.
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:16.960]   It's by my desk.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.920]   And every day I put an X or a checkmark.
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:20.920]   That's a real quick way.
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:25.940]   That feedback, that sensory feedback will probably be enough for you to pretty quickly
[00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.780]   develop the habit of I want to put down the checkmark each day.
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:29.780]   It's not that hard to do.
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:31.380]   Okay, let me just follow this stupid plan.
[00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.500]   You do that for a couple of weeks, you'll probably be good at this.
[00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.060]   This is no, this technique I'm telling you here is nothing special.
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:39.100]   This is just pure James Clear atomic habits.
[00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:41.420]   You make it easier, right?
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:42.420]   Here's my planner.
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:43.780]   This is just for time block planning.
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:45.660]   It's always next to me.
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:46.980]   And you find a little bit of feedback.
[00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:50.780]   So you have some sort of tactile feedback, drawing an X or drawing a checkmark.
[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:55.140]   So you get that bit of feedback and then you just let our brains habit apparatus go loose
[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:57.100]   and you'll develop that discipline.
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:01.300]   But because you're only focusing on one thing, you're really getting a huge bang for your
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:02.300]   buck.
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:05.500]   This one talk about atomic habits, this one habit I time block.
[00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:10.380]   If at all possible, I follow my time block plan is going to explode into so many other
[00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:11.380]   things.
[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:15.380]   It's going to unlock everything else you want to do because you can put these different
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:19.780]   initiatives into your time block plan and know they'll get executed.
[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:24.540]   So I'm going to reject the premise, Nate, that you know, you're just bad at sticking
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:25.620]   with plans.
[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:28.880]   Train that, train that carefully.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:33.900]   It is worth the effort because everything else good, or at least I should say so many
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:37.560]   other good things are going to follow if you become someone who actually sticks with their
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:38.560]   time block plan.
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:43.180]   We call this sometimes meta productivity habits, a single habit that leads to many other habits
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:44.740]   that are very useful.
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:49.140]   So train that targeted discipline and a lot of good will come from it.
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:55.780]   All right, I think we have time for one more question.
[00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:56.780]   >> Sounds good.
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:58.460]   We have a question from Matt.
[00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:03.420]   As a software engineer utilizing dozens of tools at my fingertips all day and every day,
[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:07.780]   I need clarification about the strange dichotomy displayed in your podcast.
[00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:12.580]   How can you be a computer science professor yet not so savvy with the technologies used
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:13.980]   for your podcast?
[00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:17.740]   Not to mention the fact that you use a paper planner for time blocking?
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:23.500]   >> Well, I included this question so that I could compare myself again to Robert Oppenheimer.
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:30.020]   So okay, let's go back, go back in and watch Oppenheimer or read American Prometheus, the
[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:31.020]   biography.
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:32.020]   And what are you going to see?
[00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:36.780]   In physics, there was two big groups, right?
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:42.820]   So there was the theorist, this was Oppenheimer, he was the leader of theoretical quantum physics.
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:48.540]   And then you had the experimentalist as personified in the movie with Josh Hartnett's portrayal
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:52.940]   of Lawrence at Berkeley, who built the first cyclotron and actually builds things.
[00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:55.960]   Well, computer science has that same split.
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:51:00.780]   There's the theorist who sit there with pencil and paper and whiteboards and do theory on
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:05.780]   what's possible or not possible with computers that do theory on the expected performance
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:07.900]   of a particular algorithm.
[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:10.220]   We don't use computers, we do math.
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:12.220]   We do applied mathematics.
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:16.340]   So I am the Oppenheimer side in computer science.
[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:19.060]   I'm on the Oppenheimer side, not the Lawrence side.
[00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:23.380]   So this is why I'm bad at technologies is I'm essentially a glorified math person.
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:27.900]   And when you train in the theory group at MIT, you use your computers to write up your
[00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:28.900]   papers and that's it.
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:32.100]   We don't touch compilers, we don't write code.
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:35.700]   To a computer scientist, even a systems computer scientist, and this is something people often
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:41.180]   get wrong, computer programming, for example, is to a computer science what microscopes
[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:42.180]   are to a biologist.
[00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:45.460]   Oh, it's a useful tool.
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:49.380]   But to say, oh, computer science is about being a computer programmers, like going up
[00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:52.540]   to a biologist, like, oh, so you're like a microscope technician, you're really good
[00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:57.180]   at focusing and using microscopes, like, no, I understand how organisms work.
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:01.100]   So this is why I'm not great at technology, because I'm a Oppenheimer style, theoretical
[00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:02.100]   computer scientist.
[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:07.820]   You know, again, between me and Oppenheimer, we have had a big impact on the world if you
[00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:11.500]   sort of average out all of her contributions.
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:18.260]   But why do I, I want to separate out why do I use a paper planner for my time block planning?
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:20.960]   It simply works better.
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:25.020]   So as we just talked about in the last question, so moving away from computer science, just
[00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:27.620]   talking about time block planning.
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:33.140]   The atomic habit of productivity that's going to unlock so many others is I am a time blocking
[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:35.300]   person I follow my plan I make for the day.
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:40.260]   And if you're going to do this, it is very, very helpful to have a dedicated artifact
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:42.180]   that is only for planning.
[00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:46.780]   So that you can just have this artifact with you wherever you go, you can open it at your
[00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:50.300]   desk, it's not an app or something on your computer that you might or might turn off
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:54.940]   like any other app or thing you might turn or might or might not turn off is a dedicated
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:58.780]   special purpose artifact and it fits right there in front of you, you're signaling to
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:00.540]   yourself this is something I do.
[00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:03.820]   If you're instead saying, well, you know, I have some tool on my computer, you're like,
[00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:06.380]   I have a ton of tools on my computer.
[00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:09.420]   And yes, I'm not using this one right now, just like I'm not using this one right now,
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:10.780]   it doesn't get to your core identity.
[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:16.900]   But if you own this thing, here's a specialized notebook I use for time blocking, it signals
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:19.420]   to yourself, I'm someone who time blocks.
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:25.180]   And these little psychological differences matter, and it makes you more likely to develop
[00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:28.940]   that atomic habit of sticking to your time block plan, whatever it is.
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:30.100]   So there's two parts of my answer.
[00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:33.060]   Part number one, yeah, I'm bad at technology because I'm a theoretician.
[00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:37.020]   I'm Oppenheimer, more or less.
[00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:39.620]   The second part of it is why time block plan with a planner.
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:44.300]   And I would say even if I was a Lawrence character, even if I was a hacker, even if I wrote compilers
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:47.860]   and wrote code all day, I would still use a paper planner for time block planning, because
[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:50.260]   I want to signal to myself, I take this seriously.
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:55.260]   And it's very, very important that my mind thinks of myself as a disciplined time block
[00:53:55.260 --> 00:54:00.660]   planner because so much else is made available by that single decision.
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:04.980]   All right, so that's questions.
[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:07.980]   I want to move on to a final segment here.
[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:12.060]   Before I do, let me briefly mention another longtime sponsor of the show.
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:16.060]   And that is our friends at ExpressVPN.
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:22.020]   So here's the thing, when you access the internet, the site or service you're using to access
[00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:24.980]   the internet sees who you're talking to.
[00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:29.180]   So if you're connecting to a wireless access point at a coffee shop, anyone nearby with
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:33.260]   the right software can read the packets you're sending to that access point out of the air
[00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:37.220]   and see exactly what websites you're talking to.
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:43.900]   If you're at home connected through a cable modem, the cable company sees exactly what
[00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:45.140]   websites you're talking to.
[00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:46.260]   And you know what?
[00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:50.580]   You better believe they gather and sell that data to profile you and your interests.
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:55.660]   So if that makes you uneasy, and it makes me uneasy, you need to use a VPN.
[00:54:55.660 --> 00:55:00.340]   So what happens with a VPN is that instead of connecting directly to a site or service
[00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:06.380]   you want to use, you instead connect to a VPN server.
[00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:11.220]   And you tell that VPN server in an encrypted body of your packet, here's who I really want
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.220]   to talk to.
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:17.100]   And that VPN server talks to that site or service on your behalf, encrypts the response,
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:18.960]   and then passes it back to you.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:20.980]   So what is the people sniffing your packet see?
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:23.240]   What is the cable company looking at your packet see?
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:25.860]   All they say is, "Cal is talking to a VPN server.
[00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:29.340]   I have no idea who that VPN server is talking to on his behalf."
[00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:34.860]   They learn nothing about you, about the sites and services you use, beyond just the fact
[00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:36.980]   that you are smart and use a VPN.
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:39.540]   And I'm telling you, they really do sell this.
[00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:42.780]   The information came out recently that some of these companies are selling this information
[00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:49.740]   not just to marketers, but to the Department of Homeland Security, to the IRS.
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:52.260]   So if you use a VPN, you're saying no one gets to know this.
[00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:57.700]   So the VPN I use is ExpressVPN.
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:55:59.940]   ExpressVPN I think is the best in the business.
[00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:01.620]   Their software is very easy to use.
[00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:05.180]   You turn it on and then just use your device like normal.
[00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:09.080]   In the background, it's redirecting you through the VPN server, but it doesn't affect your
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:10.080]   experience at all.
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:11.900]   They have servers all around the world.
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:14.940]   So wherever you are, there's probably a server nearby you can choose to connect to.
[00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:16.420]   So you have very fast connection.
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:18.620]   They also have a lot of great bandwidth.
[00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:20.100]   So you need a VPN.
[00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:24.180]   And if you're going to use a VPN, you might as well use ExpressVPN.
[00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:29.140]   So make sure your online activity and data is protected with the best VPN money can buy.
[00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:33.620]   Visit expressvpn.com/deep right now.
[00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:39.760]   And if you use that /deep, you will get an extra three months free.
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:50.920]   That's expressvpn.com/deep to learn more.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:54.920]   I also want to talk about another sponsor of this show, which is our friends at Mint
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:56.920]   Mobile.
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:01.800]   You probably have been noticing recently that things are more expensive.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:02.800]   Gas is more expensive.
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.580]   Groceries is more expensive.
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:05.580]   Utility bills are more expensive.
[00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:08.860]   The streaming services you use are more expensive.
[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:14.460]   Inflation is driving up the cost of the stuff you purchase on a regular basis.
[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:18.300]   Well, thankfully, there's one company out there that can actually give you a much needed
[00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:21.780]   break and take something you do on a regular basis and make it cheaper.
[00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:25.380]   And that is Mint Mobile.
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:32.340]   Mint Mobile is the first company to sell premium wireless service only through an online interface.
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:38.140]   Mint Mobile lets you order from home and save a ton with phone plans starting at just $15
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:39.140]   a month.
[00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:43.580]   So the way this works by going online only by eliminating the cost of having these expensive
[00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:50.260]   retail stores, Mint Mobile allows their service to be offered to you much cheaper.
[00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:54.260]   All of their plans come with unlimited talk and text plus high speed data delivered on
[00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:57.740]   the nation's largest 5G network.
[00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:01.080]   You can use your own phone number with any Mint Mobile plan.
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:04.740]   You can keep your same phone number along with all your existing contacts.
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:12.180]   You can switch to Mint Mobile and get premium wireless service starting at just $15 a month.
[00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:15.900]   So if you look at that cell phone bill each month and say, "My God, this is a lot of money
[00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:19.760]   going here," you should think about Mint Mobile.
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:23.620]   So to get your new wireless plan for just $15 a month and get that plan shipped straight
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:29.600]   to your door for free, go to mintmobile.com/deep.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:32.100]   That's mintmobile.com/deep.
[00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:41.700]   Cut your wireless bill to $15 a month at mintmobile.com/deep.
[00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:47.700]   All right, so I have one final segment here where I want to react to something that a
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:52.980]   reader sent me to our interesting@calnewport.com email address.
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:53.980]   So I'm going to bring up this article.
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:56.500]   I'm going to share it on the screen.
[00:58:56.500 --> 00:59:04.640]   So again, if you're listening, you can see the video for this episode at thedeeplife.com.
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:10.460]   Go to watch and go to episode 261, or you can find this, the full episode at youtube.com/calnewportmedia.
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:17.720]   All right, so the article I want to talk about comes from the Washington Post.
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:23.020]   It's written by Sophia Andrade and J'Nai Kingsbury.
[00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:32.800]   Here is the headline, "Bad Behavior at Barbenheimer Reflects a Worrying Trend."
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:38.940]   So Barbenheimer, of course, is the media term for the last few weeks where we've had Barbie
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:43.200]   and Oppenheimer opening at the same time, bringing in record business.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:49.660]   So it's the box office size, the cumulative box office size of the last month or so has
[00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:54.060]   been some of the biggest we've seen, I think the last time the box office was this big
[00:59:54.060 --> 01:00:00.020]   was when Avengers Endgame came out, or Infinity War, one of the big Avengers movies.
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:03.240]   So a lot of people are returning to the movies.
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:07.620]   Many more people are seeing movies in recent weeks than they have been in years, which
[01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:09.280]   is good.
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:16.860]   But as this article says, there have been a lot of reports of bad behavior in movie
[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:23.780]   theaters as if people have forgotten how to actually see movies.
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:28.260]   Now a lot of the examples in this article are clearly anecdotal and strange.
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:33.700]   Like the example I have up here right now on the screen is of a showing of Barbie in
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:36.980]   which someone was just sitting in the crowd fully naked.
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:41.220]   And there's this whole thing about how the security guards were saying, "Dude, you cannot
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:42.220]   be naked in here."
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:45.420]   And the guy was all confused and upset that he couldn't be naked in the theater.
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:46.580]   He was getting all worked up.
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.340]   Look, that's a crazy example.
[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:51.820]   I don't think that's representing a trend that people forgot you're not supposed to
[01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:55.100]   be naked in the movie theater.
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:01:01.180]   But I think more general here is people being on their phones all the time.
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:02.740]   That's actually the piece I want to focus.
[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:07.780]   I'm going to scroll down here to a quote about this, but I think this is the thing I want
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:08.780]   to focus on here.
[01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:11.060]   All right, so here we go.
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:16.660]   The bad behavior wasn't limited to energized Barbie audiences either.
[01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:20.500]   Saw Oppenheimer last night in one of the worst behaved crowds I've ever been in.
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.620]   Multiple camera flashes throughout.
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:26.900]   People in front of us scrolling TikTok halfway through the film.
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:31.060]   User Silvergelpin wrote this weekend on Twitter.
[01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:34.220]   If you don't have the attention span for a three-hour movie, don't leave the house to
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:37.580]   attend one.
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:39.340]   Others chimed in with their own experiences.
[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:43.620]   Let me find one more quote from here that I liked.
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:50.100]   All right, so here is Roxanne Cohen-Silver, a professor of psychology at the University
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:58.500]   of California at Irvine, who's an expert on stress, who was saying, "It's clear that the
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:03.540]   past three years have been challenging for many people in our country.
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:06.940]   The combination of pandemic, inflation, mass shooting, climate-related disasters, political
[01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:09.940]   polarization, and so on has taxed our capacity to cope.
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:14.460]   It is important to recognize this reality as we examine behavior this summer."
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:17.860]   All right, here's another quote here.
[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:21.380]   Others are calling out cell phone culture and a constant self-centered need for stimulation.
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:24.660]   "For the entire history of theaters, people were able to pay attention.
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:29.820]   The only difference now is the phones," tweeted NBC News tech and culture reporter Kat Tinbarge.
[01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:35.940]   All right, so what's going on here is a lot of people came back to the theaters.
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:37.660]   There's a lot of bad behavior.
[01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:42.660]   I think a lot of this we can just chalk up to the fact that it was a cultural event to
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:46.860]   go see these movies, especially the Barbie movie, and it became a scene.
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:50.740]   The movie itself was a party, and you would dress up, and people were drinking and bringing
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:52.900]   wine into the theaters.
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:55.300]   That's so specific to this particular cultural event.
[01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:58.780]   I'm not so worried about that representing some big change.
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:02.180]   I don't think every movie going forward we're going to be like this, but I think these reports
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:07.380]   of people on their phones all the time, people taking pictures of what's happening on the
[01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:12.340]   movie screen, people doing TikTok videos in the screenings, the fact that reports of this
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:14.940]   are up I think is interesting.
[01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:18.780]   We have two competing, those quotes I read, we have two competing explanations for this.
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:21.660]   We have the one quote that says, "Well, everyone's traumatized, and they just don't know how
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:24.580]   to cope, and that's why we're seeing this weird behavior."
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:29.940]   The other is saying, "Our attention span is down because of phones.
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.260]   We're more narcissistic because of phones.
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:36.580]   We don't want to be away from phone information, and we find documenting ourselves and getting
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:40.540]   attention online is more important than anyone else's experience."
[01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:44.140]   This latter one, this won't surprise you, this latter explanation is the one that I
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:48.160]   think probably makes the most sense.
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:56.920]   So what I think has happened is in general, addictive, highly salient, and attractive
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:02.460]   content delivered to us on phones has in general lowered people's attention spans, has in
[01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:07.240]   general made it hard for people to consume long-form content because they're so used
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:12.580]   to being able to TikTok switch at the slightest hint of boredom.
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:17.060]   Now this hadn't affected movies as much because especially in the last couple of years, movie
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:19.460]   viewership has been more self-selected.
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:25.060]   There's nerds like me who love movies, who I was as early as I could in the pandemic,
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:29.040]   I was back in the theaters wearing my mask at the time, like I want to see movies.
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.940]   But a lot of people just stopped going to the movies.
[01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:33.260]   The people who did were really interested in movies.
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:39.140]   Well now that we have widely attractive movies coming back again, we have Barbie, we have
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:43.860]   Oppenheimer, a lot of people are coming to the theater who aren't just movie geeks and
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:48.060]   their broken attention span comes through.
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:51.780]   Now you might say, "Wait a second, there have been hit movies since the pandemic."
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:54.500]   Yes, but a lot of those have been superhero movies.
[01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:57.740]   And this is a point that was made in that Washington Post article.
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:00.260]   Superhero movies are actually made for shorter attention spans.
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:01.820]   It's boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:02.820]   It moves through.
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:04.940]   There's a lot of IP references.
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:09.700]   It really holds onto your attention in a way that the people who are interested in superhero
[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:14.460]   movies, even with lowered attention spans, you can probably make it through without periods
[01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.060]   of boredom.
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:19.460]   But Barbie is written by Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach.
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:24.020]   It's not all, there's periods of discussion and interesting stuff and subtle commentary.
[01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:25.460]   Oppenheimer's three hours long.
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:28.100]   These are not superhero movies.
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:31.620]   Then we're really seeing, we bring broad audiences back to lack of attention span.
[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:36.380]   So I just want to use this to go back and emphasize a key point I made in my book, Deep
[01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:43.620]   Work, which is that it's really important to embrace boredom.
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:50.220]   And the argument I made in that book is not that boredom is in itself valuable.
[01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:58.100]   Instead, the thing that is dangerous is teaching your brain that at the slightest hint of a
[01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:01.420]   boredom, it immediately gets a stimuli.
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:05.640]   If your brain always has that experience, you are going to build up a Pavlovian response
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:10.220]   to boredom that says, as soon as I feel bored, where's my shiny digital treat.
[01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:13.400]   I need to see something on my phone to make that feeling go away.
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:17.240]   And if your brain has that connection, it can't sit through Barbie.
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.740]   It can't sit through Oppenheimer.
[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:21.500]   It has to look at the phone.
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:24.940]   So the reason why I suggest embrace boredom is because what you're doing is breaking that
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:25.940]   cycle.
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:30.800]   So if on a regular basis, you expose yourself to some sort of long form concentrated experience
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:35.140]   where you maybe feel some boredom, but you don't give in, you're teaching your brain.
[01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:36.140]   That's okay.
[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:39.600]   So the goal is not to be bored all the time.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:44.660]   The goal is to be bored enough that it's familiar.
[01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:48.380]   And so if you've done this, then when you go to see a three hour movie, you can make
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:49.540]   it through without looking at your phone.
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.340]   You're like, I do this a couple of times a week.
[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:52.340]   I'm used to this.
[01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:53.340]   That's okay.
[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:59.380]   So I want to flip this around though and say, actually, movies themselves might be one of
[01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:04.180]   the more palatable, fun ways to train boredom.
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:07.980]   Go to the movie theater without your phone.
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:12.100]   Leave your phone in the car, in the parking lot, you know, hidden in your glove compartment
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:17.240]   or turn it to airplane mode or turn it completely off and give it to your friend who's sitting
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:20.060]   with you and just sit and watch a movie.
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:24.100]   Now you will feel boredom if you haven't been practicing, but you don't have a phone accessible
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:28.100]   to actually check and you'll be able to power through that boredom because you're watching
[01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:32.000]   a movie and it's brilliantly constructed and it's really interesting and there's a 50 foot
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   screen in front of you, right?
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   It's not that hard.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:40.660]   So I actually think movies are a great tool to practice this technique of embracing boredom.
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:45.740]   If you can sit through a movie at home or at a movie theater once a week and not look
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:50.380]   at your phone, you will see benefits in all of the sorts of things you do in your life.
[01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:51.380]   So I'm flipping this around.
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:57.020]   I think the fact that we're seeing people behaving poorly at movies, we say, well, movies
[01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:01.620]   can actually be the savior of this bad behavior we're seeing at movies.
[01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:03.900]   Return to your theaters and use movies.
[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:07.100]   See things that, you know, it's not your absolute favorite movie.
[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:09.740]   See it without your phone, without your phone easily accessible.
[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:15.240]   Let this be a really natural way to re-engage with the ability to sustain concentration
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:17.580]   without needing a shiny treat.
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:21.140]   You know, Jesse, Julie and I used to do this all the time before we had kids because we're
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:22.660]   big cinephiles.
[01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:23.660]   We would see everything.
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:26.020]   I kind of missed that period.
[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:30.380]   We lived walkable to the movie theater, the big AMC on Boston Common.
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:33.060]   We would just see everything and some movies were better than others.
[01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:37.820]   If there's any reasonable movie out, you know, we go twice a week to see every movie.
[01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:40.660]   I'm suggesting people return to a little bit of that rhythm if they can.
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:45.220]   I just see lots of movies as a way of practicing focus without it being just complete white
[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:47.240]   knuckle boredom.
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:51.040]   Also, I want movies to do well.
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.040]   So there we go.
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.820]   By the way, I didn't see any behavior like this when I saw Oppenheimer, but I did see
[01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:59.380]   it at noon on a weekday in Hanover, New Hampshire.
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:01.580]   So I think the average age of the theater was 65.
[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:04.780]   I'm not sure if the people in the theater even knew how to use phones.
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:06.420]   Maybe it's not the right sample.
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:07.420]   It was an older crowd.
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:08.420]   Let's just say that.
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:12.900]   So maybe that's not the right sample.
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:16.580]   Quick tidbit, I heard that the strike might go on for like another six months because
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:21.740]   NFL season is starting and it's all the conglomerates and they'll have plenty of content and money
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:24.260]   with like the NFL and stuff.
[01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:30.420]   So this is time for you and I, you and I Jesse, have to write our strike busting screenplay
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:38.020]   or create our strike busting television show about intrepid podcasters that solve crimes.
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:41.420]   And the other thing I heard too was that next year around the same time, like 11 months
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:51.220]   from now, the union contract for all the construction and the costume and all those folks who do
[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:52.980]   the movies, that's coming up too.
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:55.580]   So there'll probably be another strike back next summer as well.
[01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:57.340]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:00.460]   I wonder how contentious their negotiations are.
[01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:05.900]   Like so the director's guild, when their contract came up previously, they actually were pretty
[01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:06.900]   successful.
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:09.860]   They had a successful negotiation and didn't end up with a strike or anything.
[01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:14.020]   So it's sort of trade by trade within the entertainment industry, how it's going to
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:15.220]   go, I suppose.
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:20.700]   So the director's got some good concessions and didn't strike.
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:25.420]   What the writer's not writing for so long, there's going to be definitely a big drop
[01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:27.540]   in content available.
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:28.620]   I know it's interesting.
[01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:33.460]   And what it's going to really affect, I think the tonight shows, right?
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:36.540]   Whatever, whatever you call this, the late night shows, right?
[01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:38.260]   Those are all in strike.
[01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:42.380]   You lose people, they're already holding on the people with their fingertips, those audiences,
[01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:44.500]   because people don't watch the late night shows as much.
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.940]   You're going to lose the rest of that audience.
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:52.060]   And the other thing, so speaking of all this, is so Jess and I were both talking to our
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:58.820]   new YouTube guru, Jeremy, and he was telling us for people doing long form podcast style
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:06.740]   content on YouTube, for a lot of these people, the number two, it's not usually number one,
[01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:11.020]   number one is phone, but the number two most common device on which their videos are being
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:13.900]   viewed as televisions.
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:19.620]   So people are viewing Lex Fridman or breaking points or Andrew Huberman.
[01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:22.740]   They're viewing these on their giant TVs.
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:26.100]   They're just using the YouTube app on their fire stick or Apple TV.
[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:31.700]   And they're putting on this independent long form podcast style content.
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:35.020]   They're putting it on their TV and watching it while they're eating meals or like they
[01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:37.420]   would any other television show.
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:38.940]   So I think that's an interesting trend.
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:43.220]   And again, this is something that the entertainment industry in general should be worried about
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:48.300]   is that, you know, as television shows are on strike, as there's less original content
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:52.940]   coming over the television shows, people are consuming that they're clicking on apps to
[01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:56.180]   watch television shows through streaming services.
[01:11:56.180 --> 01:12:00.740]   If they instead click over on, let's say breaking points, right?
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:06.860]   I toured their studio as part of a New Yorker article and saga showed me their $60,000 camera
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:07.860]   system they bought.
[01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:14.420]   And he said, we bought this because it's a 4k and it looks great on big TVs.
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:17.780]   So you click over and watch breaking points.
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:22.060]   Is it any different from a user experience than instead clicking on Disney plus and,
[01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:27.540]   you know, clicking on a Nat Geo show, it's high resolution, interesting stuff.
[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:30.180]   So I would be worried if I was entertainment industries, right?
[01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:33.100]   Because it's not like it used to be where we have a television shows around these big
[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:37.100]   TVs and independent social media and YouTube contents on phones.
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:38.820]   And it's just a different experience.
[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:40.340]   That gap is closing.
[01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:45.540]   And you might find more and more people saying, well, what is new right now is, you know,
[01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:48.860]   I want to watch Fred Min interview Zuckerberg.
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:52.860]   I'm going to watch, you know, Cal and Jesse talk about Oppenheimer for 20 minutes or whatever,
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:55.540]   you know, and I'm going to have it up on my big screen.
[01:12:55.540 --> 01:13:00.300]   And it's very specific to what I'm interested in.
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:01.460]   Some interesting shifts going on.
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:08.900]   I think that is why I've always said video is going to be the huge disruptor force of
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:15.100]   independent media, the ability for independent producers to produce high quality video.
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:21.340]   Audio podcasting was just the warning sign to the big entertainment industry.
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:26.700]   The way that that encroached on radio, there's just a warning sign of independent media is
[01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:32.300]   about the close of big gap between non-independent media in a way that you might not be ready
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:33.300]   for.
[01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:36.260]   And that's why I said video is going to be at the core of this because ultimately the
[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:40.040]   thing that's always been most powerful in all forms of media, once television and movies
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:42.920]   came along is ultimately we like to see people's faces.
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:46.340]   We like to see things were very visual.
[01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:50.320]   And so I think this is happening and I think the strike might accelerate it.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.020]   So for all of us independent content producers out here, keep an eye on this because it'll
[01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:56.720]   be interesting to see what happens.
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:00.820]   Also Jesse, you know I'm just trying to set things up so we can justify buying a $60,000
[01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:03.660]   camera system.
[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:05.460]   You know that's what I secretly want.
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:12.860]   I don't want a giant studio, a giant like sound CNN cell soundstage with $60,000 cameras.
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:14.500]   All right, enough of this nonsense.
[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:16.340]   Thank you everyone for listening.
[01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:17.820]   We'll be back next week.
[01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:19.260]   Actually, I'm solo casting next week.
[01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:24.980]   So get me all by my lonesome and then I will be back after that in the studio, the old
[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:29.260]   fashioned original Deep Work HQ back in Takoma Park.
[01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:33.740]   So I am excited to get back to my beloved equipment, but thank you for listening.
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:36.200]   And until next time, as always, stay deep.
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:39.700]   So if you liked our discussion today of time block planning, then I think you'll really
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:45.620]   like this video, which is episode two 11 of this podcast in which I get into detail about
[01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:52.140]   how I organize my life, which is that the planning system that I have been perfecting
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:57.100]   over a decade, I've been using this for a decade is what works for me.
