[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740]   All right. I want to try something unexpected here. I'm going to start with a little known
[00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.780]   story from the life of Walt Disney that I came across recently while reading Richard Snow's book
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:18.280]   Disney's Land. I am then going to connect this tale from the 1940s to our current moment in
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.760]   the 2020s, and I am going to extract from it a useful strategy for trying to combat that all
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.940]   too common sense that we are sleepwalking through life subservient to our screens.
[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:40.860]   Okay. So let me set the scene for this story. It's the late 1940s. Walt Disney is going through
[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.360]   a hard time in his life. So here's a timeline you got to understand. Sort of the apex of the
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.740]   first half of Disney's career was 1937. That is when Snow White and the Seven Doors comes out.
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.960]   It's the first full-length animated movie. It was the highest grossing movie of all time when it came
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.360]   out. So this was a phenomenon. But after that high point, his animation studio had begun to suffer
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.880]   financial difficulties, in particular because of World War II. So his follow-up films, which we now
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.700]   see as classics like Fantasia and Pinocchio, they struggled in part because there was no European or
[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.240]   otherwise international market for these because of the ongoing war. Then we get in the early 1940s,
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.360]   this big animator strike at Disney Studios. This was really traumatic for Disney. Several of his
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.640]   biographers, including my favorite biographer of his, Neil Gabler's, talks about how this really was a
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.860]   period of emotional and creative malaise for Disney. He felt betrayed. He felt drained. So here we are,
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.500]   as the 40s wear on, the high point of the animation studio is down. They're struggling. They were having to
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.700]   do, I don't know if you've ever seen this before, Jesse, but they were doing propaganda videos on
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.300]   contract for the government, animated propaganda videos because they needed the money. So there's
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.120]   nothing really exciting going on. They were always short on money. He felt betrayed. He's not having a
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:10.460]   great time. Then came the trains. So Disney was fascinated with steam trains. This is not unusual for someone who
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.580]   was born near the turn of the 20th century. You have to imagine what it was like if you're Disney's age.
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:24.360]   When you were growing up in the 1920s, right? Steam engines were magic, right? Think about it. You had
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.540]   horse transportation. That's all anyone had ever known for centuries. And suddenly you have these
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.780]   massive machines. You've never seen something like this. They were blowing and hissing steam like a dragon
[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.560]   of a size that you've rarely seen anything man-made that large. It could actually move.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.860]   And they could rush across the landscape 60, 70, 80 miles per hour, pulling these massive lines of
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.840]   freight over giant trestle bridges. I mean, it was the thing. There was nothing else to be as amazed by
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.980]   in the period when Disney grew up than it was trains. So like many people from his era, he always had had
[00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.340]   a fascination with trains. He worked selling papers on a train for a while as a kid. And so he bought,
[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.640]   he was 46 years old. It's 1940. He's not feeling good. He buys a Lionel train set. You know, the what
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.680]   do you call model trains you set up? He's like, oh, this is kind of fun. Then he discovers that one of his
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.460]   animators, Ward Kimball, was essentially building a full-size steam engine in his backyard.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.760]   And this started to get Disney going like, well, wait a second, what are you doing here? And so he
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.560]   travels with Kimball. They go to a train show where I think I forgot exactly where this was. It might've
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.640]   been Chicago. It might've been, um, somewhere in the Midwest, but it was a train show where they were
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.880]   bringing together all these like great steam engines from times past. And it was like really amazing.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.140]   And he saw that, uh, Ward Kimball was building like a fake set in his backyard to put the steam engine. And
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.180]   and Disney felt something that he hadn't felt in a little while, which was a spark of inspiration.
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:08.500]   And so he hatched a plan. He said, I'm going to build not a model train, but a 1/8 scale train. So
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.940]   to put that in the perspective, a 1/8 scale train, the, uh, engine is just big enough that like a full
[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.500]   grown man, you could sit on it and you know, your legs would kind of be over the side, but so it's like
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.300]   the size of, I don't know. You think of it as like a wagon, right? So he was like, I'm going to build a
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.540]   train at that scale and I'm going to build a track to run this thing on. Now he didn't have enough room
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:38.900]   where they lived. So he bought a new house, right? This is 1949. Disney purchases a five acre plot in
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.420]   Los Angeles specifically because the land would be well suited for building this 1/8 scale train that he
[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:51.620]   suddenly had come up with is like, this will be fun. He laid out nearly 800 meters of track for his steam
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.620]   engine, which he called the Carolwood Pacific railroad because it was on Carolwood Avenue.
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:03.460]   He ended up with a 46 foot long trestle. So that's a old school railroad bridge that was large enough
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.660]   that it fell under LA County's jurisdiction as a real bridge. They had to actually check that it was properly
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.740]   built, had loops and overpasses, a gradient, an elevated dirt berm and a 90 foot tunnel underneath
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.620]   his wife's flower bed. They engineered the tunnel at great expense to have an S turn so that when you
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.620]   went in one end, you couldn't see out the backs. You had no idea how long it felt like the tunnel was going
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:31.700]   on and on for a long time. We have some photos, I think, right, Jesse, of this track. So if you're
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.340]   watching this on YouTube, instead of just listening, we're going to see if we can pull up on the screen.
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.460]   Jesse will pull up while we're talking here some photos from an article I found that were pretty
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.580]   good. And so, yeah, so we see here, there he is on the train. So that's what 1/8 scale is. You see,
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.380]   he's riding on it, but close to the ground. All right, scroll some more, Jesse. That's the layout.
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:58.100]   Look at that. Oh, I'm so jealous. And then you see here, there's his barn. If you're watching,
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.780]   keep that barn in mind. I'll mention that in a second. I think there's like maybe one more photo on there.
[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:08.660]   Yeah, there they are going by the flower beds. All right. So amid this circuit,
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.620]   Disney also built a barn where he could store and maintain his rolling stock. It was also the control
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:20.020]   room for the Pacific line as well. And as long as he was building it, he designed it to look
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:26.260]   like his family barn he had growing up in Marceline, Missouri. This also became a place for him to relax and
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:32.900]   the brainstorm about future projects. So he went all in on this. His biographers talk about him
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:40.820]   really coming alive once he was able to start working on this railroad, this project that he was
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.980]   spending more and more time on. He bought a house just to build, had nothing to do with his work,
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.780]   but he really began to come alive, which made it all the more surprising when in 1953,
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.260]   a accident happened. It wasn't a major accident, but he, he let someone drive the train, a young
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.020]   guy drive the train and he went too fast and it derailed. And some of the steam came out of the
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:06.020]   engine and a five-year-old girl got some minor burns. She was fine. But right after that accident,
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.620]   he's like, okay, I'm done. And he shut it down and they stored away the cars. The, the locomotive went
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.860]   back to, I think they had under a desk somewhere at Walt Disney. His friends and family were surprised,
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.260]   like, wait, you're just going to shut this whole thing down. But it was not a surprise to Disney
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:26.420]   because the Carolwood Pacific project had accomplished its purpose. It had reignited his
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.180]   ability to feel wonder and motivation to build things and do things that mattered.
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:36.260]   Right. And in that barn he had built where he would sit after a day of working with his train,
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.660]   where he'd been working in there and brainstorming, he had been, it turned out, mulling an idea for the
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.980]   next chapter of his career, the chapter that would occupy him happily for the rest of his life.
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:50.340]   He had decided reinvigorated by that railway project that he was going to build a theme park.
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:58.100]   And that's where he then turned his energy. Now, Disney used this experiment to overcome
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:03.540]   the professional malaise, but I couldn't help think when I was reading Richard Snow's book recently,
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:09.540]   I couldn't help coming across this story that there might be a lesson in here that is relevant to people
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:15.620]   today who are suffering from what I think is a related condition that's at the same time,
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:21.940]   very of our current moment. Here's the issue I'm observing today that Disney's scheme might help.
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:30.500]   We spend all of our time on screens, right? At work, it's email, it's Zoom, it's web interfaces,
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:37.540]   it's on laptop screens and it's on our phone. When we're not in work, it's on our phone and it's text
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:42.420]   messages and it's social media. And maybe at some point it's on a TV screen and it's streaming media.
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:46.100]   And we're sitting here just swiping these things with our small motions of our hands. There's nothing
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.740]   wrong with a screen, but weird things happen when most of your life becomes mediated through these
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:57.620]   screens. And when we live in what is basically an artificial or abstract world, my conjecture is this
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:04.740]   dulls our nervous system. We begin to lose what it feels like to be a being that exists in the physical
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.900]   world, that is shaping that physical world, that is enjoying that physical world. So much of our nervous
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:15.780]   system, our senses, is built around experiencing the world. So much of our brain is built around projecting
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:20.500]   things into the world, imagining what's going to happen and finding satisfactions when they do happen
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:26.740]   as we expect. And we lose touch with all of that when our life is increasingly through this abstraction
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:32.740]   that we're seeing through screens. It's a digital grayness where we exist, where these real world
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:37.620]   sensations have been dulled and where we get our sensations from instead are these highly optimized and
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:42.580]   artificial pings that are delivered by memes and comments and highly produced videos that are squeezed on
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:47.540]   the glass. It's a sort of a fake or artificial version of the feelings we would have used to
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:53.140]   have being out there in the real world. It creates a condition I call the digital doldrums. And it makes
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:10:00.340]   life seem sort of listless, sort of like you're sleepwalking, not miserable, but not really fully all there.
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:08.420]   Now let's bring this back to what Disney discovered, which was the power of engineering wonder.
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.980]   Right? So if you take something that really interests you, like for him, it was trains,
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.700]   and that has no instrumental purpose, it's not like this is going to be good for my career,
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.820]   it's going to make me healthier, or it's something I can brag about because God knows
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:27.460]   Disney was not bragging about it wasn't that cool that he was building this weird train in his backyards.
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:31.300]   You find something that has no instrumental purpose other than you find it remarkably interesting.
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.580]   And then if you take that and you inflate your ambition for it to 10 times larger than what is
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:43.140]   reasonable, I think interesting things happen. Instead of buying the Lionel train, you buy five
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:48.420]   acres of land and build a 1/8 scale train you can ride. I saw a guy, to give some more examples of this,
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:53.460]   I saw a guy on YouTube once who had built a reproduction of the Haunted Mansion ride from
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:58.820]   Disneyland in his suburban backyard. I mean, the whole thing, he had built a dark room, he was using
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:05.940]   tarps to make the passages, and there was a track system and actual homemade doom buggies
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:11.380]   and prop controllers. And he really did the best he can. And this was like thousands of hours of work.
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:16.260]   My old hairstylist in Georgetown that I used to go see, he took me once to his house and showed
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:22.820]   me that he had built this commercial grade glass blowing studio, that he was building this wonderful
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:29.700]   art out of glass. The whole salon he used to work before he left had his custom glass creations hanging
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:34.980]   from the ceiling. God knows how much effort went into it, but it was really kind of incredible to see.
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:42.180]   I call this engineered wonder, and I think it is an effective way to free you from the digital
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:49.940]   doldrums. I think it works because it reactivates your actual analog world nervous system. You get used
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.860]   to what it feels like to be really engaged with something that exists in the real world, not just
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:12:00.180]   feeling these sort of artificial simulated emotions. You get used to having an intention in your mind that
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:06.420]   your nervous system then sees being made manifest in the real world. That's an incredibly powerful
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:10.740]   thing. We lose what that feels like when more and more our accomplishments have to do with numbers
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:15.380]   next to a thumbs up on a social media post. But it feels fantastic when you get back to it. We get used
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:19.460]   to how much better the analog settings to work in. We feel that it feels like to have actual authentic
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:24.420]   wonder for something and not just an artificially manipulated emotion delivered through a screen.
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:29.300]   And I think once all that's reinvigorated, that screens no longer seem so great.
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:37.060]   And you begin seeking other things you can do. Your version of Disney saying I'm now going to start
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:42.900]   Disneyland. Opening up new chapters of your life that really can be profound or meaningful in a bigger
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:50.900]   way. Now look, I know there's an irony that we're using Walt Disney, creator of Disneyland of all people,
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:57.700]   to give us a solution for escaping artificial worlds. But I still think there's something here in
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:04.900]   this notion of engineered wonder that can be an important part of building a bridge from a shallow
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:12.180]   life to one that's deeper. So there's my monologue. This was the thought I had when I encountered that
[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:18.980]   story. And this is what it made me think about. So I need to go do something crazy, Jesse. My Halloween
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:24.420]   decorations are not nearly enough. Why did you come up with the term digital doldrums? Have you had it for a
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:32.260]   while? No, I came up with it earlier today. But it seemed about right. Because when I think of the
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:37.940]   doldrums, I think about the nautical version of the term, which is you're in a position in the ocean
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:43.620]   where you have no prevailing winds. And so your sailing ship is just sort of sitting there and
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:48.340]   drifting around. That's what it feels like sometimes, right? This life, this very screen mediated life.
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:52.660]   It's not just being distracted on social media. It's like work becomes this artificial,
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:58.340]   performative, pseudo-productive dance of busily answering emails and jumping off of Zooms. But
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:02.980]   all work is the same in this world. It's all just moving text back and forth and jumping under these
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:07.780]   small screens. And everyone's very busy and sending Google Docs back and forth, but nothing's really
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:14.340]   happening. So you're busy. It's like you're in the sailing ship in the doldrums furiously trying to
[00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:19.460]   adjust your sails and tack, but nothing's happening. And so that's what I thought about. It really is
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:23.220]   like the doldrums. I think we're sleepwalking. And when you realize what it's like to actually
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:29.060]   be back in the world again, this stuff on your screen, it doesn't seem so exciting anymore. At
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.420]   least that's the hope. So I like this idea of engineered wonder. I'm playing with this for my
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.020]   Deep Life book. So this is why I've really been thinking about it. But I wanted to test it out here.
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.820]   I'm interested in both examples and feedback. By the way, you can send those to Jesse
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:47.380]   at calnewport.com. I gotta say that guy who built the haunted mansion in his yard. I showed my kids that
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:54.740]   video. That's a full-time job. And I can tell you, I admire it. I think that guy has it all figured out,
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:58.260]   Jesse. Full-time. I think he starts working in June to get that thing set up.
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.900]   It's an amazing build. All right. Well, we got some cool questions here. Some of them a little
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:10.340]   bit more reasonable to get to. I'm excited for it. But first, Jesse, it's time to hear some ads.
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:15.460]   So as you know, I'm recording this ad up in New England, where my family and I have been staying
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:20.180]   for most of the month. I have been loving almost everything about being up here, except for one
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:24.740]   terrible, disastrous mistake that I made when we were leaving for this trip.
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:31.140]   I forgot to pack our cozy earth bamboo sheets. These are by far the most comfortable sheets that
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:36.180]   we've ever owned. We love them. We have many pairs. We give them as gifts. We bring them when we travel.
[00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:41.220]   And I forgot to bring them up to this rental. And I have been kicking myself ever since. Look,
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:47.300]   I was this close, Jesse, to Cindy, my 12-year-old, to drive back to DC to pick up our sheets
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:53.300]   and bring them up here. But my wife, who's like the super stickler for the details, was like,
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:58.980]   it's illegal for a 12-year-old to drive for eight hours. He doesn't know how to drive a car. He has
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:03.140]   no money to buy gas. And so I was like, come on. You need to read The Anxious Generation. Stop
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:08.900]   helicoptering. But anyways, until he goes and does that, I am unhappy to be on normal sheets. That's how
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:14.900]   comfortable they are. And it's not just sheets that Cozy Earth offers. The Everywhere Pant. They sent me
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:19.460]   a pair of these. I love these as well. They're super comfortable like the sheets. They're very
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:24.980]   breathable and flexible. So you can bring the comfort of the sheets with you for your day as well.
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:30.820]   So now Cozy Earth Comfort is something that shows up day in, day out. All right, let me make this
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:36.660]   simple. Buy Cozy Earth sheets. And there's a 100-night sleep trial, 10-year warranty. You won't need them,
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:42.100]   but there's no risk here. And then once you love them, buy The Everywhere Pants. And of course,
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.620]   if you leave any of this on a trip at home, just send your pre-adolescent kid to go back home and pick them up.
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:50.820]   Now, are you looking for a discount before you pull the trigger? Well, I have one to offer for you.
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:57.460]   Go to CozyEarth.com and use my code DEEP for 40% off the softest bedding, bath, and apparel.
[00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:02.260]   And if you get a post-purchase survey, tell them you heard about Cozy Earth right here in the Deep
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:09.060]   Questions podcast. Cozy Earth is built for real life, made to keep up with yours. That's Cozy Earth,
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:14.020]   CozyEarth.com, and use that code DEEP. Let me talk about one other product that I use
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:20.420]   every day and I miss when I run out of it. And that is Element, L-M-N-T. Here's the thing. Staying
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:26.500]   hydrated can be hard, especially for someone like me who spends a lot of time giving talks and recording
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:32.260]   podcasts and doing interviews, which is all very dehydrating. I do this. And at the same time,
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:40.020]   I also live in a city, Washington, D.C., that in the summer becomes a stupid swamp town where even,
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:44.500]   and Jesse, you can back me up here, even prehistoric jungle-adapted reptiles would likely
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:48.900]   rather go extinct and try to handle the humidity levels that we suffer down here, which is all to
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:55.060]   say I use a lot of Element. So what is it? It's a zero-sugar electrolyte drink mix and sparkling
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:18:00.340]   electrolyte drink born from the growing body of research revealing that optimal health outcomes
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:05.300]   occur at sodium levels two to three times government recommendations. Each serving delivers a
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:11.380]   meaningful dose of electrolytes, but it does so, and here's why I like it, without sugar or food dye
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:17.780]   or those other dodgy ingredients you find in popular electrolyte and sports drinks. Element is used by
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:22.100]   professional athletes like Bradley Beal. It's used by special forces team like U.S. Navy SEALs. There's a
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:27.860]   lot of Olympians that use it. And most impressively, MIT trained technology theorists like myself.
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.740]   Now I typically start my day adding some element to my water, and then I'll add some more after my
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:38.420]   workout or if I've had like a busy speech or podcasting. I'll titrate the amount I put in by
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:44.100]   just how humid or dehydrated I feel. There's a new flavor this summer that you have to try lemonade salt.
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:49.460]   It's refreshing and hydrating. It's limited supply. So, you know, get that now while it's still
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:56.980]   summer time. I got good news. You can receive a free element sample pack with any order if you go to
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:04.580]   drinkelement.com/deep. That's drinkelement.com/deep. You can try element totally risk-free. If you don't
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:11.860]   like it, you'll get your money back, but you will like it. I am a big element drinker. So go to drinkelement.com/deep now.
[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:18.340]   That's drinkelementlmnt.com/deep. All right, Jesse, let's move on with some questions.
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:22.020]   First question is from Natalie.
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:28.100]   I left a long software engineering career to start an art business while also learning to paint
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:33.780]   with the goal of becoming a full-time artist. I have a financial cushion to last for a bit. I'm weighing
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:38.980]   different strategies for balancing business growth and my creative ambitions. Typically, I have a large
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:44.260]   time block for the art business before lunch, a time block for marketing and admin for both pursuits
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:49.460]   after lunch, and then painting after dinner. How should I pursue these two different goals?
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:54.500]   Well, I think there's two things going on here, Natalie. There's the big picture question about
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:58.340]   what you're doing with your career, the sort of like the general deep life question. And then I
[00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:04.580]   think there's the tactical question about what's the best time to do art training. Let me start with
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:11.460]   the easy one first. Once you're in a steady state, you kind of have your art business going and you're
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:18.660]   like, okay, where is art training go into this? You probably need to let your internal creative
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:22.980]   rhythms take the lead. You own your art business. So you probably have, I don't know exactly what
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:27.060]   it is, but you probably have some autonomy about how this business, like when and where it happens.
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:32.020]   Like it's not you behind a counter at a store, I'm assuming. So you should decide when and where
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:37.620]   do I do my best artwork? When am I most inspired? Like what location, what time? Make that your time
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:42.260]   block for doing your painting and then run the art business other places, right? That's just going to give
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:48.740]   you a bit of a multiplier on your return of effort for working on a creative pursuit. Find the best time,
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:53.700]   best location, because I can. I'm going to get 20% more out of those sessions. That adds up over time.
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.100]   All right, let's go to the general question here, the harder question.
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:01.620]   Leaving a long time software engineering career to start an art business. I'm a little bit worried.
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:09.460]   I know you have a financial cushion, but I'm a little bit worried about how much prep you did
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:14.340]   before making that change. The typical argument that I would make in like my book "So Good They
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:19.860]   Can't Ignore You" is that you really want sufficient career capital in the new thing you're doing
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:26.740]   that you can exchange it for success, right? That you're not coming into a new field where you have
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:31.300]   very little rare and valuable skills because that is a recipe for really falling behind.
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:35.860]   And one of the best ways, I talk about this in So Good, one of the best ways to check your career
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:41.780]   capital stores when it comes to a new professional endeavor is to use Derek Siver's concept of money
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:47.700]   being a neutral indicator of value. That is, running the art business on your side until the income it
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:53.700]   produces is enough to cover your needs. Now you have confidence that the business will work.
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:59.780]   Now you make your change. So if you made your jump before then, I guess it's all hands on deck with
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:05.620]   the art business until that income is coming in. And only if and when it feels stable would I really
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:12.020]   start prioritizing more time for the more personal pursuit of working on your own art. My concern is
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:16.900]   you're going to burn through this cushion and nothing comes of it because it's hard to run a new business
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:21.060]   if you don't have very invaluable skills. So really, I'm just going to say, put your focus on that
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:25.620]   until you feel comfortable and then do more time on your own art and do it when
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:31.220]   you feel like it's the best time for you to do the art. But you know, I've got some alarm sirens going
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:35.380]   here, Natalie, and hopefully I might be missing context here where it's safer than I think. But I want to put
[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:41.860]   out that fire before I worry too much about extending the proverbial house here. All right, who do we got next, Jesse?
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:48.180]   Next question is from Vishal. I've been a business analyst for 11 years and it provides stability and
[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:53.220]   good balance. I have a chance to buy a retail convenience store. The expected financial returns
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:58.980]   are roughly equivalent to my current full-time role. This new potential role is a major shift from my current
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:04.340]   career capital. However, if successful, owning multiple stores could provide long-term upside. Ideally,
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:09.540]   I want to take three to four months off each year. So I think this question has a lot of related themes to
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:20.500]   the last question. And again, I have deep life alarm sirens going off. Because when I analyze how to use your
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:29.300]   work as one of the tools you have to construct a deep life, there is a clear formula. The benefits of a professional
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:36.580]   pursuit are directly proportional to how rare and valuable the skills involved in that pursuit are.
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:40.420]   This is just the way the market works. The more you're leveraging rare and valuable skills,
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.420]   the more you get back either in terms of compensation or sort of like autonomy and flexibility.
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:49.540]   If you are really, really good at throwing a baseball with your left hand,
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:56.420]   you could get 20, 25 million dollars a year for doing that, right? Because it's an incredibly rare
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:03.700]   and valuable skill. You can leverage that to get a lot in return. If you are very, very good at writing
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:14.500]   dark fantasy novels like Rebecca Yaros, then you can have an extreme amount of flexibility in your life.
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:19.220]   You write one book every year or two. You make a massive amount of money. That's all you have to do.
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.580]   You can dictate when and where you work. The more rare and valuable skills, the better.
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:27.780]   I get worried about things like retail convenience stores because where's the rare and valuable skill?
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:35.780]   If you don't have a particular hard-won skill in this field, then why do you think
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:42.580]   that I can just relatively easily be making the same money as a business analyst and then maybe buy a few
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:48.020]   other stores and then I could have a pretty good lifestyle business or make a lot of money and don't have
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:53.380]   to work three or four months a year. If that was possible without you needing a hard-won skill,
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.860]   guess what? Everyone would be doing it. First, it would be people and then you would have private
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.820]   equity funds come in and everyone would be like, "This is great. What an easy business. I don't need
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:05.940]   to know much about it. If you have enough capital, you can have a retail convenience store do well and
[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:12.740]   just buy three more." Everyone would be doing it. I'm always really wary if you don't have a rare and
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:16.420]   valuable skill being applied. I don't trust a person saying this thing's going to make you a lot of
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:20.580]   money. It just never works. The market is too efficient. The market of professional pursuits
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:25.460]   and rewards is very efficient. If there's ways to do really well without rare and valuable skills,
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:29.940]   people move into it till it's saturated. Then people try to automate and systematize it and then all the
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:38.180]   opportunity goes away. I think of it as the efficient job market theory. Now, I could be wrong here,
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:43.540]   but I know I've seen some books for some stores, including several stores in Tacoma Park. I know
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:49.140]   the owners. These are hard businesses. It's hard work. It's hard to scrape a margin. Almost certainly,
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:54.900]   you're getting a much higher return on your time and much closer paths to autonomy and flexibility
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.820]   and being something like a business analyst with a specialty than you are running a retail convenience
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:04.980]   store. All this is just to say, be wary. Now, that's not to say that this is not a bad business,
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:11.140]   because I'm going to play devil's advocate for myself here, Visho. There are some types of retail
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:16.740]   outlets that can be pretty profitable, like a good McDonald's franchise in a good location can do really
[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:21.060]   well. And you could say, well, then why does anyone do it? Well, it's because McDonald's
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:27.380]   has a, if you want to be a franchisee, they have this rule that says you can't finance more than some
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:32.260]   small percent of the purchase price of the franchise. So you have to have, it depends on where you are,
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:36.900]   but many hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of capital. Now, if you have that, it could be a
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:42.820]   pretty good investment. These are, McDonald's are relatively turnkey, how they run, and you can scale
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:47.940]   them. And it's a situation where not everyone can do it because not everyone has $700,000 worth of
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:51.940]   capital to buy a McDonald's and Silver Spring or whatever it is. So there is some devil advocate
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:56.420]   here that if there's capital at play and that's what's keeping people out of the market, or it's
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:01.220]   an unusually good location and you have an inside connection to it, maybe that helps.
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:06.820]   But I just want to make this general point, regardless of the details of Visho's situation,
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:13.940]   I want to make this general point for anyone out there. If you think a deal is too good to be true,
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:17.860]   like, wow, I can just do this and make a lot of money. I don't know much about it. You're probably
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:24.020]   the sucker in the bet, probably the sucker in the bet. So be very wary about career capital and be very
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:28.980]   wary, A, about things that require career capital and be very open to where can I take the career capital
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:33.780]   I already have, specialize it a little bit more and six months from now have like a very big piece
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:38.340]   of leverage I can use in my life. If I'm a business analyst, is there a new market emerging that has
[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:44.660]   some tech complicated technical component that I can master and then go freelance and do this 20 hours
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:49.780]   a week or do this 40 weeks a year and take the other 12 weeks off. And if I change my living expenses,
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:58.100]   it can work. Like I can imagine many more potential paths to a deep life building on the career capital
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:02.420]   you already have than I can imagine building a retail empire being the way to get there.
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:07.460]   All right. So that's my sermon. I'm just very worried about anything where if I'm not,
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:13.220]   if I'm not leveraging a hard one skill, I'm nervous about the idea that this is going to be
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:21.300]   a pretty good or easy or lucrative job. All right, who we got? Next up is Doug. You've said before that
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:26.100]   the real way to improve as a writer is to write for publications. My niche is small. I've submitted
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:31.540]   pieces before, but the responses have always been no with no suggestions or edits. I haven't tried often
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:36.340]   because the process didn't help me grow. I also prickle at the prospect of using my precious limited
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:40.420]   writing time to do the non-writing that would come with searching for other avenues. How should I do this?
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:46.180]   Jesse, I feel like I'm in my curmudgeon mode today question because I've got another curmudgeonly
[00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:52.580]   answer coming. I don't know. I'm sort of, I'm sort of feeling like angry uncle today. Um, again,
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:59.460]   Doug, not knowing all your circumstances, and I don't mean to rant, but writing for publications,
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:03.860]   how you get better. Now, if you're right, if you're journaling for yourself, if you're writing fiction,
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:08.900]   just, uh, for the creative expression to share with your friends, if you're your poetry,
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:13.060]   because it just helps you get your feelings out, of course, don't mess. It doesn't matter
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:16.660]   if you publish it or not. And if it's a pain, I agree with you. Don't waste the time. But if you're
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:20.740]   trying to become a better writer, like I want to get good at this, maybe I want to have this be,
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:27.060]   if not a career, like a component to my professional life, something I'm known for something I do at a
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:32.660]   high level writing for publications, how you get good. Yes. You've submitted some pieces. The
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:37.060]   response has been no, there's been no suggestions. That's because it takes a lot. It's hard to be a
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:42.660]   published writer. You know, it takes, if it was easy, everyone would be like, yeah, I'm going to spend
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:47.380]   four months and start publishing stuff. And it's great. Yeah. It's a hard entry ramp, but it is worth
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:53.540]   keep pushing yourself to get past that gate of being published. Stephen King, he writes about this in his book
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:58.180]   On Writing. When he first started writing fiction and he was aiming in the short story market, there
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:04.100]   was a lot more short story magazines for horror and speculative fiction back then. Up in his attic,
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:10.660]   he took a railroad spike and he knocked that spike into the wall above the typewriter where he was
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:15.220]   writing up in that attic room. And he said, that's where I'm going to put my rejection slips, not a nail,
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:21.700]   because a nail is not long enough. And he began filling that railroad spike with rejection slips.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:25.300]   And you know the story he tells in On Writing? Reminds me of you. At first,
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:33.700]   no. Rejections, no information. After a while, hey, this was kind of good, but it's not for us.
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:38.580]   Maybe a couple of sentences of feedback. After a while, hey, I think this was close. You know,
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:44.020]   Stephen, I like this. This is close, but I'm not quite sure about it. Then stuff started getting in.
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:48.180]   And then he started messing around with novels. They weren't working. And then he had one that did work.
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:55.460]   It was about a young woman who had telekinesis, right? Had this power of telekinesis and what
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:31:01.940]   happened in a small town. And he sold it, hardcover. I think it was like a $2,000 advance. He was a
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:09.940]   teacher in Bangor having to work summer jobs to cleaning industrial laundries, cleaning tablecloths from
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:15.380]   New England lobster joints and maggots on him. It's gross, right? But he needed the summer job to
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:19.860]   make the money. The book does pretty well, though. It catches some attention. It's starting to get
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:24.900]   some heat. He doesn't really know this. There's no internet back then. A call comes in to his agent.
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:32.100]   They've sold the paperback rights. $400,000. This is in the 1970s. Railroad spike filled with rejection
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:36.580]   slips before he made that progress. Which is all to say, this is part of the rite of passage of writing.
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:40.180]   The key is when you're getting the no's, you say, well, how do I get better to try to make the next
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:44.580]   one not be a no? So even while you're waiting to get feedback from publication, have a writer's group.
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:50.340]   Work with other people. What's working here? What's not? Be brutally honest with me. Get the feedback.
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:53.860]   Try harder. Try a different format. Try a different style. What if I tried this? Maybe this is a better
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:58.660]   match. It's that hard work of trying to get accepted is the first major deliberate practice
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.820]   stretch that happens in the life of a professional writer. Once you're writing for publication,
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:08.660]   the next large deliberate practice stretch happens where you go from not bad to good and then really
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:16.020]   cool stuff can go on. So don't write a story. If again, if your goal is to be like a good writer,
[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:19.860]   don't try to write yourself a story where it's all gatekeepers and they don't know what they're
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:23.620]   talking about and you're just going to do your thousand words a day because it's fun and you like
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:28.180]   the idea of it and you have your herbal moth AT and you Instagram photos of it. Don't write your own
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:33.140]   story about how you want the world of writing to work. The real story is it's hard, but that hardness
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:40.980]   is the edge against which the blade of craft is sharpened. And even that push to get past the simple
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:45.540]   no, if you're really pushing, if they anger you when you push back and you have friends and you have
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:49.540]   writers groups and you're trying and you're relentless, that's when you start to get good.
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:54.340]   And so maybe my problem is I left off that first part, Jesse, that sometimes it's hard to even get in the
[00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:58.340]   publications in the first place. And that's okay. That is the first step of getting better.
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:02.500]   Mm-hmm I had my tour. We're going to revisit Doug too in the case study.
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.980]   Oh, okay. Excellent. Is that the same Doug? It's the same Doug. Yeah.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.900]   Oh, interesting. And the case study is having a great time. Yeah.
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:14.500]   All right. This will be interesting. All right, Doug, stay tuned. We're going to revisit listeners,
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:20.180]   Doug's story in the case study. He says like, Hey, I just sold. I went around trying to write for
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:24.420]   publication and an editor just showed up at my house and said, Hey, I just happened to see this
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:29.380]   on your computer screen through the window. We're just going to give you this giant check right now.
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:35.220]   I'm glad you didn't waste your time writing submission letters. Doug actually has a cool story.
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:39.540]   So I look forward to returning to that. All right. Do we have another question from someone with a name
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:44.660]   that starts with a D because that's what I really want right now? Daniel. And Daniel says,
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:51.620]   Companies investing in AI see a tool that should decrease time to value. Knowledge workers should
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:57.380]   now be able to produce faster in the company's view. How should we argue to companies that the
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:03.620]   long-term benefits of allowing slow friction-laden skill building outweigh the shorter-term benefits of
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:09.940]   faster project completion through AI assistance? So Daniel, I don't have this argument with your
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:17.780]   company. Executives are acting kind of delusional about AI because it's this, we don't understand the
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:24.420]   technology. We don't really understand exactly how it works, but we're seeing on our phone, all these
[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:32.180]   like crazy headlines from fortune articles. And so I think if you get a chat GPT description is what I
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:38.980]   can tell here is it'll automate all of your work in about 17 minutes. Wow. So we should just do that.
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:43.780]   So executives are like, we use AI. And if you're not using AI, then we don't want you here or whatever.
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:47.780]   But honestly, it's pretty narrow still, and we'll get into this more in the third segment, but it's
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:52.740]   pretty narrow still the niches in which there are significant productivity improvements happening from AI.
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:59.300]   So you have to kind of just tune out the almost delusional exuberance of the executive class
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:06.500]   right now. Look at what you do. If you see people using AI in what you do in a way that seems really
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:12.180]   helpful, then say, hey, teach me about it and use it. It might help some. But that's kind of it. And if you
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:18.340]   don't have a useful way to use it, you know, tell your boss, yeah, I have my chat GPT description and
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.380]   just go on and do the hard work of getting really good and so good they can't ignore you.
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:27.860]   There is a lot of energy that right now is kind of rootless and disconnected from reality right now.
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:33.700]   So you are not probably missing out on some way that AI was going to fully automate your job. So
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:37.860]   keep an eye on it, but just look at the people around you. Hey, are you using this? Are you finding
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:41.780]   any use in it? And after like, I don't know, I'm like having conversations with it for 45 minutes a
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:45.700]   day before I write my email to make sure that I feel good about it. You can be like, that's great. And
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:48.820]   you're doing good. And that's a really good idea. And then you can go back to your desk and just do
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:53.220]   the work. But if there really is something that's helping, then use it. But I think most people right
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:58.020]   now, there's not a major, it's okay. You're not doing something wrong if you don't have like a
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:02.500]   major productivity boosting use case for AI. It's not your job to figure out how to use their products.
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:09.140]   It's their job to convince you that the product is indispensable. So no matter how excited your boss got,
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:15.060]   because he watched a YouTube interview of Dario Amadei saying all jobs are going to be automated
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:20.180]   within 19 minutes. Keep doing your work. Keep doing it well. All right. Who do we got?
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:26.340]   All right. Next up is Amy. Naval Ravikant in his podcast with Chris Williamson says that
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:32.500]   inspiration is perishable. He argues that there is value in doing things spontaneously instead of having
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:37.300]   scheduled time for it. You won't be in the mood to do that thing when the time arrives. He also mentions
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:41.780]   that being able to do something that you want at the moment you want it is liberating.
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:48.820]   He does embody the removing the unnecessary overhead part of where he has no meetings,
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:55.620]   etc., but says that the overly scheduled life is not worth living. Does this contradict with the deep life?
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:37:01.940]   I mean, not to be spicy and like every one of my answers today, and maybe it's this New England air,
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:14.660]   but Naval is basically describing the life of like an 18th century aristocrat. Yes. If you're a moneyed
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:19.300]   gentleman. We can play it if you want to play the clip. Do you have a clip of it? Well, I think you
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:25.140]   captured it. I think that captured the main things. Okay. If you're the type of person that would come
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:33.940]   calling in a Jane Austen novel. Sure. It's probably right. This is like a great way of living, right?
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:39.940]   Because our income comes from our investments and we have freedom of time and we want to use the time
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:46.100]   in the highest ways. And to have a day that's overly scheduled, it probably is like not as life-affirming
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:51.460]   as sort of taking the interest as it arises and pursuing it. And it could be the, you're like,
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:58.580]   uh, I don't know, like, uh, Jason Priestley. Not Jason. I just said Jason Priestley. Jason Priestley is
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:09.700]   from Beverly Hills, 90210, Shannon Doherty's brother. I'm thinking about someone who's very similar.
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:16.340]   Joseph Priestley, I think. Let me just get this name right. Jason Priestley. You need to be like,
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:23.300]   uh, Luke. I don't remember this guy's name. Jason Priestley. All right. So who I am thinking about here
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:30.740]   is Joseph Priestley. I'm pretty close, Jesse. Yeah. Uh, similar to Jason Priestley. Joseph Priestley
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:35.620]   was a gentleman scientist from the 18th century contemporary of Benjamin Franklin, who he crossed
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:39.540]   paths with, who helped isolate oxygen because he just like ran these experiments because
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:44.900]   today I shall horse ride tomorrow. I shall work on experiments. And I agree. It's like a,
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:50.740]   it's probably a really interesting day-to-day way to live. But Naval Ravikant is an incredibly
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:55.300]   successful seed level investor who had early money in Uber and all these other types of companies and
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:39:02.500]   has a lot of money and doesn't have to, um, like a gentleman aristocrat of the 19th century can just sort
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:08.100]   of like let his day unfold. The rest of us, however, if we want to master a craft that's going to be
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:13.060]   meaningful and profitable takes really hard work. It's diligence. Diligence, not just to return to
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:16.900]   that craft day after day and push yourself deliberately, but the diligence to say no to
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:22.580]   other things that are more interesting in the moment because crafting that skill requires repeated time.
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:27.140]   You want to produce something that the market respects to produce something that matters to have
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:32.340]   leverage, create leverage in your life through the value you produce. Like that is hard work. It's
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:37.380]   diligent work. You have to time block. You have to work with your motivational systems. It's not always fun,
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:41.460]   but it can be really fulfilling. I'm sure Naval went through all this when he was an early stage
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:46.180]   investor making his moves early on and trying to understand the market and get in on these early
[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:49.860]   startups. He was involved and it was hard work, but it was probably also really satisfying in that
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:56.740]   stage of life. So anyways, I'm sure Naval is right that, uh, it is very liberating not to have a schedule.
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:01.380]   And actually you would enjoy a lot about your life in the moment, but most of us don't have that
[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:06.420]   opportunity. But more importantly, and I think this is maybe the contrarian stance here,
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:14.340]   is it really better? Again, when are people alive? When are they fulfilled? When they have a purpose
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:22.820]   they're pursuing? When they're able to take their energies and to shape them with discipline and
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:28.660]   motivation to creating something that makes the world better or it's interesting? What deeper satisfactions
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:34.100]   outside of those of community you get? And actually that type of motion, that type of movement towards
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:38.900]   making your intentions manifest concretely in the world, to borrow the Matt Crawford phrase.
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:46.820]   And that's often hard. Crawford talks about that in "Shop Class of Soulcraft," the deep satisfactions of
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:52.820]   commercial electrician work, bending those contuant almost like art so that all of the wires can fit
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:59.460]   into the commercial junction box and it just works. That's hard. You're bending pipes. I watched our AC
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:04.500]   guy bend like two pipes a few months ago when we got a new AC involved. That's hard work. You're heating it
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:09.220]   up at the soldering thing and you're bending it. But he was pretty satisfied when he was done because he made
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:14.580]   that thing work and the machine turns on and the house gets cold. So I don't know. I'm sure it's fun.
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:20.020]   I'm sure it's fine in the moment. I'm sure it is liberating to not have a schedule, not be pushing.
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:23.940]   But when you're pushing on the right things, sometimes that's even better.
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:29.700]   All right. Hopefully our call today, Jesse, doesn't get me fired up anymore. We need something to...
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:33.380]   I don't know what it is, but we need something to calm me down. So if this is a call that says,
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:43.220]   how could I find time to deep work when I am on a submarine in charge of the nuclear reactor and it
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:48.980]   requires 18 hour shifts and my child is with me and I'm doing childcare on the submarine while I'm doing
[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:52.420]   that. When am I doing my deep work? I hope it's not a call like that. I hope it's something that's going to
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:58.980]   call me. All right. Here we go. Hey, Cal, this is Catherine. You've written a lot about how we
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:05.060]   shouldn't be beholden to our email inboxes and the email that comes in should not set our priorities for
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:15.140]   the day, which makes total sense to me intellectually. But as a lifelong inbox zero person, I find it
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:21.860]   incredibly difficult to let go of the sense of control that comes from addressing everything in
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:31.540]   my inbox. Do you have any suggestions for people like me who want to reply to things and address things
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:38.900]   that that come in? Um, are there half measures that you would suggest we take, um, or kind of other
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:45.700]   strategies to lessen the stranglehold of the desire to keep on top of our inboxes? Thanks.
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:52.740]   Let me ask you this, Jesse. Do we still have the slow productivity theme music loaded up on that
[00:42:52.740 --> 00:43:02.260]   board? Because I think this will, I'm in a spicy mood. I think we've got to calm things down.
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:08.820]   All right. That's putting me in the right mindset here. So I'm going to approach this question
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:19.140]   with calm. So I'm going to start by saying with calmness. I know it is a common thing people say
[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:25.540]   about email. Don't stress what's in there. Don't make that be your priority. There's like more important
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:31.380]   things than it. These aren't urgent. People should have better expectations. I know that's a common
[00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:39.700]   response to inbox overload. I don't agree with it though. I actually think you should deal with what's
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:44.580]   in your inbox. You should be able to deal with everything in your inbox. And the solution is not
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:48.980]   to pretend like your inbox isn't there. It's not to pretend like people's expectations are wrong for
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:53.940]   emailing you. It is to reduce the amount of those emails that arrive in your inbox in the first place.
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:59.140]   I'm also an inbox. You're a person. I get very stressed by it. It's social stress. We talked about
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:04.900]   this context of text messages in the last week's deep dive. So I wrote a whole book called The World
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:10.020]   Without Email. It came out in 2021. And the whole premise of that book, well, I guess there's two
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:15.220]   premises. The premise is having a lot of back and forth communication is terrible for us. It makes us
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:20.180]   stressed out. It doesn't make us more productive. But the main idea of the advice in that book
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:26.820]   is we can re-engineer how we collaborate in a professional context so that we're not so dependent on
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:32.180]   unscheduled messages that require responses. That's the thing that creates an anxiety-producing inbox
[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:38.500]   full of messages that have to be dealt with is that you have a dozen or two dozen ongoing virtual
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:44.100]   asynchronous conversations unfolding with messages being bounced back and forth. So any moment you look
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:50.180]   in your inbox, 75% of those conversations have the next message waiting for you. And you kind of have
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:54.020]   to answer those pretty quickly because when you bounce it back to them, they'll bounce it back to you and
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:57.380]   you'll bounce it back to them. And you're doing this game where you're trying to get to an asynchronous
[00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:02.100]   conclusion before too much time goes on. So you have to check that inbox and you have to get down to zero.
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:06.020]   And by the time you get down to zero, there's 24 more messages arrive because they just bounced them
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:11.700]   back to you. The key then is not to ignore that. It is to stop there being so many proverbial ping pong
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:16.820]   balls coming in your direction. And the whole second half of that book, or what's it called,
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:21.460]   a world without email. I was going to say how to become an email superstar,
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:28.980]   which is another awesome title, but a world without email. The whole second half is saying
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:35.620]   when you get emails that are part of a conversation, so not something you can just either informational or
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:39.220]   something you can just answer with a single message. When they're part of a back and forth conversation,
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:46.340]   ask yourself, "What is this conversation about? What type of thing is this trying to bring us to a
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:51.860]   resolution about?" And then you have a short-term and long-term solution here. Short-term for that
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:57.700]   particular conversation, say, "How can I respond to this email that is going to move this out of
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:02.660]   unscheduled messaging from here on out?" And that might mean spending more time on that particular email.
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:06.820]   They say, "Okay, here's the decisions we need to make. Here's the way I think we should do it.
[00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:11.620]   You finish this draft by Wednesday, put it into this Dropbox folder by close of business. I'll pick it up
[00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:16.580]   first thing Thursday morning. I'll annotate it. I'll have any of my annotations in that Dropbox version by
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:22.340]   noon. You can pick it up any time after noon on Thursday to act on those. By the way, we have a meeting
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:27.540]   on this unrelated thing Thursday afternoon. So any unresolved questions, let's just chat real quickly
[00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:32.820]   after that meeting. But otherwise, whatever you have in there at the end of day Thursday, I'm going to
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:37.300]   send on to the designer. We'll have that report put together." That email is more of a pain to write
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:40.900]   than just answering the current email with like, "Yeah, I think so, but when are you available?"
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:46.340]   It takes more time to write, but you have just cauterized the wound of all of those back and forth
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:51.620]   messages. That conversation will no longer generate new messages that require a response in your inbox,
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:57.460]   so the effort was worth it. So we call that process-centric emailing. You respond to ongoing
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:02.100]   chains in ways that breaks the ongoing chain. That reduces the pressure in your inbox. That's
[00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:09.380]   a short-term solution. The long-term solution is you say, "What is the general type of work that this
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:14.980]   responds to? Is this conversation about something that I do again and again? Is there a type of report
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:23.300]   we put out? Is there agenda planning we do for this weekly meeting? Is there client issues that come in
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:29.780]   that are kind of complicated to figure out? What is the regularly occurring work-related process that
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:35.300]   this email conversation is related to?" And you can step back and say, "Let's put in place a different
[00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:41.620]   protocol for dealing with this type of thing. Here's our process for how we produce reports,
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:47.300]   and we synchronize it. We don't need unscheduled messages. Here's our process for dealing with clients.
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:51.940]   There's three days a week where they can call at this time if they want. They don't have to if they have
[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:56.100]   nothing to talk about. But we will be there, and we will answer and chat with them about any question
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:48:00.420]   you have. We'll have our intern take notes. We'll send them a summary of the notes right after and
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:04.340]   about all the things we've committed to doing. And when they next call, we'll tell them how it's going.
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:08.260]   And there we go. We now have a way of dealing with clients that don't require back and forth messages.
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:13.780]   So the long-term solution is creating protocols for regularly occurring business processes that are
[00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:19.300]   right now generating these unscheduled back and forth conversations. That is the killer of inboxes.
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:23.620]   Back and forth conversations consisting of unscheduled messages that require relatively
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:29.620]   timely responses. That is the productivity poison that has to be neutralized. And in this sort of
[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:35.620]   medical analogy, the activated charcoal that you would use here, and I'm really stretching this analogy,
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:41.300]   is being smarter about process and protocol. So I don't think we should ignore inboxes. This is,
[00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:47.940]   by the way, why I think most advice about inboxes fails, because it ignores the psychological reality
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:51.700]   of having messages waiting that require a response. And when you tell me to batch, when you tell me to
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:57.540]   don't check email first thing in the morning, when you tell me to tell people to have new expectations
[00:48:57.540 --> 00:49:02.980]   for when to expect a response, none of that works when you have dozens of messages that really do need
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:08.820]   to be replied to quickly for you to be a useful collaborator in your company. There's too much social
[00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:12.580]   stress around it. So we got to prevent those messages from getting to the inbox in the first
[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:16.500]   place. Read a world without email. More people should read that. I mean, it's not that that book
[00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:20.580]   did poorly, but it probably came in a little bit under the radar in 2021. There's a few other things
[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:25.380]   happening in the world, and people weren't thinking that much about reengineering their business processes.
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:31.060]   So check that book out. If you're curious about the type of things we're talking about, I don't know
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:36.980]   if the theme music really called me down, Jesse, but I tried. It's good to hear it again. Yeah. All right.
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:42.980]   We got a case study here from Doug, who I sort of gave a sermon about Stephen King and a railroad spike.
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:48.020]   I gave my son that same sermon, by the way, I made him read on writing to Stephen King nonfiction book.
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:53.860]   So I'm already fired up about it. Doug, let's hear your case study because I think it's going to make me
[00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:58.820]   chill out a little bit. All right. So Doug says, "I'm a public school teacher in Atlanta,
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:03.700]   and I also write a blog. You talk often about how time and place affect creative energy,
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:07.940]   and I've leaned into that more than ever this summer. The routine I've settled into has been,
[00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:14.420]   one, I do most of my writing in the nearby university library, which is only about a mile
[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:19.380]   and a half from my home. It is beautiful, inspiring, and mostly empty over the summer." Doug, I've been
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:23.940]   doing the same thing here this summer. I did a lot of work at Dartmouth, and I was in the tower room again
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:29.540]   today. It's empty. It's motivating. I love it. All right. Two, I write there in the mornings,
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:33.460]   usually for 90 minutes to two hours. I don't set a timer. That's just about how long I
[00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:38.820]   usually maintain a flow state session. Three, to get there and back, I willingly walk even in the
[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:43.780]   Atlanta heat. I choose a route that takes me through a nature preserve on the grounds of the university,
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:47.700]   and then through the prettiest part of campus. It takes about 30 minutes each way.
[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:51.700]   That whole routine is incredibly productive for me without feeling like work whatsoever.
[00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:56.980]   The time, place, and mode of transportation makes it feel like an indulgent choice of how to spend my time
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:51:03.220]   rather than work. This deep summer has been incredibly satisfying. It's funny,
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:06.900]   everybody I know is worried about me. I haven't done any of the things teachers usually do over
[00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:10.900]   the summer, so people are worried that I'm bored and depressed, and they're surprised when I tell
[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:16.100]   them it's been one of my favorite summers ever. All right, Mia Culpa, Doug, you say here that the
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:21.620]   writing you're doing is for a blog, which I think might be exactly one of those cases I was talking about,
[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:27.460]   where you don't necessarily have to worry about publication. You are enjoying the craft of writing.
[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:33.540]   You're getting better on your own pace, and you're reactivating your creative circuits. This reminds
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:37.300]   me a little bit of the engineered wonder we talked about in the deep dive, right? I mean, it's a little
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:44.020]   bit over the top, which is what's good. 30 minutes, beautiful library, two hours, isolation, flow state.
[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:49.380]   I mean, I think you're getting benefits right now that might be completely unrelated to the writing,
[00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:54.900]   and then you add on top of that the benefits of having a creative outlet during this quiet season
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:52:01.460]   in your year. So I am okay that you're saying, I don't want to right now waste a lot of time trying
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:05.060]   to get better with publication, because your goal here is not, I want to be a published novelist
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:11.540]   or like a well-known columnist. So my rant before doesn't apply to you, Doug, but does apply to other
[00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:16.660]   people who heard that and were thinking like, yeah, I want to be a professional writer, but I shouldn't
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:21.780]   have to submit things. That takes too much time away from my writing. That's who I was talking to, but Doug,
[00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:27.540]   your deep summer sounds delightful. A great example of lifestyle-centric planning and a great example of
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:35.460]   engineered wonder, that idea that we talked about in the show's opening. All right, we got a great final
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:39.460]   segment. We're going to talk about an article I recently sent to my newsletter that I want to bring
[00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:47.940]   to your attention. But first, Jesse, let's hear from another sponsor. So here's the thing about aging.
[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:54.660]   When you're a guy, guys don't think about their skin, not in the way that women know they should be
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:58.660]   thinking about it. So what do we do? When we're young, we can spend all day in the sun,
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:06.180]   basically using industrial roughs removing acid to help our suntan get darker. And our skin still looks
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:12.900]   like a young Scott Baio from Charles in Charge. Jesse last week thought my reference to growing pains
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:18.580]   was too old fashioned. So Jesse, I updated it to something that the kids would understand. It was
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:26.260]   either that or the young character. Oh God, what is his name? I don't even know his name,
[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:32.020]   but the boy who moved to the dude ranch from the city in the 1989 Nickelodeon show, Hey Dude.
[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:38.020]   That was the other reference I was going to make there. So anyways, men don't think about their skin.
[00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:44.500]   You're young, like whatever, it's fine. Then one day as you grow older, you wake up and your skin suddenly
[00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:51.460]   looks like you're a grizzled old gold prospector who there's a 50% chance may actually be a ghost.
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:56.180]   And you think, why did anyone tell me, right? I'm supposed to take care of my skin. And you sort
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:54:01.860]   of wander through Macy's and yell out retinol. What is retinol? I want you to avoid that fate.
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:09.140]   So how are we going to do this with the products of Caldera lab, their high performance skincare
[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:14.340]   products are designed specifically for men. They are simple, effective and backed by science.
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:20.020]   Their products include the good, which is an award-winning serum packed with 27 active botanicals
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:26.180]   their eye serum, which helps reduce the appearance of tired eyes and dark circles and puffiness
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:32.820]   and the base layer, a nutrient rich moisturizer infused with plant stem cells and snow mushroom
[00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:38.980]   extract. This stuff works. They actually accidentally sent me two sets and someone
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:43.620]   relative of ours was visiting was like, I want that set. I was like, yeah, you take it because we're at an
[00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:48.660]   age now we realize we need this stuff. Look at a consumer study, a hundred percent of men said that
[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:54.980]   their skin looks smoother and healthier using Caldera lab products. So men, if you want to look more like
[00:54:54.980 --> 00:55:02.100]   Scott Baio than a gold prospector who may be a ghost, you need to try Caldera lab products.
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:06.100]   Skincare doesn't have to be complicated, but it should be good. Upgrade your routine with Caldera
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:11.700]   lab and see the difference for yourself. Go to calderalab.com/deep and use deep at

[00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:27.220]   If you run an e-commerce business, this is what I want to talk about now, Jesse. If you run an e-commerce
[00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:32.820]   business, you know the best way to be successful is to keep your customers happy. And you know what?
[00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:39.380]   You build trust with your customers one package at a time. That is why smart retailers use ShipStation.
[00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:46.340]   With ShipStation, you can sync orders from everywhere you sell into one dashboard and replace manual tasks
[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:51.860]   with custom automations to reduce shipping errors. And you can do this all at a fraction of the cost.
[00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:59.780]   If we ever add an e-commerce piece to our business, Jesse, we would 100% use ShipStation so we could
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:05.300]   easily track our orders, print labels, and enjoy discounts. With ShipStation on board, the only thing
[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:10.740]   standing between us - I was thinking about this, Jesse - but if we had ShipStation, the only thing
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:16.420]   standing between us and a business fortune would be, and it's a small thing, our complete lack of any
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:23.700]   viable idea for a product to sell. But if we solve that problem, ShipStation would help us become very
[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:27.220]   successful. All right, there's two things I want to highlight about ShipStation that caught my attention.
[00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:34.820]   One, they provide discounts of up to 88% off UPS, DHL Express, and USPS rates. You can also get up to 90%
[00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:41.220]   off of FedEx rates. So just by using them, you're already saving money. You can also seamlessly integrate
[00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:46.900]   their services with selling channels you already use. And they have these features that'll make your
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:52.100]   small e-commerce business seem like it's one of the major players. For example, if you use ShipStation,
[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:58.420]   they can do automated tracking updates that they send to your customers with your company's branding
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:03.940]   in the email. So very cool. So when shoppers choose to buy your products, turn them into loyal customers
[00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:11.060]   with cheaper, faster, and better shipping, go to ShipStation.com/deep to sign up for a free trial.
[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:17.940]   There's no credit card or contract required, and you can cancel any time. That's ShipStation.com/deep.
[00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:24.260]   All right, Jesse, let's move on to our final segment. We usually, in the final segment,
[00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:28.340]   talk about something that I am reading. Today, I want to talk about something that I'm writing.
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:34.180]   This is an email that went out to my newsletter at CalNewport.com last week. It was called "No
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:40.020]   One Knows Anything About AI." If you're not subscribed to my newsletter, CalNewport.com. Each week,
[00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:47.060]   I have an essay about the type of ideas we talk about here on the show. So I wanted to read a couple
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:54.660]   excerpts from this essay because it gets at a topic we talked about a couple times already briefly in
[00:57:54.660 --> 00:58:00.980]   the show in recent months. So I began this essay by saying, I want to present you with two narratives
[00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:05.860]   about AI. Both of them are about using this technology to automate computer programming,
[00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:14.420]   but they point toward two very different conclusions. So the first narrative that I emphasize in this article
[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:19.380]   is the idea that computer programming is very well-suited for large language models because
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:24.900]   programming is basically well-structured text, and models are good at producing that. It's also easy
[00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:31.780]   to train models on it because you can compile the code that it outputs, and if it works, give it a good
[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:37.460]   reinforcement learning signal, and if it doesn't, a bad. So it's really the best-case scenario for training
[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:42.820]   language models. And so this one scenario says it's doing great and programming is basically
[00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:50.100]   being taken over by AI. Here's a few quotes I put to support that narrative. The CEO of the AI company
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:56.420]   Perplexity said that new AI programming tools have cut the time for his engineers to complete tasks from
[00:58:56.420 --> 00:59:01.860]   three to four days down to one hour. He now mandates that all of his employees use it. An article in Inc. said,
[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:07.460]   "The world of software engineering, AI has changed everything." Another article says the tech sector
[00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:13.380]   has seen 64,000 job cuts this year due to AI advancement, and they point out Microsoft in
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:19.460]   particular had many thousands of those cuts because of AI advancements. There was a big new splashy
[00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:25.300]   Atlantic piece that said the computer science bubble is bursting. This is my academic home because AI,
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:29.060]   it says in this article, is ideally suited to replace the very type of person who built it,
[00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:34.500]   so why bother learning computer science? So you read these type of things. There's dozens of these
[00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:38.740]   articles every day. And you say, yeah, okay, computer programmers are rapidly going in the way of the
[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:43.060]   telegraph operator. This is the first place where AI is having a huge seismic disruption.
[00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:49.860]   But as I point out in the article, there's a completely different narrative out there,
[00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:54.900]   depending on what articles you read and what experts you're quoting. So for example,
[00:59:54.900 --> 01:00:01.380]   just a couple of weeks ago, the AI evaluation company METR released the results of a randomized
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:04.900]   control trial where they took two groups of experienced open source software developers,
[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:10.980]   and they said, great, here's a bunch of tasks, programming tasks for you to do. Group A, use AI tools.
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:17.140]   Group B, don't. And guess what? I'm going to quote the paper here. "Surprisingly, we find that when
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:24.740]   developers use AI tools, they take 19% longer than without. AI makes them slower."
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:30.180]   Meanwhile, we're getting all these quotes from experienced developers who were using these tools.
[01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:36.020]   We're like, yeah, they're useful. But this idea that they are, like the tech leaders are saying,
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:39.620]   about to take over all programming jobs, like this is preposterous.
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:44.980]   Simon Willison said, "Quitting programming as a career right now because of LLMs would be like quitting
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:50.740]   carpentry as a career, thanks to the invention of the table saw." The tech CEO, Nick Kami, said the following,
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:57.300]   responding to the claim that the number of people required to produce software is drastically reducing,
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:02.260]   he said, "I feel like I'm being gaslit every time I read this, and I worry it makes folks early in their
[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:08.820]   software development journey feel like it's a bad time investment." Okay, but what about Microsoft
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:16.260]   firing 9,000 people because now the AI can do their jobs? Not what happened? Take a closer look at their
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:21.620]   press release. What's going on? Yes, they cut a lot of jobs across many different divisions,
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:27.460]   not because they were replacing those jobs with AI automation, but because they were trying to free up
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:35.380]   funds to invest in their AI divisions, in particular to help pay for the huge expense of running these AI
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:41.140]   data centers. So yeah, technically speaking, it's correct that Microsoft fired 9,000 people due to
[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:46.900]   AI advancements, but not because they were replaced by AI, but because their work on AI advancements is so
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:52.740]   damn expensive. Same thing with the computer science major bubble bursting. Later on in that same Atlantic
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:58.660]   article, they noted there's another reason why those majors might be down. The tech market started
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:04.340]   contracting after the pandemic because there had been a lot of spending in the tech industry during
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:09.300]   the pandemic, and now they're cutting back. And as a professor said in that Atlantic article,
[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:15.140]   "Enrollment in the computer science major has historically fluctuated with the job market,
[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:19.540]   and prior to clients have always rebounded to enrollment levels higher than when they started."
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:24.020]   This was my first exposure to computer science when I was a young computer science undergraduate
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:30.260]   in the early 2000s. The 2001 dot-com boom had happened. Money was contracting. And you know what
[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:35.140]   happened to computer science majors? Everyone was worried like, "Oh my God, where all the majors go?"
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:38.740]   And then they came back, and then they went down again during the Great Recession. Then they came back.
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:45.300]   It just goes up and down. So what's the point here? Let me read my conclusion. I'm not trying to
[01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:51.860]   battle like, "Hey, which of these is right?" Here's what I want to say about there being two completely
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:57.460]   different narratives on the same topic, all from the same two or three weeks I'm pulling these quotes.
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:03:04.420]   When it comes to AI's impacts, we don't yet know anything for sure. But this isn't stopping everyone
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:11.700]   from pretending like we do. So here's my advice for the moment. Tune out both the most heated and the
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:18.020]   most dismissive rhetoric. Focus on tangible changes in areas that you care about that really do seem
[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:23.140]   connected to AI. Read widely, and more importantly, ask people you trust about what they're actually
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:30.500]   seeing. And beyond that, follow AI news with a large grain of salt. All this is too new for anyone to
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:36.100]   really understand what they're saying. AI is important, but we don't yet fully know why."
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:41.700]   So there you go, Jesse. I just thought it was really interesting that I could find a huge number
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:45.700]   of articles saying one thing and a huge number of articles saying the other thing. And it's not like
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:51.380]   these are sequenced. We used to think this, and now our opinion changed. These are almost all from the
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:59.060]   same two-week period. So headlines are getting out of control when it comes to AI. Wait until you see
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:04.100]   the stuff you do is being affected and then talk to actual people who are being affected and say how,
[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:08.100]   because the headlines will drive you crazy. You're either going to start digging a bunker
[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:18.020]   and doing the pull-ups on the bar from Terminator 2 that Connor has to start doing when she's in the
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:22.980]   mental asylum because she knows that the Terminator war is coming because she's seen the future
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:26.980]   and she's trying to prepare for it. I don't remember her first name. Man, I'm getting so old.
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:34.020]   Connor. John Connor is the son and, well, whatever. She got really ripped. The actress who was playing
[01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:40.580]   John Connor's, you know what I'm talking about. Yeah. Uh, so you're either doing that, like preparing to,
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:46.180]   she, I think at some point, John Connor's mom can fire. She's firing like an M60 from like a shoulder
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:51.460]   crook. So you can prepare to do that. Or on the other hand, you can be shorting all tech stocks because it's
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:56.420]   all like at a crazy inflated bubble scam. Or you could say like, I'm not going to follow those
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:05:02.420]   headlines right now because most of them are crazy. And it's not my job to figure out what's useful
[01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:08.500]   about these products. It's their job to tell, show me indisputably, this is vital for your life. That
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:13.220]   was clear to me when I first saw Google. That was clear to me when I first saw email. That's been clear
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:18.020]   to a lot of computer programmers when it comes to some of these new programming tools in terms of like really
[01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:22.500]   speeding up the time of figuring out how to write boilerplate code or figuring out library calls.
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:27.140]   When it's clear, it's clear. And if it's not yet clear, you don't have to go sifting through headlines
[01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:31.460]   to figure out why. It's the product's job. It's the company's job to figure out why they're useful.
[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:36.420]   Don't trust the headlines. Grain of salt. No one knows anything. Everyone pretends like they do.
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:41.940]   That's basically my summary of AI. I would say, Jesse, this is one of the spicier episodes we had in a while. But
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:47.620]   again, I think it's this cool new England air. I mean, it's like 72 degrees right now, Jesse. I don't
[01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:53.300]   want to make you jealous. Yeah. And there's like almost no humidity. Oh, we got to just build a
[01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:58.900]   compound up here. That's the plan. We need a deep work compound to just escape and have me just do rants
[01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:05.220]   about writing habits and AI. That's the goal. All right. Speaking of which, that's all the time
[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:09.940]   we have for today. We'll be back next week with another episode, God willing, recorded from the
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:16.100]   Deep Work HQ. I'm looking forward to that. But until then, as always, stay deep. If you enjoyed today's
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:22.180]   discussion about engineered wonder and you want some more sort of philosophical fare, check out episode
[01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:29.860]   357, which was titled, What Worries the Internet's Favorite Philosopher? I actually wrote that script
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:36.340]   at Disney, so it all connects. Check that out. I think you'll like it. In a New Yorker profile
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:43.380]   rather that came out earlier this year, he was named the internet's new favorite philosopher.
