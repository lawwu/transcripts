[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.000]   All right, we have a question from Sophie.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.800]   Sophie asks, how do you manage long research projects
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.400]   while reducing anxiety?
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.720]   Sophie has some elaboration.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.280]   She says, I'm a PhD researcher in economics.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.840]   From the start of a research project,
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.760]   a publishing the paper usually takes three to four years.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.360]   Wow.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.120]   How do I manage this type of long and drag
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.160]   your research project perhaps intertwined
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.120]   with other concurrent projects?
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.800]   All right, well, that's long.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.560]   Three to four years is quite long.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.560]   I'm assuming at that duration what happens
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.880]   is three to four years of work and then a bunch of papers
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.240]   you produce at the end of it.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.160]   If not, make that the case?
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.520]   I don't know economics well, but I
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.600]   do remember Adam Grant explained this to me at some point.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.440]   I was talking to the author, Adam Grant, who's
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.600]   also a professor at Wharton.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.880]   And he talked about this, that in their work, which
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.240]   is very data analysis oriented, he's very economics oriented,
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.480]   even though he's a business professor,
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.720]   there's a long period of trying to get access
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.240]   to data sets that are good.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.840]   And then once you have those data sets
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.040]   and you've really learned them, you
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.480]   pluck a lot of fruit from them, paper, paper, paper, paper.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.780]   So that might help, by the way.
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.040]   You might amortize here.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.600]   When you're doing these long projects,
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.920]   think about getting lots of papers out of the project.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.600]   The other things I'll suggest--
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.920]   this was sort of an approach I've seen a lot in academia--
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.240]   the two plus one rule.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.160]   So have two big projects you're working on at one time,
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.520]   but in different stages.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.480]   So you have a project that's really in the hardcore,
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.160]   we're analyzing the data, we're starting to write stage.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.200]   Have another one that's in the very early stage.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.440]   I'm negotiating with the French Census Bureau
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.200]   to try to get the data I'm going to need
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.040]   to do my big Thomas Piketty style economic growth
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.040]   analysis or something.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.960]   So different stages.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.040]   So the early stage project where it requires sporadic attention
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.440]   and you can put it on hold for a couple of weeks at a time
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.120]   is OK.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.560]   You feel better about that because your second project
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.760]   is much closer to completion.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.560]   And once that's done, your first project
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.200]   gets closer to completion, you can add in another early stage.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.600]   So that's the two of the two plus one rule.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.520]   The plus one is do something small
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.560]   that ships at least once every four to six months.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.640]   So you feel like there's some progress happening.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.080]   So hey, every semester I'm going to write,
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.520]   I'm going to publish a book review,
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.800]   I'm going to do a short paper.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.360]   I'm going to go back to this data set I really analyzed
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.280]   and wrote some epic papers about, let me take a month
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.400]   and put half of my research time onto extracting
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.120]   an additional cool little insight that's
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.960]   going to be a short note or a conference talk
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.920]   or something like that.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.800]   So there's some wheel of public production
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.080]   that spins at a faster rate.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.640]   So two plus one is a good rule for these type of research
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.200]   fields.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
