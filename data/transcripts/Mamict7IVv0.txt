[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.640]   A pastor writes in to ask, "Pastor John, would a pastor who uses a biblical commentary
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.640]   written by a woman be placing himself under the biblical instruction of a woman?
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.600]   If so, would this not go against Paul's instruction in 1 Timothy 2.12?"
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.320]   It might be.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.160]   He may feel it that way, and if he does, he probably is not going to read it, he shouldn't
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.160]   read it.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.160]   It doesn't have to be experienced that way, I don't think, and here's my reasoning.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.720]   The point of Paul in 1 Timothy 2.12 where he says, "I don't permit a woman to teach
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.760]   or have authority over men."
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.560]   That's a key text, 1 Timothy 2.12.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.680]   "I don't permit her to teach or have authority."
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.560]   Those two things together, I think, constitute the eldership office, teaching and authority.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.760]   There should be men elders in the church who are spiritual and humble and kind and loving
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.120]   and Christ-like in their servant heart towards the men and women in the church.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.640]   I think the point of that text is not to say you can never learn anything from a woman.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.640]   That's just not true.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.360]   It's not true biblically, and it's not true experientially, because the reason for saying
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.800]   that I don't permit a woman to teach or have authority over men here is not because she's
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.800]   incompetent.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.400]   It's not because she can't have thoughts.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.780]   In fact, the women in your church and the woman you're married to have many thoughts
[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:40.040]   that you would do well to know and learn from, and so the issue there is not she doesn't
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.480]   have thoughts that you wouldn't benefit from or she can't teach you anything.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:53.860]   The issue is one of how does manhood and womanhood work?
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:01.000]   What is the dynamic between how men flourish and women flourish as God designed them to
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.360]   flourish when an act of authority is being exerted on a man from a woman?
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:17.520]   So I distinguish between personal, direct exercises of authority that involve manhood
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.080]   and womanhood because it's personal.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.080]   She's right there.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.560]   She's woman, I'm man, and I'm being directly pressed on by this woman in an authoritative
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.620]   way.
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.780]   Should she be doing that?
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.200]   Should I be experiencing that?
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.560]   And my answer is no.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.040]   I think that's contrary to the way God made us.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.640]   So those two words, personal and direct, here would be an example of what I mean.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.080]   A drill sergeant that gets in the face and says, "Hut, one, hut, two, keep your mouth
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.120]   shut, private, get your rifle up here, turn around, lock a set," I don't think a woman
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.320]   ought to be doing that to a man because it's direct, it's forceful, it's authoritative,
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.280]   it's compromising something about the way a man and a woman were designed by God to
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.280]   relate.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.160]   The opposite would be where she is a city planner, she's sitting in an office at a desk
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.320]   drawing which streets should be one way and which streets should be two way, and thus
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.280]   she's going to control which way men drive all day long.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.720]   That's a lot of authority, and it's totally impersonal and indirect, and therefore has
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.120]   no dimension of maleness or femaleness about it, and therefore I don't think contradicts
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.640]   anything that Paul is concerned about here.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.960]   So I would put a woman writing a book way more in that category of city planner than
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:49.440]   of a drill sergeant so that the personal directness of it is removed and the man doesn't feel
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.760]   himself and she wouldn't feel herself in any way compromised by his reading that book and
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.520]   learning from that book.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.680]   So that's the way I've tried to think it through in society and in the academic efforts
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.680]   and in the church.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.280]   So that's reading and benefiting from a woman's exegesis in private.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.200]   Would you have any reservations about quoting from that commentary by a woman in a public
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   sermon?
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.000]   I think that's just an extension of the same principle.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.360]   Here's a truth, a woman saw it, she shared it in a book, and I now quote it because I'm
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.280]   not having a direct, authoritative confrontation.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.160]   She's not looking at me and confronting me and authoritatively directing me as woman.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:46.480]   There's this interposition of this phenomenon called book and writing that puts her out
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:53.760]   of my sight and in a sense takes away the dimension of her female personhood, whereas
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.480]   if she were standing right in front of me and teaching me as my shepherd week in and
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.000]   week out, I couldn't make that separation.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.040]   She is woman and I am man and she is becoming to me my shepherd week in and week out, which
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.480]   is why I think the Bible says that women shouldn't be that role in the church.
