[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.300]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.980]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.620]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.860]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.100]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.180]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.420]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.300]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.420]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.260]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.980]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.540]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.460]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.420]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.680]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.500]   Well, listeners, welcome to summer.
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.180]   As I record this podcast with you today,
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.180]   it is early June and many of our students
[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.340]   have had enough time since community ended
[00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.700]   to begin maybe not being bored,
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.700]   but to start looking around for something to do.
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.840]   And maybe you, as moms and dads are thinking,
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.840]   "Hmm, I don't want us to lose all of the learning skills
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.980]   that we practice together and all of the routines
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.180]   that we enjoyed throughout the year.
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.020]   I want something for us to do together."
[00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.300]   And reading aloud together is a wonderful way
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.780]   to start the day or end the day
[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.020]   or take a break during the day or all of the above.
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.020]   Reading aloud as a family has multiple benefits, right?
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.420]   You know this.
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.260]   It builds community, even community in your family.
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.180]   It builds closeness between you and all of your children
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.980]   of various ages.
[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.820]   Many families have from preschoolers
[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.780]   to challenge students in the same family.
[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.000]   And a lot of families wonder,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.520]   "What could I read that would interest everybody,
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.180]   that everybody could grab a hold of in some way?"
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.860]   So we wanna talk this summer
[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.380]   over the course of the next month
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.000]   and even a little bit into July
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.340]   about ways that we can read together as a family.
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.220]   Having shared memories of stories that become beloved
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.140]   or poems that really resonate with your family,
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.440]   even songs that you learn together,
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.280]   Bible passages that you memorize together
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.880]   or study together become shared memories
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.700]   for you and your family that will last a lifetime,
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.640]   that will continue to draw your family close together,
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.600]   maybe even become touchstones for your family.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.560]   Read aloud time becomes a really sweet time of connection
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.440]   where you can exchange ideas,
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.480]   wrestle with feelings, ask questions,
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.240]   like, "What does that word mean?"
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.280]   Or, "Is that what that word looks like
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.080]   when you write it down?"
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.400]   I can remember as a child, I read voraciously,
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.480]   but I read to myself.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.920]   And my parents really didn't read to me
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.400]   after I learned to read on my own.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.760]   So there were lots of words that I knew the meaning of
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.240]   because I had read them,
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.400]   but I'd never heard them said aloud.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.480]   And boy, that cost me some degree of embarrassment
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.680]   several times.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.200]   So reading together aloud as a family
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.740]   allows you to learn new things that you might not learn
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.160]   if you're reading by yourself.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.000]   Reading as a family becomes heart time.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.360]   I'd encourage you to find time.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.360]   So reading as a family has multiple benefits
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.680]   and community is one of them.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.280]   Context sharing is also one of them.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.480]   There are lots of pieces of literature
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.880]   that you can share with your children,
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.800]   even when they're very young.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.720]   Fables, myths, legends,
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.880]   historical stories, biographical sketches
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.640]   that will build context for your students
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.840]   as they read more advanced literature later on.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:51.000]   Years ago, when I was still tutoring Challenge One,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.360]   I had a student who would say,
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.040]   I bet he said it at least once a week
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.480]   during our community time.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.240]   He would look up and he would say,
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.360]   "Oh, was that a reference?"
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.000]   And what he meant was we were always alluding
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   to past stories, pieces of literature,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.860]   myths, legends, quotes, people's lives.
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.080]   We were always alluding to something
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.960]   that the students had been exposed to earlier,
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.760]   maybe in foundations, maybe in an earlier challenge,
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.420]   maybe from Bible study at home or at church.
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.040]   When we read together with our families,
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.200]   we are able to build a context,
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.240]   a listening context for our children
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.720]   that will give them information
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.440]   they will be able to use
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.440]   as they continue strengthening their reading muscles.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.640]   Allusions and references that will occur over and over
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.000]   for our children as they continue to read.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.360]   So reading as a family has as a benefit,
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.360]   community, context, and a catalyst.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:17.080]   Reading together as a family can really be a catalyst
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.080]   for sharing questions,
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:26.000]   mining your children's and your own curiosity.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.920]   It can be a catalyst for shared learning
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.140]   and shared exploring.
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:39.120]   Reading together as a family lights the fire of wonder
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.000]   in everybody who participates.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.680]   You can cultivate wonder
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.440]   as you read with your children this summer.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.480]   Wonder about the world God has made.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.480]   Wonder about the people He has used through history.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.600]   Wonder about what God is leading your children
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.320]   and your family to do in His world.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.200]   What has He called you to do?
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.600]   How has He shaped you?
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.880]   What are your kids interested in?
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.720]   What are they good at?
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.760]   You may discover all of that
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.560]   as you read together this summer.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.480]   Now, today, I really wanna talk to you guys
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.760]   about our "Story of Rome" series.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.720]   I know that some of you have been reading already
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.080]   the stories in "Stories of Rome,"
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.600]   "The Kings of Rome," "Emperors of Rome,"
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.920]   "Senators of Rome" series.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.840]   You have found something to love in that.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.400]   Some of you are still thinking,
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.000]   "Eh, the story of Rome, what does that have to do with me?
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.520]   "My kids are not gonna learn Latin for a long time.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.120]   "My kids are little and they don't care about Rome.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.840]   "They don't even know where Rome is.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.760]   "I'm not even sure where in Italy Rome is."
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.280]   Okay, so I wanna give you some reasons
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.000]   why should you read "The Story of Rome."
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.280]   Well, here's one thing, one way to look at it.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.240]   "The Story of Rome" is really
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.480]   the story of the Western world.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.000]   It has tons of stories about men,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.680]   about government, about struggles, about power.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.880]   The story of Rome is the Western world
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.880]   that became the world we know today.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:38.080]   We can see our roots in many of these stories
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.760]   and thus understand the fruit
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.240]   that we see around us today.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.080]   That alone would provide huge catalyst
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.320]   for conversations with your older students
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.720]   who are beginning to study world governments
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.720]   and the struggles of men to govern themselves and others.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.760]   So why else should we read "The Story of Rome?"
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.600]   This is a cool thing.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.800]   We meet characters that will allow us
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.920]   to discuss virtue with our children,
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.440]   whether they are preschoolers
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.160]   or 11, 12-year-olds or teenagers.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.840]   We meet characters in "The Story of Rome"
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.360]   that allow us to discuss virtue
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.360]   and can show us real people wrestling with the choices,
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:42.440]   some of those choices that we might recognize ourself.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.440]   In "The Story of Rome," we meet good guys and bad guys,
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.280]   but here's the deal.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:54.280]   Both good guys and bad guys give us chances to ask why.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.880]   Why did they do that?
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.920]   What else could they have done?
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:08.280]   What did that guy's actions start?
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.840]   How was this situation turned for the better?
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:22.200]   How did this situation devolve into a worse situation?
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.480]   Here's the thing.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.680]   Human nature doesn't change.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.360]   And when you read stories that are set in the past,
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.160]   stories that come to us from antiquity,
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.000]   you'll see that although time changes,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.120]   human nature doesn't.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.680]   And so you will find good guys and bad guys
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.520]   in "Stories of Rome" that look amazingly like
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.640]   the good guys and bad guys of today.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.760]   Another reason to read "Stories of Rome"
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:55.260]   is that you will find the story of the early church
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.640]   intertwined.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:01.120]   Church history and Roman history is interwoven.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.680]   And so we find connections as we go.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.980]   For instance, when you hear about Caesar Augustus
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.980]   putting out attacks over the world, over the country,
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.440]   there's some connection.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.260]   You know what might have been happening in the world
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.780]   that touches our Bible stories as well.
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:27.140]   Now it is true that studying, reading the "Stories of Rome"
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.540]   will give you some context for your Latin studies.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.020]   And I wanna tell you guys that the stories
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:37.260]   in "The Kings of Rome" have a lot to do
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.980]   with timeline cards and our cycle work memory,
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.220]   our cycle one memory work.
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:48.060]   So as you prepare for the fall,
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:53.020]   hey, go ahead and start reading "Kings of Rome" this summer
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:56.980]   and you'll be amazed at the memory pegs
[00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.440]   you will begin to pound in for your children.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.060]   Here's what I'd like to do today.
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:08.060]   I want to read you three short stories from "Kings of Rome."
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:13.100]   Now, listen, three stories,
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:17.220]   but the stories are like a page, two pages,
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:18.900]   a page and a half long.
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.780]   So I'm gonna read you three stories
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.380]   and then we are going to,
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:28.380]   I'm gonna offer you some ideas for discussion.
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.500]   So after you read this stories with your children,
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.660]   how could you elicit some conversation?
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.500]   What could you wrestle with?
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.140]   I think that you will enjoy it immensely.
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:49.540]   Now, if you want to use the three stories
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.380]   as a read aloud for your students,
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.020]   you can stop the podcast now
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:58.140]   and then you can call your kids in
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.780]   and you can use this, the next three stories
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.940]   as a read aloud time.
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:08.940]   It might make the perfect rest time after lunch
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.780]   or before you go to the swimming pool
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.700]   or when it's too hot outside to play.
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.780]   So you get ready, settle in,
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.500]   and I'm gonna read to you three of the stories
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:27.500]   from our Copper Lodge Library edition, "Kings of Rome."
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:33.380]   Story one, "The Lady Roma."
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:38.060]   Long, long years ago, Troy,
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.460]   one of the great cities in Asia Minor
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.300]   was taken by the Greeks.
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:49.300]   Many mighty Trojans had defended their city well
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.380]   and among them all,
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:56.380]   none had fought more bravely than the Prince of Rome.
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.580]   And the Prince, Aeneas.
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:03.300]   But when Aeneas saw that the Greeks had set fire
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.660]   to the city, he fled carrying, it is said,
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:12.580]   his father on his shoulders and grasping by the hand,
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.780]   his son, Ascanius.
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.740]   Moreover, so precious to him was the sacred image
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.340]   of the goddess palace that he saved it
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.380]   from the burning city.
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.260]   The gods, pleased with his reverence,
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.140]   helped him in his flight by building a ship.
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.860]   So when Aeneas reached the sea,
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.660]   he at once embarked in it with his followers
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:42.980]   and their wives and sailed away to seek for a new land
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.260]   in which to build a new city.
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.180]   As the Trojans sailed,
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.340]   they saw a bright star shining above them.
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:55.500]   Day and night, the star was always to be seen,
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:00.500]   showing the seafarers the direction in which to steer.
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:05.340]   At length, the Trojans reached the Western shore of Italy
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:10.340]   and here at a town called Latium, they disembarked.
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.580]   The women were weary of the sea
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.940]   and no sooner had they landed than they began to wonder
[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:22.180]   how they could persuade their husbands to journey no farther
[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.340]   but to settle in the pleasant country
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.220]   which they had reached.
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.700]   Among these women was a lady of noble birth
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.220]   who was as wise as she was good.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.460]   Roma, for that was the lady's name,
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.360]   proposed that they should burn the ship
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.060]   in which they had sailed.
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.380]   Then it would be impossible for their husbands
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:48.340]   to go any farther in search of a new home.
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.460]   The other women agreed to Roma's daring plan
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:56.460]   and with mingled hope and fear, the ship was set on fire.
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:01.020]   When the men saw the flames devouring the vessel,
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.620]   they were troubled.
[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:06.700]   But when they found out how it had been set on fire,
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.340]   they were angry.
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:13.340]   Yet as anger could not give them back their ship
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.460]   and as Italy was a pleasant land,
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.300]   the men did as the women wished.
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.460]   They settled near a hill called Mount Palatine
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.340]   and there they built a city.
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:30.100]   Some old stories tell that the city was called Rome
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.900]   after Roma, the noble lady who had first thought
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.180]   of setting the ship on fire.
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.780]   But other stories say that the country
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:43.260]   in which Anais landed belonged to a king
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.260]   named Latinus, who welcomed the Trojan
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.420]   and gave him ground on which to build.
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:53.860]   Anais married Lavinia, the daughter of the king,
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:58.500]   and called the city which he built after her, Lavinanum.
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:03.340]   Soon after this, King Latinus was killed in battle
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:08.340]   and then for three years, Anais ruled well and wisely,
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:12.620]   not only over his own Trojan followers,
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:16.620]   but also over the subjects of his royal father-in-law.
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:21.620]   His people he now called Latins in memory of King Latinus.
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.820]   When the three years were past,
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:27.620]   war broke out against the Etruscans,
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:32.340]   who were at that time the most powerful tribe in Italy.
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:35.660]   One day, a terrible storm overtook the armies
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.060]   on the battlefield.
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:41.180]   So dark grew the clouds that the soldiers
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.020]   could not see each other.
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:49.020]   When at length the sky cleared, Anais had disappeared
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:53.140]   and was seen no more on earth.
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:57.060]   "The gods have taken him away," said the Latins.
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:01.340]   So they built an altar and henceforth worshiped their king
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.820]   as the god Jupiter.
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:07.820]   Ascanius, who had escaped from Troy with his father,
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:11.820]   now ruled in Levinanum, but he soon found
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.260]   that the city was not large enough for all his people.
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.580]   So leaving Levinanum, he built a new city
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:23.580]   and called it Alba Longa, or the Long White City.
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:29.380]   Alba Longa stood in the midst of the Albin Hills,
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:33.160]   not far from the site on which Rome itself
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.840]   was soon to be built.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.140]   Story two, The She-Wolf.
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:45.980]   After the death of Ascanius, nearly 300 years passed away
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.580]   and then a king named Proca died,
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.940]   leaving behind him two sons.
[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.960]   The name of the elder was Numitor,
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.980]   the name of the younger, Amulius.
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:03.780]   The crown belonged by right to Numitor, the elder son,
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.980]   but Amulius, who was ambitious,
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.060]   was not willing that his brother should reign.
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:15.060]   So he said to Numitor, "One of us shall wear the crown
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:19.000]   "and to the other shall belong the gold and treasures
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.380]   "left by our father, Proca."
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:26.660]   The story does not tell if Numitor was indignant
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:31.420]   with his brother and said that the crown belonged to him.
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.900]   It only tells that Numitor chose to reign,
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.620]   as was indeed his right.
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.940]   Amulius then seized the gold and treasure
[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:45.820]   and bribed his followers to drive Numitor from the throne
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.740]   and to make him king.
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:53.740]   This, in their greed, they were persuaded to do.
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:57.140]   Before long, Numitor was banished from the city
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:01.560]   and Amulius, to his great content, began to reign.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.340]   But the king was soon surprised to find
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:10.340]   that the crown rested uneasily upon his head.
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.980]   It might be that the children of Numitor
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.880]   would someday wrench the crown from him,
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.140]   even as he had wrenched it from their father.
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.660]   That this might never be, Amulius,
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.300]   thinking to get rid of fear,
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.860]   ordered Numitor's son to be slain
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.520]   while his daughter, Sylvia, was kept
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.220]   by the command of the king
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:38.620]   in a temple sacred to the goddess Vesta.
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.540]   Here, the maiden tended the altar fire,
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:45.060]   which was never allowed to die.
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.220]   But the god Mars, angry it might well be
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.580]   with the cruelty of Amulius,
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:54.080]   took pity upon the maiden and sent twin sons
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.140]   to cheer her in her loneliness.
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:02.140]   Such strong, beautiful babes had never before been seen.
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.540]   As for the king, when he heard the births
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:09.220]   of these little boys, he was both angry and afraid,
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.500]   lest they should grow into strong men
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.740]   and wrest his kingdom from him.
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.580]   In his fear, Amulius ordered Sylvia
[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.180]   to be shut up in a prison for the rest of her life,
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.120]   and her beautiful boys he commanded
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.320]   to be thrown into the river Tiber.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.280]   Heavy rains had fallen of late,
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:35.280]   and as the king knew, the river had overflowed its banks.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.240]   But of this, he reckoned not at all.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:44.240]   Although, indeed, the flood was to be his undoing.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:50.000]   Two servants, obeying the cruel order of Amulius,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.020]   placed the baby boys in a basket,
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:57.020]   and going to the Tiber, flung their burden into the river.
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.700]   Like a boat, the basket floated hither and thither
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:05.000]   on the water until at length, carried onward by the flood,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.640]   it was washed ashore at the foot of a hill
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.920]   called Mount Palatine.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.520]   Here, under the shade of a wild fig tree,
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.320]   the basket was overturned, and the babes lay safe
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.780]   and sound upon the dry ground,
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.840]   while the river stole softly backward
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.900]   into its accustomed channel.
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:31.400]   Before long, the babes awoke hungry and began to cry.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:35.320]   A she-wolf, coming to the edge of the river to drink,
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:39.520]   heard their cries, and carried them away to her cave,
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.040]   where she fed them with her milk,
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.400]   just as she would have fed her lost cubs.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.280]   She washed them, too, as she was used
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.420]   to washing her own children by licking them with her tongue.
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:58.480]   Story three, the twin boys.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:04.060]   The twin boys, it was said, were guarded by the god Mars.
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:09.080]   So it was not strange that as they grew older,
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.340]   the god should send his sacred birds, the woodpeckers,
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.260]   to feed the children.
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:18.260]   In and out of the cave, the birds flew each day,
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:21.420]   bringing with them food for the little boys.
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.620]   But neither the wolf nor the birds
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.100]   could do all that was needful.
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:30.020]   So before long, the god who watched over the children
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.720]   sent Faustulus to their aid.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:38.500]   Faustulus was one of the herdsmen of King Amulius.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.580]   He had often seen the wolf going in and out of the cave
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.260]   and had noticed, too, how the woodpeckers
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.340]   came and went each day.
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.520]   So when the wolf went off to prowl in the woods,
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.320]   Faustulus ventured into the cave,
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:57.020]   where to his amazement, he found two beautiful
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.620]   and well-fed children.
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:03.380]   He took them in his arms and carried them home to his wife.
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:06.260]   She gladly welcomed the little strangers,
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.620]   and naming them Romulus and Remus,
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:13.620]   brought them up as though they had been her own sons.
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:17.160]   As the years passed, the boys grew ever more beautiful.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.420]   Stronger and braver, too, they became,
[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:23.100]   until the rough herdsmen among whom they dwelt
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.180]   called them princes.
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.940]   The lads soon showed that they were fitted
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.020]   to lead the herdsmen.
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.300]   If wild beasts attacked the flocks
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.980]   or if robbers tried to steal them,
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:39.220]   Romulus and Remus were ever the first to attack
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:43.860]   and to drive away either the robbers or the wild beast.
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.500]   Faustulus lived on Mount Palatine,
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.700]   near the spot where the boys had been washed ashore
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.500]   when they were babes.
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.740]   This hill belonged to the cruel King Aemulius,
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.600]   and it was his sheep and cattle that the princes,
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.440]   unwitting of the evil the king had done to them,
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.180]   defended from danger.
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:09.340]   Not far from Mount Palatine was another hill
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.380]   named Mount Aventine,
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:15.080]   and here also were herdsmen guarding flocks,
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:20.080]   but these herdsmen belonged to the dethroned King Numitor.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:25.020]   Numitor was living quietly in the city of Alba.
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:28.700]   Now, it chanced that the herdsmen of Aemulius
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:32.700]   began to quarrel with the herdsmen of Numitor.
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:36.380]   One evening, forgetting all about their enemies,
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:39.540]   the shepherds on Mount Palatine were merrymaking
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.680]   at a festival in honor of the god Pan.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:47.020]   Then the herdsmen on Mount Aventine said one to the other,
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:50.060]   "See, here's our chance.
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:55.060]   We will lay an ambush for these unwary merrymakers."
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:26:00.420]   As the gods willed, they captured none other than Remus,
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:04.320]   and well-pleased with their prize,
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:09.320]   they carried the prince a prisoner to their master Numitor.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:17.300]   Now guys, that probably seems like a cliffhanger.
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.780]   What about Romulus?
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:23.780]   And will Numitor discover who this kidnapped prince
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.740]   really is?
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:30.420]   If you want to know the answer to that question,
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:32.780]   and lots more I bet you have,
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:37.700]   you can get a copy of "The Kings of Rome" and keep reading.
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:43.020]   All right, moms and dads, I want to help you
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:48.020]   think about how you could ask some questions
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:54.080]   about your reading that would cultivate a few conversations,
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:59.100]   maybe get people talking and stoke the enthusiasm
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.120]   for the stories that you just read.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.820]   Lots of you have heard about the five core habits,
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:09.080]   and I want you to know that they are natural to all of us,
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.760]   not just our little kids.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:16.560]   And adding those habits naturally, intentionally,
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.980]   to your reading conversations,
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.760]   you will see how the fun grows.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:26.420]   Our little children are really good at naming and attending
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:30.540]   and memorizing and expressing and storytelling,
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:34.980]   and you will have tons of fun picking their brains
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:39.020]   and letting their minds wonder and wander.
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.820]   So here's some ideas.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:45.820]   You could begin asking them, who's in the story?
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:50.700]   You can ask them, when we read this story together,
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:54.020]   who did you hear about?
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:58.260]   So for instance, if you read "The She-Wolf Story,"
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.960]   that's the second story that we read,
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.740]   you could say, who are the characters?
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:05.740]   And your children might be able to tell you,
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:10.740]   well, the brothers, Numitor and Amulius,
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:15.900]   and their sister, do you remember, Sylvia, twin boys.
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:20.700]   The She-Wolf could even be a character.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:24.780]   You could ask your children now, where did the story happen?
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.500]   One thing you could do is grab a map
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:32.500]   and look at present day Italy,
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:37.100]   and try to figure out where you and your children think
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:41.780]   Alba Longa, the long white city, could have been.
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:46.700]   And then go through the story, ask your children,
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:51.260]   are there any words that seemed new to you?
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:56.260]   Any words that you weren't quite sure what the word meant?
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:01.640]   The word wrench in there, the word wrench,
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.540]   when it talked about that Amulius was worried
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:09.540]   that someone might wrench the crown away from him,
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.380]   you might have to explain that wrench
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:17.020]   is a word that seems sort of mean,
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:21.260]   and it can mean a sudden tearing away or grabbing.
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:25.420]   Your children are gonna attend to words
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:29.700]   that they don't know, or words that are fun to say,
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:33.540]   or words that they hear repeated.
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:37.100]   A lot of times young children are even better than grownups
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:41.780]   at attending to the surface details, what the names were,
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:46.280]   what the people were described as looking like.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:51.280]   You can really help them tap into this talent
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.420]   by appealing to their five senses.
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:59.420]   You could ask them, what do you think Numitor looked like?
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:04.100]   What do you think his voice might have sounded like?
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.300]   You could ask them, what does the wind sound like?
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:10.440]   What does a storm sound like?
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:16.580]   You could ask, what do you think the gold and treasure
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.500]   of Amulius looked like?
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:22.940]   How big do you think that the treasure was?
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:25.420]   Do you think it sparkled?
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.020]   What do you think the crowns looked like
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:31.100]   back in the kings of Rome days?
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.460]   Have you ever seen a fig tree?
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.140]   You could talk about things
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.140]   that your children absolutely know,
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:40.500]   even if they haven't seen a fig tree,
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.460]   they've seen a shade tree.
[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.040]   What does it feel like in the shade?
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:49.000]   Maybe you want to go outside and stand in the sun
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.420]   for long enough to get hot and then stand in the shade
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.700]   and ask them, how is it different?
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.860]   How would you describe the difference?
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:03.380]   You could say, have you ever smelled a river?
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.220]   Now your kids might laugh at you
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:08.660]   because they've thought about what does a river feel like
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:13.180]   and maybe what does a river sound like as it rushes by,
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.740]   but what does it smell like?
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:19.100]   If you have a chance, take a trip to a river
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.020]   or to another body of water
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:24.460]   and encourage your children to close their eyes
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:28.220]   and sit very still and use their sense of smell
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.360]   and see what they can detect.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:36.620]   You can ask your children, where does the story take place?
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.060]   And when does the story take place?
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:42.820]   So they will be able to say that the She-Wolf story
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:47.820]   takes place in ancient times, in Italy, in ancient times,
[00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:53.020]   even before Rome was founded and that was in the 700 BC.
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:57.420]   So you can ask them,
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:00.420]   is there more than one location in the story?
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.320]   Does some of the story happen in one place,
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:07.460]   like a king's courtyard?
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:10.620]   And does some of the story happen in another place,
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:12.700]   like in the forest?
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:16.580]   You can ask about all of the people in the story
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:18.260]   and what they were like.
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.580]   So what was Numitor like?
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:25.500]   He was the oldest and who was Amulius?
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.820]   He was the younger son.
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:31.800]   What was he like and how can you tell?
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:35.980]   So they might tell you that he was greedy or tricky
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:38.640]   and you can say, how do you know that?
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.580]   And they will talk to you about what he did
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.540]   and you might be able to talk to your children
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:48.540]   about the way others see you is based
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:52.180]   not on what you think about yourself, but on what you do.
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:56.620]   It is the face that you show to your friends and your family.
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.620]   That's who people think that you are.
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.000]   One of the best things to do with our little children
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.960]   is to get them to tell the story back to us.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.880]   That's called narration.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:13.720]   You can see how much of the plot they have picked up.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.000]   Are they able to tell the story in order?
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.280]   Do they get the people, the main characters into the story?
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:27.500]   What can they tell you about the characters
[00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.760]   because of what happened in the story?
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.360]   You can get your children to tell you
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.100]   the conflict of the story.
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:37.940]   Now they might not know what conflict means,
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:42.940]   but you might ask them who had a struggle in the story.
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:46.740]   In the She-Wolf story, there are several conflicts.
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:51.120]   One of them is between Numitor and Amulius.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:55.620]   They struggle to determine who's gonna rule the kingdom
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:59.060]   and they solve the issue by what?
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:02.100]   Well, by compromise, okay?
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:06.820]   Another struggle, Amulius struggles to feel secure
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:11.820]   after he has kind of muscled his brother
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:13.500]   out of the kingdom.
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.100]   He no longer feels secure.
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:18.180]   So his conflict is really within himself,
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:21.700]   how to feel secure in his crown.
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:23.660]   You can even talk to your children
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:25.940]   about the theme of the story.
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:30.940]   So what was the main idea of the story?
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.180]   How did they behave?
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:36.660]   How were the characters, were they wise or foolish?
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:40.480]   Your children are gonna memorize.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.060]   If you read the story more than once,
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.300]   your children are gonna memorize it.
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.460]   That's the thing about repetition.
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:50.100]   As we repeat stories,
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:53.540]   we might think our children are getting bored,
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:56.600]   but children are not usually bored by repeated stories.
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.720]   They love it.
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:02.380]   And remember, repetition leads to memorization.
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:06.040]   So these names are gonna stick with your kids.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.860]   These locations, these places,
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.640]   even these virtues that you want to talk about
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:16.140]   with your children, honor and honesty, kindness,
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:20.900]   they will stick with your children.
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:25.540]   One of the ways you can use the core habit of expressing
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.300]   is narration.
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:31.180]   You can ask your children to tell the story back to you.
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:35.100]   You can ask them to act out the story.
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.580]   You can even really get into it
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:39.420]   and provide props for costumes
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:44.060]   or a basket for riding down a river in.
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:47.340]   You can draw the characters.
[00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.180]   You can ask them,
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.100]   what do you think Numitor looked like?
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.940]   What do you think the she-wolf looked like?
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.140]   What do you think the shepherd looked like?
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.680]   What kind of clothes did he wear?
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.260]   You can draw the characters.
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:03.020]   You could draw scenes from the story.
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.660]   If you want to practice handwriting this summer,
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.700]   or if you have a child who's just learning to write in cursive
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:12.020]   and still thinks that is fun with a capital F,
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:15.520]   you could give them a sentence or a paragraph to copy.
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:20.060]   You can encourage them in their storytelling.
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.300]   You could encourage them to write a story
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.100]   about something that they know,
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:31.100]   or to write the story of what they think happens next.
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:35.660]   After the three stories that I just read for you,
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:40.100]   what do they think is the next step in the story
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.980]   and get them to write it.
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.060]   There are all kinds of things
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:47.800]   that you can do with your children
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.480]   that bring the story to life
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:55.300]   and is more than just sitting and retelling.
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:58.620]   Using the characters in the story
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:02.720]   to teach virtue, to teach honor,
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:07.720]   using the story to introduce new vocabulary words,
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:12.180]   using the story to stretch their imagination
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:15.420]   and to incite wonder.
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:20.220]   All of these are good ways to bolster the fun
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:23.780]   that you and your family can have together
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:27.060]   as you read this summer.
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:30.360]   I hope that you enjoyed some of our stories
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.060]   from Kings of Rome,
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:36.140]   and I am looking forward to sharing more stories with you
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:41.140]   next week from our Exploring the World with Uncle Paul.
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:44.100]   I'll see you guys next week.
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.680]   (gentle music)
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.260]   (gentle music)
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.320]   you
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:38:01.320]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
