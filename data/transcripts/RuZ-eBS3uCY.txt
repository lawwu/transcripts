[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   It's Monday on the podcast, but it's Tuesday in real time for us because we're in Nashville right now
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.720]   at the Sing Global 2022 Getty Music Worship Conference,
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.240]   recording this before a live studio audience. Let me hear you.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.960]   [Applause]
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.760]   That was good.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.640]   We have been recently on the podcast talking a lot about spiritual gifts,
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.760]   and speaking of spiritual gifts, if anyone here has any inclination whatsoever towards missions,
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.560]   you've probably heard about or even read John Piper's book, Let the Nations Be Glad.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:43.680]   That book turns 30 years old this summer, with over 300,000 copies sold.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.240]   To celebrate, we just released a 30th anniversary edition, an expanded hardcover of that book.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.680]   For those of you who want to read it again, or maybe you haven't read it before,
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.560]   this is a good time to do it. Let the Nations Be Glad.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.160]   Pastor John, looking back now on 30 years of what God has done with that book,
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.600]   what thoughts do you have on that book and missions going forward?
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.360]   It's the most surprising book that I've written, surprising in its effect,
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.720]   because it has been used to strengthen the hands of veteran missionaries and awaken a desire for
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.680]   missions among aspiring missionaries, and it has been used to clarify what we're doing among
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.520]   younger missionaries.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.640]   And so I've been amazed.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.800]   And what's surprising is that I've never been a missionary.
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.120]   I've never crossed a culture, learned a new language, embedded myself in a people,
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.720]   and given my life to growing Christ Church there.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.600]   I've never done that.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.400]   I've been a pastor of a local church all those years when that book was coming into being.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.760]   And so it has stunned me that a person with no, no missionary experience could write a book
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.680]   that God would use in mission.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.280]   So that's the first thing that strikes me is why would that be?
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.240]   I think the answer is it's Bible-saturated, and Bible has its own power.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.440]   You don't have to be anybody if you speak the Word of God faithfully.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.960]   So that's the first thought.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.600]   The second thought is I was just trying in those early years, during the '80s,
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.320]   the book I think came out in '91 or '92, since this is 30 years.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:37.760]   I was just trying to bring my big God theology, Calvinism, Reform theology,
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.960]   to bear on the local church and to be consistent with it in all that we did.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.600]   And one of the things we wanted to be was a platform for the sending of missionaries.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.080]   And I had to come to terms with, okay, what's the relationship between being radically
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.960]   God-centered, believing in the absolute sovereignty of God and the saving of sinners,
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.520]   and that launching pad?
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:13.120]   And it emerged as perfect because the book, the subtitle is called "The Supremacy of God
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.280]   in Missions," and the title is called "Let the Nations Be Glad."
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:25.600]   So my Reform theology comes out in the subtitle, and my Christian hedonism comes out in the title.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.800]   And Christian hedonism simply means that God is most glorified among the nations
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.120]   when the nations are most satisfied in God.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.520]   And that's what Psalm 67 says.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.720]   "Let the nations be glad.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.120]   Let the peoples praise him, O Lord.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.040]   Let the peoples praise you."
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:51.760]   So the gladness of the nations and the glory of God came together perfectly in my theology.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.720]   I thought there's nothing more obvious than that we should be a missionary sending church
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.120]   and that I should do everything I can to mobilize people for the cause of missions.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.040]   And during those years of trying to mobilize people, thought after thought after thought
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.200]   came that moved towards a book.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.680]   And some of those thoughts included, "Are people really lost?"
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.480]   So many people today don't--they're all into other issues besides rescuing lost people
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.280]   from perishing.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.600]   Are people going to hell?
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:31.200]   So I had to answer that, give good, solid, exegetical foundations for that heartbreaking
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.840]   reality.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.720]   And then, do you have to hear about Jesus in order to be saved?
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.840]   Lots of evangelicals are inclusivists and say, "No, you don't have to hear about it."
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.840]   He did it, yes, and purchased salvation, but you don't have to hear about it in order to
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.560]   benefit from it.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.560]   So I had to write about that.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.000]   And then the last one was peoples versus people.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.880]   I mean, that was a real red-hot issue that nobody thought about when I was growing up.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.520]   I never used the word people with an S on the end when I was growing up, ever.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.040]   I remember using it one time, and a little girl said to me, "People is already plural.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.840]   You don't say peoples, you say people."
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.280]   She corrected me.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.520]   That's very sharp.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.880]   But now she needs to be taught missiology because there are thousands of peoples, and
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.400]   the Bible talks about them, and that missions is reaching all those peoples, not saving
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.440]   every soul.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.480]   Jesus is going to come back when people are not yet saved, but I don't think He's coming
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.680]   back until the mission is finished, and the mission includes reaching the peoples.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.840]   So we had to deal with the whole issue of peoples versus people.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.280]   So those are the pieces that came together.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:02.080]   And the last thing I would say is it's the only book I have written, I think, from which
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.320]   people remember one sentence.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.920]   "Missions exist because worship doesn't."
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:14.400]   I was just talking to a guy in the restroom 20 minutes ago, all right?
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.480]   And he was asking me a question about my talk yesterday, and he said, "You gave the impression
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.640]   that eternity is going to be an endless worship service."
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.400]   I said, "Wrong impression."
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.040]   And you're right.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.040]   I probably did leave that impression.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.200]   I didn't mean to because I think worship from the heart, corporately, is more than worship
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.760]   services.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.200]   It's all that you do, according to Romans 12, 1 and 2.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.720]   You laid on your whole life in your vocation and your hobbies and everything when it does
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.760]   from the heart.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:52.880]   And I said, "Most people, when they read that sentence, first sentence in the book,
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:07:00.720]   'Missions exist because worship doesn't,' misunderstand it by thinking, 'I mean, missions
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.280]   exist because worship services don't exist.'
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.480]   That's not what I mean."
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.080]   And so I clarified it in later editions.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:14.960]   I mean, people are not living out of a supreme valuing of God above all things.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.080]   - Amen.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.480]   We recorded this episode live in Nashville with a bunch of you who showed up and showed
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.160]   up alive and showed up engaged.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.280]   It was a great memory.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.880]   If you were there, thank you for your enthusiasm and your presence.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.600]   It was great meeting so many of you after the session at the book signing.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.840]   Four other episodes came from this recording session, and we're going to start 2023 off
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.240]   with them.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.080]   So stay tuned for more episodes from our live recording in Nashville.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:45.600]   In the 30th anniversary re-release of "Let the Nations Be Glad" is available in a newly
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.880]   expanded hardcover.

[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:02.240]   Next time we have a special episode on a topic that I've wanted to bring up for a long time,
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:10.080]   particularly over that question, "How do we approach God during seasons when we feel our
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.800]   brokenness, particularly when that brokenness is a brokenness over the guilt and shame of
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.680]   our own sin?"
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.320]   How then do we approach God?
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.920]   That question gets answered robustly in two full chapters in Nehemiah, chapters 9 and
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.400]   10.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.400]   Pastor John is going to walk us through those next time.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.080]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.920]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.720]   Thanks for listening.
