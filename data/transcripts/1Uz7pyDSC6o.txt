[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Well, why do we keep confessing our sins if all of our sins have been canceled in Christ?
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.240]   It's a great question from a listener to the podcast named Andy, who represents, I
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.000]   think, a lot of listeners out there who are asking this very same question.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Here's how Andy put it, "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.960]   Can you help me understand the work of Jesus whereby all of our sins, past, present, and
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:33.360]   future, were forgiven in Christ, and yet we are called to continually confess?"
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.040]   Thinking specifically of the "it is finished" statement in John 19, 30, and also the amazing
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.320]   reality that Christ "forgave all our trespasses and canceled our record of debt that stood
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.480]   against us" in Colossians 2, verses 13 to 14.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.960]   But then we're also called to constant confession, too, in 1 John 1, 9.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.480]   So, Pastor John, how do we make sense of all these truths?
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.280]   Why do we keep confessing if all of our sins have been canceled in Christ?
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:10.120]   I love that question because it gives me an occasion to exult with you and with all of
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.960]   our listeners in the immeasurable greatness and beauty and preciousness and wonder of
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:24.080]   what Jesus did, in fact, on the cross, achieve once for all when He died and rose again for
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.520]   His sheep.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:33.440]   And I say "for His sheep" because it says in John 10, 15, "Jesus laid down, I laid down
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.520]   my life for the sheep."
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:44.200]   In other words, in the death of Jesus, God has a very special, peculiar design or intention
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:54.040]   or purpose to purchase and create a flock for Himself, including the purchase of our
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:01.040]   faith, our union with Christ, our forgiveness of every sin, past, present, future, our eternal
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.800]   right standing with God as adopted children and as new creatures in Christâ€”all that
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.400]   purchased once for all by Jesus.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:17.440]   That's what God intended and achieved when Christ died and stood in the place of His
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.760]   sinful flock, His sheep.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.400]   Now Andy sees this glory.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.120]   He sees it, and he's exulting in it with me, I believe.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.240]   He says in John 19, 30, he sees it is finished.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:42.040]   He sees in Colossians 2, 13, God made us alive together with Christ, having forgiven us all
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.400]   our trespasses by canceling the record of death that stood against us with its legal
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.400]   demands.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.240]   This, He set aside, nailing it to the cross.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.120]   That's just got to be one of the most amazing two verses in all the Bible for describing
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:06.820]   what became of our debt that we could never pay, canceled, nailed to the cross.
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.440]   And you can add to what Andy has seen and pointed out in those verses these, like Hebrews
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.880]   7, 27, "Christ has no need like the Old Testament high priests to offer sacrifices
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:27.840]   daily since He did this once for all when He offered up Himself," or Hebrews 9, 26,
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.380]   "He has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.240]   of Himself," or 10, 14.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.600]   I mean, Hebrews is really good at this.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:48.720]   "For by a single offering, He has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified."
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.960]   So there it is, once for all, not repeated.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.240]   Not repeated in history, not repeated in the mass, in the Roman Catholic mass, Sunday after
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.120]   Sunday, not repeated in any kind of Protestant religious performances that we may attempt
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.880]   through baptism or whatever.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.520]   Once for all, done, finished, complete, debt paid in full, can't be added to, can't be
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.280]   improved upon.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:21.000]   That's the foundational glory of the achievement of Christ when He died for us on the cross.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:29.780]   So Andy's question is, well, if the death of Christ achieved the forgiveness of all
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:38.080]   the sins of all God's people for all time, what does 1 John 1, 9 imply when it says,
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.920]   "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.120]   from all unrighteousness."
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:57.240]   Or verse 7, "If we walk in the light as He is in the light, the blood of Jesus His Son
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.580]   cleanses us from all sin."
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:07.840]   So Colossians 2, 13 and the passages that we saw in Hebrews sound like our forgiveness
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:16.180]   was achieved, completed in the death of Christ, but 1 John 1, 9 and 1, 7 sound like our forgiveness
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:23.760]   and our cleansing depend on our confessing those sins and walking in the light.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.100]   And that's the issue that Andy is raising.
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:33.660]   Here's how I would resolve the tension biblically, and there are two steps in the resolution.
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:43.020]   So number one, we should distinguish between the purchase, and that includes the permanent
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:51.100]   securing, so the purpose and the permanent securing of our forgiveness once for all at
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:06:01.320]   the death of Jesus, on the one hand, from the personal possession and enjoyment of that
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.440]   benefit, on the other hand, which comes to us through faith.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:17.000]   So at the death of Jesus, our sins are canceled, nailed to the cross, debt fully paid, so payment
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.140]   and securing accomplished.
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.880]   Once for all, never to be repeated, permanently, infallibly for all God's people when Christ
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.280]   died.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:36.520]   But the personal reception, the possession, the enjoyment of that achievement, that purchase,
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:44.740]   that securing of forgiveness only comes to God's people through faith in Christ, union
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.660]   with Christ by faith.
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:57.660]   So I say that because of texts like Acts 10:43, "Everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.660]   of sins."
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.200]   I mean, that's clear.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.820]   Everyone who believes receives forgiveness of sins.
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:09.860]   And Romans 3:28, "We hold that one is justified by faith."
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:15.420]   So justified, including forgiveness of sins, right standing with God, by faith.
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:23.740]   And the reason there's no conflict, no tension between the absolute certainty of the forgiveness
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:30.820]   achieved in the moment of Christ's death and the fact that this forgiveness is dependent
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:36.140]   upon, contingent upon God's people coming to faith in Christ, the reason there's no
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:42.940]   conflict, no danger of anyone missing out who was died for in that way, is that God
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:50.900]   sees to it in his sovereignty that all those for whom he fully paid do in fact come to
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.260]   faith.
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.180]   There's no dropout.
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.580]   Those of me foreknew, he predestined.
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.580]   Those of me predestined, he called.
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.580]   Those of me called, he justified.
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.580]   Those of me justified, he glorified.
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.020]   He sees to it.
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:09.860]   That's the first step in resolving the tension between Colossians 2:13 and 1 John 1:9.
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.180]   Here's the other one.
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:20.300]   The Bible teaches that there are traits that God's people have that show they are in
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:27.220]   fact God's people and do truly belong to Christ, truly born again, truly have union
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.740]   with Jesus.
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:38.540]   These traits are how we can know that our sins were fully paid for and our forgiveness
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.660]   fully secured by the death of Jesus.
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:51.020]   One of those traits is how we deal with ongoing sinning in our lives.
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.940]   This is the complicating issue.
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.940]   Christians sin.
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.940]   1 John 1.8, that's what John is dealing with.
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:04.420]   1 John 1.8 says, "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves."
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:14.300]   The question becomes, well, if you are a true child of God, if your sins are truly and fully
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:20.500]   paid for, covered, canceled, what will you feel?
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:27.060]   What will your thoughts and actions be toward your ongoing sinning?
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.660]   What trait will mark you?
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.740]   And here are two biblical answers.
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:40.620]   Colossians 3.3, "You have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God."
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.740]   That's a description of wonderful, completed salvation.
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.060]   We're already home.
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:53.180]   Next verse, "Put to death, therefore, what is earthly in you, sexual immorality, impurity,
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.300]   passion, evil desire."
[00:09:54.300 --> 00:10:02.080]   So one trait of those whose sins are fully paid for is that we make war on our sinning.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.640]   That's the mark of those whose sins are fully canceled.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.380]   We make war on our sinning.
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.580]   We put them to death.
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:19.500]   But you can't do that if you don't admit, that is, confess that you have any.
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:24.260]   So the second trait, 1 John 1.9, is confession.
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.860]   If we confess our sins, which you have to do in order to make war on them, if you don't
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.460]   think you have any, if you're not confessing, "Yes, I have sinned.
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.700]   I'm sorry."
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.540]   If you don't confess that, you won't make war.
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.540]   If we confess our sins, He's faithful and just to forgive our sins.
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:49.260]   So confessing our sin is the agreement with God that we have sin, and it must be fought
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.860]   and killed.
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:56.580]   If we don't confess this truth, we're living, John says, in an illusion.
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:01.160]   We're lying, we're deceived, we're calling God a deceiver, and we're not saved.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:08.360]   If we're living in the illusion that we have no sin and that it doesn't need to be killed,
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.640]   we're living in an illusion, not in salvation.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:17.260]   So confession of sin is not the basis of our forgiveness.
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:26.220]   It is one of the traits that show we are truly in Christ, where all our sins are covered
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.220]   by His blood.
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:31.500]   Yeah, that's fascinating, and a great point to end on here.
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:36.100]   Thank you, Pastor John, for walking us through those texts, and thank you for listening.

[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:59.220]   Well, if 2020 has taught us anything, it's that the times are always uncertain, and our
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:03.760]   lives in this world are far less stable than we ever imagined.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:09.300]   So where do we find comfort and confidence to walk forward in seasons like we've experienced
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.880]   in the spring of 2020?
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.980]   That is the question up next on Wednesday.
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:14.980]   I'm your host Tony Reinhke.
