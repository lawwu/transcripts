[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840]   This is Scott Anderson, CEO for Desiring God.
[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:09.440]   You and other friends of Desiring God make possible the work of this ministry, including this podcast.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:17.880]   Thanks for your part in helping us freely share the truth that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:28.100]   Well, we asked for your questions on technology and you have responded.
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.000]   We have a lot of them and they keep coming in and please keep sending them in to us.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.800]   Josh in South Carolina wants to know when is it time to give up our smartphones and revert to a dumb phone?
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.000]   Arlene from North Florida asks, Pastor John,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.960]   I've heard Matt Chandler say on numerous accounts how our love and addiction to technology is making us angry and impatient.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.160]   I've seen it in my marriage and in my mothering. Could my iPhone be the reason I don't
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.520]   persevere in the faith? And if so, how do I keep that from happening?
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.040]   So Pastor John, two important questions on the table.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.980]   Well first in response to Arlene,
[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:15.880]   could my iPhone be the reason I don't persevere? Here's a text from the Bible that comes to my mind immediately.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.080]   2nd Corinthians 4 9.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.280]   Demas, in love with this present world,
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.040]   has deserted me, Paul says, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:37.200]   And what's striking about this is that Demas is mentioned twice more in Paul's writings.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.320]   Before this it says in Philemon 1 23,
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.360]   Epiphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus sends greetings to you and so do Mark,
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.920]   Aristarchus, and Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.920]   So Demas is a fellow
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.560]   worker with Paul in the ministry. And then Colossians 4 14 says, Luke, the beloved physician
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.440]   greets you as does Demas.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.760]   So Demas is there in three epistles, and in two of them
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.340]   he's a fellow worker, and in one of them he has left. He has deserted.
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.880]   Demas, in love with this present world, has
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:30.440]   deserted me. Now, I don't know, we don't know if Demas repented. Maybe he did. But as far as we know,
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:38.720]   Demas did not persevere in faith, and he looks like he proved to be an
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.840]   inauthentic
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.000]   Christian. And that happens. We've seen that in real life and
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.200]   in our own day. The reason
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.160]   he left and made shipwreck, it looks like, is because he loved the world.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.240]   Now, how does that relate to Arlene's question? Her iPhone is somehow
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.680]   involved in making her angry and
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.120]   impatient with her children and her husband, so she is rightly
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:17.120]   asking, "Could my iPhone be the reason that I don't persevere?" And then the answer would be
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.640]   that the world
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.160]   did not destroy Demas. His love for the world
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.280]   destroyed Demas, it seems. An iPhone does not, will not,
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:37.520]   destroy a marriage or mom or soul, but love for what's on the iPhone can.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:45.400]   And the Lord will not say to anyone on the judgment, "I don't think I never knew you because you owned an iPhone."
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.720]   I don't think any, I don't think he'll ever say that to anybody at the judgment day.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.200]   "I never knew you because you owned an iPhone." But he may well say, "I never knew you
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:02.680]   because you loved spending time on Facebook and online shopping more than you loved me."
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.200]   When Jesus said in Matthew 5 29, "If your right eye
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.640]   caused you to sin, tear it out and throw it away,
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.960]   better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell," he was talking mainly about sexual lust.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.240]   But the principle
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.040]   applies to any
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.680]   destructive allurement, it seems to me. We may have to take radical steps
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.600]   against something that is intrinsically
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.040]   neutral or good in order to fight what in our hearts is bad.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.480]   Why gouge out your eye when the problem is not your eye, it's lust?
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.360]   Well,
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.360]   because the eye is complicit,
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.400]   just like the phone is complicit. And yes,
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.080]   the stakes are
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:03.440]   infinite. Better to tear out your eye than to be thrown into hell, it says. And the poor eye,
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:11.640]   when God made the eye, for goodness sakes, the eye is good. I mean, this is just Jesus' radical way of
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.160]   saying
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.400]   you have to do whatever you have to do
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:22.280]   with regard to dispensing with things that may be good in order to avoid what may be be bad. Now,
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.000]   this brings us to Josh, because they're very related questions.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.400]   He says, "Is it too extreme to reject the technology and the tide of culture
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:41.200]   by going back to a very basic cell phone?" A little flip phone, I suppose he means. "And my answer is,"
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.720]   to Josh, "it's
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.000]   probably not any more extreme than tearing out your eye."
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.400]   So Josh asks, "Well, when is it time to do that, to pitch my
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:01.320]   smartphone?" And Arlene asks, "How do I keep my iPhone from threatening my perseverance in faith?"
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.120]   Now,
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:10.320]   here, my guess is that some are going to say, "Well, look, Piper,
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.880]   since the phone is not the problem, but the heart is the problem,
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.160]   it's pointless to pitch the phone." To which I respond, "No,
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:27.000]   it's not pointless to pitch the phone. If that's all you do, it would be pointless,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.680]   but
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.000]   we're always fighting on two fronts in the battle for holiness.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.720]   We're fighting on the internal front of the heart, the heart front, to be satisfied in Jesus, to be so
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:46.320]   satisfied in Jesus, to see him so clearly and love him so dearly and follow him so nearly that
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.000]   nothing, not a smartphone, can control us. Nothing can control us but only
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.080]   Jesus. Of course, that's the main battlefront.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:00.200]   Love Jesus more and you won't be enslaved by your smartphone. But biblically,
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:06.760]   we're also fighting on the external front to remove or avoid
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.960]   stumbling blocks to our faith. So you get Romans 13, 14,
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.920]   "Make no provision for the flesh to gratify its desires.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.680]   Drug addicts don't fondle needles.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.880]   Alcoholics don't keep stashes of brandy.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.720]   Sexually supercharged eyes
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.160]   put safeguards on their computers, and
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.000]   smartphone junkies who are
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.520]   throwing away their lives or wasting money or becoming irritable and angry and
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:47.960]   impatient may go back to a flip phone. This is not unbiblical. This is not legalism.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:54.080]   This is wisdom. This is fighting on all fronts for holiness in the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:00.720]   for the sake of the heart, for the sake of the Lord, for the sake of the family, in these cases it sounds like.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.000]   So,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.320]   it is totally legit, I would say, to take away any particular technology that is
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:18.000]   characteristically, chronically doing you in in certain ways. That may be a very wise
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.600]   move. And as far as when, all I know to say is
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.440]   pray and ask the Lord to make it plain when the time has come
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.800]   to take that step. Talk to wise, mature, spiritual people
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:37.240]   in your church, those who know you best, and seek their
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.920]   counsel. And
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.480]   always, I'll close with this, always
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.360]   put the main
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.800]   spiritual effort into
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.560]   knowing and loving and trusting
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.440]   Christ.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:57.880]   Getting rid of bad influences doesn't make anybody love Christ in and of itself.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:03.960]   True freedom from the bondage of technology comes not mainly
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.840]   from throwing it away, but comes from filling the void
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:16.000]   with the glories of Jesus that you're trying to fill with the pleasures of the smartphone.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.840]   Fight the deceitful,
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.960]   fleeting pleasures of the iPhone with the true,
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:29.520]   lasting pleasures of knowing and being cared for by Christ.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:36.800]   Amen. That is strong and wise counsel. Thank you, Pastor John, for thinking this through with us.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.720]   We have recorded and released a number of episodes on technology recently.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:47.000]   Two of them became very popular episodes. In fact, see episode number 636,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   which is titled "Why Not to Check Your Phone in the Morning?" and see episode number 637,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.280]   "Don't Waste Your Mornings."
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:01.760]   You can find those episodes and all the other episodes at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.760]   And please do continue to keep sending your technology questions in to us.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:13.160]   Well, tomorrow is Wednesday, and I cannot remember what's scheduled, but I'm sure it will be interesting.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.160]   I'm your host Tony Reiki. We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.320]   you
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.380]   you
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.440]   you
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:31.440]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
