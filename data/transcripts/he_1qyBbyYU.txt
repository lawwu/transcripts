[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.320]   Pastor John, in the last podcast, in episode 43, we talked about civil disobedience, and
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.560]   there you suggested that the Apostle Paul wrote the early verses of Romans 13 under
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.400]   the assumption that Caesar himself would read the letter.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.400]   The statements are really strongly put by the Apostle Paul for obedience to government
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.160]   in those verses.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.480]   Explain this point further and the implications of your interpretation.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.000]   When Paul says here, "Rulers," he's looking Caesar in the face and he's saying, "You,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.720]   Mr. Caesar, you are a terror to what is bad, not a terror to what is good.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.160]   Do you understand that?
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.160]   That's what you are.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.080]   That's what God made you to be."
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.840]   He's not saying it always works that way.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.160]   He's saying that's what it ought to be.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.480]   I think he's using "is" statements to imply "ought" statements in order to communicate
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.480]   to the Caesar.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.440]   I think if you were to ask me, "Why did he write it so absolutely?"
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.400]   You said, John, that he doesn't mean it absolutely.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.640]   Why did he write it absolutely?
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.760]   My two answers are, number one, he knows, writing to Rome, this is going to be read
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:25.040]   by the authorities, and he wants to make sure the authorities hear his belief in them and
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.840]   deliver a subtle message to them, not a waving of your finger in their face, but this is
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.840]   what you're to do.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.520]   You're to reward the good and punish the bad.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.880]   The second reason, I think, is because we Christians are in much greater danger of hell
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.360]   by our own sinful pride and rebellion than we are by being abused by a government.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.680]   A lot of people don't feel that.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.920]   They feel like, "Wow, I think an oppressive government is more dangerous to me than my
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.920]   own sinfulness."
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.120]   I don't think so.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.360]   An oppressive government will make your life miserable, but it cannot damn you.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.480]   Your own sin and rebellion and anger and bitterness cannot only make your life miserable, it can
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:17.720]   send you to hell, and therefore Paul, I think, is writing these verses in Romans 13 in the
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.400]   way he does to cut in both directions.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.280]   He has to protect himself against insurrection against the Romans, and he wants to guard
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.220]   Christians against getting their back up and being proud and arrogant, and so I think he
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:40.680]   writes it the way he does in the wider context of what he says to be understood as not absolute.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.680]   Very sobering.
