[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.260]   Do you see a difference between the funding the flying cars and the Space X's and Tesla's
[00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.160]   versus but sure, maybe it like improves aesthetic heritage of humanity. But does one of them
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.720]   seem a different category than the other to you? Or is it basically is that all included
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.360]   in the venture stuff you're interested in? It's a little bit like saying should I should
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.640]   we fund a Thomas Edison or Beethoven get push comes to shove, and we can only find one of
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.620]   them, we probably should find Edison and not Beethoven, right? Like indoor lighting is
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.560]   probably more important than like music. I don't want to live without Beethoven, right?
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.800]   This actually I think is a very important point, the point of the world, right? There's
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.680]   lots and lots of people trying to figure out the point of human existence, religions and
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.040]   philosophies and so forth. But what they all have in common is right other than maybe Marxism,
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.160]   what they all have in common is we're not just here to get up in the morning, work in
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.480]   a factory all day, go home at night, be depressed and sad, go to bed, like we're not, it's not
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.480]   we don't, we're not just material, right? Whatever this is all about, like it's not
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.960]   just about materiality. There are higher aspirations and higher goals, right? And we create art,
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.480]   we create literature, we create paintings, we create sculptures, we create like aesthetics,
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.480]   We create fashion.
