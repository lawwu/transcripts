[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.120]   that portion of scripture we read at the beginning in the second epistle of Paul to the Corinthians
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.840]   in chapter 4 and reading verses 3 and 4.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:25.760]   But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.840]   hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.320]   of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.020]   Now I want in particular tonight to consider those two verses as I say, but clearly we
[00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:53.400]   must consider them in the context of the whole statement which we read at the beginning and
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:00.260]   especially the first seven verses of this particular fourth chapter.
[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.240]   Now those who attend here regularly will know that we are looking at these seven verses
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.040]   for the eighth time.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.840]   We've been analyzing them and examining them and seeing how there the great apostle gives
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.440]   us an account of his own ministry.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.600]   He tells us how he preached.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.800]   He tells us what he preached.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.560]   And it was what he preached that determined how he preached.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.880]   He doesn't use these methods of craftiness.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.760]   He has renounced the hidden things of dishonesty.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.440]   He's not ending the word of God deceitfully.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.440]   Why not?
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:47.440]   Well, because of the nature of the gospel, the glory of Christ, the glory of God.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.080]   There's no need for him to do it because he can never commend this gospel truly.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.880]   He is but an earthen vessel and the excellency of the power is of God and not of men.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:07.320]   So we've followed him as he has worked through these explanations as to why he preached the
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.520]   gospel in the particular way and manner in which he did.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:21.520]   But here in these verses tonight, to finish off his complete view of his ministry, he
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.640]   tells us that everybody who listened to his message didn't believe it.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.700]   His preaching, like the preaching of the Lord himself before him, and like the preaching
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.240]   of every preacher of the gospel ever since, divided people into two groups, those who
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.080]   believed it and those who didn't believe it.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.120]   And the apostle, with his customary honesty, acknowledges that all did not believe.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.880]   There were some to whom his gospel was hid and they rejected it with scorn and contemnation.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.200]   And now he tells us why that was the case.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.880]   And that is what to which I want to call your attention this evening.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.680]   It's Palm Sunday.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.400]   It's the Sunday before Good Friday.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.360]   It's the Sunday that reminds us again of how the Son of God, when he came into this world,
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.240]   was despised, rejected, condemned, crucified.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.600]   The hymn we've just been singing has taken us through the details.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.440]   They're all perfectly true.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:36.140]   The popular crowd which had acclaimed him on Palm Sunday turned against him at the instigation
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.600]   of the authorities and cried out with one accord, "Away with him!
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.000]   Crucify him!"
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.200]   They preferred a murderer to be set free and to be given to them.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.120]   That was his treatment.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.680]   Everything that we've been reminded of in that hymn, everything that we can read so
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.360]   clearly as we go through the pages of the four gospels.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:05.060]   Now my friend, here is the biggest problem confronting mankind this evening.
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.340]   Why was he treated like that?
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.640]   Why did the world into which he'd come treat him in that way?
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.720]   Indeed, as John's prologue reminds us, his own people did that, the Jews.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.540]   He came into his own and his own received him not.
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.120]   Why was the Son of God crucified?
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.120]   Why was he rejected?
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.520]   Ah, but let me ask a contemporary question.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.080]   Why is he still being rejected?
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.360]   Because this was not only his fate when he was here in the flesh.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.600]   It was still the same when a few years later this great apostle was preaching him and proclaiming
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.640]   him.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.640]   It is still the same this evening.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.160]   Only some 10% of the people of this country even pretend to be interested in him.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.480]   The 90% are rejecting him, dismissing him, want nothing to do with him.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.760]   "Ah," they say, "we are concerned about the world as it is.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.280]   What's going to happen out there in the Far East, that's what we want to know.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.640]   And if the church can help us to stop war, well then we're interested, but we're not
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.800]   interested in you are Christ and in your doctrines.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.280]   We want something practical, something helpful."
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.280]   They dismiss it.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.960]   They're not interested.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.480]   This great fact, the coming of the Son of God into the world, his death upon the cross,
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.240]   his resurrection, it means nothing at all to them.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.160]   Now the question is, why is that?
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.400]   That's the question I say with which the great apostle deals in these two verses that we
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.560]   are looking at together tonight.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.440]   Now the apostle not only says and admits that there were some who didn't believe his gospel,
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:01.040]   fortunately for us he goes further and he tells us why they didn't believe.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.840]   And that is the thing, of course, that we've got to emphasize.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.640]   Why is it that people are not Christians?
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.520]   Why is there such a thing in the world tonight as a person who's not a Christian?
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.640]   There is a message which offers to solve all our problems.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.720]   I'm not exaggerating when I say that.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.600]   That's what it offers.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.240]   If everybody lived the Christian life, there'd be no tension in the world this evening.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.080]   Mr. Macmillan would not have had to take that journey today to meet President Kennedy.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.960]   If every single person in the world were a Christian, there'd be no threat of war.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.840]   There'd never be a war.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.840]   Not only that, all the other problems would be solved.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:55.040]   All the wars that take place between individuals and groups, all the misery and the unhappiness
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.640]   in the world tonight, it would go if sin went.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.840]   Well then why doesn't everybody believe it?
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.040]   Why is it being rejected?
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.560]   Why do men and women refuse it?
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.280]   That's the question, and it's a very profound question.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.600]   We must examine this.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.040]   There's nothing of more vital urgency for us, I say, than just this thing.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.280]   Because as I want to try to show you, it is because people are so ignorant as to why they're
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.200]   not Christians that they are not Christians.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.680]   They think they know, but they don't know.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.280]   "Oh," says somebody, "that's quite a simple question."
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.280]   Is it?
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.280]   You'll find that it's not a simple question.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.480]   It's a very profound question.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:41.760]   And as we follow the apostle in his explication of it, we shall find that in a sense he is
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.600]   still dealing with the message of the gospel.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.520]   You see, the gospel of Jesus Christ even tells us why people don't believe it.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.680]   It is it alone that can give us light on that.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.880]   We've been seeing Sunday night after Sunday night how the gospel alone can give us light
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.120]   on certain vital topics and subjects.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:09.120]   But you know, it's the only thing that can give us light even on unbelief.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:16.720]   There is nothing else that explains to us tonight why it is that some people do not
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.040]   believe the gospel.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:23.680]   Here is the explanation as to why anybody is not a Christian.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:29.120]   Now, you notice the interesting way in which the apostle puts it.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.120]   He says, "If our gospel be hidden."
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.440]   Why didn't he just say, "Well, if there are some people who don't believe it."
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.360]   Now, that isn't what he says.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.200]   He says, "If our gospel be hidden."
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:49.920]   And in putting it like that, he leads us to the key to the understanding of this terrible
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:58.840]   problem of unbelief, the major problem in the world, I say, at this very hour.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.920]   If our gospel be hidden.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.920]   Not simply if certain people don't believe it.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:12.360]   Well, now then, here I think he is opening the matter out to us and putting a suggestion
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.660]   to us.
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.640]   And let me put it to you in this form.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:25.880]   There are clearly certain wrong views with respect to unbelief.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.160]   You put this question to people, "Why is it that some people don't believe the gospel?"
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.360]   "Oh," they say, "that's not at all difficult.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.400]   They can answer that very easily and very simply."
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.200]   And this is what they say.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:45.240]   The man says, "I'm not a Christian, and I'm very free to tell you as to why I'm not a
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.240]   Christian."
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.160]   And he says, "My reason is this.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:54.040]   I am not a Christian because I say that there's nothing in it.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.000]   That there's nothing there."
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   That's what he says.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.920]   "Here you are," he says, "with all your great doctrines, your doctrine of God.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.080]   Then you come to the one you call the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:14.360]   You ask us to believe that some great divine person has come out of eternity and was born
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.520]   as a babe in Bethlehem.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.840]   You say he was still God, though he's a helpless babe.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.100]   You say he's got two natures in one person.
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.460]   You say this is the Son of God in the flesh.
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:30.600]   Then you tell us that he worked miracles, turned water into wine, raised the dead, stormed
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:37.820]   the raging of the waves of the sea and the howling of the wind.
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:44.260]   You say that he was killed and crucified upon a cross, that he died and was buried, but
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.820]   that he rose again.
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:51.100]   Conquered death and the grave and manifested himself unto certain people.
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.180]   No, they say that's what you claim.
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:58.220]   And you say that he did all this in order to save men and in order to put them right
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:03.260]   with God and that if we believe in him he'll give us a new life and a new nature that will
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.660]   become new men and in a new world."
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:12.340]   "But," said the man, "all this, of course, is to me sheer nonsense."
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.020]   "Ah, just don't believe it.
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.980]   There's nothing in it.
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:17.980]   It's all a lot of nonsense.
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.820]   It's a fairy tale.
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.340]   The world is full of fairy tales.
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.180]   This perhaps is the greatest of them all."
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:27.300]   "Of course," he said, "I know people in the past used to believe that sort of thing.
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.300]   They were ignorant then, unlettered.
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.540]   They hadn't got our knowledge and so on.
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.540]   But I don't believe it any longer.
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.540]   It's all nonsense."
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:36.860]   "Now, that's his attitude.
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.340]   He says, you see, that there's nothing in it.
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:47.380]   And to be told about judgment and hell and heaven and all this, to him it's just childish.
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:53.340]   It's folklore, fairy tales, rubbish, nonsense.
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.340]   He dismisses it.
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.620]   He says there's nothing there.
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.100]   People have been persuading themselves.
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:02.380]   And of course," he said, "there's a great deal in the power of persuasion.
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.900]   People can persuade themselves of anything.
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:08.260]   And no doubt some people feel much better and happier because they persuade themselves
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.100]   of these things as being true.
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.340]   But of course, he knows that there's nothing in it.
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.100]   There's nothing there at all."
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:21.940]   Well, now, this is something which the apostle, of course, was familiar with.
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.140]   You see, there were people like that at the very beginning.
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:31.600]   There were people who even looked into the face of Jesus Christ and said all that.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:37.520]   And after he'd gone, when the apostles were preaching, the apostle Paul tells these Corinthians
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:44.340]   in the first, epistle first chapter, that his preaching of the cross was to the Jews
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.260]   a stumbling block.
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:51.480]   To the Greek philosophers, it was nothing but utter foolishness, folly.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.480]   This is what they said.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.500]   They said, "This is simply monstrous."
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.560]   The Jews said, "Of course we're expecting a Messiah.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.340]   But when the Messiah comes, he'll come as a great prince.
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:04.700]   He'll come as a great king.
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:09.620]   He'll gather a great army and he'll raise an insurrection against this Roman tyranny
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.940]   that's over us and that's conquered us.
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:16.000]   And he'll smash the Roman army and he'll set himself up as king in Jerusalem.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.500]   And the Jews will be the greatest people in the world.
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.500]   That's the Messiah."
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.500]   Not a fellow like this.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.500]   This is just a carpenter.
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.500]   This is a fool.
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.500]   Who's this?
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.980]   Not even trained as a fairy, you see.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.980]   Knows nothing.
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.580]   And not only that.
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:38.340]   He was arrested, crucified in utter weakness, couldn't save himself, made great boasts
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.180]   and claims, but there he was.
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.940]   Why didn't he come down from the cross and prove that he was what he said he was?
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:44.940]   But he didn't.
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.020]   He died in utter weakness and was buried in a grave.
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.020]   That the Messiah?
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.020]   Nonsense, they said.
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:54.940]   It's the very antithesis of the Messiah.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:59.180]   And then you see the Greeks, great philosophers.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:03.980]   They thought this was very funny, this gospel.
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:08.620]   Because you see, they'd had a great succession of very great men, great thinkers, philosophers.
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:13.340]   Plato, Socrates, Aristotle and the rest.
[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.120]   And they'd gone very far.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.020]   But now they were waiting for somebody to go yet further.
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:27.420]   A great thinker who'd elaborate his great system of philosophy and explain everything.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.660]   And they're confronted by a Jew.
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.940]   The Jews had never produced a philosopher.
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.860]   Palestine wasn't the home of philosophy.
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.180]   Greece was the home of philosophy.
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.140]   And a carpenter again.
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.780]   A man who doesn't elaborate a great system of philosophy.
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:49.020]   Spends most of his time preaching to a handful of utterly ignorant and illiterate people
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.500]   in a little place, in a district called Galilee.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.620]   The thing is monstrous.
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:15:00.220]   And then having created a bit of a stir, crucified again in utter weakness there it ends.
[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:05.420]   Now said the Greeks, this is just unutterable nonsense.
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.060]   There's no great teaching there.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.820]   There's no profound philosophy there.
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.700]   He doesn't give us what we want.
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:16.540]   He hasn't carried the teaching of the schools yet further and to a higher position.
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:20.820]   They rejected it as nonsense, nothing in it at all.
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.380]   It was utterly dismissed.
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:29.740]   Now there you see has been the attitude of so many towards this gospel from the very
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.740]   beginning.
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:38.580]   Their attitude is that while it makes such great claims, in actual fact there is nothing
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.060]   there at all.
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.220]   But now they go further.
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:50.660]   They tell us that they have discovered this emptiness of the gospel claim as the result
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.220]   of certain things.
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.940]   And they're very proud of this.
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:16:02.300]   They say that while ignorant people still believe it, while it still may be all right
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:06.380]   to go and preach it in the heart of Africa or somewhere like that, that they of course
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:11.420]   have not interested any longer and don't waste any second of time with respect to it.
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:12.420]   Why?
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:16.020]   Well because they've discovered that there's nothing there and that there's nothing in
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.020]   it.
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.020]   How?
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:27.900]   By means of their brains, their reason, their thinking power and capacity, their logic and
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.100]   their understanding.
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.860]   Now that is the claim I think you'll all agree with me.
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:37.900]   You go and ask one of the 90% of this country today who are not Christians why they're not
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.500]   Christians and why they're not interested in this kind of thing and why they never darken
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:47.380]   the doors of a place of worship except perhaps next Sunday, some of them on Easter Sunday.
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.380]   And this is what they'll tell you.
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:55.060]   "Well, that reasonable man, a thinking man, a man who has any understanding cannot possibly
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.060]   believe this."
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:01.300]   They can give you the reason for saying that there's nothing in it.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:05.460]   But wait a minute, I'm saying that this is the false view.
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.580]   How do I substantiate my case, my claim?
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:11.820]   Well it's not at all difficult.
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.420]   I do it like this.
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:23.740]   If you could prove to me that no intelligent, able man has ever believed the gospel, well
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:28.180]   then there'd be some point in that argument and I'd be prepared to consider it.
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:35.020]   If what decides whether you believe this or not is the brain you've got, well then I say
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:40.940]   you've got to prove to me that no man who's had a great brain has ever believed it and
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.660]   has ever been a Christian.
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.980]   Now that I think follows of necessity.
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:52.700]   If a man's brain capacity and power of thought and of reason and of logic and of understanding
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:18:02.720]   is the deciding factor, then it must be the case today that no thinking, reasoning person
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.700]   is a Christian tonight, not a single one.
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:11.260]   It's impossible if it is purely a matter of brain.
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:16.860]   But of course the answer to that is that there are many highly intelligent people who are
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:20.780]   Christians and who believe this with the whole of their being.
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:25.540]   But I can bring the argument round from the other side.
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:32.180]   If it is because they've got great brains and understanding that they do not believe
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:37.060]   the gospel and suggest to us that it's only people who are lacking in brains and understanding
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:45.460]   who do believe it, well then they would also have to show us that all unintelligent people
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:52.260]   do believe it and that there is no such thing as an unintelligent man who is an unbeliever.
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:57.060]   But they can't do it of course, for the fact of the matter is, my friends, tonight at this
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:02.740]   moment that that 90% of the people of this country who are not Christians and who reject
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:07.820]   it completely can be divided into two groups.
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:16.020]   A very small number who really are very able people and have got very good brains, but
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.660]   the great bulk of them haven't.
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:24.140]   The unbelievers tonight, you know, do not only consist of these great philosophers and
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.940]   the clever gentlemen of the Brains Trust.
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.860]   Tom, Dick and Harry don't believe it either.
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:35.020]   The man who's never read a book on philosophy, he's standing on the street corner, perhaps
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:40.260]   in the public house, and he says, "It's rubbish, nothing in it."
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:47.660]   The biggest fool in the land, the most unintelligent, agrees 100% with Bertrand Russell.
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.620]   They're saying exactly the same thing.
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.900]   Very well, I mustn't waste your time.
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:20:00.460]   That proves conclusively that what decides whether a man is a believer or not is not
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:05.260]   his brain power and capacity.
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:10.220]   The able men and the fools are found in the same camp.
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:16.860]   And thank God on the other side, there are great brains and people who haven't much intelligence
[00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:20.180]   in the Christian church also.
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:24.300]   Both parties are found in the two positions.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.900]   And thank God that this is the case.
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:31.500]   If this were a matter of intelligence, how unfair it would be.
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.820]   What an unfair advantage the men who happen to be born and able men would have over the
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.780]   vast majority of us.
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.460]   Thank God it isn't that.
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.300]   It wouldn't be a gospel if it were that.
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:46.420]   Well, there's their first reason, but they've got a second reason, which is this.
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.180]   "All right, sirs and men, I'll accept that argument.
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:53.940]   I can't answer that, but my case is this.
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:58.300]   It isn't so much my brain power as it's the knowledge I have."
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:03.140]   Of course, he said, "In the past, people believed your gospel, but that was because they hadn't
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:09.900]   got our modern knowledge, and especially our modern scientific knowledge.
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:15.260]   They were not aware of the great discoveries that have been made, especially in this century,
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:20.420]   and indeed during the last hundred years, this phenomenal advance of mankind since about
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.420]   1860.
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:24.940]   They knew nothing about that, but of course," he said, "I do know.
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:29.540]   I've inherited all this, and it's because of the knowledge that I now have.
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:35.180]   It's my awareness of certain facts and certain information.
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:38.940]   That is my reason for not being a Christian."
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:39.940]   What about this?
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:47.820]   Well, again, the answer is not at all difficult.
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:54.780]   There is no new knowledge that has come to light during the last hundred years that has
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:58.740]   made the slightest difference to these matters.
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.380]   Not the slightest.
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.060]   I'm not here to denounce the advance of knowledge.
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.660]   I thank God for it.
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.740]   Thank God for scientific discoveries and inventions.
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.500]   Thank God for everything that makes life in the home easier.
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.140]   All your gadgets and inventions, I'm not opposed to them.
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:21.220]   Thank God for them, and for every knowledge—scientific, medical knowledge, the cure of diseases.
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.780]   Thank God for it all.
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:29.900]   But all I'm saying is this, that I know of no knowledge whatsoever that makes even
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:36.740]   the slightest difference to the subject matter of this gospel.
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:41.260]   Tell me, what new knowledge is there about God, or about the Lord Jesus Christ, about
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:45.820]   life itself, about death, about what lies beyond death?
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:46.820]   What's your new knowledge?
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:47.820]   What is it?
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.820]   You haven't got any.
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.900]   There isn't any.
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:56.420]   So you see, to say that you don't believe because of this new knowledge is not correct.
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:02.420]   There is no new knowledge that touches this in any way whatsoever.
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.020]   But not only that, my dear friend.
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:11.020]   Can't you see that my text tonight is sufficient to answer that argument once and forever?
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.740]   Here is a man who says, "Now, of course, if I'd lived in the past, I no doubt, like
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.140]   everybody else, would have believed your gospel.
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:23.020]   But you see, with my knowledge, which has come in since 1860, I cannot believe it."
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.500]   Here's the answer.
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:33.500]   If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:39.300]   There were people who did not believe the preaching of the Son of God nearly two thousand
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.560]   years ago.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.900]   There were people who did not believe the preaching of the Apostle Paul.
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.700]   There's nothing new about unbelief.
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.700]   It's got nothing to do with the twentieth century whatsoever.
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:54.420]   There have been unbelievers in the world from the very beginning.
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.980]   It's got nothing to do with time.
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.180]   It's got nothing to do with development.
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.540]   It's got nothing to do with advance of knowledge.
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:03.540]   Why not?
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:08.140]   Well, because this is revelation.
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:13.100]   You see, the gospel is not something that encourages us in our quest or in our search
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.900]   for truth.
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:18.260]   It is what is called revelation.
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.920]   It's not men's training to try to discover.
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.660]   That's what science does and does rightly.
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.500]   That's what we must do in every realm.
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.540]   We seek and we try to discover more and more truth.
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:37.420]   But here we start by saying this, that all our seeking will never bring us anywhere because
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.660]   God is eternal and absolute.
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:44.140]   He's infinite and we are not only finite, but furthermore we are different from him.
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.920]   He is holy and we are sinful.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:51.620]   We start with this, that the world by seeking knew not God.
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:55.420]   The philosophers couldn't find him and they still can't.
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.560]   You see, we are dealing with a different type of knowledge.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:03.020]   We are no longer in the realm of things that can be seen and touched and felt and handled
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.420]   and weighed and measured.
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:11.380]   It's the spiritual realm and God, the everlasting, and all man's efforts are inadequate.
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:18.820]   This has got to be revelation, and it is revelation.
[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:24.940]   And because it is revelation, it's got nothing to do with time at all.
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:30.580]   What we are told is that at a given point in time, two thousand years ago, God sent
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:34.360]   forth his son, made of a woman, made under the law.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.380]   He did it then.
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:40.040]   And that's a fact which faces everybody.
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.300]   You can't add to it, you can't take from it.
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.540]   There's nothing new which makes any difference at all.
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:49.980]   It's this revelation.
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:54.660]   And you and I are facing the same revelation that faced this man Paul before he became
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:26:00.620]   an apostle, and everybody who's ever lived ever since.
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:07.140]   You and I this evening are in exactly the same position as everybody who's ever lived
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.660]   since the Son of God came into this world.
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.460]   There is no difference at all.
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:19.220]   They've all been confronted by these same facts, and you have no knowledge that in any
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:26.220]   way makes the slightest difference to them, none at all.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:31.660]   So you see, these reasons which men give for their unbelief are entirely wrong, they're
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.260]   quite false.
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.460]   There's not a vestige of truth in them.
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:37.700]   They're entirely mistaken.
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.700]   Very well, let me come to the positive then.
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:45.900]   Having seen the baseness and the wrongness of the false views, let us turn secondly to
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:50.460]   the true view and the true explanation of unbelief.
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.740]   Now then, here it is.
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:27:02.540]   If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world hath
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:08.220]   blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ,
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:12.500]   who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.500]   What does he mean?
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.300]   Listen to him.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:19.920]   I again draw attention to the way in which he puts it.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.460]   If our gospel, he says, be hid.
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:26.060]   Actually the word he used was this.
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:32.780]   If our gospel be veiled, veiled.
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:39.000]   He says if there is a veil between anybody and this gospel, that's what he said.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.980]   You see, he's borrowing the idea that he's already used in the previous chapter, where
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:48.500]   he talks about Moses coming down from the mountain, his face was shining and the people
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.920]   were frightened, so he put a veil over his face.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:56.280]   And then he says, you know, the trouble with the Jews is this, that their minds were blinded,
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:02.520]   for until this day remaineth the same veil, untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament,
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.740]   which veil is done away in Christ.
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:09.720]   But even unto this day when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart, and he goes
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.720]   on with it.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.720]   It's the same idea.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:16.080]   If our gospel be veiled.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.200]   Now then, here is a very wonderful picture.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:23.680]   Here is the real explanation.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:27.480]   You see, what the apostle is saying is this.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.680]   The thing is there.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.960]   Why don't they believe it then?
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:36.600]   Because they don't see it.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.320]   If our gospel be hidden, there is a gospel.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.680]   Well, why don't they believe?
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:44.960]   Ah, it's hid from, the veil has come between them and the gospel.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:50.600]   Now here is the first way to understand unbelief.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:54.480]   It's a kind of blinding, says the apostle.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:29:00.240]   You see, you may have the best eyesight in the world, but if somebody ties a piece of
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:04.200]   velvet round your eyes, you won't be able to see anything, will you?
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:09.240]   Now that doesn't mean, imagine a man doing that to me, and he puts a veil tightly round
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:14.080]   my eyes, and I can't see that stained window at the other end of the chapel.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.080]   What would you think of me if I said, "You know, there is no stained window at the end
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.080]   of that chapel.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.080]   I can't see any stained window.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.320]   There is no stained window there at all.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.080]   If there were, I'd be seeing it, but I can't see a stained window.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.240]   Therefore, there isn't a stained window."
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.240]   What would you say of me?
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:33.320]   You'd say I was mad, that I was a fool, and you'd be right.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.480]   You see, the window's there.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.960]   Well, why don't I see it?
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.880]   Well, because there's a veil.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:44.040]   That's why people don't believe, says the apostle.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:51.920]   If you like, like a man in a fog.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.920]   I can't remember whether I've ever said this before in this pulpit.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:30:00.000]   I remember a friend of mine, I believe he's in this service at this moment, strangely
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.440]   enough, taking me for the first time round the Northern Ireland coast, and he'd been
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:12.440]   telling me as we motored along that at a given point we'd be able to see Scotland.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.720]   And we came to that point, but I didn't see Scotland.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.720]   Why not?
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.320]   There was a mist.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.880]   I ask again, what would you have thought of me if I'd said to this man, "You know, I
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.520]   didn't realise before, but you're just a liar.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:31.940]   You told me that Scotland can be seen from this point, and I don't see Scotland."
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:37.360]   What if I said that there wasn't such a place as Scotland, because I couldn't see it?
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:43.040]   You see, the trouble was that a mist had come down, and it veiled everything.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.360]   Scotland was there.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:45.800]   I couldn't see it.
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:50.040]   Why, well, the veil.
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:56.120]   Or I say it's like a blind man, poor man, he can't see anything.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:59.960]   But blind men are very intelligent men, and because they can't see things, they are not
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.620]   foolish enough to say that the things are not there.
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.200]   They say, "I'm blind, I can't see."
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.080]   They want us to tell them what's there.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.240]   They say, "Give me a description of it.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.240]   Write an account of it.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.280]   I'd like to read it.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.440]   Give me some mental image or picture."
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.840]   They know they're blind.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.320]   They don't say the things are not there.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.760]   They say, "I unfortunately haven't got the power of vision.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.760]   I can't see."
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.760]   Or I mistake this even further.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:26.400]   It's like a man, if you like, who's tone deaf.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:31.480]   I heard a very clever man the other day on the wireless, I think it was, or somewhere.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:39.480]   He admitted, quite frankly, that he could not tell any difference whatsoever between
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:46.840]   Beethoven's greatest symphonies and the merest kind of doggerel or jazz.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.560]   He said, "I'm tone deaf."
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:52.160]   He said the only tune he recognized was God Save the Queen.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.800]   But he said, "As to the rest," he said, "it's all one to me.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:32:00.000]   I don't know whether it's the greatest classic that's ever been written, or I don't know
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.920]   whether it's the merest rubbish.
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:06.080]   It's all noise and sound to me."
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.680]   But what was he telling us?
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:12.160]   Well, he wasn't actually saying, was he, that there was no difference between Beethoven
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.340]   and jazz.
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:18.640]   What he was saying was that he was lacking in appreciation.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.960]   He hadn't the capacity to tell the difference.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:26.680]   You see, there is a difference, but he lacked the capacity.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.960]   It was he who couldn't tell the difference.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:33.160]   It was he who wasn't aware of the difference.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:37.920]   The trouble is in the man, and it's so true in many realms and departments of life.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.920]   People look at a great masterpiece, a wonderful painting.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:46.200]   They say, "I see nothing in it, nothing at all."
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:51.040]   There are people who see nothing in great classical literature, see nothing in Shakespeare,
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:54.360]   but they think a Wild Western is wonderful.
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.440]   You see, there it is.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.240]   It's a question of a man's capacity.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.320]   No, this is where men go wrong.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.960]   They say, "There's nothing there."
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.560]   What they really mean is that they can't see it.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:08.720]   Oh, Francis Thompson has put this very beautifully in that little poem of his, "The Kingdom of
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.720]   God."
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:16.640]   "Not where the wailing systems darken and our benumbed conceiving soars, the drift of
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:24.120]   pinions would we hearken beats at our own clay shutter doors.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:30.480]   The angels keep their ancient places, turn but a stone and start a wing.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:40.680]   'Tis ye, 'tis your estranged faces that miss the many-splendored thing."
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.840]   How grandly said.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:51.760]   "Ah, if you but had the power to see, you'd just turn a stone and start a wing.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.200]   The angels are all rounder the bountous.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:58.480]   People are talking about the great quest for truth and seeking the kingdom of God.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.800]   There's no need," says Francis Thompson.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:05.320]   It had come to him as a revelation when he was selling matches there in the gutter in
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:09.400]   Charing Cross, you remember, in his rags.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.240]   It had come to him, he'd seen it.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:19.600]   The angels keep their ancient places, turn but a stone and start a wing.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:26.600]   The angels keep their ancient places, turn but a stone and start a wing.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:33.600]   The angels keep their ancient places, turn but a stone and start a wing.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:38.600]   The angels keep their ancient places, turn but a stone and start a wing.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:44.600]   The angels keep their ancient places, turn but a stone and start a wing.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.600]   But why are we thus veiled by nature?
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.600]   Here's the answer, the devil.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:56.600]   "If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.600]   hath blinded the minds of them that believe not.
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:06.600]   Lest they believe, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God,
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.600]   should shine unto them."
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.600]   It's the devil.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:15.600]   Now we cheer, of course, that the world is completely ignorant.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.600]   If it doesn't believe in Christ, who expects it to believe in the devil?
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.600]   And it doesn't believe in the devil.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.600]   And yet, you see, its whole condition is due to the work of the devil.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.600]   Why is the world as it is tonight?
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.600]   Why isn't this world paradise at this moment?
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:37.600]   Why all the alarms, I say, and the anxieties and the heartbreaks and the misery and the unhappiness?
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.600]   Why?
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.600]   And there's only one answer.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.600]   It is the devil.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:49.600]   God made the world perfect, put men in it in perfection.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.600]   What's happened?
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.600]   Oh, the devil came in in his subtlety.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:57.600]   And he tempted Eve, and she in turn persuaded Adam.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.600]   The fall?
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:04.600]   You see, if you really want to do something about your world, you've got to come back to this.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:07.600]   The gospel alone explains the state of your world tonight.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.600]   It's the fall of men.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:14.600]   It's this blinding against the knowledge of God that accounts for everything.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:18.600]   Wasn't that the very thing that the devil did to Eve?
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.600]   Adam and Eve had believed in God.
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.600]   They were having communion with him.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.600]   God came down and spoke to them.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.600]   Why the difference?
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:33.600]   The devil came and said to them, "Hath God said that you shouldn't eat of this particular fruit?"
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.600]   Of course he said that. I can tell you why he said that.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.600]   He said that to you because he knows very well that in the day that you do eat of that fruit,
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:44.600]   your eyes will be opened and you'll become as God yourself.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.600]   And he doesn't want you to be like God.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.600]   He wants to keep you down.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.600]   He spoke a lie against God.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:55.600]   He blinded them to the truth about God's holy nature, and they believed it.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:59.600]   And the world has been as it has been ever since and still is tonight.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:06.600]   Because he blinded the eyes and the minds of Adam and of Eve, and he's done it ever since.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:11.600]   Look at it in the case of the Pharisees and scribes and the Sadducees that are described in the Gospels.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.600]   Can't you see this?
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.600]   Look here. Here are the facts.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:20.600]   Here is a man who's apparently just a carpenter.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:24.600]   At the age of 12, he displayed the most amazing learning and understanding
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:28.600]   and could confound and confute the doctors of the law in the temple.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:29.600]   Even then.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:32.600]   But then he went back and worked as a carpenter until he was 30.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:37.600]   And then he began in his public ministry, and he began to say the most extraordinary things.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.600]   People said, "We've never heard things like this before.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:43.600]   This man speaketh with authority and not as the scribes and Pharisees."
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:47.600]   But not only that, he began to do most extraordinary works.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:51.600]   He did these works before their very eyes.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.600]   They saw them. They couldn't deny it.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.600]   He could give sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:03.600]   He could raise the dead, make the lame to leap as the heart.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:07.600]   He could commend the very elements. They saw him doing it.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.600]   Yet what was their reaction? Hatred.
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.600]   Trying to dispute the facts.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.600]   Trying to say he hadn't done it.
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.600]   And yet the facts were staring them in the face.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:22.600]   And instead of having the sense to say, "Well, now, who is this who is capable of such actions?"
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.600]   They said, "We must get rid of this man.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.600]   This man's a nuisance. This man's an annoyance."
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:31.600]   Now, what is that? You see, that's nothing but prejudice, is it?
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.600]   That's nothing but malice and hatred.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.600]   That's not science. That's not philosophy.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:42.600]   That's not a calm intellectual detachment that looks at facts without prejudice.
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.600]   It's the exact opposite.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.600]   They stoned him. They hated him. They spat upon him.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:51.600]   And finally they persuaded the mob to say, "Away with him. Crucify him."
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:56.600]   And it's all the work of the devil.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:01.600]   Unbelief is always the result of prejudice.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.600]   It is refusal to face the facts.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.600]   It is refusal to face the truth.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:07.600]   And, of course, we know exactly why.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.600]   You see, this is how it worked.
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:13.600]   Our Lord, in his preaching and in his works, condemned the Pharisees.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:17.600]   They were very great men until he came.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.600]   They were the teachers.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.600]   And everybody looked up to them and admired them,
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:25.600]   thought they were very holy and all the rest of it.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.600]   He eclipsed them completely and they became jealous.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.600]   He made them feel guilty. He condemned them.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.600]   They were quaking in his presence. And they hated him.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:34.600]   They said, "Get rid of him."
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:36.600]   Self-defense.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:42.600]   The intellectual arguments that are put up are nothing but a camouflage
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:49.600]   to conceal the immorality and the sinfulness of our daily life and living.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.600]   It is sheer prejudice.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:55.600]   The devil comes, he dulls the mind, he makes us stupid,
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.600]   he perverts the taste and the very desire.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:05.600]   Don't you know something about this in ordinary life?
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:12.600]   Haven't you sometime had the problem of getting a child to give up reading trash
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.600]   and to begin to read something that's worth reading?
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.600]   It can be a very difficult process. Why?
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:22.600]   Well, because the child has been reading so much trash that its taste has been perverted.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:26.600]   And it's the major problem in this country today.
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.600]   It's going to be, I think, the greatest problem of all.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.600]   The people have read such trash in the daily newspapers.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:35.600]   It's going to be very difficult to get them really to think
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.600]   and to read something worth reading again.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.600]   Less and less are they reading.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:43.600]   They are looking at trash, papers, television, hearing it everywhere.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.600]   And there is no judgment, and people are lost and are astray.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.600]   It's the depravity of taste that accounts for it all,
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:53.600]   and that is all the result of the work of the devil.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:58.600]   The devil poisons the mind.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:03.600]   We've got a saying, haven't we, to the effect that all seems yellow to the jaundiced eye.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.600]   The man says everything is yellow.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.600]   It isn't, of course.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.600]   The fact is that he is suffering from jaundice,
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.600]   and therefore thinks that everything is yellow.
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.600]   It's he who is jaundiced,
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:15.600]   and it's the devil who has put the jaundice into the soul of men,
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:19.600]   the veil that colors everything and poisons everything,
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:24.600]   and prevents his seeing the truth as it is in Christ Jesus.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:32.600]   Oh, I needn't keep you. I can give you one final proof of all I'm trying to say.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:41.600]   And the final proof, of course, is the case of any man who has ever been converted.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.600]   Look at this man, Paul.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.600]   There he is, a Saul of Tarsus.
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.600]   What's his position? It's this.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:54.600]   "I have early thought with myself that I ought to do many things
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:57.600]   contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth."
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.600]   He hated him. He despised him.
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.600]   He was supporting all those who got rid of him.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:05.600]   He was a Pharisee of the Pharisees.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.600]   He regarded him as a blasphemer.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.600]   He regarded him as a fool.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:13.600]   He regarded Christianity as something that was against God,
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.600]   and he decided to exterminate it.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:20.600]   Now, there he was, Saul of Tarsus, with all his genius,
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:24.600]   all his abounding ability, all his knowledge and understanding,
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:26.600]   this favorite pupil of Gamaliel.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.600]   He was all out against it.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:35.600]   And yet we know him, don't we, as the Apostle Paul,
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.600]   preacher of the gospel, teacher of the churches,
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:42.600]   the mightiest man of God that the church has ever known.
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.600]   The same man.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:49.600]   He got the same ability as a Christian as he had before.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.600]   He proves it in these epistles. It's all here.
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:55.600]   All the logic, the understanding, the brilliant argumentation,
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:58.600]   the mighty bursts of eloquence, it's all here.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.600]   It was there before, it's still here.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.600]   And yet the man is absolutely different.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.600]   What is it?
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:06.600]   He hated the thing, he's now preaching it.
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.600]   He denounced it, he says it's the only way of salvation.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.600]   What's made the difference?
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.600]   Just one thing.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:17.600]   The veil has been taken away.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.600]   Or if you prefer it, the jaundice is gone.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:26.600]   The gospel is the same as it was before.
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:30.600]   His abilities are exactly the same as they were before.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.600]   And yet his attitude is different. Why?
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.600]   The veil is gone.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.600]   He's seeing it.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.600]   He couldn't see it before. He thought he could, but he couldn't.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.600]   The gospel was hid to him.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.600]   But the veil was suddenly taken away.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:48.600]   And he saw it, and he was lost in wonder, love and praise.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:52.600]   And he became its greatest preacher and protagonist.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:56.600]   That's the cause of unbelief.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.600]   And he's only one example.
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:03.600]   There have been thousands and thousands in the history of the church.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:06.600]   Men who hated it and reviled it and rejected it,
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.600]   suddenly believed it and lived for it.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.600]   The veil had gone.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:13.600]   No change in the gospel, no change in their ability.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:17.600]   But the thing that was preventing their seeing, the mist was rolled away.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.600]   The opacities had gone.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.600]   They saw it.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.600]   And they rejoiced in it.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:28.600]   That is the true explanation of unbelief.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.600]   This sermon by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones is concluded on the second side of this cassette.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.600]   So please stop your machine now, and without winding the tape, either forward or reverse,
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.600]   turn the cassette over when the message is continued.
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:59.600]   Will you bear with me while I come to a third point?
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:03.600]   The tragedy of unbelief.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:08.600]   The tragedy of unbelief.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:18.600]   Is there anything more tragic than the rejection of this gospel?
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:23.600]   What does it mean? Why do you call it a tragedy, says someone?
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:27.600]   Well, you see, I call it a tragedy for this reason.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:35.600]   There is nothing which is more tragic to me than that a man should be unaware of the state and the condition in which he is.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:43.600]   It's a very tragic thing to see a man saying, "Look at me, I never felt so well in my life."
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:48.600]   He doesn't know that he's got a growth in him that's killing him.
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.600]   Tragic, isn't it?
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:55.600]   Ignorance, doesn't know it. It's there, but he doesn't know it.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:57.600]   "Look at me, never felt better in my life."
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.600]   There it is, eating away at his vitals that's been kept from him.
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:07.600]   That's the condition of mankind in unbelief.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:12.600]   Oh, this is the tragedy of tragedies in the world tonight.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:15.600]   That men are bursting of their blindness.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:20.600]   Bursting of their perverted taste.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:28.600]   Bursting of the rottenness in their lives and in their hearts.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.600]   They're not aware of it. They don't know it.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:35.600]   They think they're clever. They think we are fools.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:37.600]   They're proud of themselves.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:41.600]   They not only don't believe this gospel, they glory in the fact that they don't.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.600]   They make fun of it. It's one of the best jokes.
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:48.600]   Have fun at the expense of people who do believe it.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.600]   And they think this is marvelous.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.600]   They're bursting in it. They're reveling in it.
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:55.600]   In their blindness, in their incapacity.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:47:00.600]   In their depravity.
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:08.600]   And in the defacement of the image of God that was given to men at the beginning.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:12.600]   Oh, what a tragic thing it is.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:17.600]   That men should burst of their ignorance and of their blindness.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.600]   There are people like that in the natural realm out there.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.600]   There's a type of men to be had. We all know him.
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.600]   He says, "You know, I don't want to know. I'm happy as I am.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:28.600]   Don't tell me. Don't waste your breath on me. I don't want to know."
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:31.600]   He's not going to be, "I've always voted like this. I'm always going to."
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.600]   What a hopeless man.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.600]   A man who doesn't want light. He doesn't want information.
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:38.600]   He doesn't want knowledge.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.600]   He's not aware of his ignorance and he bursts of it.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.600]   He delights in it. He glories in it.
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:48.600]   And that's the state of men in unbelief.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:54.600]   The apostle says he not only glories in his unbelief, they glory in their shame.
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:59.600]   Fancy a man bursting about drunkenness.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:03.600]   And about how he got drunk. Bursting about it.
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:07.600]   And people thinking it's funny and wonderful.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:14.600]   This generation that rejects Christ is glorying in its blindness and ignorance.
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:17.600]   It is glorying in its shame.
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:23.600]   With the world as it is tonight, how can anybody be happy?
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.600]   How can they think it's clever to reject this?
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:30.600]   And the world as it is, as the result of rejecting it.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:33.600]   But that's what they're doing, isn't it? On with the dance.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.600]   Let nothing interfere with our happiness.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.600]   I read a leading article in a paper yesterday.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:40.600]   It was on the front page, you see.
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:44.600]   There's this crisis developing there in the Far East and anything may happen.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:48.600]   They say for today the great thing is the Grand National.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:54.600]   That's it. We were like that before 1939 went away.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:59.600]   The amorous affairs of the then king, they were the things that mattered.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:04.600]   On with the dance. Keep on with the pleasure and the happiness and the joy.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:06.600]   This is life. This is marvelous.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.600]   We are the 20th century people.
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:12.600]   There's no gospel for us, none of your sob stuff, none of your religion for us.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:16.600]   And the world as it is, as a hell-rounded about you.
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:21.600]   Glorying in ignorance, glorying in shame.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:24.600]   What a tragedy.
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.600]   Oh, but it's worse than that.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:31.600]   They not only are ignorant of their ignorance,
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:35.600]   they are ignorant of the fact that they're lost.
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:42.600]   If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:45.600]   What's that mean?
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:51.600]   Oh, it means they're outside the fold of God, but they don't know him.
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:55.600]   That they're outside the realm of his benefits and blessings.
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:00.600]   That they're outside the ambit as it were of his munificence.
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:02.600]   Lost.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.600]   They don't know they've got a soul.
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:09.600]   They don't know the real greatness of men.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:13.600]   They don't know that they're separated from this glory.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:14.600]   Oh, still worse.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:19.600]   They don't know this, that if they die in that condition,
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:23.600]   they will spend an eternity like that.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:30.600]   Would you like to spend eternity even as things are now, but they'll be worse than that.
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:32.600]   There'll be no relief.
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:36.600]   Eternal punishment. Lost.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:40.600]   Outside the life of God, outside the love of God,
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.600]   left to yourself and men like yourselves,
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:46.600]   with all that is base and unworthy in control,
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.600]   no relief at all.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:53.600]   Just this riot of the senses, the lusts of the animal part,
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:57.600]   and everybody the same, and utter selfishness on all ends,
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:01.600]   and left to that for all eternity, and never a hope of deliverance.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:03.600]   Lost.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:08.600]   That's what he says.
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:12.600]   If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:14.600]   And they don't know they're lost.
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.600]   Isn't life wonderful, they say.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:20.600]   We'll carry on like this to the last moment, and then we die.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.600]   And then you say to them, "What then?"
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:23.600]   Oh, they don't know.
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:24.600]   They haven't thought.
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:26.600]   Well, my friend, it's about time you began to think.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:32.600]   Because if one of these bonds is used, you know you'll be facing that unknown eternity.
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:38.600]   And if you are outside the life of God and are lost,
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:45.600]   it'll be an eternity of misery and of wretchedness and of shame.
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.600]   Did you know that?
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:51.600]   What knowledge are you boasting about when you don't know that?
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:54.600]   What's the use of telling me about all your wonderful inventions
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:52:00.600]   when you don't know how you are going to spend an eternity, no end at all?
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:03.600]   Lost.
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:12.600]   Always outside the life of God and love and peace and joy and purity.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:22.600]   Perpetual filth, unhappiness, misery, wretchedness,
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:28.600]   jealousy, envy, malice, spite, hatred, forever and forever and forever.
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:30.600]   Lost.
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:37.600]   Oh, the tragedy that men should burst about their unbelief when it leads to that.
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:40.600]   But I wouldn't end on that note.
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:45.600]   You know, there's something much more tragic to me even than that.
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:54.600]   And that is the tragedy that men should fail to see these things.
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.600]   That's the thing that's heartbreaking, isn't it?
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:03.600]   Think of the blindness of the man who doesn't believe the gospel.
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:07.600]   What is he blind to? Oh, isn't this heartbreaking?
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:10.600]   Haven't you felt at times when you've been talking to a blind man,
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.600]   if only you could somehow make him see, but you can't of course.
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:15.600]   Oh, you say, "What a pity that you can't see."
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.600]   "It's so glorious, it's so magnificent."
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.600]   "If only!"
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:19.600]   But he can't.
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:22.600]   But you wish you could make him see because the sight is so magnificent.
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:25.600]   Well, multiply that by infinity.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.600]   And you see the position of the poor unbeliever.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:28.600]   What's he blind to?
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:34.600]   Well, he's blind to God's great and glorious plan of salvation.
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:37.600]   He knows nothing about it.
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:41.600]   He's got his little plans of how he's going to have his pleasure,
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.600]   how he's going to spend his money.
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:46.600]   But here, my dear friend, in this book there is unfolded a plan of God
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.600]   before the foundation of the world.
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:53.600]   God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit met in a great conference
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:56.600]   to plan the salvation of man.
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:00.600]   And the great scheme was adumbrated and brought into being.
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:04.600]   And then in the Old Testament, you have an account of how this was gradually put into operation.
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:06.600]   And it's unfolding before you.
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:09.600]   You read it in history, you read it in prophecy.
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:11.600]   That's the secret of the Old Testament.
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:19.600]   The unfolding plan of God to redeem men from sin and from shame and from hell.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:24.600]   But this man sees nothing in it.
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:29.600]   The latest crack of the latest comedian is much more wonderful.
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.600]   "Bible?" he says, "Boring. Nothing in it."
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:32.600]   He doesn't see it.
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:35.600]   What a terrible thing that a man sees nothing in the Bible
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:38.600]   and the unfolding plan of God in the Old Testament.
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:39.600]   But what am I talking about?
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:43.600]   Well, with the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, I must say, time fails me.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:49.600]   This is the theme of themes that will employ our tongues who are in Christ to all eternity.
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:51.600]   What am I speaking about?
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:57.600]   Oh, I'm speaking about the Lord Jesus Christ and His glory.
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:05.600]   When the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son,
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:10.600]   made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that are under the law.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:14.600]   Oh, are you interested in spectacle?
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:16.600]   Are you interested in drama?
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.600]   Are you interested in great and magnificent events?
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:20.600]   Of course you are.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:22.600]   Everybody is.
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:26.600]   The next royal wedding I see is going to be televised.
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:28.600]   Why? It's going to be a spectacle.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.600]   It's going to be a great show.
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:34.600]   People like looking on at great people marching solemnly up the aisle.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:36.600]   This and that being done, going out.
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.600]   They'll wait for hours.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:40.600]   Marvelous. What a sight, they say.
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:41.600]   A spectacle.
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:43.600]   Very well, my friend.
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:46.600]   Would you like to see the spectacle of spectacles?
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.600]   Here it is.
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:56.600]   Come with me to the stable of an inn.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:00.600]   Look at the straw and the manure and the floor.
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:03.600]   Look at the oxen and the cattle.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:07.600]   And look at a poor woman lying on the straw in the corner
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:10.600]   and a man standing by and look into the manger.
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.600]   There's a little babe there.
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:14.600]   Oh, she has nothing very wonderful about that.
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:19.600]   It's a bit of a shame that he's in a manger instead of being in a crib somewhere.
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:21.600]   What's he doing in a manger?
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:24.600]   But I see nothing very extraordinary about it, don't you?
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:26.600]   Do you know what that is?
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:29.600]   Veiled in flesh.
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:33.600]   The Godhead, see!
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:39.600]   Hail, incarnate deity.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:42.600]   Can you see it?
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:44.600]   Or do you see nothing in it?
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:46.600]   Is that nothing to you?
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:49.600]   God in the flesh.
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:53.600]   The Word made flesh dwelling among us.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.600]   The One through whom everything was created.
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:57:01.600]   The One who was the instrument of God's creating the whole cosmos at the beginning.
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.600]   There he is as a helpless babe in a manger.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:06.600]   Following the little boy.
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:12.600]   Oh, I see and listen to him arguing there in the temple with the doctors of the law at the age of twelve.
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:13.600]   Same one.
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:16.600]   God, look at that carpenter.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.600]   Wonderful work he's doing, yes, but do you know who he is?
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:21.600]   That is God in the flesh.
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:24.600]   Oh, go on right through it all.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.600]   Do you see nothing in it?
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:28.600]   Look at these mighty miracles.
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:30.600]   Who is this? The people said very rightly.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:31.600]   Have you said that?
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.600]   Have you seen the glory breaking through?
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:36.600]   Can you say with John, "We beheld his glory"?
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:39.600]   The glory is of the only begotten of the Father.
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:42.600]   Go up onto that mount one day.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:45.600]   There he goes up with Peter and James and John.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:47.600]   And suddenly he's transfigured before them, yes.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:52.600]   Very raiment is shining in such a manner that no fuller on earth could bring such a shine out of it.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:55.600]   Who is he? Moses and Elias speak to him.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:56.600]   Who is he?
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:58:02.600]   Ah, there comes a voice from heaven answering, "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:05.600]   Hear him!"
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:08.600]   Have you seen something of that glory?
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:09.600]   But I mustn't keep you.
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:15.600]   Come and go to Calvary's hill with me and look at that cross in the middle.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:16.600]   There are three crosses there.
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:18.600]   Look at the one in the middle.
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:19.600]   He's dying.
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:21.600]   He seems to be much weaker than the other two.
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:26.600]   He dies long before it was expected and long before they had to be put to death.
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:27.600]   Who is he?
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:28.600]   He's sweating.
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:31.600]   He's crying out in agony, "I thirst."
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.600]   Who is he?
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:33.600]   He gives up the ghost.
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:36.600]   He says, "Into thy hands I commend my spirit."
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:37.600]   It is finished.
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:38.600]   Who is he?
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:44.600]   Who's dying?
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:57.600]   When I survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of Glory died,
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:02.600]   my riches gained I count but loss and poor contempt on all my pride.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:06.600]   My dear friend, it breaks my heart to think that there's anybody in this congregation
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:10.600]   who can look at that and see nothing and be absolutely unmoved.
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:11.600]   You're blind if you are.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:13.600]   No more, you're dead.
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:15.600]   There can be no life in you.
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:21.600]   Don't you see the glory streaming from his face?
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:25.600]   Look at the resurrection and its glory.
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:27.600]   Look at him ascending.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:28.600]   Is it nothing to you?
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:30.600]   Do you see nothing in it at all?
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:36.600]   And then think of the other things that such a man is utterly unaware of and to which he is blind.
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:39.600]   Do you see nothing, I say, in all these things?
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:43.600]   Do you see nothing in the fact that you can be reconciled to God tonight?
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:47.600]   Do you see nothing in the fact that your sins can all be forgiven
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:52.600]   if just as you are at this moment you believe in him and that he died for you
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:55.600]   and was giving his life for you on that cross?
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:58.600]   Is it nothing to you?
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:03.600]   Tell me, is it nothing to you that you can become a child of God,
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:07.600]   that God will put a new nature into you, something of his own nature?
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:11.600]   Is it nothing to you that the Holy Spirit will come and dwell in you?
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.600]   Tell me, is this nothing?
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:19.600]   And as you look to that unknown future,
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:25.600]   is it nothing to you to be told that if you believe in this Lord Jesus Christ
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:29.600]   and give yourself to him and become incorporated in him,
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:33.600]   that when you die and though your body may be buried in a grave,
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:38.600]   you will go on to be with him?
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:43.600]   And that when that last great day comes and he returns
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:48.600]   and all the dead shall be raised up in the body from the grave,
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:53.600]   you who believe in him and who belong to him shall become like him
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:59.600]   with a new body even, absolutely perfect, free from sin, glorified as his body,
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:04.600]   and you'll spend your eternity in his glorious presence,
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:11.600]   in a glory which is indescribable.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.600]   Does that leave you untouched?
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:16.600]   Does that leave you as you were?
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.600]   Does it mean nothing to you?
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.600]   Do you see nothing in it? Do you ridicule it?
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:21.600]   Do you say it's sob stuff?
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.600]   Do you say it's not practical, it's not relevant?
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:29.600]   My dear friend, if you do, you know there's only one explanation.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:32.600]   You are blind.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.600]   You're totally blind.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.600]   You're dead.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:41.600]   You've got no appreciation of the spiritual at all.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.600]   You're a lump of clay.
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.600]   You're a beast.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:48.600]   You're worse.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:56.600]   You're altogether devoid of the essential things that make a man really man.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:02.600]   If our gospel be hid, if it's veiled, it is veiled for them that are lost.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.600]   Can't you see it tonight?
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:07.600]   Aren't you horrified at the thing that you see nothing in these things
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:10.600]   that have caused the angels to sing,
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:13.600]   that have produced Handel's Messiah,
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:17.600]   that have produced some of the greatest works of art and of sculpture
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.600]   that the world has ever known,
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.600]   inspired these great apostles,
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:25.600]   produced the greatest benefactors that the human race has ever enjoyed,
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.600]   and you see nothing in it?
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:33.600]   Can't you see that it's sheer and terrible and tragic blindness,
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.600]   and that it's all the result of the devil having blinded you with this veil?
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.600]   If you see it, well then, my dear friend,
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.600]   do what the apostle says.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.600]   Turn to the Lord.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:49.600]   When it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be removed.
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.600]   You can't move that veil.
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.600]   I can't.
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.600]   I can't make you see.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.600]   I've often tried to.
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:02.600]   I've often tried by speech, by argument, by everything I possess,
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:04.600]   and I've killed myself, but I can't.
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:05.600]   Nobody can.
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:11.600]   When the devil has blinded you, there's only one who can make you see.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.600]   But he can.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:19.600]   All you need to do is to know that you're blind and cry out unto him.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:21.600]   Ask him to give you sight.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.600]   Ask him to open your eyes.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.600]   We have this treasure in earth and vessels.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:27.600]   I can't do it.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.600]   Nobody else can.
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:35.600]   That the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us,
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.600]   and that excellent power can do it.
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:43.600]   His blood can make the foulest clean, his blood availed for me.
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:50.600]   There is power, power, wonder-working power in the precious blood of the Lamb.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:54.600]   There is an energy in this gospel that can give life to the dead,
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:04:01.600]   sight to the blind, understanding to the ignorant.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:05.600]   The apostle told these people in the first epistle that the princes of this world
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.600]   didn't know him when they came.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.600]   But when they had known him, he said,
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.600]   "They would not have crucified the Lord of glory,
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.600]   but God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:24.600]   Yea, the Spirit that searcheth all things, even the deep things of God."
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.600]   My friend, have you seen them?
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:27.600]   Do you thrill to them?
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.600]   Have you seen the glory?
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.600]   If you haven't, you've never seen them.
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:34.600]   You can see these things and remain unmoved.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.600]   I say you've never seen them.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.600]   Recognize your blindness while there is still time.
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:47.600]   Cry out unto him and ask him to give you sight, and he won't refuse you.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:48.600]   He's promised to do it.
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.600]   Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:56.600]   Turn to him and ask him, and then you'll be ready to say something like this.
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:02.600]   I heard the voice of Jesus say, "I am this dark world's light.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:04.600]   Look unto me.
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:11.600]   Thy dawn shall rise, and all thy days be bright."
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:20.600]   I looked to Jesus, and I found in him my star, my sun.
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:23.600]   Can you say that?
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:32.600]   I looked to Jesus, and I found in him my star, my sun.
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:42.600]   And in this light of life I'll walk till traveling days are done.
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:45.600]   He is the light of the world.
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:47.600]   There is none other.
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:53.600]   And it is only as the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:06:09.600]   shines into us that we see him and the glory that is his and the glory that shall be ours.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:18.600]   God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts to
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:28.600]   give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:34.600]   Have you seen a glimpse of the glory that you may enjoy forever and forever?
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:39.600]   Turn to him. Cry to him even now.
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:44.600]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
