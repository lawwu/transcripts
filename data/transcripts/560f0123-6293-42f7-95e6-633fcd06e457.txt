[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.300]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:42.260]   in the right direction.
[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.940]   Because this is the initial episode of the Surpassing Value Podcast, it seemed right
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.300]   to me to lay out the origin, purpose, and probable destiny for this podcast.
[00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.080]   I thought that there might be a fringe group of people that would be curious as to why
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.260]   I had this compulsion to start a podcast voluntarily.
[00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.820]   Before I begin, let me say for the vast majority of people who are listening, you will probably
[00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:22.700]   not find this episode interesting, so please feel free to hit stop and go to episode #2
[00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.220]   if you want something that is remotely at an attempt at substance.
[00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.380]   This introductory episode is really for my friends or family who are interested, who
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.900]   are curious, as to why I would do something so dramatic.
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.700]   If it were me, I wouldn't be interested, so I've given you that fair warning.
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.040]   By talking about the origin, purpose, and probable destiny for this podcast, I think
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.300]   it will answer all those questions.
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.420]   So let me get to the origin.
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.020]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to really more adequately
[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.340]   flesh out what's been going on.
[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.340]   It's my attempt and my contribution in how we could think about things.
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.320]   Don't get it twisted, I don't have an innate desire to be heard, I don't consider my voice
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.140]   to be "special" by any means.
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.420]   Now that's hard to swallow from someone starting their own podcast voluntarily, I get that,
[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.180]   you'll just have to take me at my word.
[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.980]   However, what I mean by compulsion is the following, or the reason for the compulsion
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.980]   is the following.
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:47.400]   My perception is that there are so few voices in an ocean of megaphones that are speaking
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.140]   within a framework that withstands scrutiny.
[00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:02.760]   What I mean by that is, there are so many people with huge influence in our culture,
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.680]   and that's what I mean when I say an ocean of megaphones.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.760]   The megaphone is their platform, it's their huge audience.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.280]   And there are so many celebrity pastors and notable thought leaders, just influential
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:25.640]   people who, when they're speaking out on the issues facing our country, they are not speaking
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.020]   within a framework that withstands scrutiny.
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.280]   To say it another way, the substance of what they say, if you were to analyze it, it wouldn't
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.600]   pass muster at all.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.680]   I understand how that might come off as I make that statement, I'm cognizant, it makes
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.800]   me look arrogant, I'm not a scholar, I don't have the credentials of a scholar.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.520]   So in order for the listener to prove or disprove the veracity of my statements, I guess you're
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.520]   just going to have to judge the content I'm putting forth.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:03.560]   Furthermore, in order to be fair to the ocean of megaphones that I'm referring to, we would
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.800]   need to have sustained dialogue, which is essentially impossible though.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:15.660]   Because if we're talking about a wide-ranging idea, or some notable person of influence,
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.840]   some celebrity pastor, I'm not going to be able to sit down with that person and have
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.600]   sustained dialogue.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:31.640]   I'm going to do my best to portray viewpoints that I do not share accurately, I will not
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:40.260]   caricature other viewpoints because I've seen people do that and I find it unbeneficial
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.660]   and very anti-intellectual.
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.480]   So I'm going to steer clear of doing that.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.980]   The other thing is my perception of what I see in society today might be wrong.
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:00.340]   Maybe the people of notable influence, maybe they're not wrong.
[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.140]   Maybe I'm the one that's wrong, I get that.
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.020]   Everyone stands or falls before his maker.
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:16.460]   Believe me when I tell you, even though I'm putting out this podcast completely voluntarily,
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:24.300]   I feel compelled to do so because of what I perceive to be a lack of voices speaking
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:33.300]   correctly in what I see as a very perilous time period.
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.540]   If we're friends on Facebook, you might have noticed that I've been posting a lot more
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.260]   on current events and trendy ideas.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:48.760]   Those are completely my own thoughts, those are completely my own opinions, they do not
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:56.300]   reflect the stance of the church I attend or any other organization that I'm affiliated
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.420]   with, that's just an FYI.
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:05.900]   But going back to that, if you know me, you know that posting on Facebook is just not
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.340]   my thing.
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.900]   Let me say, for those who do post actively on Facebook, I don't think there's anything
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.300]   wrong with that.
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:20.660]   You want to share your life, you want to share pictures of your children, your parents, or
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.760]   other events, you want to share what you're learning, you want to share things that have
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.720]   touched you, I think that's great.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:38.880]   I think it could be a great medium to see what's going on in another person's life since
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:45.660]   we can't be keeping tabs on everybody, so there is a lot of good that comes from social
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.600]   media and from posting on social media.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.080]   That just was never my thing.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:07:01.320]   However, I started posting on social media because of the complete, again my perception,
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:11.960]   just the complete lack of accuracy when it comes to speaking about what's going on, not
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:19.920]   only in our country in a political sense, but what I would think in a much, much more
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.840]   deeper and important sense.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:30.800]   The problem I found with posting on Facebook, though, is that I'm constrained to a very
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.840]   limited amount of space.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:38.580]   I get maybe a couple paragraphs, maybe along with that an image or a video or some other
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.720]   link.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:47.960]   That's not enough space, though, to fully flesh out some of these ideas.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.880]   Good ideas cannot be adequately developed over Facebook.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:58.660]   For example, nobody expects to understand a subject like general chemistry over a couple
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.320]   paragraphs.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:06.000]   Relevant science majors will spend a year with exams on that subject alone, and even
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.800]   then that's not exhaustive.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:19.160]   General chemistry is an important subject, but so is justice, so is love, and so is racism.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:26.280]   So is philosophy, so is theology, or the lack thereof.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:34.360]   So it doesn't mean that posting on Facebook about these ideas is inherently bad.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:43.680]   My only point is there are huge limitations, huge limitations when it comes to tackling
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:49.520]   these subjects, and I experienced those huge limitations because I had so much more to
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:55.780]   say, but I knew I had to truncate it or risk losing the post altogether.
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:03.140]   In the process of truncating, there are things, important things that are left unsaid, counterpoints
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:09.320]   that are not dealt with, and nuances that would have clarified as opposed to obfuscating
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.000]   that were not developed.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.840]   The end result is that many times, meaningful justice to an idea or topic isn't accomplished.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:26.920]   With the podcast medium, one is able to deal with these topics in a more meaningful way
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:32.860]   that comes closer to accomplishing that justice, that meaningful justice, but is by no means
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.660]   exhaustive either.
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:42.380]   The best way, in my opinion, is when you have a relationship with someone, and there is
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:52.720]   sustained dialogue, but that rarely happens, especially amongst people with differing ideologies.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:10:00.900]   So with the podcast medium, I know that even with this medium, there are going to be limitations,
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:07.320]   and it's not as limited as posting on social media.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:13.760]   Secondly, as I move on to the purpose of this podcast, you've already kind of picked up
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:20.140]   when I just talked about the origin, that is kind of interlinked with the purpose.
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:24.240]   What I would add to this section, though, is that the purpose of this podcast, again,
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:30.500]   is to just fully flesh out these topics to my target audience, and my target audience
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.060]   are my friends and my family.
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:39.380]   My friends generally consist of people at church, at work, my childhood friends from
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.460]   Koreatown, and from other parts of Los Angeles.
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:46.260]   I grew up in Los Angeles, the city, not the county.
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.220]   I moved around a lot of times, so I have a lot of friends from different areas of Los
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.260]   Angeles.
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.060]   And I'm not aiming to get downloads.
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:11:02.220]   I'm not interested in making this podcast famous, and even if I were, it's not going
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.080]   to happen.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:11.700]   But there's such a low barrier of entry into the podcast community.
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:17.140]   And when I heard about that, I thought that this would be a great medium for those who
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:22.780]   are interested to maybe ignite dialogue.
[00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:34.820]   Maybe if you see some dude making a fool of himself, maybe that will stiffen other people's
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.100]   spine and we could finally have dialogue.
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:49.580]   And I value sustained dialogue so much, especially someone who has a differing ideology than
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:59.420]   myself because I want to share lives with people who have differing ideologies than
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:05.980]   me, but the problem is our culture almost doesn't allow for that.
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.940]   And I think that's incredibly sad.
[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:18.100]   So you remember at a dance when no one's dancing, some fool steps onto the dance floor
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:24.700]   first and starts dancing, and then everyone kind of joins in on the dance because they
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:25.700]   know it's safe.
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.220]   They know that you're not going to be judged.
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:37.300]   I want to be that guy who starts the dance and everyone with differing ideologies, we
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:47.500]   can at least share our lives and talk and see one another as human beings as opposed
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:57.380]   to people who have differing ideologies, aka the enemy.
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.420]   That is great in an established relationship.
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:08.460]   But again, even in established relationships, people are scared to speak.
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:17.780]   By doing something so dramatic, perhaps this will engender more conversation.
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:26.660]   So if you're listening to this and I say something and you want to talk, but you're afraid that
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:33.340]   you'll be labeled a racist or a bigot, I will keep our conversation confidential.
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:38.140]   If you're listening to this and you're the only liberal in a sea of conservatives or
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:44.800]   vice versa, I will keep our conversation confidential.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.620]   If you don't want to have sustained dialogue, that's fine too.
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.380]   I just need to take a risk.
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.540]   I also created an email for this podcast.
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.380]   It's thesurpassingvalue@gmail.com.
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.140]   If you want to send an anonymous email, that's fine too.
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:07.420]   It's thesurpassingvalue@gmail.com.
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:16.100]   Feel free to send me any thoughts, concerns, questions, ideas for future episodes, things
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.100]   of that nature.
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:25.860]   Furthermore, in the course of this podcast, you're going to hear me point to other podcasts,
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.740]   other resources, other thought leaders.
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:36.940]   I'm not going to present myself as someone with original ideas or fresh ideas.
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:42.460]   I might even take certain episodes to clarify some of the things I said earlier.
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:47.620]   As one might expect, that is not the way to grow a podcast.
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:54.100]   Because if you want to grow a podcast, you sort of have to have a cloak of authority
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.540]   so that people will come and listen to you.
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.780]   But growth is not one of my goals.
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.640]   It's not a goal.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:11.700]   So I'm free to point people to others and to do away with that type of pretentiousness.
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:23.180]   I'm looking forward to that, to just speaking and being what I would call a signpost theologian.
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:27.660]   So before I define that, I want to tell you right now, there's a podcast that I've been
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.580]   listening to that I would point you towards.
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:35.260]   It's the Just Thinking Podcast with Daryl Harrison and Virgil Walker.
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:41.400]   That is the Just Thinking Podcast with Daryl Harrison and Virgil Walker.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:48.620]   They're part of a larger podcast group called The Bar Podcast, B-A-R, The Bar Podcast.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:54.040]   That is headed up by my friend, Dwayne Atkinson.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:16:00.180]   Dwayne Atkinson is someone who actually helped me start the podcast, who helped me launch
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.180]   the podcast.
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:04.540]   I want to give a huge shout out to Dwayne.
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:08.700]   But the Just Thinking Podcast is a podcast that I've been listening to heavily.
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:17.060]   I would 100% recommend that you listen to them and just listen to all their episodes.
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:21.140]   If you come up to me and you tell me, "Hey, I listened to a couple of your episodes and
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:26.380]   then I just moved on to Just Thinking," I would consider that a victory.
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.660]   That's what I mean by a signpost theologian.
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:36.020]   A signpost theologian is a completely made-up term I just came up with to describe someone
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:43.620]   who doesn't consider themselves an authority, but rather someone who knows just enough to
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:50.780]   point people in the right direction and/or sift through the impurities.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:57.020]   Pretty much of all of what I'm going to say are things I've learned and digested.
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:01.180]   I don't have a single original thought in my head.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:07.180]   I will do my best to present the source of the things I say, but my head has become so
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.980]   full of ideas.
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:17.180]   I don't know with 100% accuracy where I got some of my ideas from.
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:22.180]   So that's what makes it difficult.
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:28.500]   So if you hear something and it sounds like something else that someone said, it's probably
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.140]   something else that someone said.
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:40.180]   The only human part that I will consider that I've played is that I try to use a strict
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:48.000]   scrutiny standard to the things I've learned, filter them through that strict scrutiny standard,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.580]   and hopefully do a decent job presenting it in a manner that is relevant, but again, by
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:59.780]   no measure exhaustive.
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:05.060]   With that said, if you're listening to this podcast, some of these topics might or might
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.360]   not appeal to you.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:16.880]   My target audience is not exclusively Christian, but as you know, I am a Christian.
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:25.880]   So that is the worldview that I'm going to be speaking from, or trying to speak from.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:34.040]   Now it doesn't mean that what I'm going to say isn't thoughtful.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:41.280]   And what I mean by that is, when people who do not go to church hear someone say, "I'm
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.900]   going to be speaking from a Christian worldview," it sounds like I'm just going to be spitting
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.320]   out a lot of Bible verses.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:56.040]   I am going to be spitting out Bible verses, but it's not going to be a sermon.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:10.680]   It's going to be an accurate blend of conveying truth, speaking in terms that anyone can understand.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:18.840]   However, I do believe that the Bible is the Word of God.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:23.580]   And in one of these episodes, I want to talk about that because I wasn't raised in a Christian
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:34.380]   home, and I really do want to explicate how I came to faith around college.
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.560]   I do want to talk about that because that's close to my heart.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:47.200]   I also, in a future episode, want to talk about the physical evidence for the resurrection
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.480]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:55.360]   Again, not speaking from a "because the Bible says" standpoint, but the extra-biblical evidence
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:00.840]   that points to the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:08.920]   In another episode, I am hoping to tackle the extra-biblical evidence for the Bible,
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:14.000]   the Hebrew Scriptures, the Old Testament, and also the New Testament.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:21.080]   I also want to talk about critical race theory, racism, social justice, human dignity, Darwinian
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:28.880]   evolution and scientific racism, abortion, the philosophical arguments for Christianity,
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:33.720]   worldview analyses, political philosophy, and sociological applications.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.880]   I will be talking about various passages in the Bible, various theological positions,
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:42.880]   the canon of Scripture, this idea of contributory negligence.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:49.900]   I'm hoping to even do some book reviews because I think there are plenty of books out there
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:55.480]   that could aid us in understanding so much of what's going on.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:04.000]   Now, if you've noticed from this list, it is incredibly eclectic in nature.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:14.880]   However, each of these topics, I could only approach from the Christian worldview.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.120]   And I want to tackle this in another episode too.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:24.960]   There really is no such thing as ideological neutrality.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.240]   It really is a myth.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:32.240]   Now, I can't expound on that in this episode.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:40.520]   I want to devote at least half an episode, if not an entire episode, to this idea and
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:45.060]   what I see as the myth of ideological neutrality.
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:49.920]   But let me say, it just doesn't exist.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:55.620]   So there is this temptation for me to say that I'm going to approach all these topics
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:22:02.920]   in a neutral fashion because a neutral fashion seems to give the connotation that it's unbiased.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:10.160]   And when you engage in a truth-seeking process, you would think that you would have to approach
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:15.040]   it from a neutral and unbiased viewpoint.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:24.040]   There's truth to that, but my only point is, none of us, none of us are ideologically
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.720]   neutral.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:32.520]   Thirdly and lastly, I want to address the probable destiny of this podcast.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:37.000]   I mentioned in the origin section that this podcast was born out of my perception that
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.120]   there are so few voices in an ocean of megaphones that are speaking within a framework that
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.480]   withstands scrutiny.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:52.980]   Dialogue is many times just shut down through assaults and insults while the one doing the
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:23:02.360]   veiled assaulting and insulting feels morally superior for having done so in a polite manner.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:11.480]   There are way too many monologues where straw men are set up as the opposing viewpoint.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:18.400]   People chop down or cut down these straw men in order to prove a point that doesn't really
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.680]   benefit the conversation.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:28.200]   And that entire action of setting up a straw man and then cutting down that straw man doesn't
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:33.520]   hold up to the pressure that truth naturally brings.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:39.680]   All it does is make that person who's doing the setting up and the cutting down, it makes
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:48.020]   that person feel morally superior and objective when in reality it's really the coward's way.
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:56.720]   With that said, this could very well be and I foresee it to be a temporary moment in time.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:03.320]   I don't think the few voices will be forever.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:11.640]   At some point we're going to wake up, at least that is my hunch.
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:18.680]   In the future this podcast is just going to shut down because there won't be few voices
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.800]   at some point.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:27.360]   Moreover, if I feel that I can't bring good content or it dawns on me that even the content
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:36.240]   that I'm bringing isn't up to snuff, then I won't see a need to continue.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:40.720]   So with that said, I don't know how long each podcast is going to be.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:49.100]   If you put a gun to my head, 30-45 minutes an hour, some episodes maybe 5-10 minutes.
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:54.120]   Even the frequency of the podcasts in terms of the production of new episodes will probably
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.240]   vary.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:25:02.120]   Whatever the case, I feel free because I'm not trying to gain traction.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:08.640]   All I want to do is just do a good job in tackling these issues and put forth a decent
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.640]   product.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:15.640]   I want to end with the title of this podcast, The Surpassing Value.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.760]   That comes from Philippians 3.8.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:25.960]   Philippians 3.8-10 is my favorite passage in all of scripture and it reads like this.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:32.280]   More than that, I count all things to be lost in view of the surpassing value of knowing
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:38.360]   Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them but
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:45.880]   rubbish so that I may gain Christ, and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:52.340]   of my own derived from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:26:00.160]   which comes from God on the basis of faith, that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:08.520]   and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:21.160]   There is so much meaning and purpose and joy and satisfaction I derive from these simple
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:25.240]   three verses.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:40.600]   I want to know Christ in my suffering because there is, as Paul described, this surpassing
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.540]   value.
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:48.520]   It's greater than anything of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:56.080]   And many times, that joy happens in suffering.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:07.560]   And when we avoid suffering, we're also robbed of that joy.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:12.600]   I want to be vulnerable.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:17.120]   I want to look like a fool.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:23.160]   I want to look like the village idiot.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:37.560]   Because when I look at this country, this country that I love with my entire heart,
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:50.400]   and I see it burning, I see it burning, I see it looted, I see half the country hating
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:28:04.640]   the other half, and I think to myself, I know why people hate each other.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:10.360]   I know what the solution is.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:17.640]   And it's gotten to a point where the false piece is now gone.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:23.280]   And we are completely at odds with one another.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:34.480]   I do not want to look back 5, 10, 15, 20 years from now and think to myself, you know, I
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.100]   wish I spoke up.
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:41.020]   I wish I spoke up.
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.840]   It's a little strange.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.520]   It's a little weird.
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:51.920]   This is completely outside of me to start a podcast.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:57.200]   Part of me is even ashamed.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:08.400]   At the same time, at the very same time, the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus,
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:15.280]   my Lord, makes it easy for me to risk.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:22.000]   It makes it very easy for me to risk.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:32.680]   The compulsion that I described to you earlier is a snapping that has occurred in my heart.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:44.160]   When you decidedly realize how little you care about being misunderstood, or the vulnerability
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:51.640]   that comes from articulating controversial ideas from a minority point of view, it is
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:57.540]   like fire in my bones.
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.120]   Well thanks for making it to the end.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.400]   I'll try to make the journey worth it.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:09.640]   To Him, the honor, glory, and eternal dominion, James Hong.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:16.520]   Amen.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.100]   (upbeat music)
