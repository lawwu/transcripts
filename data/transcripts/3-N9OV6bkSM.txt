[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   Here's a quick overview of how to use custom charts in Weights & Biases.
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.200]   So taking a look at the Google Colab, you'll start by installing the Weights & Biases Python
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.200]   library.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.500]   In the next cell, this starts a new Weights & Biases run to the custom charts project,
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.820]   and then logs some dummy data and creates custom charts that are based on these tables.
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.280]   So let's take a look at what that looks like on the project page.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.800]   On the left here, you can see that new run that I just launched coming in.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.040]   So each run appears in this sidebar and then is visualized on these charts.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.060]   These are the default charts, so these come from the call to WMB log up here.
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.960]   And then these charts down here are the custom charts.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.600]   These are what we created by calling a specific chart from the script and logging a specific
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.800]   table of data to visualize.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.640]   So taking a look at what we can do here.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.560]   Opening up this, I can actually edit the definition of the visualization that you see here on
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.000]   the right over here in this Vega spec.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.520]   So removing this line, you can actually see the line, these guys update.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.160]   And so I can apply this custom visualization and then see that on my project page.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.120]   Now if I wanted to save this new style of this visualization, I could actually save
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.680]   that as a new chart, and then I could call that from my script.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.680]   So looking at the list of charts I have access to, I can grab that and then go back to my
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.680]   script.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.840]   And in the next cell, I'll show you how you can log a custom chart that you've specified
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.200]   from the UI.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.460]   So I come in here and give that Vega spec name.
[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.720]   So I'm in this new run, I'm initializing the run, and then appending some data to this
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.560]   table, logging the table, specifying how the fields map to the columns in the table.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.120]   So specifying how the chart will be set up.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.080]   And then I just give it the new spec name that I defined here in the UI.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.920]   And when I run this cell, this will actually give me a new run that has exactly that chart
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.920]   that I was logging.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.440]   So you can see here, it's very fast to go from having an idea for a new chart to actually
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.040]   specifying it in the UI and seeing the result logged from your script.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.240]   I hope this was a good overview of the custom charts feature.
