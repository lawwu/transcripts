[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.980]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.640]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.340]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.640]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.980]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.540]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.900]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.900]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.980]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.860]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.200]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.480]   But don't forget,
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.560]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.480]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.560]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.120]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.720]   Well, listeners, I'm happy to welcome you to this episode.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.040]   We are gonna talk about Memory Master.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.700]   Those of you who may be new to classical conversations
[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.240]   and the foundations program may have,
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.120]   as the fall wears on, has worn on,
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.800]   you guys may have started hearing the words,
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.080]   the phrase Memory Master bandied about
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.000]   in your foundations community day.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.080]   And maybe some of the students
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.440]   in your child's foundations group
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.160]   have already started working on Memory Master.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.480]   And you're wondering what in the world is Memory Master
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.000]   and why should I care?
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.640]   And should I press my student to do that?
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.160]   And what does it look like?
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.840]   Now, some of you have been in foundations communities
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.600]   long enough to know what Memory Master is,
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.840]   but maybe you've never stuck your toe in the water,
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.360]   or you're just wondering,
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.780]   "Mm, it's a lot of pressure."
[00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.800]   I mean, is it a lot of pressure?
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.380]   Does my child want to do that?
[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.140]   Do I want to do that?
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.920]   I have got somebody here
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.120]   who can answer all of your questions.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.720]   And she loves Memory Master,
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.440]   but more than loving Memory Master,
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.320]   she loves children and families,
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.840]   and she loves equipping them to learn together.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.920]   So welcome Kelly Wilt today.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.100]   Kelly, thank you so much
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.760]   for sharing your Memory Master magic with us.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.680]   - Oh, friend, it is a rainy, gray November day here
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.580]   where I am, but it is pure sunshine to talk to you.
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.420]   - Oh, that's so sweet.
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.360]   - But I have something near and dear to my heart.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.060]   So I am excited to be here today
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.600]   and to discuss these things with you
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.320]   at what could be a critical time
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.000]   for a lot of families who are trying to make that decision
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.680]   about is Memory Master for us this year or not?
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.780]   So it's good for us to have this conversation
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.900]   because hopefully it will encourage families
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.060]   who are on the fence,
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.700]   and also maybe give a new perspective
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.820]   about the purpose of Memory Master
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.820]   and what it can mean for them and their families.
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.060]   - That's really good.
[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.340]   You guys, Kelly knows all about Memory Master.
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.420]   You might recognize her voice,
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.380]   well, maybe from podcasts or other recordings,
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.540]   but also if you have been
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.540]   to the National Memory Master competition before,
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.100]   Kelly Wilt serves as the emcee.
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.260]   So she knows all the ins and outs of Memory Master
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.220]   on the grand stage.
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.740]   But I'm here to tell you, that's not all there is.
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.220]   You do not have to commit to being part
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.700]   of the National Memory Master competition,
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.140]   which is like Memory Master on steroids,
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.940]   in order for you and your family
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.660]   to benefit from learning together
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.740]   and practicing Memory Master at the community level.
[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.500]   So that's most of what we're gonna talk about today.
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.700]   If you came on this podcast thinking,
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.500]   oh, I'm gonna learn all the tips and tricks
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.260]   for National Memory Master, you need to wait.
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.700]   We're gonna do that episode in a little bit.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.700]   But today, this is just about families
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.940]   who might be sticking their toe
[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.700]   into the water of National Memory Master.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.700]   So Kelly, I wanna start out just,
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.540]   and this is actually good for everybody to consider.
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.100]   This first question I wanna ask you,
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.580]   how can I inspire my child
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.060]   to want to do Memory Master?
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.820]   And the question a lot of us as parents are asking right now,
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.340]   is it too late for this cycle?
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.620]   So two part question.
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.420]   - Two part question, and I'm gonna answer it in reverse.
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.780]   It's definitely not too late for this cycle,
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.660]   but I will say this,
[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.660]   the sooner that you have a conversation with your child,
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.940]   and you make it a priority for your family for this cycle,
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.140]   the more time you will have to practice.
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.140]   And we like to say, practice makes progress.
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.980]   And one of the keys to achieving Memory Master
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.020]   is understanding that a large portion of this
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.100]   is mastery, not perfection.
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.900]   We don't expect as parents perfection from ourselves,
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.540]   and we can't expect it from our children,
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.180]   but we can expect them to take steps
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.020]   toward mastering difficult things.
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.060]   And so, I think it is key to inspire our children
[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.580]   to want to do Memory Master by first of all,
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.700]   being honest with them,
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.020]   having a conversation about,
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.380]   you know what, this is gonna be a challenging thing,
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.220]   but I have confidence in you.
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.220]   We can do this together.
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.020]   And that togetherness,
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.780]   as a parent communicating that to your child is key,
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.620]   because then immediately your child knows
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.820]   that he or she has a support base
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.820]   for accomplishing this challenging thing.
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.540]   And so, I think part of inspiration is honesty.
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.900]   I think part of inspiration is also
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.900]   being a ready source of encouragement for your child.
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.820]   - You know, I think about some of the long-term goals
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.620]   that I've tried to achieve in my life in the past,
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.340]   and at some point it is very likely
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.780]   that you might hit a plateau,
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.700]   or you just might be burned out with reaching an end goal.
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.500]   And it's always wonderful to have that one person
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.380]   in your life who looks you eye to eye in those moments
[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.460]   and says, you know what, this is tough,
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.220]   but I have confidence in you.
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.140]   You can do it.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.940]   Keep going, keep pressing forward,
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.620]   and you will accomplish this.
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.340]   And as parents, we have to be that for our children
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.100]   when they are taking steps to achieve a goal,
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.220]   a long-term goal like Memory Master.
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.420]   - That's really good.
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.580]   I love, love, love what you said.
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.700]   As parents, maybe the best inspiration for our child
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:14.140]   is to be their chief cheerleader.
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.060]   I like this.
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:20.060]   Be honest, be encouraging, and be available.
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.940]   That will inspire your child.
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.260]   Because you're right,
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.500]   our children need us to be honest with them.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.020]   This may not be the easiest thing you do this year.
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.340]   This may be hard.
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.340]   This may be sometimes discouraging
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.020]   if you get to that set of math facts
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.180]   that for some reason,
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.580]   you just can't make them stick in your head.
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.700]   Or if there's a history sentence,
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:50.100]   the wording of which keeps tripping your tongue up.
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.180]   But that encouragement that you can do it,
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.340]   you can do hard things, keep going, that's really good.
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.580]   I like that.
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:00.460]   I like that.
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.140]   Do you think it's encouraging to children
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:07.300]   to think that they might have a partner and a parent?
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.380]   - You know, I know for me, in difficult tasks,
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.300]   it always is encouraging to know
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.100]   that there's someone else there.
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.780]   And I think, especially in homeschooling,
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:21.660]   for our children to see that we are right alongside them,
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.180]   and that we are not going to basically
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.540]   throw this off on them
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.820]   to accomplish this hard thing by themselves,
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.740]   and then be incredibly disappointed
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.180]   when they don't accomplish it.
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.060]   - Yes.
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:36.660]   - That's not a good relationship builder.
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:39.780]   I think that is a discouragement to children.
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.740]   I know a lot of parents really take this to heart,
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.540]   and they actually commit themselves
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.620]   to learning all of our foundation's memory work,
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.860]   which I think is fantastic.
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.700]   - Man.
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.020]   - We've had some parents who in the past have joked
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.540]   that we need to have a parent national memory master.
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:02.540]   They want to model that dedication for their children.
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.420]   And you know, that's not for everyone.
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.260]   - Right.
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.180]   - I think as parents,
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.900]   we can commit to demonstrating for our children
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.620]   that we also are willing to do hard things alongside them.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:14.460]   - Yes, yes.
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.940]   - And complete the way.
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.100]   - And I think, you know,
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.420]   for the parents who have bitten that off
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.140]   and are chewing on it with their child,
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.620]   I think it can be very eye-opening for children
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.420]   to see that we as parents also struggle,
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.900]   and that in some ways,
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.420]   our kids are sometimes quote-unquote better at it
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.260]   than we are.
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.100]   I remember memorizing the timeline with my girls years ago,
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.820]   and I was keeping pace with them.
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.220]   I was feeling pretty darn good about myself
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.860]   for like the first five weeks.
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.180]   And then after we got up and we had bukus of cards,
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.180]   they were way faster than I am.
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.780]   Now, my husband and I, who are now grandparents, okay,
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.780]   and our grandchildren are not old enough
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.500]   to do foundations yet,
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.300]   but we are preparing ourselves.
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.180]   So we have decided that we are gonna start working
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.540]   on the timeline cards now.
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.380]   - Love it.
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:11.060]   - So that when our grandson is ready to tackle that,
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.180]   we'll be able to keep up.
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.100]   So, wish us luck.
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:14.940]   - Thank you.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.780]   - Wish us luck.
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.900]   All right, so listen,
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.580]   why is Memory Master important?
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:24.500]   Would you say that Memory Master is important
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.220]   for foundation students?
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.140]   And if you think it is important for those students,
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.380]   why is it so important?
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.460]   - That's a really great question.
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.940]   Yes, I would say it is important,
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.540]   but for reasons,
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:42.740]   different reasons than what might be typically thought of.
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.860]   - Okay, awesome.
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.420]   - So in our family's homeschooling journey,
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.940]   we have graduated two of our three children
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.660]   through Challenge Four.
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.340]   And looking back, I think when they were in foundations,
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.140]   I didn't recognize how important
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.380]   committing information to memory would be
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.140]   for their future success.
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:06.380]   I think I sort of had a view that Memory Master
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.700]   was a cool thing that they could do and they could achieve.
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.940]   And we could look at that as a recognition
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.900]   of what a great job we were doing as foundations families.
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.900]   - Right, in those early years, we did this great thing.
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.820]   - Yes, and truly Lisa, now looking back,
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.140]   I don't think I realized that that foundation's memory work
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.340]   is truly foundational.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.180]   - Yes.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.700]   - Not only in giving children the memory pegs
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.780]   that they'll later use to hang information on
[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.500]   through their years in challenge.
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.340]   - Yes.
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.980]   - But also, we are basically doing brain training.
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:42.820]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:47.820]   - Brain training, even in the youngest of foundation students.
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:53.340]   And so, as we, I can say if I went to the gym
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.620]   and someone handed me a 200-pound barbell
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.340]   and said, "Lisa's brain,"
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.980]   I can assure you that would not be happening.
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:00.820]   But--
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.540]   - Let me tell you, there are not 200-pound barbells.
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:08.540]   But maybe a 200-pound deadlift bar or something.
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.220]   - There you go, there you go.
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.060]   Ooh, yeah, that's true, that's true.
[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:18.060]   But you know, if I took time to lift weights bit by bit
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.740]   and increase my strength, it would be much more likely
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.580]   that I would be able to lift that heavy weight
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.500]   with more ease without injuring myself, maybe.
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.180]   - Yes, yes, absolutely, you're right.
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.060]   - Yeah, and it's kind of that way, I think,
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.540]   for our foundation students who, in these younger years,
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:40.620]   are getting a taste of that brain training
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.700]   as they commit all of these facts to memory,
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.420]   as they commit these geographical locations to memory,
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.660]   or timeline events, they are essentially starting
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:57.020]   to lift those smaller weights and then heavier weights
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.820]   so that when they are in challenge and beyond,
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:05.660]   their memory is outstanding, that they commit to memory
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:10.380]   more than just facts and information, but stories
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:15.380]   and poems and build up a library of the mind.
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.140]   So, you know, this is kind of the foundation's memory master
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.820]   is kind of the mental strength equivalent of, you know,
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.620]   looking at picture books with your child
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.740]   and having them recite back that picture book.
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:29.940]   - That is so true.
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.620]   - Yeah, and so as they grow,
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:37.020]   their ability to remember should also grow.
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:40.620]   - Mm-hmm, I will tell you a little short story,
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:45.620]   an anecdote that really showed me that this was true.
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.340]   My older daughter only did two years of foundations
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:51.660]   'cause we didn't find CC in our early days
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.860]   of homeschooling, but she was a great,
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.780]   she did memory master both of the years
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.180]   that she was in foundations.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.300]   She had a great memory that just got better.
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.860]   But when she was in college, she had one class,
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.660]   it was some kind of political science class,
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.620]   and she had to memorize.
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.820]   It was like the top, for 15 countries,
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.380]   she had to memorize their gross national product,
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.740]   in order, and several other categories.
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.260]   And I was just, it was just a bunch of numbers
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.780]   and percentages, and it just seemed horrifying to me.
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.900]   And she was like, "Oh no, I'm done with that part."
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.100]   And I'm like, "How in the world?"
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.980]   And she said, "It's like way easier
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.060]   "than memory master, Mom."
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.620]   She said, and she told me all the tricks
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.420]   that she had learned about cycling the information,
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.580]   about grouping it, about how to practice
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.300]   and when to practice, and mind palaces,
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.100]   and tricks that she had learned,
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:48.340]   that she had held on to as a college student
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.260]   from her foundations days.
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.620]   And the one thing that impressed me the most,
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.100]   not that she could memorize it all,
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.660]   'cause I knew she had a sharp mind,
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:01.100]   what impressed me the most was her confidence
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.220]   that that would not be a stumbling block at all.
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.180]   And so I love what you said, it does build brain muscle,
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.500]   but it also builds confidence, confidence.
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.220]   - Okay, so we have decided
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.100]   that our family's gonna do memory master.
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.020]   Yep, it's a good thing, it'll be good for us,
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.780]   eat your spinach, it's gonna be good for us,
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.660]   we're gonna do it.
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:25.260]   So what should my expectations be as a parent,
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:30.260]   both for me as the parent and for my child
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.060]   as the hopefully eventual memory master?
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.260]   - So I think how we said,
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260]   how do I inspire my child to want to do memory master?
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.660]   We need to be honest.
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.300]   We need to be honest with ourselves about our expectations.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:49.740]   I am guilty of in the past expecting my children
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:54.740]   to review memory work and letting them be on their own
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.020]   and expecting it to happen
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.460]   and for all of it to sink in through osmosis.
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.660]   And obviously, I don't even have to tell you
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:03.860]   the end of that story.
[00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.220]   I would come in the room and both of my boys
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.940]   would have created Lego lightsabers
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.020]   and they would be doing other things
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.340]   aside from listening to the memory work.
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.740]   So I think as a parent,
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:19.220]   one of your expectations must be that you will be hands-on.
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.820]   You have to be.
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.300]   Now, that's not to say that there won't be opportunities
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.380]   to be hands-off, for instance.
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.940]   If you play the memory work when you're in your minivan,
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.620]   driving to the grocery store
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.260]   or since we're approaching the holidays,
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.980]   if you're on your way to pick out a Christmas tree
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.300]   or driving to a Thanksgiving meal
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.340]   at a family member's house and you put on the CD,
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.140]   there are plenty of opportunities for review
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.620]   where you are not hands-on at.
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.860]   However, as a parent,
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:49.820]   you have to be willing to commit the time daily,
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.620]   if not almost daily,
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.820]   to reviewing a portion of the memory work
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:57.500]   because when we think about this type of information,
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:02.140]   saturating our children's mind, they're like sponges.
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.340]   If you dump a big bucket of water on a sponge,
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.500]   it's not going to soak in as deeply
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.820]   as if you pour a little bit by little bit over time.
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:13.500]   - That's true, that's a great analogy, awesome.
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.100]   - So I think as parents,
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.060]   we have to be willing to give time.
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.060]   We also, one of our other expectations is
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.380]   that we need to not allow ourselves to be frustrated
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:27.260]   because one of the delights of parenting
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.820]   is the fact that we are helping to refine
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.740]   our children's sinful little natures.
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.020]   - Yes, yes, oh my goodness.
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.860]   - And so there will be times when your child
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.300]   will want to go and build Lego lightsabers.
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.140]   - Yes.
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.780]   - And you know what, at that moment in time,
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:43.420]   as you weigh the situation,
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.140]   you weigh what has transpired
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:46.940]   in your household for that day,
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.060]   that might be exactly what they need to do.
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.260]   They might need it from time away.
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:56.260]   But I think also we have to be willing
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:00.140]   to sit down with our children and say, it is now time.
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.180]   I have given you time for these other things
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.940]   and now we are focused and we are here to do this together
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.900]   and to bring them into that time
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.700]   where you are working together.
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.580]   So I think, you know, our expectations,
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.620]   we have to be honest with ourselves.
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.500]   We also have to recognize that there will be times
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:20.020]   where we as parents may be frustrated
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:23.740]   and we need to figure out ways to work around that
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.420]   for the benefit not only of ourselves,
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.980]   but also of our children.
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:31.820]   And, you know, I think I had really high expectations.
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.140]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.460]   - All three of mine,
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.340]   when they were coming through Memory Master,
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:40.060]   I expected to say it once and they would retain it forever.
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.860]   - Right, like we could do that.
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:43.700]   - Exactly.
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:47.580]   So our expectations for our children cannot be,
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.900]   they cannot exceed the expectations we have for ourselves.
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.820]   If it takes us multiple repetitions
[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.500]   in order to master something and continue to remember it,
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.540]   of course it's gonna be that way for our children.
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.820]   Now, Lisa, you're right.
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:01.860]   They are better than us.
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.620]   Every year at National Memory Master.
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:04.980]   - I'm amazed.
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:09.420]   - I am reminded how these children can not only memorize,
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:13.140]   but they can manipulate facts in their minds,
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.220]   which is outstanding.
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.820]   But, you know, we also need to give them that confidence
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:23.500]   that you were speaking about earlier by repeating.
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.700]   Repeating, you know, over a long period of time
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.580]   and that we also need to have intensity
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.980]   by presenting the memory work
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.140]   in ways that they can easily remember.
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.020]   So we typically will say it has to be practiced
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:40.020]   with duration, repetition, intensity
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.460]   in order for it to stick.
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:42.500]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.860]   So what should be the expectations
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.060]   that we have of our child?
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.460]   'Cause I believe you and I do agree
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:54.220]   that we need to keep our expectations realistic.
[00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:55.060]   - Yes.
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.500]   - And that's our job for our, we need to be realistic.
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.940]   But what are those realistic expectations?
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:02.780]   - Right.
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.540]   Well, you know, sometimes I think we look at our children
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.780]   and we make the assumption that they're going to perform
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.260]   to the highest level.
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.860]   We look at our four-year-old and say,
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.500]   oh, he's gonna be, or she's gonna be
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.340]   a memory master this year.
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.220]   And we make that assumption.
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:20.060]   And either through life experiences, you know,
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.020]   things that are going on within your household
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.940]   during that particular cycle,
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.420]   it just may not be a reality.
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.660]   And so I think we have to look at
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:29.860]   what is going on in our lives.
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.100]   Did we move this year?
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.500]   Did our children go through, you know, a big move?
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.260]   Are we changing communities?
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.740]   Was there a family member who was sick that, you know,
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:43.180]   maybe mom or dad didn't have time to practice,
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.300]   to commit themselves to practicing?
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.220]   I think we have to be realistic with what is achievable
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.700]   based on the life circumstances
[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.220]   that we've gone through for that year.
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.940]   And also we need to look at our children and think,
[00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.500]   okay, what is my child's capability?
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:03.500]   Maybe your four-year-old came into foundations this year
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.380]   and is sitting on community day, you know,
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.300]   doing all the fun new grammar, you know,
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.420]   practice and jumping around and having lots of fun,
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.300]   but maybe memory master just is not
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.060]   on your family's radar this year.
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:19.260]   You're new to this whole classical education thing
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.260]   and the classical conversations.
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:24.580]   It might just be time for you to sit back
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.540]   and watch and take in and learn more
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.020]   about what classical home education is all about.
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.580]   And that's okay, that is okay.
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.700]   - And you know, one thing that I was thinking, Kelly,
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:38.940]   that I always counsel young parents to consider
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:43.340]   is that your expectations for each of your children
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.820]   need to be individual.
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.380]   You can't have a blanket,
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:51.980]   this is what we expect of memory masters in our house.
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:55.140]   No, you got to consider what is the grow,
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:22:00.140]   what's the grow goal for this child this year?
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:01.940]   Because like you said,
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.740]   if you have a child who really struggled
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.620]   at the beginning of the year to even make eye contact
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.340]   with other people in their class,
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.380]   then complete mastery of memory master
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.820]   might be too much of a stretch.
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:19.340]   So you have to consider where each of your children is
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.940]   in the given year and what would be,
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:27.220]   it's never bad for us to encourage our children to stretch,
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:30.780]   but what would stretch one child might break another.
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.260]   - Oh, that's so true.
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.140]   I think, you know, we have to, you're right,
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.180]   each child needs to be considered as an individual
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:42.020]   and each year needs to be considered individually.
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:45.020]   It's a dangerous thing for a parent to say,
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:48.300]   in this family, every single child is a memory master
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.340]   every single year.
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.180]   - Right, yes.
[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.740]   - And to not give that consideration,
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.940]   both to life and to the children
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.260]   that are entrusted to your care,
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.460]   because not only are you growing their minds,
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.860]   stretching their minds, you're shepherding their souls.
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.980]   And so you're very right, you know,
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.140]   what might be achievable for one child,
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.020]   even within the same family,
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.500]   might be too much of a stretch
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.900]   to the point of breaking another.
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:12.980]   So as parents, you know,
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.740]   we are our children's best, first and best teachers,
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:17.900]   and we know them best.
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.140]   And we really have to be honest with ourselves
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.780]   and consider not only the student,
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.020]   but also the life circumstances
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.980]   and the ability for that goal
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.540]   to be accomplished in that year.
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.500]   - That's so wise, so rich.
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:34.140]   Okay, so we have gotten ourselves straight.
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.780]   We've had a stern talk with ourselves.
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.220]   We've decided to do it.
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.660]   Our child is excited.
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:41.300]   We have committed to being realistic
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.740]   about our expectations of ourselves and of our child.
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.620]   We are all in, what do I do first?
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.540]   - Oh, so good.
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.860]   Okay, so first steps.
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:53.940]   If you have had a, well, the very first step,
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:57.100]   if you haven't already had a conversation with your child,
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.620]   be honest, sit down and say, you know what?
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.540]   I'm thinking this would be a good goal for you,
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.140]   and this is why.
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:09.060]   And also, you know, looking through the memory work,
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.140]   it also is something to consider
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.300]   that maybe the goal for your child for that year
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:14.980]   might need to be tailored
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.460]   from being a memory master of all subjects
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:23.380]   to being a memory master of two subjects or three subjects,
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:28.060]   or even just one subject based on what you've observed,
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.420]   like we were saying, that, you know,
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.700]   honest dialogue with yourself,
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.660]   and then communicating that to your child and saying,
[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.420]   okay, I wanna look with you, you know, at the memory work,
[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:42.220]   and I wanna talk through what is this gonna look like?
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.300]   Have that conversation with your child and say,
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:49.300]   okay, I think we can do this by practicing 15 minutes a day,
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.820]   if it's a small goal, or 30 minutes a day.
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.940]   Now, I would strongly recommend
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.820]   that you not take hours and hours every day.
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:59.020]   - Yes, yes.
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.260]   - Like with being our gym analogy
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:04.740]   that we had before with my 200 pound barbell.
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:05.580]   (laughs)
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.980]   - Too much of a good thing is not too good,
[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.100]   it's just too much.
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.900]   - Exactly, and so very quickly,
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.500]   your child will weary of this.
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.540]   And unfortunately, in some cases,
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.900]   come to resent practicing memory work,
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.860]   which is definitely something we don't want to do.
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.580]   So I think it's good to first have that conversation
[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:28.780]   with your child, lay down expectations,
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.660]   and think through, you know,
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:34.140]   how will we give each other accountability for this?
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:38.260]   Maybe you tack on that daily habit of reviewing memory work
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:41.380]   onto something that you already regularly do.
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.100]   For instance, maybe right after lunch,
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:44.980]   as soon as we, you know,
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.340]   clean up the dishes from the table,
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.460]   we're gonna come right back and do our practice.
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.220]   That makes it easier because you're attaching that
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:55.020]   to something that you already do regularly.
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:56.980]   And so there won't be the battle of,
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.740]   okay, your children have run off to their rooms,
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.220]   they've hidden under their beds.
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.060]   Don't do it.
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.700]   - It'll just become a natural routine,
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.780]   and nobody resents a routine, it just is.
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:09.300]   It's not something that's been put on them.
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.580]   - Exactly. - Cool, I like that.
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.740]   I like that. - Exactly.
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:16.180]   When it comes to community and first steps in community,
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.780]   one of the very first things you need to do
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.580]   is let your foundations director know.
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.900]   Let her know or him know,
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.300]   this is a priority for our family this year.
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.500]   Right now, you know, maybe our stretch goal
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:33.380]   is to memory master in three subjects.
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.660]   But our realistic goal is that we're going to at least
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.900]   try to daily practice our memory work for one or two.
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.420]   Or maybe, you know, you look at your director and say,
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:44.460]   "Hey, this is the year."
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.940]   - Right, right.
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.820]   - You know, and so have that conversation
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:52.860]   because your director is planning more than likely
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:56.020]   to have an interest meeting to gather other parents
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.940]   who are also interested in memory master.
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:00.620]   And some directors even taking it upon themselves
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:04.580]   to plan fun things like memory master clubs
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:08.580]   or having a review party over Christmas
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.620]   where you all get together or a review day in the park
[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:12.820]   where everyone can run
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:16.820]   and then come back together and practice some more.
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:20.100]   So letting your director know is a very hospitable way
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.940]   to also help him or her to be able to plan
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.700]   and also to gain support for this goal
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.460]   that you're trying to achieve as a family.
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.620]   - Yeah, oh, that's really good.
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:34.500]   Okay, I know 'cause I've read the catalog and other things
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:39.500]   that memory master is supposed to be child led,
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.020]   not parent pushed.
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.660]   And I know that none of us good parents
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.900]   who are listening to this call would ever be pushy,
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:51.540]   at least not at the beginning with our intentions.
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:55.900]   But sometimes, man, it is so easy for a parent to get pushy
[00:27:55.900 --> 00:28:00.420]   when a child's energy or interest starts to wane
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.900]   like what do I do?
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.980]   What do I do, Kelly, if my child's attention
[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:08.380]   or tenacity wanes during the process?
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.060]   Do we just give up?
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.900]   - Oh, okay, first of all,
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.780]   you have a parent on the call right now with you
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:16.180]   who is guilty of being a pusher.
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.740]   - Oh my gosh, I so can slip into that
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.180]   without even noticing.
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.820]   - Well, and for me, just being completely honest,
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.180]   it was a point of pride for me.
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:29.620]   I wanted to be able to say my child was a memory master
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:31.020]   as long as that,
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:34.140]   because that's a goal that's centered on myself,
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.620]   not on my children, not on their eternal benefit.
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.100]   It was all about me.
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:41.580]   And the Lord quickly drew my attention to the fact
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:45.300]   that my vision was wrong.
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.140]   Because the one year I did push,
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.580]   I completely stole my son's joy
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.620]   out of the memory master process.
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.380]   Stole the joy.
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:57.540]   I might as well have been cracking a whip
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:02.260]   'cause I was just unkind and not the mom
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.100]   that he needed at that moment.
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:07.300]   And so, I think I would say, first of all,
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.580]   keep the fact that this is child-led,
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.060]   not parent-pushed in your mind.
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:16.380]   And when you feel like you are moving to that side
[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.660]   where you're a pusher and not a leader,
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:23.300]   you need to take a moment to regroup as a parent
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.620]   and really examine,
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:28.420]   okay, are we doing this at a great time of day
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.380]   when our children get up in the morning?
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:31.860]   It is not good.
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:34.380]   You know, it's not kind as soon as their eyes pop open
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:37.140]   for us to say, all right, here's the timeline song,
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:37.980]   here we go.
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.340]   I mean, that just, I think that would build resentment.
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:42.180]   - Yes.
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.220]   - Examine. - That's so good.
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:45.700]   - Yeah, examine when you're doing it.
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.780]   - Your kid's natural rhythm.
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:49.620]   - Right. - Yeah.
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.940]   - You know, examine when you were reviewing.
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.900]   Is there something that you can improve
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.660]   that will make it more natural?
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.460]   Is there a point in the day
[00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.300]   where it's just basically simpler
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.620]   for you to do this thing together?
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.500]   And I think also, you know,
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.140]   when our children's attention wanes,
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.140]   or their tenacity.
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:09.980]   - Yes.
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:12.500]   - You know, we also, as parents,
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:16.220]   need to be willing to inspect what we expect.
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.060]   - Ooh.
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:20.300]   - So it may be time for an honest conversation
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:22.300]   with your child and to say, you know what,
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.020]   in, you know, at the beginning of the year,
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:26.300]   or, you know, even as now,
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.220]   right before we get into the holidays,
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:30.900]   maybe you sit down with your child and say,
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:32.620]   you know what, when we first started doing this,
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.020]   I noticed that you were really excited.
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.340]   And you came to the couch and you were,
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:41.500]   you had the book and the CD and you were ready to go.
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.340]   - Right.
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.940]   - Now, you know, when I call you to do this,
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.740]   you don't come right away,
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.660]   or I'll find you doing other things.
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.340]   And that what that says to me is,
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.540]   you're not excited about this anymore.
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:55.620]   And as parents, you know,
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.180]   sometimes we have to look at our children and say,
[00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:01.700]   I need to dig a little deeper to find what is the reason?
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.300]   Did we set too large of a goal?
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:05.820]   Are you discouraged?
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:07.340]   Are you just brain tired?
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.260]   And you need a little bit of time away,
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:12.500]   and then can come back to this with renewed energy,
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.140]   because I know I've been there.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:14.980]   - Right.
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:17.620]   - But we have to be willing to have that conversation
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:18.700]   with our children.
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:21.020]   Now, if your children are really young,
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.660]   it might just be as a parent,
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:26.100]   your opportunity to say, okay, I reached too far.
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:29.060]   The goal is too big, we're stretching too far,
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:29.900]   and then you--
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.460]   - We're stretching too thin, we're just too thin, yeah.
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:36.060]   - You just need to intentionally tailor the goal
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.660]   to something that is manageable.
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:39.420]   And that's okay, that's okay.
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:43.020]   It is far better for you to intentionally tailor a goal,
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:47.620]   than for you to aim for something and then stop trying.
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:51.060]   - Right, and be miserable about both things,
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:54.980]   that you stopped and that it was too much.
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:55.900]   - For sure.
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:56.860]   - I like that.
[00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:01.820]   I love that the reminder that we need to explore the why
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:05.540]   of the waning interest and respond appropriately.
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:07.980]   So do we need to scale the goal?
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.020]   Do we need to take a break?
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:13.580]   Do we just gently remind our student that,
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.660]   well, we knew it was gonna be hard.
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:16.500]   - Right.
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.500]   - Stretching is sometimes uncomfortable,
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.660]   but it does allow us to do things with ease
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.300]   after we stretch.
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:28.860]   So sometimes our students just need to be given a break
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:30.980]   and then encouraged to come back.
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:32.900]   But sometimes, like you said,
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.260]   we've set a goal that was unrealistic.
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:38.620]   And maybe we didn't realize it was unrealistic.
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:39.460]   - Right.
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.420]   - And a lot of how our children will feel
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.860]   about amending a goal will come from us.
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.620]   So if we act like, well, the best,
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.260]   let's just do the best we can.
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:51.620]   I guess this is the best we can do.
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.740]   Then that seems like a loser mentality.
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:55.620]   - Yes.
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.900]   - But if you are like, oh my goodness,
[00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:00.820]   we are having so much fun with this history sentences.
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.220]   Let's put all our time there
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.540]   because that is bringing us so much joy.
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:06.700]   That is a joyous way to tailor.
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.700]   And this is embracing the strength.
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:09.780]   I love that.
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:10.620]   - For sure.
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.460]   - I love that.
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.300]   - I will also add, for goodness sakes,
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:14.580]   don't do what I did
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.380]   and compare your children to one another
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.900]   or to their community.
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.500]   Do not look at your child and say,
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.500]   well, Tommy's mom never has to call him.
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:27.540]   - Yes.
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.380]   - Don't do that.
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:30.700]   Because again, that builds resentment.
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.100]   It's not motivational.
[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:33.820]   I mean, my goodness.
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:37.220]   If I were lifting weights, like we alluded to earlier.
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.060]   - Yes.
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:40.020]   - You looked at me and said, well,
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:43.380]   your friend, whomever is lifting this,
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:44.860]   I'm not motivated for that.
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.340]   - What's the matter you?
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:47.180]   - That's right.
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:48.620]   That's right.
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.540]   You know, part of that encouragement
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:54.260]   is finding your child's emotional currency.
[00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:55.900]   What will build them up
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:58.940]   to the point where they can come at this again,
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.980]   that with renewed interest and vigor.
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:04.380]   And you know, I really do think the holidays
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.500]   are a great time for us to be able to do that.
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:11.460]   To have, you know, refreshed vision, fresh eyes,
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.260]   to come back again, you know,
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.980]   at that goal with energy and excitement.
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:18.860]   Because, you know, realistically,
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.940]   sometimes we do need a little bit of time away
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:26.140]   in order to come back and completely be able to achieve
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:27.980]   what we're wanting to do over the longterm.
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:29.380]   So I agree with you, Lisa.
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:32.380]   The conversation and how it's framed to your child
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:36.380]   is of critical importance for them wanting to continue
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:39.180]   forward and chase that goal.
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:40.180]   - Yes.
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:43.460]   That's great.
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:44.860]   That is really great.
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:48.620]   Those are good thinking points for us.
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:50.980]   So this kind of goes along with it.
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:54.180]   Some of us on the call might be thinking,
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:55.700]   okay, this sounds really good.
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.220]   I just joined in to see what in the world
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:59.180]   this Memory Master thing is,
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.780]   and we're not really gonna do it.
[00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:04.860]   I don't think it's the right goal for our family this year.
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:07.940]   But are there some ways that we could stretch
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.380]   toward this goal for the future?
[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.380]   - So good.
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:16.100]   I think that we've alluded to this a little bit already.
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.420]   Just by dipping your toe in the water
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.620]   and saying to your child,
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:23.620]   well, I think we're going to do this one subject this year.
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:26.500]   And then, you know, say, okay, next cycle,
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.140]   we're gonna make it our goal to do this subject
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:34.140]   and one other, and continue stretching.
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:36.580]   Obviously, with kindness toward your family
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:38.460]   and toward your student and consideration
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.260]   for what they're able to do.
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:43.300]   And also, I think, assess each year,
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.820]   okay, this was when it got tough.
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:46.660]   - Right, right.
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:47.900]   - This is when, you know,
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.980]   when we got to week 16 out of 24,
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.100]   that was when it started to feel heavy.
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:57.620]   And anticipate those things as you move forward.
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.260]   You know, I think also,
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:02.220]   just thinking about this being a stretch goal,
[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:05.140]   a lot of parents will try to get their children
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:08.740]   to commit to memory the subjects of memory work
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:11.420]   that repeat from cycle to cycle.
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.500]   So maybe they'll start out, you know,
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.540]   working on the timeline song,
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.860]   because timeline repeats in cycle one, two, and three,
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:22.020]   or math, which can be difficult for some students
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.380]   to remember those numbers.
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:26.380]   And when our children are young,
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.780]   skip counting is a little easier because of the song.
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.420]   But when they're 10 years old and up,
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.620]   you know, committing those facts to memory
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:39.460]   is incredibly helpful for our students moving forward
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:40.860]   in their math studies.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:43.940]   So, you know, potentially starting with a subject
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.900]   that would be repeated and having them focus on that
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:48.620]   and try to master that,
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:51.580]   helps you to continue to build forward
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:54.380]   because they've already mastered that subject in one cycle.
[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.220]   - Right.
[00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:57.620]   - It's just review in the next cycle,
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:59.860]   and then add on one more subject.
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.140]   So that by the time that you've done this
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:03.820]   for a couple of years,
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.900]   your child is starting to feel more confident
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:09.460]   because they're seeing things they're familiar with.
[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:10.620]   And then at that point,
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:12.820]   it becomes easier to retain the information
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.300]   because they've seen it more than once,
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.340]   they've experienced it more than once.
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.100]   You know, their bodies have grown,
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:20.540]   their minds have grown,
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.020]   there's more familiarity with what we do in community
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.100]   and then also what you do at home.
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.460]   You know, if you're building good habits
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:30.100]   and you're using good rhythms on a daily basis,
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.700]   and that confidence makes them think,
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.940]   "Well, yes, I can do this, I can do this."
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.900]   It also helps if you're asking your child
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.620]   to continue to stretch,
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:44.060]   to encourage the other students in the community
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.500]   who have talked, who have done this,
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.980]   to talk to your child and to say like,
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:50.620]   "What was this like for you?"
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:53.500]   And have conversations with other people,
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.420]   other families who have stretched for these goals
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:58.820]   and glean wisdom from other people in your community,
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:02.540]   as well as from your child's tutor and director
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.900]   about ways that you can continue to tailor,
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.220]   always stretching toward the future,
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:10.340]   always looking for it with a growth mindset,
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:13.940]   but yet also tempering that with the understanding
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:18.380]   that at some point, you may need to continue to tailor.
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:21.100]   Sometimes it may look like three steps forward
[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:24.700]   and two steps back, but you're still making progress.
[00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:26.740]   And that is what I think.
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:27.980]   - That is so good.
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:30.100]   And that's very encouraging, Kelly.
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:33.180]   It's not, Memory Master is absolutely not
[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:36.180]   an all or nothing proposition.
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:39.300]   I think that's what I want families to take from this call
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.620]   more than anything else.
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.220]   It is not all or nothing.
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:47.100]   And you can, parents, even give your students
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:51.740]   incremental rewards at home that you determine.
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:54.540]   So it's not, you'll get a brand new bike
[00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.700]   if you become a Memory Master.
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:00.540]   It might be that you earn a Bailey book
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:04.460]   for every fact you memorize.
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.660]   And so then you are in control
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:10.580]   of how much you quote unquote earn.
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:11.420]   - Right.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:14.900]   - So, all right, we're getting into the slow slide
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:19.900]   to the holiday season where everybody's regular routine
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:25.220]   and all our well oiled rhythms kind of unravel.
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.060]   So Christmas is coming up.
[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:30.540]   What can I do to make sure that memory work
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:33.020]   is not forgotten over the break?
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:35.220]   What can I do over the holidays?
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.060]   - So good.
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:39.140]   First things first, do not relegate your curriculum
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:42.780]   to a spot on your bookshelf and let it get dusty
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.540]   over Christmas break.
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.980]   Keep it out on the countertop safely away
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.100]   from all of the Christmas and holiday baking
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.700]   that you're going to do.
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.460]   But keep it handy.
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:56.140]   If you have any other resources like flashcards,
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:58.180]   during the holidays, we're on the go.
[00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.500]   Take those flashcards in your car,
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.540]   put on the memory work.
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:06.140]   As you travel from place to place,
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:09.460]   who knows your children may even want to serenade a neighbor
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.900]   by caroling the history book.
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:14.660]   - You never, my kids used to do weird stuff like that.
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:16.580]   (laughing)
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.820]   - I think the first tip I would say
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:21.580]   is keep your resources handy.
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:23.580]   That means that you might need to put them in a bag
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.620]   and take them from place to place.
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.900]   So that way you're still continuing to work
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:31.220]   on reviewing memory work little bit by little bit.
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:34.420]   I know a lot of families who have that stretch goal
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:37.460]   of memory mastering for every subject
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:40.500]   will often take time during the holidays
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.820]   to review the memory work that comes
[00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:44.540]   at the end of the cycle.
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:47.380]   And to go ahead and read those things,
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.460]   recite those things with their children
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.620]   so that they have a little bit of familiarity
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.660]   before they get to the end of the cycle.
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:56.620]   Because obviously we don't have as long to practice
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:01.020]   the facts on weeks 22, 23, and 24,
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:04.420]   as we do the facts that came way back on weeks one,
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.980]   two, and three.
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:09.300]   So I do know some families will take advantage
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:13.100]   of that opportunity just to not necessarily master
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:14.780]   those facts, but to at least introduce.
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:17.700]   - Yeah, that's such a good idea.
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:20.420]   - I think one of the easiest ways
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.060]   to not forget memory work over the break
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:26.980]   is to integrate it into your preparations for the holiday.
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:29.380]   I have distinct memories of my children
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.020]   singing into rolling pins
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.340]   as we rolled out Christmas cookies
[00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:36.020]   and we recited memory work.
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:38.980]   Or if we're measuring ingredients for cookies,
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:42.500]   that they're reciting their metric measurements.
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:45.180]   So I would look for little ways like that
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:48.340]   to integrate the practice into what we were doing
[00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:49.980]   at home during that time.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.860]   And I would also say, Lisa, you were spot on.
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:54.300]   A lot of times over the holidays,
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:57.460]   our homeschool routines just fly out the window.
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:00.860]   And it's good to attach that memory work review
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:04.180]   to something you still continue to do regularly
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.180]   over the holidays.
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:07.940]   Like for example, we were talking about eating lunch
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:09.300]   and then memory work.
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:12.340]   Obviously you're still going to eat lunch over the holidays.
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:15.780]   So it's a good thing to attach that habit to something
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:18.860]   you're going to continue to do that won't be upset
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:22.500]   by the fact that you may be taking a break
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:25.060]   from other subjects over the holiday break.
[00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:28.980]   So I think those are two good things.
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:29.940]   - Yeah.
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:32.940]   - And giving your children opportunities to play.
[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:36.860]   I know that there is a brilliant CC mom
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.420]   who has figured out that the flashcards
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:41.420]   that we have for each of our cycles
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:44.340]   actually correspond to the color spots
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:48.020]   on the board for the game candy land.
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:49.660]   - Yes, that's hilarious.
[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:51.340]   - So if you have fun games,
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:52.900]   or there are things that your children have done
[00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:55.340]   in community for grammar review,
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.780]   I mean, while you have a little more ease at home,
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:00.820]   that's a great time to just say,
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:03.460]   hey, what game do you want to play
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.940]   that we played on community day?
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:09.940]   And just to continue to cultivate those memories with them
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.380]   by doing those same things at home.
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:14.820]   I think there are so many ways
[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:17.340]   that we can have fun with memory work.
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:20.740]   Children really, their love language for learning
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:22.820]   when they're young is play.
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:25.380]   And so if we can tap into that and we can harness that,
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.180]   particularly over the holidays,
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:28.420]   you're making great memories,
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:32.300]   but you're also strengthening their memory along the way.
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.660]   - That's really good.
[00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:36.740]   That's really, before, I know I need to let you go,
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:41.140]   but you said one thing in passing a few minutes ago
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:43.220]   that I really want to ask you about.
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:46.420]   You talked about sometimes communities
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:49.580]   will have like memory work practice days
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:52.740]   or something about playground days
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.620]   where they run off and play and then they come back
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:57.540]   and everybody does math facts or something.
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.900]   What are some fun things that we as parents
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:03.060]   can encourage our community to do
[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:07.060]   that will help our family stretch
[00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:09.140]   toward this memory master goal?
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:10.380]   - Oh, that's so good.
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:13.620]   I think if we do have conversations with our directors
[00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:15.460]   and they have a really good idea
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:18.340]   of how many students in a community
[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:21.540]   are stretching toward memory master in different ways,
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:24.340]   they can work alongside parents
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:27.340]   to plan fun things together.
[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:29.020]   I have been in communities in the past
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:33.380]   where directors would set up a different station
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:37.020]   in one big room for each portion of memory work.
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.700]   And so the students would rotate through
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:41.140]   and they would get a stamp or a sticker
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:43.780]   for their review index card,
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:47.140]   with each center that they had gone through
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:48.540]   and they had reviewed memory work
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:50.140]   and it was motivating for them.
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:54.740]   I know other communities have also done color beads.
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:58.460]   And so as students go through each section of memory work
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:44:59.820]   up until that point,
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:01.620]   as they review it with a different parent,
[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.500]   they'll get a different color bead for a bracelet.
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:06.780]   Those are just fun little things
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:10.140]   for communities to be able to do
[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.660]   that are a little more formal,
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:15.140]   but you always have the opportunity to call up a friend
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:18.340]   who also is stretching toward this particular goal
[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:20.420]   and say, hey, you know what?
[00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:22.500]   We're gonna go do this thing today
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:23.940]   and we'd like to invite you along.
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:26.420]   We know you're also working on memory master
[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:28.660]   and we were just wondering, could we trade off?
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:30.620]   And you could ask my child questions
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:32.740]   and I could ask your child questions
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:34.660]   just so that you're continuing to practice,
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:38.020]   but you also have ample opportunities for fellowship
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:39.500]   during those times.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:41.780]   Never forget that there are people alongside you
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:44.540]   in the trenches who are doing the same things
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:47.740]   and community, just knowing you're not alone
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:50.540]   in the same sense that your child wants to know
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:53.340]   they're not alone in this memory master process.
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:56.460]   As a parent, you are not alone either.
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:57.500]   - Yes.
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.780]   - Not only are we here at Classical Conversations
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:03.420]   delighted to support you with any questions
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:06.140]   that you might have, your local director,
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:10.340]   your child's tutor are also there to walk alongside you
[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:11.700]   and to give you support.
[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:14.940]   Your friends and community are wanting the same things
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:16.460]   for their children.
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:18.940]   So if you reach out to another parent and you say,
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:22.100]   hey, we would love to review memory work with you.
[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:23.860]   Do you want to come over for a play date?
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:26.180]   There is nothing more delightful to that parent
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:28.900]   than to hear, you know what?
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:32.420]   I have a friend here who is also doing hard things.
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.180]   Let's do hard things together.
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:35.180]   - Yes.
[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:36.620]   - Support one another.
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:39.820]   - I really think that as humans,
[00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:41.660]   God made us to be in community.
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:45.900]   And I do really, really believe that doing hard things
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:47.820]   is easier with a friend.
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:48.860]   - For sure.
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:53.260]   And it does help to know that we as parents
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:56.420]   are not alone in this endeavor
[00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:59.620]   that we're encouraging our children in.
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:01.020]   That's really good, Kelly.
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:01.860]   Thank you.
[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:05.060]   That reminds me of something that I wanted to mention
[00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:07.220]   to you guys, you listeners.
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:10.540]   You are not alone as you try to become
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:13.340]   a better and better home educator.
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:15.980]   And you may think, I really wish I knew
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:20.980]   how to wield those tools, those skills better.
[00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:22.980]   I really want to know more and more
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:25.340]   about the skills of learning that people
[00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:28.300]   keep talking about, but man, I need some encouragement
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:29.740]   or I need a community.
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:33.020]   If that's you, I want to ask you if you've heard about
[00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:35.580]   the classical learning cohorts.
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:37.860]   You can cultivate those new skills
[00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:40.500]   and grow in your confidence
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:45.140]   as you are giving your children that quality education.
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:48.340]   If you want to check this out,
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:53.140]   you're invited to experience the classical learning cohort,
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.380]   ask a mentor event,
[00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:57.900]   if that's not the longest title for an event ever.
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:01.820]   But listen, what it is, is a free,
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:03.460]   absolutely free, no pressure event
[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:07.100]   that will give you a little bit of firsthand knowledge
[00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:10.860]   about the classical learning cohort,
[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:15.860]   where you can learn to wield the skills better
[00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:19.340]   with a group of fellow learners.
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:22.100]   Registration is open now
[00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:26.140]   and it closes the beginning of February.
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:29.380]   So in the spring, classical learning cohorts
[00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:33.580]   begin early in February, okay?
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:37.220]   If you are interested to do that,
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:42.220]   you can register at classicalconversations.com/cohort.
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:48.620]   That's the classical learning cohort
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:52.180]   and encourage a group of encouragers for parents,
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:54.660]   just like we as parents are gonna be encouraging
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:57.780]   our students who are interested in Memory Master.
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:01.820]   And Kelly, you have given us so many good suggestions
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:06.300]   about how to equip ourselves and equip our students
[00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:09.500]   to be realistic and be a part of this process.
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:11.620]   Thank you so much for your wisdom.
[00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:12.740]   - Absolutely, friend.
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:14.740]   And if you're listening to this podcast
[00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:18.540]   and you have questions about the Memory Master process,
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:22.260]   please check out our forums on CC Connected
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:25.620]   or reach out to our Foundations Academic Advisor
[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:29.060]   at foundations@classicalconversations.com.
[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:31.020]   We're happy to help in any way that we can
[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:34.020]   to help you be able to stretch toward this goal
[00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:35.460]   for your family.
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:36.620]   - That is awesome.
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:37.980]   It's a great reminder, Kelly.
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:38.820]   Thank you.
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:40.460]   Guys, I will see you next week.
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:41.980]   Thanks, Kelly, again.
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:42.820]   Bye-bye.
[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:45.620]   (gentle music)
[00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:47.680]   you
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:57.680]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
