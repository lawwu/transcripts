[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.120]   You will remember that we are still considering the first verse of the first chapter of Paul's
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:15.960]   epistle to the Romans. We have seen together that the Apostle is here introducing himself,
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:25.120]   and he describes himself as a servant of Jesus Christ, a called Apostle, but also one who
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:34.400]   has been separated unto the gospel of God. Now we have considered his account and description
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:41.120]   of himself in that threefold manner. So now we are in a position to go on to consider
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:51.960]   what he tells us here about that unto which he has been separated. He is convinced, he
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.160]   knows that God had separated him from his mother's womb through this peculiar task
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.820]   of preaching and proclaiming the gospel. He has been separated unto that, and you notice
[00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:14.840]   that he describes it and defines it as the gospel of God.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:24.080]   Now here again we are face to face with something which is of the utmost importance for us.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.100]   The Apostle here, as I shall have occasion to say probably many times, is pressing into
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:39.320]   a very small space the great content of his gospel. It's even a synopsis compressed,
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.320]   if you like. But that makes it of course doubly important for us to be sure that we do see
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.320]   something at any rate of the great content which he thus puts into so few words. And
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.040]   the best thing we have to do therefore, the best thing we can do, is to just look at the
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:04.480]   words themselves. He has been separated, he says, unto the gospel. Now I often feel that
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:12.600]   we are so familiar with this word 'gospel' that we fail to realize its deep and its tremendous
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:21.720]   significance. It means, as everybody knows, good news. And it's just that, I fear at times,
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.240]   that we tend to forget. We turn up our dictionaries and we find that 'gospel' means that, and
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.200]   we stop at that. We've known the exact meaning. We are philologists, we are interested in
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.720]   words and their meanings and their derivations. And often our whole study of the scripture
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.480]   ends with the words, we end with a letter, and we've never succeeded in arriving at the
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.800]   spirit. If we say that we know that 'gospel' means good news, the really important question
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:01.080]   for us therefore is this. Is the gospel good news to us? Has it come to us as good news?
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.200]   Is that our real understanding of the thing itself, and not merely the word in which it
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.880]   is described? Now the apostle of course was very concerned about this. He can never mention
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.640]   this word or come anywhere near it without obviously being thrilled and moved to the
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.080]   very depth of his being. And I believe that he introduces the word like this at once in
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:35.240]   order to remind us of certain contrasts. He is now a preacher of good news, no longer
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.960]   by contrast a teacher of the law. He had been a teacher of the law. He was a Pharisee as
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:50.400]   we've seen, and a great expert. But there was no good news about the law. The law was
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.560]   never meant to be good news. The law, as we shall find him saying, was added because of
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:03.280]   transgressions. The law had come in in order to pinpoint sin. The law had never been given
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.840]   as a means or a method or a way of salvation. You can't think of the law in any sense as
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.960]   good news. Though there is, to be certain, and it's true, an element of grace in the
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:22.160]   law, the law as such is not a gospel. It's not good news. Now there are many who seem
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.880]   to fail to understand that. They seem to think that God gave the children of Israel the law
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.320]   in order to give them an opportunity of saving themselves. But the Apostle will be of great
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:40.640]   pain to say that that is a tragic misunderstanding of the law. And therefore to think that the
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:47.400]   gospel only came in as an afterthought when the law had failed, is just to misunderstand
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.520]   both the law and the gospel. No, no, it isn't law, says Paul. He is no longer a teacher
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:03.600]   of the law. He is a herald of good news. Or, in the same way, we can say that the gospel
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.700]   is not merely an announcement that God is going to forgive sins. Because that again
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.440]   was something that was known under the old dispensation. There is a very great and wonderful
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:22.040]   doctrine of forgiveness of sins in the Old Testament. So the peculiar thing about the
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.680]   gospel is not just that either. And it is again to misunderstand the gospel, to think
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.340]   of it solely as a message which announces that our sins are going to be forgiven. There
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:41.440]   are abundant statements of that in the Old Testament documents. It isn't that. That
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:48.440]   isn't the good news. And another negative, which perhaps is very important, is this one.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:57.000]   This message is not primarily an appeal to us to do anything. That again would not be
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.440]   good news. There are people, as you know, who seem to think of the gospel, the Christian
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:08.080]   message, as just a great appeal to men and women to live a good life, to be moral and
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:15.200]   to be ethical, and so on. Now, it's not for me to criticize others, but I have no doubt
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.280]   at all that a good deal of that kind of thing will be heard next Sunday. On any national
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:28.200]   or civic occasion, that is the kind of thing one hears. And appeals are made for behavior
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:34.520]   and loyalty to the country, and so on and so forth. That's not good news. It's not
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.720]   the gospel, therefore. It's not the Christian message. But so often it passes as the Christian
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:46.760]   message. It's sometimes given the designation public school religion, which is an appeal
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:53.560]   simply for conduct and for behavior. But that's not Christianity. That's not gospel. To make
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:00.520]   an appeal to people isn't to herald good news to them. Indeed, it's almost the exact opposite.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.020]   If you simply tell people that they ought to be better, and that they must make a great
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:11.180]   effort to be better, you're not bringing good news to them. But Paul says that he's a herald
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:19.520]   of a gospel. He's been separated to give good news. Well, what is this? Well, obviously
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:27.760]   it is something new. It's something unique. It's something very special. And, of course,
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.480]   the Apostle goes on later to tell us exactly what it is. He gives us a hint of it straight
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:39.280]   away here. It's something concerning God's Son. Indeed, it's something concerning God
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:46.380]   himself and what he's done. As I say, it is not primarily an appeal to us to do anything.
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:54.640]   It is an announcement and a proclamation to us of what God has already done. You see,
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.160]   he puts it like this so magnificently in verses 16 and 17. "I am not ashamed of the gospel
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:06.540]   of Christ." Why? "It is the power of God unto salvation." Not an exhortation to men to save
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:13.240]   themselves. God's way of saving. God's power unto salvation to everyone that believe it.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:21.840]   To the Jew first, and also to the Greek. "For therein is a righteousness from God revealed."
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:27.320]   That's the new thing. Now, that's the thing that you don't find in the Old Testament.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:33.600]   You see, it isn't there. The forgiveness is there. But this full exposition of this righteousness
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:44.080]   from God is the new and the special and the unique thing which makes the gospel the gospel.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:51.280]   And it is because he realizes that the Apostle, I say, always thrills to it. Now, that statement
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:58.640]   that I've just read is an example of what we may call laterties. "I am not ashamed of,"
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:05.000]   by which he really means, "I take pride in, I burst of. Nothing else to me is so great
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.040]   as this." It's one of those positive statements which is given a negative form. He says, "I
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.200]   am not ashamed." He means, "I'm absolutely thrilled by it. I can scarcely contain myself."
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:25.800]   Well, now, this then is the first thing we must always realize about the gospel. And
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.880]   this, you see, is something that, according to the Bible, always must characterize the
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:37.280]   gospel. If you go back to the Old Testament and look at the prophecies of the coming of
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:45.240]   this gospel, you'll find that they're all of them lyrical. Think of Isaiah 35. Think
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:52.120]   of Isaiah 55. On this comes the lame man's going to be leaping like a heart, and everybody's
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:58.000]   going to be singing and rejoicing. That's the note. The mere thought of it, the suggestion
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:06.240]   of it, always brings in this element of praise, and of rejoicing, and of thanksgiving. And
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:11.320]   if you've noticed what we read together in that passage from the second chapter of Luke's
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.920]   gospel, just now, the same point comes out exactly. The angel appears to those shepherds
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:22.480]   in the field at night. He says, "Look here, I've got good tidings of great joy for you."
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:29.640]   That's the note. Good tidings. Gospel. And you remember that after they'd gone to Bethlehem
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:34.920]   and had verified these things, we are told that they went back rejoicing, and with a
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:42.440]   great joy. That's the introduction to the gospel. And the heavenly choir sang praises
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:48.680]   unto God. And they said, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:57.160]   amongst men," and so on. Now this therefore, obviously, is something which is very vital
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:03.840]   to the gospel, and an essential part of it. Well now, my friends, there's no point in
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:10.640]   our going further until I ask a question. And the question again is this. Has it come
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:19.360]   to us like that? Can we say, honestly, at this moment, that this is the greatest and
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:27.880]   the biggest and the best good news that we've ever heard? I'm getting to the position
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:36.240]   in which I feel I can say that if we cannot say that, well then, to put it at its mildest,
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:43.000]   we ought to be very doubtful as to whether we are Christians at all. This is either the
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.840]   greatest good news we've ever heard, or else it isn't. And if it isn't such to us,
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:57.840]   well, there are reasons for that. If you are not aware of the fact that this is the greatest
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:03.560]   good news that has ever come into this world, or has ever been received by men, it may be
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:11.320]   due to the fact that you have an inadequate sense of sin, and an inadequate realization
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:17.440]   of your own sinfulness. Because people who think that they're all right as they are,
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.960]   because they're such good people, and because they're living such good lives, the gospel
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.840]   is not good news to them, they've never seen any need of help, and therefore they don't
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.600]   feel thrilled at it, and they don't see how wonderful it is. Those who think they
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:35.480]   can put themselves right are in the same position. There is no doubt about this at all. An inadequate
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:43.280]   understanding of our sinfulness is probably the greatest single cause of a failure to
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:49.400]   rejoice in the Lord always, and to realize that this message is the greatest good news
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:57.560]   that the world has ever received. Let us therefore examine ourselves. If you are lacking in joy,
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:02.400]   the thing to do is not to try to work up some joy within yourself, it's to go to the Bible,
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:10.520]   to the law, and convict yourself of sin. The positive road to joy is always via the depth
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:19.280]   of sin. That's one thing. Or another one, perhaps, is this. It is a failure on our part
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:26.240]   to realize the consequences of sin. If we adopt the modern philosophy and attitude of
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:31.160]   not believing in hell and in eternal punishment, and believing that because God is love that
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:38.560]   oh, everybody will be alright in the end somehow, or if we believe that after death our souls
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:43.520]   are annihilated and go out of existence, a temporary amount of punishment, but that it
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.200]   comes to an end, and that the whole thing is conditional, well, of course, as we detract
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:54.840]   in that way from the punishment of sin, so we are detracting from the good news of the
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:00.880]   gospel. And again, that is often a fruitful cause of this. The only other one I would
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:09.840]   mention is this. It is a failure to realize the greatness of the salvation itself. I mean
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:15.920]   by that that we tend to reduce it only to forgiveness. Concerned, as so many of us are,
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:20.280]   just about escaping the punishment and hell, we want forgiveness, and we feel we've got
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.360]   it and there it ends. We haven't seen it in its height and its depth, its breadth and
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:31.840]   its length, the greatness of it all. Well, now the apostle, obviously, is concerned about
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:37.120]   the greatness and the glory of the gospel. That's why he's writing this letter to them.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:42.120]   He wants them to know about it. He's heard that they're already in the faith, but he
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:47.840]   seems to wonder whether they really have grasped it. He takes up his pen, and inspired as he
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:53.080]   knows himself to be, and with all the authority of a called apostle, he's going to display
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:15:02.480]   it to them in all its fullness and in all its grandeur. The gospel. Oh, how easily we
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:08.080]   use this term. How glibly we repeat it. I'm as guilty as anybody else. It ought to be
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:14.160]   impossible for us to use the very word "gospel" without bursting forth, as it were, into a
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:22.240]   hymn of praise and of thanksgiving. Good news from God. That's the gospel. Nothing less.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:29.200]   Very well. Well, now then, that brings me to the most important thing of all. It is
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:44.280]   the gospel of God. The gospel of God. The good news, in other words, is what God has
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:51.480]   done about men and about his salvation. And that is why, of course, it's quite unique
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:59.320]   and quite new. I'm going to write to you, says the Apostle, not about some human philosophy.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:04.160]   I'm not going to give you my own ideas as to how life should be lived. I'm not going
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:10.960]   to tell you what men has got to do. I'm going to tell you what God has done. That's it.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:19.320]   The gospel of God. It's good news from God. Now, this description here, this definition
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:24.840]   of the gospel, I think you'll agree, is a very striking one. There are other descriptions
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:30.480]   given of the gospel in the New Testament. It's called the gospel of peace, the gospel
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:36.840]   of the kingdom, the gospel of salvation, the everlasting gospel, and there are other titles
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:46.040]   and designations and adjectives used. But surely there is none which is used so constantly,
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:17:00.240]   especially by this Apostle, as this present one in some shape or form. The gospel of God.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:06.320]   But the Apostle doesn't leave it, you notice, even at death. He does something here which
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:15.600]   I must now proceed to emphasize, praying that the Holy Spirit will enable us all to see
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:24.760]   its absolute primacy and centrality. You notice that at once the Apostle introduces us to
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:34.280]   the great and central doctrine of the blessed Holy Trinity. Listen to him. All separated,
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:39.720]   he says, "Unto the gospel of God," leave out verse 2 for a moment, it's in brackets and
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:47.760]   rightly so, "the gospel of God concerning his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who was made
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:52.520]   of the seed of David according to the flesh and declared to be the Son of God with power
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:18:02.800]   according to the Spirit," capital S, the Spirit of holiness, the Holy Spirit, "by the resurrection
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:11.760]   from the dead." That's the gospel that he's been separated unto. It is a gospel in which
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:21.760]   God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are concerned. It is the work, the
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:32.120]   special work, the glorious work, of the three persons, each one of them taking part in it.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:40.240]   Now the Apostle, as I've been reminding you, is writing under the influence and guidance
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:46.180]   and inspiration of the Holy Spirit. And therefore when he puts it like this, he's not doing
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:51.280]   something accidental, he's not doing something that he might have left out. It is absolutely
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:56.080]   vital to his whole position that this should be emphasized. Let me try to bring that out
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:06.840]   in this way. There are some people who seem to conceive of the gospel solely in terms
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:13.600]   of the Father. You talk to them, they say that they're Christians and that they believe
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:19.120]   the gospel. Well then, you ask them to tell you, "Well, what do you mean by the gospel?
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:24.080]   What do you mean by being a Christian?" And they will tell you. And you listen to them
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:30.160]   and you notice that they end with not even mentioning the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:37.600]   at all. They talk a lot about God. They talk about receiving forgiveness from God. They
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:45.280]   talk about praying to God. They talk about being guided by God, and so on. But the whole
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:53.520]   of their talk finishes without the very mention of the name of the Son. And yet they regard
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:20:00.200]   themselves as Christians. They seem to have a kind of Christianity apart from the Son.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:09.160]   Now, this has been always the peculiar danger of people who are natural mystics. The mystics,
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:15.400]   you see, not only believe in God, they know, they believe, that it is possible for one
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:22.400]   to get to an intimate knowledge of God, to a direct experience of God. That's all right.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:27.760]   But the trouble with the mystics generally is that they think that that is possible and
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:33.720]   they go on to seek it without the Lord Jesus Christ at all. They take up their manuals
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:38.560]   on mysticism and they go through the stages, the dark night of the soul, and so on and
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:45.200]   so on, until they reach that final stage of contemplation. It's a constant danger with
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:51.800]   the mystics. They say, "What you've got to do is, is to turn in and examine yourself
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.760]   and look into yourself that God is in you." There are many books which have taught this.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:00.160]   Some of them have been very popular. Take a book which was very popular forty years
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:05.720]   ago and just beyond called "In Tune with the Infinite" by a man called Prime. It had
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:10.520]   a great vogue amongst many Christian people. But now it's a typical illustration of what
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:18.400]   I'm saying. It offers you an experience of God directly without the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:27.620]   being absolutely essential. Now then, there's one danger, the Father only. But let us be
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:34.760]   quite fair and admit that there are some who seem to put their entire stress and emphasis
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:47.040]   upon the Son only, and entirely forget the Father. Now these are the people who sometimes
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:55.080]   even go so far as to give the impression that God the Father is even reluctant to forgive
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:02.840]   us. And they picture, you find it in certain hymns, they picture the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:11.240]   as having to plead with his Father to forgive us. That he goes there and he says, "I have
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:17.600]   died for them, I have bought them," and there he has to persuade God to forgive. To
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:24.000]   them, you see, the whole of Christianity is in the Son only. And the Father, I say, is
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.040]   someone who has taken no part in it, and who indeed almost seems to be reluctant to listen
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:36.160]   to the pleadings of his Son, as if the Son had to persuade the Father. That's the second
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:44.040]   danger. And then of course there is the third, which tends to put the whole of its emphasis
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:50.680]   upon the Holy Spirit. Isn't it amazing how ready we all are to go astray and to fall
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:59.560]   into error? Isn't it our one and only comfort this evening that we are his workmanship,
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:04.680]   and that he who hath begun a good work in us will perform it? If he didn't go on with
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:11.120]   it, we'd all go astray, somewhere or another. And here it is, you see, Son, Father only,
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:17.800]   Son, Son only, Son, the Holy Spirit only. They again want power or something like that.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:22.680]   They're interested in experiences, or in power, or in something like that, and therefore they
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:31.500]   go instinctively to this doctrine of the Holy Spirit. It's a very subtle danger, this.
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:39.480]   I don't know that this is an occasion perhaps for personal confessions, but I am very well
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:45.440]   aware of this third danger, because I once spent a certain amount of time in it myself.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:54.160]   In other words, you can be interested in the doctrine of regeneration without seeing the
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:24:00.960]   absolute necessity of the atonement. And there are many illustrations of that in this country
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:07.040]   today. There are people who can talk quite rightly and soundly about rebirth, being born
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:14.000]   again, regeneration, life from God, but they don't believe in the atonement. They are conscious
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.520]   of the need of new life and of new power, and they see that it's offered. Yes, but they
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:24.760]   go directly there, they bypass the cross. There are people who talk about being in contact
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:30.680]   with the living Christ through the Spirit, who again bypass Calvary entirely, and see
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.520]   no substitutionary atonement. It's a most subtle danger.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:42.400]   Well, it's just my business tonight to remind you that there are those three possible errors
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:49.360]   and dangers, unless we are very careful. But each one of them is wrong. Each one of them,
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:55.480]   you see, has a modicum of truth, and a certain amount of truth, and that is what makes them
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:02.520]   dangerous. There is nothing so dangerous as to exaggerate a part of truth into the whole
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:10.720]   of truth. What these three say is quite alright, except that they leave out other parts which
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:19.120]   are equally vital and essential. For the teaching of the Scripture is, as we see here, that
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:29.360]   salvation is the work of the three persons in the blessed Holy Trinity. It is primarily
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:39.120]   that of the Father, the gospel of God concerning his Son. The Father first. It's the Father's
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:48.040]   idea. It's the Father's plan. It's the Father's purpose. It's the Father who initiates it.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:52.920]   It's the Father who gave the first promise concerning it to Adam and Eve in the Garden
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:26:01.760]   of Eden. And oh, we must be clear about this. We must not go on to consider what the Son
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:07.480]   has done, what the Holy Spirit has done and does, until we are absolutely clear about
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:16.240]   the primacy of the Father and the origin of it all in the Father himself. Isn't it amazing
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:21.080]   that we can ever forget it? If there's one verse in the Bible that everybody knows, it's
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:31.880]   John 3.16. And you see what John 3.16 says is this, "God so loved the world, that he,
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:40.400]   God, the Father, gave his only begotten Son." You notice the order? It's God who's done
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:46.600]   it. It's God who's initiated it all. He is the promoter, as it were, and the prompter
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:54.880]   of it all. God the Father. The Lord Jesus Christ himself was always at great pains to
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:00.120]   emphasize this. You read the gospel according to St. John particularly, and keep your eye
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:05.800]   on this, and you'll find him saying time and time again, "The words that I speak, I speak
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:11.400]   not of myself. The works that I do," he says, "they're not mine, they're the works of the
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:19.120]   Father." That is his constant emphasis. If you want it all absolutely summarized perfectly,
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:25.520]   you've simply got to turn to the 17th chapter of John's gospel, where our Lord in his high
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:34.960]   priestly prayer says, "Father, I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do." He was
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:39.960]   sent by the Father. He was given the work to do by the Father. He was sustained and
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:45.320]   enabled to do it by the Holy Spirit, but it was the Father who sent him. It was the Father
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:50.600]   who prescribed the work. It was the Father who gave him the people. It is always what
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:57.520]   the Father has done. He came to glorify the Father. "Father," he says, "I have glorified
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:04.400]   thee on the earth." It was the whole center of his life, the glory of his Father, the
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:11.680]   work which his Father had given him to do. And of course, you will find that emphasis
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:20.640]   everywhere in the epistles of this apostle Paul. What is the gospel? It's this. God was
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:29.240]   in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself. He, God, hath made him to be sin for us who
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:35.640]   knew no sin. When the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his own Son, made
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:40.480]   of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that are under the law. And I could go
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:46.880]   on quoting him at great length, as you know. But it's always God the Father. And yet you
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:53.040]   see, I say, this is forgotten by so many. They are so Christocentric, if I may say so,
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:29:03.080]   that they forget the Father himself from whom it all comes. You find it in their prayers.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:08.720]   They always pray to the Lord Jesus, not to the Father. They are entirely centered on
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:15.120]   the Son. But this, my friends, is wrong if you make him the center, because he is not
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:21.800]   the center. The center is the Father. You remember how the apostle Peter puts that.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:28.880]   He says that the Lord Jesus Christ has died for what reason? For this reason, to bring
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:38.440]   us to God. The whole purpose of the work of the Son is to bring us to God the Father.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:45.520]   Which is the definition of eternal life. This is eternal life. That they might know thee
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:52.640]   the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent, always the order. He never varies
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:58.800]   it. He never did. He had come to glorify the Father. He knew that everything starts with
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:07.160]   the Father and comes from the Father. So that the author of salvation is God the eternal
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.120]   Father.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:21.640]   Now, my friends, I must pause again to emphasize this, and to ask a question. Is that our idea
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:30.600]   of salvation? When we think of salvation, do we think of it instinctively in terms of
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:38.240]   the Father, and the glory of the Father? We should. We mustn't stop in our thinking of
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:44.120]   salvation in terms of ourselves, or any experience we've had. We may be happy, we may be more
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:50.040]   joyful, we may be not committing certain sins. Excellent. Thank God for it. But if your account
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:56.920]   of salvation stops there, if you don't go on to glorify the Father, your conception
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:04.440]   of salvation is very inadequate. Indeed, it is entirely unlike what we find in the New
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:13.520]   Testament. Not only that, our conduct, our behavior, the result of this salvation, must
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:25.760]   also point in the same direction. The object of salvation is to bring us to glorify God.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:33.280]   What is sin? Well, sin is failure to glorify God. But you see, we don't often put it like
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:39.720]   that, do we? If we are asked what is sin, we say sin means that you do this, or that,
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:46.280]   or something else that you shouldn't do. And therefore, when you're converted, your testimony
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:52.440]   is this, "I no longer do those things, I'm no longer interested." And you say, "That's
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:56.720]   my testimony. I used to do this, that, and the other. I was a drunkard, or something
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:03.760]   else. I'm no longer that." Well, that's excellent, as I say, but you know that's a very poor,
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:13.640]   a very inadequate, and a very negative way to describe salvation. The essence of sin
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:23.160]   is to fail to glorify God. Man was made to glorify God. The chief end of men, the shorter
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:31.240]   catechism tells us, is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever. And you see, if we only
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:37.040]   defined sin as the failure to do that, we would see how everybody's a sinner. And we'd
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:41.960]   see how your most respectable people can sometimes be the most terrible sinners. They're never
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.440]   been guilty of these particular sins, of course not, but they don't glorify God, they glorify
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:52.280]   themselves. So many people say, "I can't feel that I'm a sinner, I've never felt it." That's
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:58.840]   because they're thinking in terms of sins. If only they saw that sin, rarely, is just
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:04.640]   a failure to glorify God with the whole of your being, all the time, they'd see that
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:11.680]   they're terrible sinners. Now, if that is sin, salvation must be this, that we are brought
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:20.200]   into a state and condition in which we live to glorify God. He's the center of our life,
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:26.200]   the center of our conversation. How often do we, in giving our testimonies, thus glorify
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:35.960]   God? It's the test of Christianity, the Apostle starts with it, it's the gospel of God. Very
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:44.000]   well, then. If that is the point at which we stop, it is not surprising that we find
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.840]   Paul, in writing to Timothy, describing the gospel like this. He calls it "the glorious
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:57.680]   gospel of the blessed God." Or, if you prefer it, "the gospel of the glory of the blessed
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:06.320]   God." It's the plan of the Father, it's the great movement of the eternal God himself.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:16.040]   But, it is something that has been worked out through the Son, and by the Son. The Father
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:21.360]   sent the Son to do it. It is the gospel of God concerning His Son, Jesus Christ, our
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:27.440]   Lord, and what He's done. But it's God who sent Him to do it. Very well. So the Son comes
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:36.360]   in, in that second position, and in that way. And it is, thirdly, as he reminds us here,
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:47.000]   something which is applied to us by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit enabled the Son. You
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.080]   remember, He came upon Him there as He was baptized in the Jordan by John the Baptist.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:57.040]   He descended upon Him in the form of a dove. And the gospel of John tells us that God giveth
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:03.880]   not the Spirit by measure unto Him. He filled Him with the Spirit. And He was enabled to
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:12.840]   do His work through the Spirit in this way. So the three persons, you see, are of necessity
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:18.880]   involved. And the moment the Apostle mentions the word "gospel," he thinks of the three
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:29.480]   persons of the blessed Holy Trinity. The gospel, then, is the mighty action of God the Father,
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:38.760]   God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, whereby we are saved. It is God's provision for us
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:46.240]   in our desperate need and plight. It was something that had been mentioned under the Old Testament
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:51.520]   dispensation. It's now happened, says Paul. That's why I call it good news. I'm going
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:58.440]   to tell you exactly what has taken place.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:06.920]   Now we must pause at this point to indicate this. The Apostle here does something that
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:18.280]   is characteristic of the whole of the biblical teaching. This is the way that the Bible teaches
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:31.920]   the doctrine of the blessed Holy Trinity. The doctrine of the Trinity is never stated
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:38.880]   directly in the scripture, always indirectly. There is not any explicit statement to the
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:47.240]   fact that God is three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. There is no such definition.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:54.520]   The way in which the Bible states it is the way in which the Apostle states it here. The
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:37:04.000]   gospel of God concerning His Son, and then the Spirit of holiness, the Holy Spirit.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.760]   Now let me just give you some other illustrations of the same thing in order that this may be
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:15.240]   clearly fixed in all our minds. You get the same thing, of course, exactly at the baptism
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:26.240]   of our Lord. There is the Son standing in the waters of Jordan. The Holy Spirit, in
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:32.480]   the form of a dove, descends upon Him. And the voice of the Father comes out of heaven
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:46.320]   saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:53.200]   Not again an explicit statement, but the three together, three distinct persons in the one
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:59.440]   Godhead. The Son says, "I and the Father are one." And you will find other statements.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.960]   Let's take, for instance, what I was going to mention next, the teaching in the fourteenth
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:12.120]   chapter of John, where our Lord says that He is going to leave them. But that He is
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:20.480]   not going to leave them orphans. He is going to send the Holy Spirit. And He talks about
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:26.400]   the Holy Spirit as He. And because the Holy Spirit is coming into them, He and the Father
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:33.520]   are going to take up their abode in the believer. You see the same idea. The three persons,
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:41.480]   and yet one Godhead, one God. That is how the Bible teaches this doctrine.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:46.360]   You get it again at the end of the Gospel according to St. Matthew, where our Lord gives
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:53.280]   His great commission to His apostles to go out to preach, to disciple all the nations.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:39:00.800]   Baptizing them, He says, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:06.680]   And the fact that we are to be baptized in the names of the three is a tremendous declaration
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:12.560]   of the equality and the co-eternity of the three. It is the whole doctrine of the blessed
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:16.040]   Holy Trinity.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:22.880]   And then you remember how this apostle Paul, at the end of his second epistle to the Corinthians,
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:29.600]   says the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the communion of the Holy
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:35.520]   Spirit be with you. The three persons again, you see. He doesn't sit down and say, now
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:40.560]   there are three persons in the blessed Trinity. No, he puts it in this way. That is the biblical
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:44.600]   way of doing it. And so many people have failed to understand that.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:52.640]   And then you've got another remarkable illustration of it in Hebrews chapter 9 verse 14, where
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:40:05.840]   we read Christ, who through the eternal Spirit, offered himself to God. Now there are many
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:11.160]   other examples and illustrations of the same thing. I've simply selected some for you this
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:20.040]   evening, and I do so in order to make this point. How important it is as we read the
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:30.160]   scriptures or study them that we should be alive and alert to these things. You have
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:34.680]   to look for them. They are here, if you just look for them, if you pay attention to what
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:43.760]   you're reading. Notice what he says. Gospel of God concerning his Son, Spirit of Holiness.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:51.720]   As we read our scriptures, therefore, let us always ever keep our eye on the way in
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:41:00.160]   which these glorious and mighty and eternal doctrines are suddenly introduced. It's not
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:09.440]   surprising that the apostle Paul started with this. My friends, the doctrine of the Trinity
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:18.200]   is the differentiating doctrine of the Christian faith. There is no question at all about this.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:27.000]   A famous theologian once said, "The doctrine of the Trinity is the heart of Christianity."
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:35.280]   And it's absolutely right. It is the thing that makes our Gospel absolutely unique. There
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:43.360]   are other religions that believe in God, but there is not another that preaches and teaches
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:50.480]   the blessed Holy Trinity. So that it is absolutely essential to us as Christians that we should
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:57.240]   have a clear grasp of this doctrine of the Trinity, the three persons in the Godhead,
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:06.080]   equal, co-equal, co-eternal. And yet they have divided this work in this way. How essential
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:14.240]   that we should understand it. It influences the whole of our thinking. There are some
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:21.400]   people who seem to be most excited at the present time by what is called apologetics.
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:25.280]   They read in their newspapers, like you may have read this morning, that the scientists
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:33.460]   are now on the verge of saying that virgin birth is a possibility after all, Parthenogenesis.
[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:38.400]   You read it this morning. And Christians sometimes feel now this is going to be wonderful. Our
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:43.560]   whole position is going to be established. My dear friend, if your position is going
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:50.400]   to depend upon what scientists may or may not say, well then I tremble for you. They
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:55.680]   have their fashions. They say a thing and then it is denied. No, no. What I am saying
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:04.280]   is this. It is all right as far as it goes. You have heard about the famous proofs of
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:11.600]   the existence of God. All right as far as they go. But let us remember that as Christians
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:19.800]   we are not simply men and women who believe in God. We believe in the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:26.840]   We believe in the triune God. The Mohammedans believe in God. The unregenerate Jews believe
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:33.600]   in God. There are others who believe in God. The essence of Christianity, the heart of
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:41.560]   Christianity, is that we believe in the three persons, one God. Paul is going on to prove
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:47.800]   it that Jesus is the Son of God, born of the seed of David according to the flesh, declared
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:55.680]   to be the Son of God with power. Yes, he is God the Son. And equally true is it to say
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:03.800]   God the Holy Spirit. We must be Trinitarians. We cannot afford to be slack or loose in our
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:10.280]   ideas about this. It is the very heart of Christianity, the essence of our position,
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:18.720]   that the three glorious eternal persons, for us men and our salvation, have done these
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:27.720]   mighty things that the Apostle goes on to unfold in this glorious epistle. Oh may God
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:35.840]   enable us to see the primacy and the centrality and the all-importance of the doctrine of
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:43.560]   the Holy Trinity. Let us pray.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:52.520]   O Lord our God, we come into thy presence, conscious that we have been talking together
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:45:01.040]   about things that battle the mind and the understanding; that, O God, we thank thee
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:08.880]   that we are not saved by our understanding, but by the great and glorious truth itself.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:15.760]   And O, we would thank thee for the revelation of it in thy word. We thank thee, O God, at
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:25.720]   this marvellous, amazing, astounding thing which has been done for us. O Lord, open our
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:34.080]   minds, enlighten the eyes of our understanding, help us to receive and to believe these things
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:42.400]   truly, that we may realize the greatness of thy love and see that it is only this that
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:51.360]   could have saved us or rescued us from the depths of sin and woe. O Lord, forgive us
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:59.080]   that our hearts are so cold, that we can receive these things without being moved in the very
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:06.760]   vitals of our life. O God, display them to us, we pray thee, in such a manner that we,
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:15.520]   like those shepherds of old, shall go on our way rejoicing and singing because of this
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:26.800]   great good news, glad tidings of great joy, bringing to us the knowledge of what thou
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:36.840]   hast done for us through Jesus Christ thy Son and by thy Holy Spirit.
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:43.880]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:50.760]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us, now this night, throughout
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:59.240]   the remainder of this hour's short, uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage, and evermore.
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:01.360]   Amen.
