[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580]   Well, happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
[00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.800]   This episode releases on the evening of the holiday, and we pray that your day has been
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.280]   full of gratitude for God's kindness.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.360]   And Pastor John, as we look forward now to another weekend, today's timely question is
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.840]   about corporate worship.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.760]   It's from a listener named Scott.
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.660]   "Dear Pastor John and Tony, thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.440]   On this show, I've heard you say that no one can truly worship God without enjoying Him.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.840]   It's been a big indictment to me for the many occasions in church when I have participated
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.680]   in the service without any feelings of joy in God for who He is.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.980]   So my question is, should we still try to worship God even when we aren't enjoying Him?
[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.760]   Or should we wait for the enjoyment to come first, seeking it out prior to the beginning
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.280]   of our musical worship?
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.660]   I have a feeling you're going to say that we should go ahead and try and pray for enjoyment.
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.560]   So then can we work back from an action to a state of heart?
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.560]   That is, can going through the motions of worship produce in us the sort of heart that
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.920]   would bring forth that same worship spontaneously?"
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.720]   Pastor John, what would you say to Scott?
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.760]   The short answer to that last question is yes.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.160]   You can't work backward like that.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:22.480]   That is possible if, if, if, if done in the right way.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:31.760]   And before I try to sum up what that right way is, let me point Scott to pages 96 and
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:39.640]   97 of the book Desiring God, because that's where I pose this very question and give it
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.960]   the best answer I know how.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.440]   So pages 96 and 97, I think it's the most recent edition of Desiring God.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.920]   In that section I actually use the moment of worship and the act of our giving a tithe
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.640]   in that moment as an act of worship when I don't feel like it.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.480]   Should I give a tithe when I don't feel like it as the, you know, the plane is coming down
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.400]   the aisle and I have to choose whether to do that act of worship because I ought to
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.680]   and I don't feel like it or not.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.840]   But instead of just rehearsing what I wrote on those pages, which seems cheap, let me
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.800]   come at it another way and use another analogy.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.760]   I have been really helped by a couple of books by Edward John Carnell, who used to teach
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.560]   at Fuller Seminary over 50 years ago and died just before I got there as a student.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.360]   But some of his legacy remained.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.760]   And in his really amazing book called Christian Commitment, and if you can get it, it's timeless
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.520]   in its penetration.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.280]   So Christian Commitment, it's called.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.920]   Not what you think probably when you hear that phrase.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.320]   He says this, "Suppose a husband asks his wife if he must kiss her goodnight.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.920]   Her answer is, 'You must, but not that kind of must.'
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:10.160]   What she means is this," and I'm still quoting Carnell, "What she means is this, 'Unless
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:20.600]   a spontaneous affection for my person motivates you, your overtures are stripped of all moral
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.600]   value.'"
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:32.600]   So this is like me saying no one can truly worship God without enjoying him.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:40.000]   He's saying no one can kiss his wife with any moral value if it doesn't come from a
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.320]   spontaneous affection rather than simply, "I guess I have to because that's what husbands
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.240]   and spouses do," like tithing or singing a hymn in church or whatever.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.320]   That's the analogy.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.440]   But now let's analyze what Carnell says a little more closely.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.960]   He doesn't give the whole truth here.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.440]   What he says is basically right, I think, but he points to the truth.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.880]   The wife says, "Yes, you do have to kiss me goodnight."
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.320]   In other words, it is for a good husband a moral obligation.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:25.560]   And what she means is that showing outward affection for a wife is what a husband ought
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.640]   to do.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.040]   He ought to do that.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.960]   No outward affection, failure of duty.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.760]   It's a duty, and he ought to do his duty.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.360]   And she admits that.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.260]   But then she makes the amazingly penetrating observation that there are different ways
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.280]   to perform a duty.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.280]   And some are empty, and some are full.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.680]   Some have moral value, and some don't have moral value.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.000]   So Jesus said in vain, in vain, empty, "Do people worship me because their heart is far
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   from me?"
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.800]   So Jesus knew exactly what she's talking about.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.440]   She probably got it from Jesus, right?
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.800]   "Of course it is their duty to worship me," Jesus would say, or God would say, "but their
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.320]   outward forms of worship have lost all moral value because they're empty.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.640]   They don't have any affection in them for me."
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:27.680]   Now, my question is, is there no third alternative between an empty, duty-driven, perfunctory
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:37.640]   kiss on the one hand, and a spontaneously joyful, affectionate, warm, heartfelt, mouth-to-mouth
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.580]   kiss on the other hand?
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.340]   Anything in between those two?
[00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:49.920]   And Scott's question is, is it possible to work back from the kiss that doesn't have
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.520]   affection to the kiss that does have affection?
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:00.880]   And I said, "Yes, can the act of kissing without affection be a proper step toward
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.720]   kissing with affection?"
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.240]   So Scott's raising the very question I'm raising when I wrote those pages and right now.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.840]   Is there a third kind of kiss?
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.800]   And I would argue that there absolutely is a third kind of kiss between a mere perfunctory,
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.760]   empty, emotionless kiss on the one hand, and a full-blooded, romantic, affectionate kiss
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.760]   on the other hand.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:31.680]   And that third kind of kiss, while not having the robust, full affections of delight and
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:42.840]   cherishing, nevertheless is not the same as a mere perfunctory, empty, hypocritical, emotionless
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.600]   kiss.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.520]   So what are the marks?
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.520]   That's the key question.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:53.120]   I think he's asking, and I'm asking, what are the marks of this third kind of kiss or
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.840]   third kind of act of worship on Sunday morning?
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.840]   Here they are.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.120]   Here are the marks of this good kiss, which is not all it should be.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.040]   And I say good because it's not fake.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.320]   It's not hypocritical.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:16.280]   Number one, the heart behind this kiss does not say, "Oh, well, it's the action that counts.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.960]   Action doesn't matter.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.440]   Husbands are supposed to kiss their wife.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.520]   I'll just do the act."
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.840]   The heart behind this third kind of kiss renounces such a way of kissing.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:34.720]   Number two, it regrets the absence of appropriate affection for the wife.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.040]   It regrets.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.800]   This is a sadness to him.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.580]   He does not justify it.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.220]   He laments it.
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.240]   He repents of it.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.120]   He's not going to say, "Oh, it's just because I'm tired," or whatever.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:58.600]   Number three, he is not content with this state of affairs, and whatever the cause is,
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.280]   he wants it to change.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:07.180]   He wants to do all he can to see his proper affections restored.
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.700]   He wants the affections that he doesn't have.
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:20.880]   He is like the psalmist in Psalm 51, "Restore to me the joy of my kissing the Lord."
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.100]   He says, "Restore to me the joy of my salvation, kissing her."
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:34.280]   Number four, he whispers a silent prayer to God to give him grace, help him feel for his
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:39.360]   wife, to restore what's gone away for a day or gone away for a year.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.880]   He really prays.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:49.640]   Number five, he kisses her, kisses her in hope, humble hope that the very act of kissing
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:57.040]   will be part, not the whole, but part of God's way of restoring his affections.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:05.240]   Six, he takes whatever other steps he can to remove obstacles to affection and to restore
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.800]   his heart for his wife.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:12.800]   So, Scott's question was—this is a direct quote, now, if I remember what you said—"Can
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:21.400]   going through the motions of worship produce in us the sort of heart that would bring forth
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.600]   the same worship spontaneously?"
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:33.240]   And my answer is, it's probably not helpful to call this kind of kissing or worshipping
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.400]   "going through the motions."
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.720]   That has too many ugly connotations.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:45.480]   But if he means singing the songs, praying the prayers, giving the tithe, listening to
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:51.840]   the sermon, with these six steps in play, then yes.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.840]   Yes.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:10:00.800]   This is a third way of worship between robust, fully engaged, affectional expression on the
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:08.440]   one hand, and lifeless, empty, hypocritical, going through the motions on the other hand.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:18.240]   And that third way, as inadequate as it is for our complete satisfaction, and God's
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:24.480]   fullest honor, is a good strategy for getting to where we ought to be.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.560]   That's a great analogy.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.560]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.920]   Well, next week we are back with three episodes about Christian hedonism.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.640]   It's the heart of what we do here.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.440]   On Monday, we're going to look at the relationship between Christian hedonism and Reformed theology.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:05.800]   And on Wednesday, we're going to look at Pastor John's expectations and hopes and fears about
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.940]   the future of Christian hedonism after he's gone.
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:13.440]   And then we end the week on Friday looking at the name Desiring God and some alternatives
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.080]   and why Pastor John settled on the phrase Desiring God.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.840]   It's an important week coming up, but today, happy Thanksgiving again on behalf of Pastor
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.760]   John and the whole team at Desiring God.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.760]   Thanks for listening.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.760]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
