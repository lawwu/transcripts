[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.120]   There's a prayer that you can pray for your family every single day and Pastor John explained
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.400]   it in a sermon titled "God Demonstrates His Love Toward Us" which John Piper preached
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.320]   exactly 15 years ago this December.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.560]   There he explained an important connection between Romans 5-5 and Ephesians chapter 3
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.680]   verses 14-19 and a podcast listener named Kevin from Ontario, Canada who is currently
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.960]   going through the Roman sermons wanted to share this little gem of a sermon clip with
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.960]   us.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.640]   Here's what Pastor John said in that message.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.900]   Ephesians 3, 14-19.
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.920]   This is the most wonderful prayer in the Apostle Paul's writings.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.240]   It may be the third most wonderful prayer in all the Bible.
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.120]   If you give to John 17, the greatest, and then give to the Lord's Prayer, the second
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.400]   greatest, I think this one comes next.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:08.800]   Someday I'm going to preach 15 or 30 messages on this prayer because it is so multi-layered,
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.080]   the meaning is so profound.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.400]   So let me read it with you.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.720]   Ephesians 3, 14-19.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.440]   Here's a prayer that you should pray for yourself and others.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.640]   For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, Paul says, from whom every family
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.520]   in heaven and on earth is named, and here comes the content of the prayer.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.240]   That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.840]   power through his Spirit in the inner man, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.120]   faith and you being rooted and grounded in love, mark that word, in love, may be able
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.800]   to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.360]   and to know the love, mark it again, the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge and be
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.200]   filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.920]   Let's read it backwards and show you how it relates to Romans 5.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.840]   What's the goal of the prayer?
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.680]   To be filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.680]   Are you there?
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.840]   Anybody got that one in your back pocket?
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.000]   We done with this?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.600]   We know that, on to something else?
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.000]   Anybody?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.240]   I want that because the Apostle Paul prayed that I should have it.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:36.600]   And I think being filled with all the fullness of God is the same as having the love of God
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.240]   poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who is given to us.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.240]   Why do I think that?
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.840]   Because if you read backwards now and ask, "Okay, how does this come about?"
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:53.660]   The answer is, it comes about through knowing the incomprehensible love of Christ whose
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.200]   height and depth and length and breadth is beyond knowledge so that you might be filled.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.200]   You see the connection there between knowing the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.960]   and being filled with all the fullness of God?
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.820]   One is a means to the other.
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.940]   So in knowing the love of Christ which is beyond knowledge and incomprehensible and
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.740]   yet the heart knows it with its own kind of knowing, we become filled up with all the
[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.740]   fullness of God.
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.900]   So then the question becomes, "And how do we experience the love of Christ like that?
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.180]   How do we know the unknowable love of Christ?"
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.300]   And you go backwards and it says, "Well, in order to do that, you have to be rooted and
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.060]   grounded in love so that you may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.540]   height and depth and have the love of Christ and then be filled with all the fullness of
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.540]   God."
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.900]   So it's love to love.
[00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.380]   You see that?
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:50.840]   We must be rooted in love, founded on love so that we have the power to recognize unknowable
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.660]   love and thus be filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.820]   This is worth 15 sermons.
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:05.100]   I have spent more time in this prayer than any prayer in all the Bible because no prayer
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:12.580]   in all the Bible kindles longings in me like this prayer kindles longings in me.
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.060]   Doesn't it do that for you?
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.540]   Don't you want to know what this is talking about?
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.240]   I hardly know what it's talking about.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.700]   It's all about experience.
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.100]   It's all about the fullness of the love of God.
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.700]   It's all about knowing the unknowable love of Christ.
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.420]   It's all about roots going down into love before you know the love of Christ so that
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.080]   you can know the love of Christ.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.340]   This is mystery all.
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.500]   And yet Paul puts it in a book, in words, so that we read it, so that we'll pray it,
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.460]   so that we'll experience and maybe in the miraculous experience of it, know what it
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.460]   means.
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.300]   "Oh, long for this.
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.620]   Pray this for your children.
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.380]   Pray this for your spouses."
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.380]   Do you wonder, "How do I pray for my family?"
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.220]   Pray this prayer every day.
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.700]   Pray it for your soul.
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.700]   Pray it for this church.
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.800]   Pray it for me.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.220]   If you want to know what it's like to have the love of God poured out into your hearts
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.180]   by the Holy Spirit who's given to you, meditate on these verses.
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.380]   You want to know objective reality mediated by the Holy Spirit exploding in your heart
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.980]   with self-authenticating experience of the love of God.
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.740]   If you want that, there are two obvious things you do.
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.620]   One is you meditate upon the objective reality laid out in the Bible called the gospel of
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.620]   Christ crucified.
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.540]   And the other is you pray, pray, pray, pray, pray.
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.540]   Do it to me.
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.540]   Do it to me.
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.540]   Do it to me.
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.540]   Direct my heart.
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.540]   Direct my heart.
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.020]   Let the love of God be upon me.
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.380]   Fill my heart with all the fullness of God, which is the love of Christ beyond knowledge,
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.500]   rooted in love, wrought by the Holy Spirit, Christ dwelling in my heart.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.620]   Do those things to me, even if I can't understand what I'm saying, so that I might recognize
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.620]   it in the doing.
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.020]   I wonder if you have any problems with Jesus loves me, this I know.
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:11.620]   Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so.
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.620]   That's true.
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.900]   It's not enough.
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.580]   Needs another verse.
[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.820]   I made it up.
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:29.460]   Jesus loves me, there's no doubt, for the Spirit pours it out.
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.640]   Little ones to Him belong.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.380]   We are weak, but He is strong.
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.540]   Amen.

[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:11.100]   on how he can parent well, and we'll hear Pastor John address that tomorrow.
