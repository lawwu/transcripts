[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.920]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.960]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.280]   of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.160]   This episode, as with all episodes,

[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.920]   Writing.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.280]   With no further ado, let me introduce Morgan Housel.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.400]   Hello, Morgan.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.400]   Thank you so much for having me, Rick.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.600]   Happy to be here.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.320]   It's really a pleasure to have you on.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.000]   I'm really excited to be talking about your new book,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.400]   The Psychology of Money, which I found to be just
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.040]   a really enjoyable read.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.000]   In fact, I hated the book, quite frankly,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.040]   because as I was reading it, I was saying, yes, that's me.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.080]   Yes, that's me.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.520]   Yes, that's me.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.560]   But it was a great book.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.880]   That's all of us, though, right?
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.520]   That's true, which is the whole point of the book.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.720]   Before we get to the book, I did want
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.680]   to dig into your background.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.640]   So I think like many careers, I never
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.280]   planned to become a financial writer.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.400]   That I've been for my entire career.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.080]   The only "real job" I've had is as a financial writer.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.160]   It's all I've ever done.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.700]   I started writing for The Motley Fool
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.720]   when I was a junior in college.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.440]   And I really didn't have any plan or any intention
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.040]   of doing that.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.280]   I just kind of stumbled into it on accident.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.960]   And I thought maybe I would have that job for three months
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.280]   or six months before I found another job in private equity
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.720]   or investment banking, which is what
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.080]   I wanted to do at the time.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.640]   But I ended up staying at The Motley Fool for 10 years.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.880]   And I just fell in love with the process of writing.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.000]   I had been very interested in investing in finance
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.880]   before that, and I knew that my career was
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.840]   going to be in finance.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.800]   That was the plan.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.280]   But writing, I had no interest in, never thought about it.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.000]   But I loved writing from the perspective of--
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.960]   it really dawned on me, and it took me a while
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.720]   to figure this out.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.440]   But I think writing is about much more
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.760]   than just communication.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.480]   Writing is a thinking process.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.160]   It helps you really crystallize a lot of the thoughts
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.560]   that you have in your head, the vague ideas
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.240]   that you have in your head, that when you are forced to put them
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.760]   down onto paper, you really start to see either, oh, wow,
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.080]   now it makes a lot more sense.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.160]   This vague gut feeling that I had that I always kind of knew,
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.880]   but never put into words, now it makes a lot more sense.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.280]   Or you realize the opposite.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.400]   You put it into words, and you say, oh, that feeling
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.480]   that I had that I thought was so true,
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.320]   that I believe so strongly, now that I put it into words
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.840]   and write it in a sentence, it actually
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.880]   looks pretty ridiculous.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.840]   Maybe it looks wrong.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.760]   So I think writing was a great way to think
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.160]   and a great way to learn.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.760]   And I really fell in love with it from that perspective.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.240]   So after you were at The Motley Fool for 10 years
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.360]   and you came to the realization that you loved writing,
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.520]   you ended up then going to The Wall Street Journal.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.480]   Yeah, I was at The Wall Street Journal for several years.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.320]   It was actually when I was still at The Motley Fool.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.880]   I was full time at The Motley Fool
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.520]   when I was writing the Saturday investing column at The Wall
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.240]   Street Journal, did that for several years, which was great.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.000]   Obviously, it's one of the foremost financial publications
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.720]   in the world.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.320]   So it was great from that perspective.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.900]   It was very different for me, though,
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.720]   because The Wall Street Journal is capital J journalism,
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.840]   whereas everything else that I had written up until that point
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.600]   was more or less a blog, where I could take much more liberties
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.520]   in terms of giving my opinion, writing in a more casual format
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.480]   and casual style, whereas The Wall Street Journal was very,
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.000]   by the book, in a great way.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.920]   That's why it has the reputation that it has.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.440]   But it was a very different style of writing for me.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.160]   And then 4 and 1/2 years ago, I joined the Collaborative Fund,
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.440]   which is a venture capital private equity firm.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.400]   And all I still do there is write and speak.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.680]   But it's back much more to the blog style of writing,
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.360]   where, of course, your reputation is on the line.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.560]   But you can be much more open about your own opinions,
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.120]   how you feel about things, and much more open with your ideas
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.800]   rather than the very strict journalism format.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.080]   Let me ask a question about the Collaborative Fund,
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.400]   because I dug into that a little bit.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.640]   I wanted to understand, what exactly
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.560]   is it that that fund does?
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.800]   Yeah, so we invest mostly in early-stage startups,
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.520]   but also later-stage growth companies
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.140]   that are multibillion-dollar companies,
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.800]   but all in the private markets.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.240]   So most of what we do by volume, the number of deals that we do
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.400]   is in seed-stage, Series A-stage companies, very young startups.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.880]   But most of what we do by dollar--
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.240]   if you weight it by dollars, it's
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.280]   later-stage companies that are more mature,
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.360]   companies that are getting very close to going public.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.960]   So I'm actually not involved at all on the investing side.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.360]   All of what I do is what you see.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.640]   It's the writing and speaking.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.960]   So I'm a partner at the firm, a part of the firm.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.240]   But day-to-day, the investing process, picking investments,
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.120]   is not in my wheelhouse, so to speak.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.360]   The fact that I write about behavioral finance,
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.000]   public markets, et cetera, and I work at a private equity firm
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.160]   has not been, I think, any roadblock in the slightest
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.660]   for me.
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.360]   It's been a great home for me, even if on the outside,
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.680]   it seems like a weird fit.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.220]   That was also true at The Motley Fool.
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.040]   I mean, I'm a passive investor who
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.320]   writes about investing history.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.040]   The Motley Fool is, of course, a stock-picking website.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.480]   So I felt like that was, in some ways, kind of a weird home,
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.960]   too.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.920]   But it worked for me.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.720]   So I guess my whole career, I guess,
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.520]   I've been at a home which has seemed a little bit opposite
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.360]   from what I actually write about.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.200]   You've written a few books in the past,
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.440]   although nothing quite as ambitious
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.360]   as The Psychology of Money.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.840]   Yes.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.280]   The first two books that I wrote were very short e-books,
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.720]   better describing them as a long-form blog post that we
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.800]   turned into a Kindle edition.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.040]   One of them was called 50 Years in the Making--
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.720]   The Great Recession and Its Aftermath.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.280]   I always had this view that whenever
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.200]   there's a big event in the world,
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.600]   whether it is a big recession, or a pandemic, or a war,
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.280]   whatever it is, all the big events that happen in life
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.040]   actually have very deep roots.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.840]   They seem like they came out of nowhere.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.840]   And they just happened.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.240]   The 2008 financial crisis, we view it
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.520]   as maybe the real estate bubble started in 2003 or 2004.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.280]   But they always have these deep roots.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.620]   All these events have ancestors.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.120]   They have parents, and grandparents,
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.040]   and great-grandparents.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.520]   So I wanted to dig back and really try to go back and say,
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.040]   what was the cause of the 2008 financial crisis?
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.560]   And I think you can actually tie it back really
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.600]   to the end of World War II, when all the GIs came home.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.400]   And there was a big fear among policymakers
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.180]   that ending the wartime spending was
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.200]   going to shove us right back to the depths of the Great
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.120]   Depression that we had just gotten out of.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.520]   And because of that, they started a ton of stimulus
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.380]   programs to create US individuals, US families,
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.640]   into consumers.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.800]   A lot of stimulus packages and new policies, new incentives
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.840]   to get people to consume, to go to the store
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.960]   and spend as much money on goods, and services,
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.880]   and appliances, and cars, as homes as they could.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.760]   And that became kind of the new mantra of the United States.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.200]   And around the 1980s, there was a big fundamental shift
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.160]   in terms of a new growth of income inequality.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.000]   And in very simple terms, think what that created by and large
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.280]   was a small group of people who were doing very well
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.400]   financially inflated the aspirations
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.320]   and the expectations of everyone else who were not
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.360]   doing quite as well.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.800]   And everyone else, that lower group of people,
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.880]   filled the gap between their financial reality
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.660]   and their expectations with debt.
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.480]   And that became kind of the big debt surge of the last 40 years
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.560]   that came to a head with the 2008 financial crisis.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.560]   I think largely from a social perspective,
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.160]   that was lots of people whose incomes had not risen
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.180]   were trying to fill the gap to keep up
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.360]   with people whose incomes did rise by a lot
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.700]   and were inflating their material expectations of what
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.280]   they expected out of life.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.160]   So what you just described is probably
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.120]   with a phrase, keeping up with the Jones, right?
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.920]   Yeah, and for most of US history,
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.320]   that was fairly easily, because the Joneses, your neighbors,
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.200]   most likely lived a life that was very similar to you.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.160]   They probably worked at the same factory,
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.200]   earned a similar income.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.740]   Of course, there were disparities between people,
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.040]   but it was much more closer than it is today.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.240]   And I think one of the big causes of this, too,
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.360]   was the rise of social media, where all of a sudden
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.240]   the people, quote unquote, "around you"
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.040]   that were influencing your behaviors
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.000]   were not just your neighbors or your co-workers,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   but they were people all over the world.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.680]   Fueled by algorithms that were designed
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.920]   to give you the most flamboyant pictures that you can see.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.400]   And all of a sudden, your expectations
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.560]   of how you can live a good life, so to speak,
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.680]   whether that was the cars you drive or the vacations
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.680]   that you take, all of a sudden became much more inflated,
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.480]   because the purview of what you see around you
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.680]   and your expectations grew so much.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.040]   And you actually talk about that in The Psychology of Money.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.200]   Outward appearances and keeping up with the Jones
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.640]   causes people to do a lot of things
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.320]   they wouldn't ordinarily do.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.240]   - Yeah, yeah, people judge their well-being
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.360]   relative to everyone around them.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.240]   And so even though we've had a lot of progress
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.520]   in the United States over the last hundred years
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.080]   and progress around the world,
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.480]   I think a lot of that progress does not necessarily
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.640]   make us feel that much better
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.400]   because our expectations have increased by and large,
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.640]   and lockstep, if not greater, than our incomes have.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.520]   So this is true, like if you were to look at,
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.920]   you know, someone like John D. Rockefeller,
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.560]   who is the richest person in the history of the world,
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.000]   his net worth adjusted for inflation
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.080]   is something like $300 billion.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.440]   But Rockefeller never had penicillin.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.800]   He never had sunscreen.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.200]   He never had Advil.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.640]   He only had sunglasses, sunglasses in the later stages
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.960]   of his life because it hadn't been invented yet.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.080]   But no one should be able to say
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.240]   that a lower income American today
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.760]   should feel better off than John D. Rockefeller
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.600]   because they have penicillin and Advil.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.720]   That's just not how people's heads work.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.760]   People's expectations of what is normal
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.400]   and what they should appreciate, you know,
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.520]   grow over time and inflate over time.
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.480]   And so I think that expectation inflation,
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.520]   that is normal and natural and understandable,
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.920]   also has a big impact on how individuals
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.760]   think about their money.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.440]   Because your ability to be happy with your money
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.560]   is not just your income or your wealth.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.640]   It's your income and your wealth
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.680]   relative to your expectations.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.160]   And we talk a lot about, in the financial industry,
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.200]   how to increase your income, how to increase your wealth.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.280]   And of course, that's very important.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.600]   That's a great conversation.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.760]   But if we're not talking about
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.920]   how to also manage your expectations,
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.840]   then any sort of growth that you have,
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.360]   if you are fortunate enough to have it
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.800]   in your income or your wealth,
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.240]   is not gonna feel nearly as good
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.520]   as you once thought it would.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.520]   So I think the hardest and the most important financial goal
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.080]   is getting the goalposts to stop moving.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.240]   It's a very difficult thing,
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.360]   but if you're not able to do it,
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.280]   I think you're probably gonna be disappointed,
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.920]   even if you are lucky enough to have a growing income
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.800]   and rising wealth throughout your life.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.280]   - So John Bogle wrote a book called "Enough,"
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.200]   which talks about this exact concept.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.800]   You have to know when you have enough.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.640]   - Right, and you know, that concept that Bogle talks about
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.560]   with having enough is something
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.920]   that I read about in the book.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.800]   To me, there's a really fascinating story,
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.480]   several fascinating stories,
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.560]   that fall into the extreme end of this topic.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.960]   One of them that I talk about in the book is Bernie Madoff,
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.200]   who everyone knows did what he did.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.720]   To me, the most fascinating part
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.200]   about Madoff, though, is this.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.000]   If you go back to the 1980s,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.080]   Bernie Madoff was running a legitimate,
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.680]   non-fraudulent business as a market maker in stocks,
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.120]   matching buyers and sellers.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:50.960]   And it was not a fraud.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.280]   It was a legitimate business.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.440]   And he was, by some accounts,
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.440]   making upwards of $50 million per year
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.400]   from the legitimate side of his business.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.320]   Very successful.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.040]   He still looked at that ostensibly
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.600]   and said that's not enough.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.440]   And he wanted so much more so badly
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.920]   that he created one of the biggest
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.640]   financial frauds in history.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.840]   So, and there are lots of similar stories like that,
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.040]   maybe not as extreme,
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.600]   of people who are doing very, very well financially.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.720]   But because of whatever, it's their expectations,
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.600]   it's who they associate with, who they look up to,
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.080]   they want more so badly
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.160]   that they're willing to push the boundaries of risk
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.000]   or the boundaries of the law, in Madoff's case,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.160]   so strongly that they end up ruining their lives
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.160]   and ruining other people's lives as well.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.560]   Now, that's, of course, an extreme example,
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.840]   but I think all of us need to have
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.200]   some sort of calibrated view on what enough is.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.480]   And that's not to say you shouldn't strive for more
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.720]   or have goals for your future, for your family.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.880]   Like, of course, I do, everyone else does.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.720]   But unless you're willing to have some view
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.640]   of managing your expectations
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.920]   and some idea of what having enough is,
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.240]   I think you're gonna have a hard time financially in life.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.480]   There's a story that I love from Daniel Kahneman.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.120]   After he won the Nobel Prize,
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.160]   you do very well for yourself financially
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.800]   with speaking in books and whatnot.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.040]   So Kahneman went to a financial advisor several years ago,
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.920]   and he told the financial advisor, he said,
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.720]   "I have no goals to grow my money.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.840]   "I don't wanna grow my money.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.240]   "I just wanna keep this safe
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.600]   "and live off of this pot of money for the rest of my life."
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.040]   And the financial advisor looked at him and said,
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.320]   "I can't work with you."
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.480]   And to Kahneman, it was shocking that the idea
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.640]   that we should always want more money
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.400]   is so ingrained into us that when someone comes to you
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.880]   and says, "I don't wanna grow my money,"
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.480]   it seemed completely backwards to this financial advisor.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.920]   So I think Kahneman probably has this extreme view
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.800]   of enough that might be foreign to most of us, of course.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.960]   But I think having that calibrated view of enough
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.600]   is a really fundamental and important part
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.080]   of being happy with your money
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.600]   and being satisfied with the money
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.960]   that you might be lucky enough to accrue over your life.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.800]   - Good points.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.800]   But before we get onto the book,
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.320]   which we've jumped ahead a little bit,
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.760]   you actually wrote another book prior to that.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.040]   And by the way, these two books
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.560]   that we're talking about now,
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.320]   "50 Years in the Making,"
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.320]   "The Great Recession and Its Aftermath,"
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.880]   and then the other book, previous book,
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.200]   "Everyone Believes It," "Most Will Be Wrong,"
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.360]   "Motley Thoughts on Investing in the Economy,"
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.520]   these are both free through Kindle on Amazon.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.920]   So you can read these two books for free.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.920]   And could you tell me what that first book was all about?
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.120]   - The first book was really just a collection of articles
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.280]   that I had written at the Motley Fool.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.320]   Very similar, actually, to "The Psychology of Money,"
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.960]   which is also a collection of 20 or so points
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.400]   about behavioral finance and how we think about money
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.560]   that all kind of tie in a story to it.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.960]   The first book that I wrote, which is very short,
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.920]   again, it's more or less a long-form blog post
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.760]   that we turned into Kindle format, and it's free now,
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.080]   is just a short collection of articles
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.800]   and observations that I had put together
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.040]   while writing at the Motley Fool.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.880]   That was 10 or so years ago, so a lot of those were early.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.480]   A lot of those were kind of related to things
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.640]   that happened during the financial crisis of 2008,
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.040]   because you go back to 2010,
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.160]   that's what everyone was talking about, writing about.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.360]   But that, in some ways, I guess,
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.920]   was kind of the early format
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.080]   that ultimately became "The Psychology of Money" book
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.080]   that just came out.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.720]   - So let's get into "The Psychology of Money,"
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.800]   a very well-written book, I really enjoyed it.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.600]   It's a rather easy read, and don't take that the wrong way.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.160]   I mean, I was laughing as I was reading it,
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.120]   and I was seeing myself in this book.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.960]   It's not a technical book.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.680]   It doesn't get into quantitative theory,
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:27.000]   or the capital asset pricing model, or anything like this.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.120]   But it's a really good book on what you call soft skills.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.240]   And I'll just read one sentence from your introduction.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.040]   I think it sums it up really well.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.120]   The aim of this book is to use short stories
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:43.720]   to convince you that soft skills are more important
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.800]   than the technical side of money.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.920]   I think you really did that in this book.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.200]   You were able to bring out all those quirky things
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.320]   that we, as human beings, do to really hurt ourselves.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.800]   - Yeah, I think what's really important
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.000]   is that we tend to view finance
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.120]   through this academic analytical lens.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.480]   Let's tend to how we think about money,
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.120]   particularly at the CFA, CFP level,
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.120]   in terms of a very analytical field.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.720]   And it's not that any of that stuff is bad or wrong.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.840]   That's not it whatsoever.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.280]   The technical analytical research data side of investing
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.560]   is very important.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.240]   But what's interesting to me is that the psychological,
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.600]   the softer side of investing, if you have not mastered that,
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.000]   if you're not putting that at the forefront
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.080]   of what you're doing, then none of the analytical skills
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.200]   that sit on top of it necessarily matter.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.560]   Because look, you can have a PhD in finance from MIT.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.920]   You can be the smartest, technically-minded,
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.200]   data-driven person in the world.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.400]   But if you panic in March of 2020, or in 2008,
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:45.120]   or if you lose your cool during the tech run-up of 1999,
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.440]   none of that analytical skill matters.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.800]   So if you are not managing your relationship
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.000]   with greed and fear,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.040]   or your ability to take a long-term mindset,
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.480]   it's not that the other stuff doesn't matter.
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.040]   It's that the behavioral stuff has the ability
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.480]   to neutralize any of the analytical skills
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.680]   that you might have.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.040]   So if you think of a pyramid of financial skills,
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.720]   the base of that pyramid that sits at the bottom
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.400]   is behavior, and everything that sits above that,
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.200]   the analytical skills in terms of asset allocation,
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.560]   stock selection, taxes, et cetera,
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.040]   none of those things matter until the skill
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.600]   that sits below it has been mastered.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.000]   And if people don't master the behavioral side of investing,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.880]   then I think none of the technical skills matter.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.480]   And we can see this in terms of these individual examples.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.600]   There are people who have PhDs in finance
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.280]   and become partners at Goldman Sachs that go bankrupt,
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.680]   while at the same time, you have people
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.480]   who have no financial education, no training, no skills,
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.800]   that do very well for themselves financially,
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.520]   simply because one person mastered
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.840]   the behavioral side of investing,
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.120]   and the other person didn't.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.440]   And there are very few other fields where it's like that,
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.120]   where you can be very technical-minded
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.940]   and have all the technical skills,
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.480]   but if you don't master the behavioral side of your field,
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.640]   none of the technical skills matter.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.640]   - One of the things that I battle against are rules of thumb.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.520]   But I'm speaking with a client.
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.980]   I'll say to them, "What do you think your asset allocation
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.120]   "between stocks and bonds should be?"
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.960]   Very simple question.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.420]   And what will almost happen almost all of the time
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.200]   is they won't give me their answer.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.240]   They'll give me the, "Well, most people say,"
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.300]   or, "Well, from what I was reading,"
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.960]   or, "The books I've read said
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.540]   "that you should have your agent bonds,
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.120]   "or you should have this and you should have that."
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.720]   And I say to them, "Just throw all of that out.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:35.800]   "I don't care what other people say
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.000]   "the average investor's asset allocation should be.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.920]   "I want you to tell me what you think
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.020]   "your asset allocation should be,
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.720]   "forgetting about all of that stuff."
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.640]   And the reason I say that is because
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.640]   in the very first chapter of your book,
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.840]   it's called "No One's Crazy."
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:57.260]   And you talk in here about individual history.
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.960]   In other words, how much risk are you willing to take
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.840]   is what happened to you in the past.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.160]   So your asset allocation between stocks and bonds
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.580]   is going to have a great deal
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.840]   about what you've experienced in the past.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.880]   Well, here's one example.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.860]   If you were born in 1950 in the United States,
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.880]   then during your teens and 20s,
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.160]   your young, impressionable teens and 20s,
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.840]   where you're learning like a baseline foundation
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.840]   of knowledge about how the economy works.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.120]   During those years, the S&P 500,
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.420]   adjusted for inflation, went nowhere.
[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.460]   0% return adjusted for inflation
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.400]   during your teens and 20s.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.540]   That was your early experience in the stock market.
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.980]   If by contrast, you were born in 1970,
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.300]   then during your teens and 20s,
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.660]   your early impressionable years,
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.860]   the market went up tenfold adjusted for inflation.
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.600]   So just based off of the generation
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.860]   that you were born into, just born 20 years apart,
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.220]   you started your life,
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.860]   your early experience in the stock market
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.020]   was completely fundamentally different.
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.220]   And that sticks with people for the rest of their life.
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.820]   The early experience that they have in markets
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.260]   tends to stick with them.
[00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.220]   This is especially true if you look at the generation
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.380]   that grew up during the Great Depression,
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.940]   in terms of that trauma stuck with them
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:04.820]   for the rest of their life.
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:08.740]   And you can measure their unwillingness to go into debt
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.060]   or invest in the stock market to greater degrees
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.820]   relative to other generations.
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.660]   And what's interesting about this is,
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.780]   it's not that the generation,
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.460]   that one generation is smarter
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.100]   or has better information than another,
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.260]   that's not it whatsoever.
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.300]   They're equally smart, they're equally informed,
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.140]   but because they have different experiences,
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.940]   they go through their life thinking about risk
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.140]   and thinking about opportunity
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:28.780]   in fundamentally different ways.
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.580]   This is true from generation to generation.
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.340]   It's true from country to country.
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.300]   It's true from different parts of the country.
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.500]   It's even true just based off of the value
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.780]   that were instilled in you by your parents,
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:39.980]   which is gonna be different for me
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.420]   than it is different for you, Rick,
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.940]   than it is different from anyone else listening to this.
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:47.420]   We all kind of see the world through this own unique lens
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.340]   and become prisoners of our own unique past.
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.260]   And that's fine, I think.
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.180]   I think one of the big takeaways from it
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.700]   is just realizing that since everyone is different,
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.700]   there is not necessarily one right answer in finance,
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.540]   that the decisions that you come to with your money
[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.580]   are gonna be different from mine,
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.500]   not because we're disagreeing with each other,
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.860]   just because we have different goals
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.580]   and different perspective based off of our experiences.
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:08.980]   And a lot of times in finance,
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.700]   when there are debates about different investing strategies
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.540]   or where the economy is going next
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.060]   or what you should do with your money,
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.380]   it's not necessarily that people
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.340]   are actually disagreeing with each other
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.740]   or arguing with each other.
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:21.700]   A lot of times what it is
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.500]   are just people reflecting the fact
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.460]   that they see the world through a different lens
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.180]   because of their own experiences.
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.060]   And I think it's important for us
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.300]   to come to a greater conclusion,
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.100]   an idea that equally smart, equally informed people
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.740]   can come to different conclusions, and that's fine.
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.860]   That there's a great quote from financial advisor,
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.100]   Tim Maurer, who says,
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.540]   "Personal finance is more personal than it is finance."
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.180]   And I think we should embrace that more
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.220]   and realizing that, look,
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.060]   there are crazy things that people do with their money
[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:48.900]   that you can look at,
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.140]   you and I can look at and say, that's a bad idea.
[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.380]   But most of the decisions that people make with their money,
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.220]   check the boxes in their head in that given moment
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.860]   in terms of, this is how I think the world works.
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.500]   And this is what I want out of the world.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.860]   So therefore, this is what I'm gonna do with my money.
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:03.900]   And if you think about that,
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.020]   just in terms of no one is necessarily crazy,
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.740]   that we're all trying to figure out
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:08.940]   what we should do with our money
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.420]   based off of how we think the world works.
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.900]   You become a little bit more empathetic
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.220]   to differing views and views
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.660]   that you otherwise might disagree with
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.060]   that don't make sense to you,
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.740]   but might make sense and be the good strategy,
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.420]   the good thing to do with their money for other people.
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.460]   - I often find it interesting
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.660]   that when children watch their parents suffer
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.220]   through something like a downturn
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:37.500]   where they would lose their jobs, lose their money,
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.540]   that the children see this
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.620]   during their impressionable years.
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.980]   And the parents are talking about,
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.540]   I'll never get into the stock market again.
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:46.380]   I'll never do this again.
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.300]   I'll never do that again.
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.740]   And the children hear this and listen to it.
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:53.260]   And that reflects in their attitudes, at least for a while.
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:57.180]   And I say that because I recall a conversation
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:00.540]   sitting around a table with some young people
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:01.780]   who worked on Wall Street.
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.180]   This was about 2012.
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.460]   And they had just gotten out of college
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.260]   and they had just gotten their first job
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:09.260]   working on Wall Street.
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:12.700]   And we were talking about investing their 401k plan.
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.380]   And I was absolutely shocked
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.420]   that some of them didn't wanna put any money
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.820]   in the stock market.
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.460]   And they worked on Wall Street
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.340]   because they had seen, and their answer was,
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.140]   I watched my parents suffer.
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.820]   I watched them lose almost everything
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.980]   in the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008.
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:33.140]   And I just don't trust the market.
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.780]   - Yeah, I think that's true for a lot of things.
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.660]   It's true for politics by and large as well,
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.460]   where we think we are open-minded
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.580]   and some people are more open-minded than others.
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:43.220]   But by and large, on average, in general,
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.980]   people tend to take their political views
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.220]   from what they learned from their parents.
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.020]   It's true for finance as well.
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.260]   It's true in business as well.
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.460]   Howard Schultz of Starbucks
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.900]   has made this point many times
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.620]   that the reason that he is so adamant
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:58.260]   on having good health insurance for Starbucks workers,
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:23:59.620]   even at the lowest levels,
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.820]   is because he personally watched his father,
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:06.420]   I believe, break his leg and didn't have health insurance
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:07.900]   and was unable to work
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.460]   and then completely made the whole family destitute
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:11.300]   because of it.
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.420]   And that personal experience
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.060]   and watching that when he was a kid
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.820]   is what made him really want to emphasize health insurance
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.220]   for Starbucks employees.
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.740]   So there are a lot of things that people like me
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:21.900]   and you and everyone else,
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.900]   we're trying to learn
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.420]   and read about other people's experiences, which is great,
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:26.660]   and try to be open-minded.
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.740]   But unless you have experienced something firsthand,
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.460]   I think it's hard to have the emotional scar tissue
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:33.420]   that you otherwise would,
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:34.940]   that people who have actually been in the trenches
[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.260]   and experienced those things.
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.020]   And all of us have experienced bad events,
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.540]   tragic events to different degrees,
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:41.380]   but they're all different.
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:42.980]   They happen at different points in our lives
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.940]   to different degrees and different context.
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.340]   So that's why we just go through the world,
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.460]   seeing the world through a slightly different lens
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:49.900]   than one another.
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.620]   Really important in finance and economics,
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:53.540]   just to realize that everyone
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.820]   has a different view of the world.
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:59.020]   - I asked the Bogleheads, when I'm gonna have a guest on,
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.180]   if they could give me some questions
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.100]   that they have for the guests.
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.180]   One person who responded, who had read your book, said,
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:10.380]   "A question I have is whether you have developed insights
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:13.100]   "into strategies people can use
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.420]   "to change their behavior around money."
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.860]   So we have these innate, ingrained beliefs.
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.020]   How do you change?
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.340]   - You know, this might sound cynical
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.820]   or sort of fatalistic, but I think by and large,
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.180]   my answer to that question is no.
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.780]   I don't think there are a lot of things that we can do
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.180]   for the big behavioral flaws and biases
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.300]   that we have to overcome them.
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.860]   This came to me from Daniel Kahneman,
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.140]   who is, of course, the world's foremost authority
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.540]   on this topic, who's been asked several times
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.620]   some variation of the question.
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.540]   They say, "Dr. Kahneman, you've done all this research,
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.460]   "all this insight into behavioral finance.
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:50.580]   "Has it made you a less biased person?"
[00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.740]   And he always says, "Absolutely not."
[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.100]   He has the same biases, the same behavioral flaws
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.700]   that he's had his entire life.
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.740]   And which should make sense,
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.820]   because a lot of the behavioral flaws that we have
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:03.620]   in finance have to do with dopamine and cortisol
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.420]   and these hormones in our brain.
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.380]   And it's ridiculous to think that we can read a blog post
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.420]   and change that, change those hormones
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.180]   based off of something that we read in the moment.
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.740]   So for me, rather than trying to assume
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.260]   that we can fix our flaws, that we all have,
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:18.100]   they're all different flaws,
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.260]   but everyone is behaviorally flawed in some way,
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.100]   rather than assuming we can fix them,
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:25.540]   to me, it's just becoming a little bit more introspective
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.900]   and embracing your flaws and realizing,
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:31.420]   and if you look at your past and realizing the areas
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.700]   in which you have erred in your financial life,
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.780]   realizing that that is probably a good indication
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.740]   of what you are likely to do in the future,
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:40.420]   and then situating your finances, investing your money,
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.180]   having an asset allocation that embraces those flaws,
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.860]   rather than assuming you've learned your lesson in the past.
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:48.700]   So for one example, if you are someone who panicked
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:52.700]   in March of this year, and in 2008, and in 2001,
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.740]   rather than assuming that you have learned your lesson
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.540]   this time and you won't do it again,
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.180]   you should probably just embrace the fact
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.740]   that you have a lower risk tolerance
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.380]   than maybe you thought you did.
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.740]   You should have more of your assets into bonds and cash
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:06.860]   than you otherwise did,
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.580]   rather than assuming you can learn your lesson.
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.180]   I think your past behavior is gonna be
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.540]   a very good indication of your future behavior,
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.780]   regardless of how hard you try to fix those flaws.
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:16.820]   - I completely agree.
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.700]   And a lot of times that I'm talking with clients,
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.460]   I ask them, how did you react during 2007 and 2008
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.820]   when the market lost 60%?
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:28.860]   And if their answer is, I didn't do anything,
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.460]   well, that's a good indication to me
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:35.140]   that their tolerance for risk is probably relatively high.
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.980]   But if they did something, like got out,
[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.420]   or reduced their allocation, or quote-unquote,
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:43.500]   oh, I made a terrible mistake, and I sold, so forth,
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.460]   it tells me that whatever allocation they had going in
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:51.100]   to 2007 and 2008, it might have only been 60% stocks,
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:54.860]   but that was still too high because they sold.
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:59.140]   So your past actions do tell probably
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:00.940]   what you're going to do in the future.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.460]   And then in the future, quite frankly,
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.260]   and I don't know if this has any effect
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:06.700]   on what we're talking about,
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:10.540]   but once you go from an accumulation to a distribution
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.220]   in your portfolio, because you're retired now,
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.100]   and you're gonna live off your portfolio,
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.580]   your portfolio, you can't make up the mistakes
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:21.260]   as easily anymore because you're now distributing money
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:22.980]   instead of bringing on more money.
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.740]   When you're young and you make mistakes,
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.860]   okay, you don't do it again,
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.580]   just stay in for the long term.
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.700]   You continue to, you didn't lose that much money
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.420]   because you didn't have that much money in
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.540]   when you jumped out.
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:34.740]   You're gonna continue to earn money
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:37.140]   for the next 20, 25 years.
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:41.300]   But when you're 65 or so and you decide to retire,
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.820]   you can't afford to lose it.
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:45.460]   You can't afford those biases to take hold of you
[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:46.700]   where you capitulate.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.620]   - No, it's really important.
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.380]   I mean, one story that people talk a lot about these days
[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.380]   is what's going on with Robinhood right now.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.140]   Surge this year in popularity, surge in volume,
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.340]   seems like virtually every young person
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.420]   under the age of 25 has a Robinhood account
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:03.380]   and they're all buying bankrupt companies and penny stocks.
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.860]   There's actually one maybe silver lining from that,
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:07.620]   which is, A, first,
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.260]   you know exactly how that story is gonna end.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.300]   You don't know when it's gonna end,
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.300]   but you know exactly what's gonna happen to those people.
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:15.020]   It's all gonna end in tears, of course.
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:16.780]   But then there's maybe one silver lining to that,
[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.980]   which is learning that lesson
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.500]   when you are 19 or 20 years old
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:22.980]   is probably so beneficial
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:25.300]   rather than learning that lesson about risk
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.980]   and taking unnecessary risk in the stock market
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.540]   when you are 45 or 50 or 60 years old.
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:31.940]   So maybe that's one silver lining
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.460]   to the Robinhood story this year
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.980]   is that people are learning about risk the hard way,
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.340]   firsthand, when they are by and large young
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:39.340]   versus later in life
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.580]   when they are either saving for their kids to go to school
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.700]   or saving for their own retirement, et cetera,
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.900]   when those lessons become very devastating
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.020]   versus learning it when you're 19 years old.
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:48.900]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.580]   Let's go ahead and get back to the book
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.560]   and some of the chapters in the book.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:58.200]   In chapter four, you have confounding and compounding.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.920]   And you talk about Warren Buffett,
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:05.280]   and you said that he was worth, when you wrote the book,
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.240]   $84.5 billion,
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:13.560]   but $81.5 billion of that came after he was age 65.
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:17.960]   Now, he's 90 years old now, so that's 25 years ago.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.880]   But the point is that most of his wealth
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.160]   actually occurred after age 65.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:25.160]   And it was all due to compounding.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.720]   And once people learn the benefits of compounding
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.200]   and staying the course,
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.920]   this is where, eventually, over time,
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.240]   they begin to make money.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.240]   - Yeah, I think what's interesting about Buffett
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.480]   is that if he were a normal person
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:46.160]   and had started investing when he was 22 or 25
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:49.480]   and retired at 65, like most people would, a normal person,
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.600]   and if he had earned the same average annual returns
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.640]   during that period, 22% per year, great returns,
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.920]   you would have never heard of him.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.800]   He never would have become a household name.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.120]   His net worth would have been literally
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.160]   something like $12 million, with an M, not a B.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.000]   You would have never heard of him.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.640]   The reason he is so successful in dollar terms
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.920]   is because he started investing at age 11,
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.400]   and he continues through today at age 90.
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.280]   That's why he is so successful.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.640]   So yes, he is a great investor.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.800]   He is a skilled investor, of course, period.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.160]   But the real secret to his wealth in dollar terms
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.160]   is just the amount of time he has been investing for.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.000]   And that's really important,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.200]   because whenever there are investors who talk about Buffett
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.240]   and try to piece together how he's done it,
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.640]   they go into great detail about how Buffett thinks about
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.600]   moats and business models and brands
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.000]   and market cycles and whatnot,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.720]   which is all good, important stuff.
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.640]   But the single most important part of explaining his success
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.080]   is just the amount of time he has been investing for.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.760]   Now, I think that explanation is just too simple
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.400]   for people to take seriously.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.720]   They don't wanna think that his success
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.880]   can be just tied to something as simple
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.080]   as the amount of time he's been doing it for.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.520]   But that, again, just highlights the idea
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.320]   that compounding is not intuitive.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.480]   It's not intuitive to think that someone
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:01.120]   could achieve that much success after their 65th birthday,
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.840]   even if he's 90 years old today.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.600]   It's not intuitive to think that all of the gains
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.360]   can be tied to his geriatric years,
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.240]   even if he's been doing this for his entire life.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.720]   But that's how compounding works.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.400]   The gains for compounding are almost unnoticeable
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.480]   in the early years.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.160]   They get good in the middle years.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.520]   And then it's not until you've been investing
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.680]   for 30, 40, 50 years
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.840]   that things can just start getting ridiculous.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.880]   So look, if you are someone who is 60 years old
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:26.880]   listening to this, you might say,
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.120]   "Well, that doesn't do me any good.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.040]   "I don't have 50 years in front of me."
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.760]   But that's just the hard truth about how compounding works
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.280]   is that it is something that takes place over decades.
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.440]   And of course, all of our attention goes to
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.720]   what is happening in the stock market this month,
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.040]   this quarter, this year, even this decade,
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.000]   when we know over the long course of investing history,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.880]   what really matters is not necessarily
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.040]   what's gonna happen this year or even this decade,
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.160]   but what's gonna happen over the next 20, 30, 40, 50 years.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.480]   That's where the big gains come,
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.160]   the big gains that so many of us look at
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.360]   and aspire to and try to learn from.
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.920]   And it's so easy to overlook
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.440]   where those gains actually came from
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.560]   and what actually caused them.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.920]   - I often talk with people who are professionals
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:11.280]   about how long it took them to become qualified
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.560]   to do what they do.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.640]   And then even after that,
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.000]   how long it took to begin to accumulate wealth
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.320]   and become well-known in their industry
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.960]   and basically become successful.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.760]   And it takes almost a lifetime.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.400]   I mean, you start out in elementary school,
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.680]   then you go to high school,
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.160]   and then you get into a good college,
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.160]   and then you study biology,
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.920]   and then you go to medical school,
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:38.240]   then you spend 10 years in medical school at various levels,
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.400]   and you accumulate all this debt
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.680]   going through medical school,
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.200]   and then you finally get out of residency
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.720]   and you start working.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.320]   And it takes years and years and years
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.240]   to actually see the compounding effect
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.360]   of all the work that you're doing
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.360]   to become a successful physician.
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.240]   And yet, when you look at investing,
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.040]   people seem to wanna make it like tomorrow.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.240]   - That's, I mean, that's the hardest part.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.840]   And there are some fields where you can gain
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:11.000]   some sort of skill in a fairly short period of time.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.040]   And that's why I think it's intuitive to think,
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.360]   if you are an investor that you need to see results
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.320]   in the next six months,
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.040]   let's just say if you are going to the gym,
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.320]   if you are someone who is not in very good shape
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.160]   and you start going to the gym every day,
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.360]   within six months, you should start seeing results.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.280]   Not right away, not overnight, not in the first week,
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.600]   but after six months, you should see some results.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.000]   But if you are someone who is just getting into investing,
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.040]   there is no expectation whatsoever
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.400]   that after six months or even after one year,
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.280]   you're gonna see anything that looks like returns.
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.880]   You could have significantly less money
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.120]   than you did after a year.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:44.360]   And that's in the normal course of operations
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.560]   as an investor, just the history of volatility.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.480]   So it's not intuitive for a lot of people getting into it
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.800]   to understand how much time it takes.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.960]   But historically, we know that to put the odds of success
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.320]   in your favor and for the odds of success
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.720]   to be greatly in your favor,
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.120]   to where you have a very good chance
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.520]   of doing well over time,
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:05.600]   you need to be invested for at least 10, if not 20 years
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.680]   before the odds of success are in
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:12.440]   between 80 and 90% historically from everything we know
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.560]   that you will have a decent return accruing to you.
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:16.680]   So a lot of investors who say,
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.760]   "Well, I don't have 20 years in front of me."
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.120]   I think it's just important to realize
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.080]   that if that's the case,
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.680]   you are just relying on a greater degree of luck
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.320]   to fuel your success, to fuel your returns.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.760]   And that's what it is.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.000]   Most investors, if you ask them,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.280]   "Are you a long-term investor?"
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.640]   They will tell you yes.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.200]   Most investors will say that.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.720]   They think they're long-term investors.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.600]   But then if you ask them,
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.520]   "What is your definition of long-term?"
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.560]   A lot of investors will tell you one year
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.600]   or three years or five years.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.440]   The Federal Reserve actually does a survey
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.600]   where they ask people
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.000]   their long-term inflation expectations.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.480]   And the definition of a long-term
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.840]   that they use in that survey is three years.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.680]   So for a lot of people, three years, five years, 10 years,
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.120]   that's definitely the long run.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.000]   Whereas we know if you look at the history of investing,
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.040]   it's at least 10 years, if not closer to 20 years,
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.080]   that counts as a good definition of long-term,
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.080]   which is the odds of success
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.800]   for earning a positive return are in your favor.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.240]   - Back in the day when I was,
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.400]   I think I wrote my first book 20 years ago,
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.040]   I was looking at how long people held
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.840]   onto their equity mutual funds.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.440]   And the average was about two to three years
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.520]   before they sold them
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.000]   and went on to another equity mutual fund.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:22.880]   - Right.
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.320]   - Let's talk about chapter five.
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:28.720]   Now that you've made your money, how do you keep it?
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.600]   How do you stay wealthy?
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:34.000]   - The key point here is that getting rich and staying rich
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.080]   are two completely separate skills
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.520]   that often have contradictory skillsets,
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:41.920]   but you need to nurture both of them to do well over time.
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.000]   Getting rich requires being an optimist
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   about the long run, taking a risk,
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.280]   being optimistic about the future of the economy,
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:52.120]   the future of business, the future of society.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.600]   You need to be optimistic about that in order to get rich.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.640]   Staying rich requires almost the opposite.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.280]   It requires a pessimism,
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.240]   if not paranoia about the short run.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.120]   It requires that you have enough adequate liquid savings
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.160]   and the avoidance of debt
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.200]   so that you can survive the short run
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.920]   because you know the short run is gonna be
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.680]   a continuous chain, a never-ending chain
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.560]   of setbacks and disappointments and breakages
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.000]   and recessions and bear markets
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.480]   and now pandemics and crazy elections.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.200]   You know that that is the history
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.560]   of the United States and around the world,
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.760]   that there's always bad news in the short run
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.320]   that you need to prepare for.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.720]   So I think those are the two conflicting skills
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.560]   that you need to have.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.120]   And they seem like they're contradictory,
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.160]   but to me, for most people,
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.360]   I think the way to think about this
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:35.160]   is that you need to save like a pessimist
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:36.920]   and invest like an optimist.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.520]   You need to save money with the idea
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:41.360]   that we might fall into a new recession at any moment,
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.160]   that there could be a bear market at any moment,
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.800]   that you can get laid off at any moment.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.440]   You need to save like a pessimist
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.640]   while investing like an optimist
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.200]   with the idea that over the next 10 or 20 years,
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.880]   people are gonna figure problems out
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.800]   and we're gonna get better in the economy.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.040]   We're gonna get more productive.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:59.200]   There's gonna be profits that accrue to shareholders
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.000]   and the stock market is gonna rise in a rational way.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.400]   I think that's investing like an optimist.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.080]   So you need to have both of those together at the same time.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.840]   Not many people do.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.560]   I think there are more people
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:11.560]   that are good at one or the other.
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.080]   They may be good at getting rich
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.440]   and during bull markets, they do extremely well,
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.360]   but they're not necessarily good at staying rich.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.840]   They're not good at knowing the boundaries
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.040]   of how much risk they should take
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.160]   or how to situate their finances
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.360]   so that when the tide goes out, so to speak,
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.320]   they're not gonna get wiped out themselves.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.800]   And then there are also a subset of people
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.280]   that are not good at getting rich in the first place.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.240]   And they're so conservative, so pessimistic
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.400]   about what's going on in the world
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.200]   because there's always bad news,
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.920]   bad headlines in the news.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.480]   They get so caught up in that
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.360]   that they're never actually able to invest like an optimist.
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:45.040]   So I think nurturing both of those skills separately
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.000]   and realizing that they are separate skills
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.480]   that have separate skill sets
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.840]   is really important to do well over the long run.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.880]   - One of the chapters is save money.
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:58.080]   And I found this to be so basic.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.800]   And I think the point that you make in this chapter
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.000]   is look, just save money.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.160]   A lot of people say, I wanna save for a boat,
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.560]   I wanna save for a house, I wanna save for retirement.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:10.280]   You make the argument, it doesn't really matter.
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:13.120]   Even if you're not saving for anything, just save.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:18.000]   - Yeah, I think most people need a reason to save.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.720]   And they're saving for a specific event
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.120]   that they can foresee in the future.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.400]   They can foresee that they need a new car in the next year.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.880]   So they're saving for that.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:27.360]   To me, savings has always just been a hedge
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.920]   against the idea that the most important events
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.280]   in your life and around the world
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.280]   are the things that we cannot see coming.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.800]   It's COVID-19 that we could not see coming
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.880]   before it happened.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:39.080]   It's the big recession, the big layoffs,
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.640]   the big trauma that everyone goes through
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.720]   at some period in life that you can't see coming.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.480]   That's the stuff you need to save for.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.120]   So I think you don't need any reason to save money
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.920]   other than the idea that what's gonna be really important
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.160]   to both your happiness and your success in life
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:56.120]   is your ability to have options and control your time
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.960]   and be in control of the situation
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.960]   when something bad happens to you in your life.
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.120]   If there's a layoff or a medical emergency,
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.880]   having options in your life
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.920]   are gonna be one of the most important assets that you have.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:10.120]   And you get those options by saving for things
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.640]   that you cannot see coming.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.040]   Even when everything seems like it's going right
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.520]   and your career's on track
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.160]   and the economy seems like it's going right,
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:20.160]   to still have a good buffer, a good level of savings,
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.760]   room for error in your personal finances
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.280]   that allows you to get through those hard times
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.480]   that you might not see coming,
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.640]   that no one can predict coming,
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.640]   but we know are just an ever-present part
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.400]   of everyone's life.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:34.000]   - One of the chapters you wrote is called Surprise.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.600]   By the way, I love the title of your chapters.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:36.600]   They're very simple.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.440]   (laughs)
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.200]   Very descriptive, too, by the way.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.720]   But you say something in here
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.080]   that is absolutely brilliant.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:47.520]   You say historians are not prophets.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.120]   Historians are not prophets.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.840]   Explain that.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.320]   - The whole study of history, the whole subject of history
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.040]   is basically looking at surprises.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.040]   It's looking at events
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.080]   that no one necessarily saw coming
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:58.960]   because those are the things
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.080]   that move the needle in the world.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:05.000]   It's things like the Great Depression and the World Wars
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.440]   that before they happened,
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.720]   particularly well before they happened,
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:10.040]   no one could have possibly seen those coming
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.520]   and no one could have seen them playing out
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.040]   the way in which they did.
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.720]   Those are the things that make the most difference in life.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.240]   So of course historians are not prophets about the future
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.800]   because what historians do
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.160]   is they spend all their time studying things
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.760]   that nobody saw coming.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:24.800]   But I think there's an irony
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.680]   that we tend to look at history
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.720]   like it is a roadmap of the future,
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.360]   particularly if for something analytical like investing,
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.280]   where we have 100 years of investing data
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.400]   and we combine that data
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.120]   to give us a view of what's gonna happen in the future
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.120]   without realizing that a lot of the big events
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.320]   that we pay attention to,
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.680]   the Great Depression, the crash of 1987, even 2008,
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.440]   or this year with COVID-19,
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.360]   all of those big events in the history that we have
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.000]   are things that people did not see coming
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.200]   before they happened.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:56.400]   So how should we use those as a roadmap of the future?
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.120]   The biggest lesson that we should take away
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:01.000]   from those surprises is that the world is surprising.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.160]   It was surprising in the past
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.640]   and it's gonna be surprising in the future as well.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:08.120]   And I think the way to deal with that as an investor
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:12.600]   is to have more expectations than you have forecast.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.280]   The difference of that is this.
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.600]   If I were to say hypothetically,
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:20.520]   we are gonna have the next recession in Q3 of 2021.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.480]   If I were to say that, that is a forecast.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.960]   I'm forecasting something specific that's gonna happen.
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.080]   If I were to say, on the other hand,
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.600]   on average, you should expect there
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.200]   to be two recessions per decade
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.880]   because that's historically what we've had.
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:33.200]   That is an expectation.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.760]   I don't know when they're gonna come.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.280]   I don't know where they're gonna happen.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.680]   I don't know how severe they're gonna be when they hit.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:40.440]   But just as my baseline expectation,
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.960]   I expect there to be two recessions per decade on average.
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:44.960]   That is an expectation.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.560]   It's very different from a forecast,
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.280]   but an expectation just makes it
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:50.520]   so that when something does come out of the blue
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:51.840]   that you did not expect,
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.920]   it's not necessarily surprising to you.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.000]   Even if you did not see this recession coming,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.480]   as in 2020, I think virtually none of us did,
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.040]   even if you didn't see it coming,
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:01.920]   if you have it as your baseline expectation,
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.600]   you're not necessarily surprised when it comes.
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:07.800]   I think this is similar to how people in California
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.120]   think about earthquakes.
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.320]   Whereas if you live in California,
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.840]   you know that there are gonna be earthquakes.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:13.840]   Some of them are gonna be big.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.600]   You know they're gonna be part of your future,
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.840]   but you can't forecast when it's gonna come.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.440]   No one even tries to predict
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.440]   when the next big earthquake is gonna come.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.440]   You just expect,
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.560]   and you know that it could come at any moment.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:25.560]   It could happen today.
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.000]   It could happen 10 years from now.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.680]   And then so by expecting it,
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:29.880]   you are just building your house
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.280]   so that it can withstand it whenever it's gonna come.
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:35.000]   I think we should think about recessions and bear markets
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.320]   in a similar way,
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.160]   that rather than trying to predict when they're gonna come,
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.600]   which is where all the energy
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.400]   in the finance industry goes to,
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.200]   we should just situate our finances
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.880]   and have robust enough finances
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.040]   that we can endure them whenever they might come
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:50.160]   with the expectation that they might come at any moment,
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.600]   rather than trying to predict exactly
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.240]   when they might come in our life.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:58.600]   - A lot of advisors talk about the optimal portfolio.
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.800]   You know, they wanna put this asset allocation together
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.600]   and come up with the optimal portfolio.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.200]   And I laugh at that.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.360]   I say, you know, how do you know
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:08.120]   what the optimal portfolio is going to be going forward?
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:09.960]   All you're doing is you're looking back at history.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.520]   You're looking back at the numbers of what they were
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:16.040]   based on whatever was going on at that particular time.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.960]   It has very little,
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.640]   well, it might be some rhyme to it
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.040]   as to what might happen in the future,
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.880]   but you can't say that the correlations
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.800]   between these asset classes
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:28.280]   are going to be 0.67 going forward.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.080]   And this is the optimal allocation
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.600]   between stocks and bonds
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:35.120]   or the optimal allocation between international and US.
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.240]   And yet, a lot of people invest
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:41.560]   based on very precise backward-looking data
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.920]   that it could happen by luck, I guess.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:47.960]   I mean, you know, the clock strikes 12 twice a day.
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:51.320]   - But other than that, I just don't see how
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.080]   a lot of what happened in the past,
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:56.720]   as far as correlations between asset classes
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.680]   and, you know, value premiums
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:03.320]   and all of these factor models are all looking backwards.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.360]   How relevant is it going forward?
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.040]   - I think where a lot of that comes from, too,
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:11.600]   is not realizing what you are actually paid for
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:12.440]   in investing.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:13.640]   Let me explain what I mean by that.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:15.600]   Of course, there is, for anything in life
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.440]   that is good and worth pursuing,
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:18.400]   it has a cost.
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.240]   There's a cost that you have to pay.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.160]   It's the same in investing.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.600]   You can do very well in financial markets over time,
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.240]   but you have to, there's a cost to that that you have to pay.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.000]   To me, the cost that you have to pay in investing
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.280]   is dealing with uncertainty and randomness.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.360]   That's the cost of the mission that you have to pay
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.320]   in order to do well over time.
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.880]   But people don't want to pay that cost
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.120]   or they don't view it as a cost,
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:40.000]   and it makes them feel much better
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.880]   if they are using a sense of precision
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.080]   because it makes them feel like they are in control.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.480]   And the cost that we are all being forced to pay,
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.520]   it makes them feel like they're getting a freebie
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.160]   if they can use their intelligence
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.520]   and their analytical skills
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.320]   to try to get around that cost.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:54.480]   So that's why I think you have people
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:57.760]   who do a lot of data mining historically
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:59.880]   to figure out exactly what they should do
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.400]   because it makes them feel like they are more in control
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.440]   in a market where kind of by definition,
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:07.880]   what we all deal with is uncertainty and randomness.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:11.040]   So it's just trying to avoid the cost of,
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:14.360]   the long-term cost of admission in stocks.
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:17.640]   And to me, it's just so obvious and clear historically
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.840]   that rather than trying to avoid that cost
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:21.680]   and trying to outsmart that cost,
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.040]   that you should just pay that cost.
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.360]   It's a good fee to pay.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.280]   It's not a fine.
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.520]   It's not an indication that you did something wrong.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.680]   It's a fee to get into the theme park.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:32.480]   It costs $100 to go to Disneyland,
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.360]   but most people who go realize that it's worth it
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:35.480]   because Disneyland is fun.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.120]   It's a good place to bring your family.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.680]   So they don't mind paying the fee to get in
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.200]   because the rewards are worth it.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.720]   And I think the fee of uncertainty and randomness
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:46.840]   and volatility, variability in investment markets
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.200]   is the same.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.720]   It's a fee, you have to pay it.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.920]   There's a cost and the cost is dealing with that,
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.000]   the pain, the discomfort of uncertainty,
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:55.960]   but it's worth paying.
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.000]   Over a long period of time,
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.840]   it's worth the cost of admission.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:46:59.940]   And rather than avoiding it,
[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:02.000]   we should just try to pay that cost.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.180]   - One last chapter that which I thought was really
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:06.520]   one of the best chapters in the book
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:09.040]   is called "You and Me."
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:12.520]   Beware of taking financial cues
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:16.720]   from people playing a different game than you are.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:19.160]   And I thought this was a brilliant chapter.
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.000]   - Well, thanks.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.120]   And really where it comes from is this idea
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:25.520]   that all of us as investors are playing different games.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.180]   There are high-frequency traders, there are day traders,
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:30.920]   there are fund managers managing for the next quarter,
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.440]   the next year, all the way up to pensions and endowments
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.400]   that are managing money for the next century.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.700]   We're all playing very different games,
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.240]   but we play on the same field.
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.480]   There's only one stock market.
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:41.160]   There's only one price for Apple stock,
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:42.800]   only one price for Google stock,
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.300]   even if we're playing different games.
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:47.900]   And a lot of times the prices of stocks get moved around
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:50.200]   by people who are playing a different game than you are.
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.520]   And if you are taking your cues from those other investors
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.680]   as a cue for what you should do with your money,
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.280]   you're liable to get them hurt.
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:01.360]   Here's one example from this, from 1999, 2000.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:05.440]   A lot of the gains in dot-com stocks back then
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.480]   were being pushed around by day traders
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:10.560]   who were pretty rationally, pretty reasonably,
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.240]   chasing momentum.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.680]   There was momentum in those markets
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.680]   where you could make money.
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:17.000]   They were rationally chasing it as day traders
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.840]   or as people who are investing for a week.
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.360]   You can't necessarily blame them for doing that.
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:21.900]   That's the game they were playing.
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:25.300]   The problem was when Cisco stock and Dell stock
[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.800]   and Microsoft stock were going up so much.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.120]   And then long-term investors looked at that and said,
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:32.280]   "Oh, maybe they know something I don't.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.520]   Maybe the other investors know something that I don't.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.860]   So I should put my long-term retirement money
[00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:38.480]   in those companies as well."
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.880]   Now, when the tide turned and everything unrolled,
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.080]   unraveled, the day traders were gone.
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.360]   They were only in it for the gains that you could make
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:46.600]   between today and tomorrow anyway.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.520]   They were gone.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:50.560]   The bag holders who got left with so much damage
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.880]   were the people who were actually long-term investors
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:56.640]   who were taking their investing cues from those day traders.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:59.920]   That's at least one explanation for how bubbles play out.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:02.100]   So I think it's always important in investing
[00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:04.320]   that you understand what game you're playing
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:05.600]   and realizing that if other people
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.260]   are playing a different game than you,
[00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:08.600]   you got to make sure that you're not
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:09.960]   taking your cues from them.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:12.360]   One other example of this is if you were to watch CNBC
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.400]   or Bloomberg TV, any of those shows,
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.840]   you will hear people say something along the lines of,
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:20.240]   you know, "You should buy Netflix stock."
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:22.120]   And it's not that that's necessarily bad advice,
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.960]   but you always have to ask the question, who is you?
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:26.400]   Are you talking to a day trader?
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:30.120]   Are you talking to a widowed retiree on a fixed income?
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:33.240]   It's very different for different people.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.720]   We're all playing different games.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.120]   And it's just another realization
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:37.320]   of what we discussed earlier, Rick,
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:40.220]   which is that there's no one right answer
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:41.920]   for most financial questions.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.480]   The answer that is right for you
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:47.800]   might be completely different for me and wrong for me
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.640]   if you and I are playing different games.
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:50.760]   And it's so important, again,
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:52.080]   to realize that personal finance
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:54.120]   is more personal than it is finance
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.920]   and realizing that people can disagree,
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.160]   come to different conclusions,
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.920]   and what is good information and good advice for you
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:01.720]   might be disastrous for me.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:03.360]   And we really have to think about finance
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:05.120]   through much more of a personal lens
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:07.760]   rather than a one-size-fits-all lens.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:10.560]   - I always say everything that's written out there
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:14.840]   about the optimal asset allocation and so forth
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:17.720]   is geared towards the average investor.
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:19.560]   Yet in 32 years of doing this,
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:21.860]   I've never met anyone average.
[00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:23.320]   - Right, exactly.
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:24.160]   - So here we are.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.560]   It's a great book, "The Psychology of Money."
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:28.720]   You see yourself in this book.
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:31.080]   And I have to admit,
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:33.660]   I saw myself in this book more than I wanted to.
[00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:37.840]   But one of the pains that we go through to learn.
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:40.680]   Question that one of the Bogleheads have for you
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:42.800]   is what are you working on now?
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:43.640]   What's next?
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:46.760]   - You know, I'm still doing what I've always done,
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.640]   which is just trying to do a lot of reading
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:51.140]   and a lot of thinking about what's going on in the world
[00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:53.600]   and trying to piece things together to write about.
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.800]   I do have a second book idea that has been sold
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.360]   that I'll start working on next year,
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:50:59.960]   but we'll save that conversation
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:01.120]   for later when it comes out.
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:04.620]   But my whole career has been,
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:05.740]   and I think will continue to be,
[00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:08.260]   just a bunch of casual reading and casual thinking
[00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:09.860]   and trying to piece things together
[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:12.700]   that I can write about that hopefully
[00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:14.420]   other people find beneficial
[00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:16.660]   and are able to see themselves in the stories
