[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:13.520]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound,
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.520]   where we've gotten 734 questions this year.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.560]   I made that number up, but it's gotta be pretty close.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.640]   - Okay, I was about to say, wow, you counted.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.480]   - It's probably pretty close.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.720]   I bet we get five or six questions a week.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.840]   Remember, it's askthecompound@gmail.com,
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.040]   askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.760]   - That's it. - Getting all these emails
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.600]   mixed up.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.960]   Today's Ask the Compound is brought to you
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.720]   by our friends at Bird Dogs.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.400]   Duncan, big news in Bird Dogs this week.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.200]   I noticed, they sent me an email.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.080]   I'm on the email list, obviously.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.200]   They know me.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.040]   They've got some new colors.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.840]   My favorite kind of shorts are,
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.640]   they have the gym shorts, they have the khaki shorts.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.640]   These are the khakis, 'cause they have the little belt loops.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.880]   I haven't had to use the belt loops yet.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.120]   But new colors, so we have three of 'em.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.280]   I liked the mint green, and I don't know, is it salmon?
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.320]   It's called orange blossom.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.600]   - Oh, wow, that's bold.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.560]   That's bold of you.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.400]   - I don't mind taking bold colors in the summer.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.400]   - I like the blue, the blue's my favorite.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.240]   - The blue's nice, too.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.640]   I got a pair of the green and the orange.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.180]   I'm a sucker for new colors.
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.960]   They're very, you know, I'm stocking up now
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.840]   for the summer, for spring break, all that kind of stuff.
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.680]   It's great.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.440]   Also, still, and I think I got a free T-shirt
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.840]   out of the deal, too.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.160]   I don't know how I, by two pairs,
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.160]   I don't know what the deal is.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.360]   But with us, you can still get the free white Tech Dad hat.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.360]   I still got it here.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.220]   So put an ATC in the code,
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.900]   or just go to birddogs.com/ATC.
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.080]   My wife is saying that my closet
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.320]   is overflowing with bird dogs.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.160]   I can't help it.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.080]   They're everywhere.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.760]   - Yeah, you know, on Thanksgiving,
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.360]   I actually was talking about bird dogs with someone.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.420]   Someone, for real, like completely unprompted,
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.040]   was like, "Are those bird dogs?"
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.040]   Or I guess they saw the logo on what I was wearing.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.960]   And I told 'em, I was like,
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.520]   "Yeah, they sponsor our podcast."
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.760]   And they're like, "Oh, I keep getting targeted advertising
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.800]   "on social media for them."
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.720]   And I've thought about trying 'em.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.400]   Real conversation.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.720]   - Get a free hat out of the deal.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.960]   All right.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.920]   You wanted to spike the ball real quick
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.800]   on a stock pick, or not yet?
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.880]   - Oh, that can wait a second.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.640]   First, I just wanted to say,
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.000]   it's that time of year, Spotify, Wrapped,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.360]   share with us any of your compound podcasts
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.080]   that are coming up in your top 10.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.400]   We love to see that.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.240]   So, share that with us.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.080]   I think we're gonna be doing--
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.840]   - Yeah, we've been getting a lot of that on social media,
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.680]   that people share it.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.080]   It's pretty cool how that works.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.460]   - Yeah, it's very cool.
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.640]   And yeah, we have, even the Ask the Compound
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.640]   is the youngest show.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.200]   So, we're still small and growing fast,
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.480]   but we had hundreds of people with us in their top 10,
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.760]   and top five, that kind of thing,
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.800]   which is very cool to see.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.160]   So, really appreciate that.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.760]   Our best show of the year, do you have any guesses?
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.000]   - Oh, I have no idea.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.320]   Our best show of the year was,
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.200]   Is It Crazy to Be 100% Invested in Stocks?
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.040]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.440]   Okay, I would have never even guessed what it could be.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.920]   Okay, good question, I remember that one.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.580]   - Yeah, yeah, so that was it.
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.480]   But yeah, thanks to everyone for listening.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.800]   And yeah, if Apple has a similar thing,
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.720]   then share that too.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.560]   - I think they do.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.400]   - I know they do for music.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.660]   I don't know about for podcasting, but yeah.
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.960]   And then, the next thing I was gonna say
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.440]   is just because it's become like a tradition
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.400]   where we make jokes about everyone's favorite
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.960]   oat milk stock, I just wanted to say,
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.080]   it's been a pretty good month.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.920]   So, John, if you could chart on of,
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.800]   this is the way over the last month.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.560]   - So, 80% in a month.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.680]   - Yeah.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.520]   - That's not bad.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.800]   All right, John, show the year-to-date return, though.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.000]   So, before the show, Duncan actually asked John
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.520]   to pull up the chart of Oatly on a year-to-date basis,
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.360]   and he looked at it, he said,
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.240]   "Wait, wait, wait, this is not what I wanted to see."
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.200]   Still down 35%.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.760]   Pull a good chart, and it's over the one month.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.600]   Oh, no.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.360]   - Okay, that's all time.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.840]   - All time, so this is down 94% from the IPO.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.320]   It spiked after the IPO, as well.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.560]   - Oh, I was buying it.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.680]   - Oh, on the IPO?
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.520]   Okay.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.360]   - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.080]   I basically bought it every point along that.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.840]   - Amazon was down 95% at the tech bubble.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.000]   I mean, same thing.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.840]   - Yeah, give me hope.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.560]   Help me rationalize holding on.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.480]   - All right, first question.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.200]   Up first today, we have--
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.400]   - I'm surprised we haven't gotten anyone
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.440]   who's written in and said it.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.520]   I'm with Duncan here.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.760]   I've gotten crushed on Oatly, as well.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.600]   - Oh, I've heard it.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.520]   Yeah, I've had multiple people reach out and be like,
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.600]   not just Oatly, but on other things, yeah.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.960]   There's camaraderie there.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.160]   So, up first today, we have a question from Dave.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.760]   I'm still new to bonds, so forgive me
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.240]   if you've covered this before,
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.000]   but what are the various outcomes for bonds
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.060]   if rates rise or fall from here?
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.680]   I'm trying to figure out the right maturity
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.200]   for diversifying into treasuries,
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.480]   and want to understand the risks.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.240]   - All right, we've still been getting a heavy influx
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.960]   of questions about bonds and yields.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.000]   It's still a ton of questions, right?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.360]   It's plateaued a little bit, for sure,
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.320]   but I think a lot of people are slowly
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.400]   but surely preparing themselves for the idea
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.880]   that the Fed might cut rates in 2024,
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.560]   which could mean lower cash rates, CD rates,
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.080]   money markets, savings accounts,
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.520]   all those things will go down.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.440]   So, I think people who've made that move into cash,
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.340]   and it went from earning 10 basis points at their big bank
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.320]   to at least earning four or five, maybe more, percent
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.800]   in T-bills or savings account or money markets,
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.060]   they've made that leap, but now they're saying,
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.940]   okay, maybe it has to be more fixed income
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.380]   so I can actually lock in some.
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.700]   So, our friends at the US Benchmark Series of ETFs
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.060]   send us this monthly update, which is pretty cool.
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.340]   John, throw this chart up here.
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.540]   So, this is an interest rate scenario analysis tool.
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.580]   And, of course, different bonds have different maturities
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.980]   and different durations,
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.340]   and the yield curve never moves exactly the same.
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.340]   You don't have a 1% move in every single maturity.
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.740]   A lot of times these bonds move in different forms
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:52.740]   and the interest rate,
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.180]   the magnitude of the change is different.
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.060]   So, what Benchmark Series did for us is they looked at
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.700]   what would happen over a 12-month period to these bonds,
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.020]   and they show the two-year, three-year,
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.780]   five, seven, 10, 20, and 30-year treasuries, right?
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.340]   So, a bunch of different maturities.
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.340]   What would happen if rates rose 50% or fell 50 basis points?
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.340]   What if they rose 1% or fell 1%?
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.300]   So, as an example, we'll show here.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.020]   So, the 30-year treasury, if rates were to fall 1%,
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.540]   is up over 20%, right?
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.180]   22% or so over a year.
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.340]   If rates were to rise 1%, it's down a little less than 10%.
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.780]   Now, there's this funny term in the bond market land
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.260]   for this called convexity.
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.620]   I won't bore you with the details there
[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.820]   because that sounds like a very scientific word,
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.680]   but all that means is most of the time,
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.300]   if bond yields fall, your price is gonna rise more
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.340]   than if bond yields rose, the loss.
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.060]   So, the gain outweighs the loss.
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.860]   It's not a one-to-one thing.
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.940]   But the other thing, throw this back up here, John.
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.660]   The other thing to look at is a shorter-term bond,
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.500]   if rates were to fall 1%, you can see the two-year,
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.380]   it rises 5%, and most of that is the yield right now.
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.660]   So, you're not gonna get as big a bang for your buck
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.940]   if yields were to fall in something of a shorter-term bond,
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.100]   just like you're not gonna see as big of losses, right?
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.020]   You're not gonna see a loss
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.460]   because the yield's gonna make up for it.
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.780]   So, you do have this interesting dynamic now, though,
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.460]   where if rates rise, your loss is gonna be not that bad,
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.140]   and if rates fall, your gain is gonna be pretty good,
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.460]   which was the opposite of what things were like
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.860]   a few years ago during the pandemic when rates were so low.
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.940]   So, you have higher yields now.
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.820]   You have this convexity piece where if yields fall,
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.900]   you're gonna get a pretty big gain in your bonds,
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.060]   and if rates rise a little bit,
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.620]   you're still, you have some shock absorbers there.
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.660]   - So, wait, you're saying I should tax-loss my OBLY
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.460]   and buy up a bunch of long bonds?
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.860]   - Yeah, if you wanna nail,
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.860]   I mean, rates have already fallen a little bit,
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.700]   but this is the problem with trying to guess this
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:52.260]   is we don't know if interest rates fall,
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.700]   how much are they gonna fall in the third year
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:54.940]   versus the two year versus the five,
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.420]   we don't know what the magnitude of that fall is going to be
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.980]   'cause the variables there are what's the Fed doing,
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.020]   what's the economy doing, what's inflation doing,
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.220]   what are bond traders doing,
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.780]   where are bond people moving your money?
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.420]   So, the helpful thing about a chart like that
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.700]   is it shows you what the potential outcomes can be,
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.780]   and it gives you a range of expectations,
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.540]   but you just don't know what the magnitude
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.700]   of those rate changes is going to be.
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.480]   But that's the idea.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.820]   So, if you want bigger bang for your buck if rates fall,
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.540]   you go further out on the yield curve,
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.700]   but that means way more volatility, too,
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.920]   and if rates rise a little bit, you're gonna ding more,
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.300]   and if you want some more stability,
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.700]   you stay on the shorter end of things.
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:36.540]   That's the idea.
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.940]   - I think people sometimes paint the bond market
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.740]   as being very mathematical and easier to predict
[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.820]   than the stock market, but this doesn't really sound like it
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.160]   if it comes down to--
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.000]   - No, it is because--
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.300]   - Someone picking rate times to hike or cut or pause.
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.100]   - But it is, bond market is more math
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.220]   because over the long term, call it five to seven years,
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.260]   your starting yield is gonna explain 90 to 95% of your gain.
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.420]   So, these are the short-term moves,
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.740]   and so you kind of know what's gonna happen
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:07.980]   based on where rates go from here.
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:08.900]   You just don't know where rate's gonna go.
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.140]   That's the hard part in the short term.
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.420]   If you're trying to guess the bond market,
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.340]   you're guessing interest rates,
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.660]   and that's really, really difficult to do.
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.440]   So, I talked about this earlier this week on my blog.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.900]   The 10-year treasury went from a low to 3.3% this year,
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.940]   then it shot up to 5% in a matter of months,
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.140]   and then in the past month, it's gone from 5% to 4.1%,
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.940]   and no one could have predicted that path of rates.
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.060]   If you tried to guess that somehow
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.380]   because you're trying to guess inflation
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.740]   or economic growth or whatever, good luck with that.
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:41.420]   That's why bonds are generally for longer-term people
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.940]   that want less volatility,
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:43.900]   and so if you're trying to guess this
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.740]   and be like a hedge fund manager,
[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.260]   yeah, it's gonna be a lot harder to do.
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.820]   So, I would think about it more from the perspective
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:49.700]   of a long-term investor
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.660]   'cause no one can predict interest rates.
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:52.500]   That's the point.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.580]   - Got it, makes sense. - All right, next one.
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.740]   - Okay, up next, I wonder, actually, question on that.
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.580]   Do you think we're gonna get
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.280]   as many bond questions in 2024,
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.060]   or do you think we're gonna see a shift,
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.580]   a turning point in this?
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.420]   - That'd be interesting.
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.100]   I guess it depends where yields go.
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.940]   But obviously, yields getting to 5%
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.500]   is one of the things that cause a lot of people
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.740]   to write us in about bonds,
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.020]   but it has slowed down a little bit.
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:16.860]   - Yeah, yeah, I'm curious.
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.700]   - We're doing an ask the compound sentiment indicator.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.100]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.740]   Okay, up next, we have a question from Tim.
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.020]   Sure, it's great that S&P 500 is up 20% this year,
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:26.980]   but aren't we just pricing
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.980]   in the inevitable Fed rate cuts in 2024?
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:33.300]   Should we really expect the market to go up again next year
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.080]   after surprising the upside this year?
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.360]   Color me skeptical.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.020]   Full disclosure, I'm naturally bearish
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.060]   and take a bit of an anti-bin stance about the markets.
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:41.900]   - Wow.
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.660]   - I kinda like the anti-bin thing here.
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.420]   This one made me laugh a little bit.
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.980]   Do you remember Garth Brooks,
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.300]   I think I've told you this before,
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.340]   was the greatest selling album musician of all the '90s,
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.180]   which is very surprising.
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.380]   - I remember that from the Chuck Klosterman book,
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.900]   which still boggles my mind.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:56.740]   - But do you remember,
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.940]   I think he was at the height of his powers,
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.220]   it was like 1998 or 1999,
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.460]   and he did this,
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:05.100]   he tried to have a rock star persona of Christopher Gaines.
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.600]   John, show this up here.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.440]   This is when Garth,
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.880]   he did the little mini goatee thing,
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.960]   and he put a wig on and had his hair go over his eyes,
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.440]   and he looked a little goth,
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.960]   and he changed into Chris Gaines,
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.400]   and everyone's kinda like, "Wait, what?"
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.720]   And this was his rock star persona.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.280]   So I'm thinking maybe I should do that as the anti-bin,
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.680]   and this is my Doomer personality,
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.480]   where I have some sort of anti-bin
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.720]   who's always glass and full optimistic,
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.520]   and I think of it like his name was Chris Gaines,
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.800]   I could be Chris Loss, right?
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.740]   Or Chris Bear, something like that.
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:37.860]   - I'm liking it a lot.
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.940]   - I turn into a perma-bear, I don't know, once a week.
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:40.860]   It'd just be fun to try,
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.400]   like the dollar is going to crash,
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.220]   there's flames all around me,
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.260]   and the United States financial system, as we know it,
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.620]   is over, hyperinflation is coming.
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.460]   I'm gonna try it.
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.220]   - I think I would pay money to see this,
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.060]   so I think this is something I need to do.
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.220]   - I'll start a newsletter, just full-time perma-bear.
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.140]   Okay, maybe not.
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.500]   But this is what makes the market, I guess.
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.460]   This person is anti-bin.
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.220]   I appreciate that, if that's your natural inclination,
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.720]   that's fine, whatever works for you.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.220]   Maybe the stock market is pricing in Fed cuts,
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.060]   'cause it is forward-looking, after all.
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.800]   That's what people like to say.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.880]   I do like to look at historical market returns
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.800]   to think about something like this,
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.340]   'cause I think what this person is asking is,
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.500]   okay, sure, the market is up 20% this year,
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.860]   but what happens after a year is up 20%?
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.640]   So I like to look at this.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.540]   One of my favorite all-time stats of the market
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.540]   is the fact that over the past 100 years or so,
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.700]   you've been more likely to see a 20% gain
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.780]   in a calendar year than a loss.
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:33.420]   So not including this year, there's been 34 gains of 20%.
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.700]   This is them on the screen right now.
[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.740]   There's only been 26 total down years.
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.800]   Okay, so what happens the year after a 20% or more gain,
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.900]   going back to 1928?
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.200]   You can see there's way more green on this screen
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.040]   than there is red.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.580]   So John, keep this up here for a second,
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:47.740]   and I'm gonna go through the stats.
[00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:52.580]   So 22 out of the 34 years that we experienced a 20% gain,
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.580]   the next year was also a gain.
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.480]   So that's 65% of the time.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.500]   Stock market was down 12 out of 34 years.
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.620]   That's 35% of the time.
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.200]   The average return was roughly 9%.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.180]   Average gain when the market was up was 19%.
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.260]   The average loss was 9%.
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.860]   There was 19 double-digit up years following a 20% gain.
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.300]   You remember the late '90s?
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.340]   It was 1995 to 1999.
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.300]   Every single one of those years was a 20% gain.
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.060]   That's probably part of this.
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.920]   There were just two double-digit down years
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.180]   following a 20% gain.
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.580]   One of them was in 2022.
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:27.260]   So 2021 was a big, I think we were up 28 or 29%.
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.820]   We were down pretty big the next year.
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:34.720]   So we are teetering on the edge of a 20% gain this year.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.160]   We'll see if Santa comes through by the end of the year
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.960]   or not and hold onto it, but you can do the chart off, John.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.960]   So the returns after a 20% up year
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.120]   are actually pretty decent, and I guess kind of average,
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.000]   if you wanna look at it.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.760]   There's actually a few more losses in there than gains.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.140]   So the other question is,
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.480]   does one year really impact the next year?
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.480]   Like, is there a correlation there?
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.120]   So John, throw up my next chart.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.640]   I looked at the average return from one year to the next
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.520]   when stocks are up, when stocks are down.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.320]   When stocks are up big, so call it 15% or more.
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.800]   And then when stocks are down big,
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.160]   call it a loss of 15% or worse.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.320]   And the average returns are all 10, 11, 12%.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.520]   So there's really not much signal here.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.280]   There's more, you know, one year doesn't impact the next.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.060]   I'm sure you could slice and dice the data a little bit
[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.360]   and try to find something in there,
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.460]   but that's mostly data mining probably.
[00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.840]   So it's certainly possible
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.080]   that we're pulling forward 2024 returns
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:30.960]   'cause the Fed is gonna cut
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.760]   and the stock market is getting ahead of it.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.680]   But I just think you can't really be smart enough to say,
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.080]   just because the stock market's up this year
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.920]   means it's gonna be down next year.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.040]   And we're gonna see a Chris Gaines phenomenon
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.240]   where anti-Benn is going to be right.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.200]   I think the thing to remember
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.560]   about historical return numbers
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.960]   is that they're helpful to set expectations,
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.080]   but it's also true that things
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.920]   that have never happened before in the stock market
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.720]   seem to happen all the time.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.960]   So I think it's just important to prepare yourself
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.560]   for a wide range of outcomes.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:00.400]   That's my whole thinking
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.520]   with looking at returns like that
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.320]   is there's a lot of big up years
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.560]   and there's a handful of down years
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.960]   and that's the best I can do for you
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.160]   is most of the time the stock market goes up,
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.120]   but sometimes it goes down.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.120]   - Do you think perma bears always pick the underdog?
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.080]   Like if the Panthers are playing the Ravens,
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.360]   are they going Panthers?
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.040]   Like are they, is that in their just nature?
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.160]   - I mean, I've basically been a perma bear my whole life
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.360]   if I'm rooting for the Lions then, right?
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.400]   - Okay, so when it comes to sports, you're a perma bear.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.840]   - I guess I had to be.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.880]   - All right, good.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.920]   I'd like a little pushback.
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.120]   That's a fair question.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.240]   Let's do another one.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.320]   - Hey, up next we have a question from John.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.340]   Before 2022, I was adamant about not paying off my mortgage.
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.440]   I thought it was a mistake to pay off my previous home
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.920]   in a low rate environment,
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.160]   but now with nearly 8% interest rates
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.960]   and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in effect,
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.640]   I've had a change of heart.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.200]   The higher interest rate makes each payment more costly
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.760]   and I doubt I can consistently be 8% returns
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.480]   on investments.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.120]   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.240]   especially for folks in high tax states like me,
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.120]   pushes us towards the standard deduction
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.460]   instead of itemizing,
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.360]   making the mortgage tax deduction less beneficial.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.360]   I'm curious to hear Bill Sweet's thoughts on all of this.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.120]   When you ask for Bill Sweet.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.640]   - Ask and you shall receive.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.400]   Bill gets called out by name here a lot.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.120]   Bill, I think this email was actually came to my inbox
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.520]   and it was, I wrote a blog post a couple of weeks ago
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.980]   saying that I'm just not a big fan
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.600]   of paying off a mortgage early.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.720]   It's tax advantaged.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.880]   It's a good inflation hedge.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.440]   What do you think in terms of the tax part of it here?
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.240]   'Cause a lot of this seems to make sense to me.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.360]   - Yeah, Ben, you're a homeowner and John,
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.640]   I mean, great, great thought.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.720]   Really, John's question has to do with tax deductions
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.120]   rather than mortgage interest.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.480]   And Ben, I find that mortgage interest deductions
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.280]   for tax purposes, they're generally overrated
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.120]   and John kind of alluded to why in the question.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.320]   So I wanna talk through a little bit of how it works
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.200]   to kind of set the table.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.520]   John, can we throw the chart up
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.360]   that we slapped together before the show?
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.840]   So let's start from left to right here.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:07.400]   For those at home, the 2017 standard deduction was $12,000.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.640]   This year, that's gonna come in
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.760]   for married filing joint couples at $27,000.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.000]   And what that means is in order to realize
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.440]   any tax deductions relating to mortgage interest
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.480]   or property taxes or the like,
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.360]   you need to exceed that hurdle.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.840]   And so due to that Trump era tax cut
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.480]   that happened back in 2017,
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.520]   the hurdle's just much higher today
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.160]   than it was at any time in recent history.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.960]   And to illustrate why on the right side,
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.200]   I say, look, if we're capped at the $10,000
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.820]   state and local tax deduction,
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.160]   we would need to deduct more than about $13,000,
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.200]   $24,000 to $23,000 of mortgage interest
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.400]   in order to exceed that standard deduction threshold.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.240]   In other words, for this example I've illustrated here,
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.340]   you're paying $24,000 of mortgage interest,
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.980]   which at 8%, that's a $300,000 loan.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.300]   You're only able to deduct the last $6,000
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.600]   of mortgage interest.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.360]   And to put that into terms, John, can we kill the chart?
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.940]   To put that into dollar amounts,
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.840]   that's only worth about $2,000.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.860]   So Ben, what John's getting at is,
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:10.220]   I'm gonna borrow 300K and pay $24,000 to do that,
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.100]   and I really only get a $2,000 tax break for it, right?
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.340]   So this is the SALT thing,
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.940]   especially people on the coast complain about,
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:16.940]   people with high incomes.
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.420]   What does SALT stand for again?
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.100]   - State and local tax deduction.
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.300]   Yeah, throw it up on the whiteboard behind me.
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:26.540]   - Okay, but so let's say this thing runs up
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:27.940]   and that comes back into play.
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.500]   Is it a better deal then?
[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.440]   - Yes, on a relative basis, right?
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.580]   Because ultimately,
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.440]   everybody gets a standard deduction for free.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.420]   You don't have to do anything
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.020]   to earn that standard deduction.
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.600]   So it would increase the relative tax deduction
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.460]   of the mortgage interest,
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.980]   but you're still paying that money out of pocket.
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.300]   Like, I guess that's the issue.
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.060]   And just to frame it again in terms of percentages,
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.020]   we have an 8% pre-tax mortgage rate, Ben.
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.980]   If we include that $2,000 of tax reduction,
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.420]   what that's worth when you actually do the math,
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.380]   that only decreases the mortgage rate to 7.3%, right?
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.220]   So you're still paying after taxes 7.3%.
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.540]   Ben, to answer your question,
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.160]   that would drop the effective mortgage rate
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.480]   to about 6.8, 6.7%.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.140]   But you're still paying after taxes
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.460]   that amount to borrow money.
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.160]   And relative to what you can get in a,
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.780]   let's say a bond fund, a treasury fund,
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.200]   or some compounding gains,
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.620]   yeah, I don't think it's as worth it as it was before,
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.180]   and the taxes are definitely part of that.
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.300]   - So my thinking was,
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.220]   I was talking more about the 80% of people
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.700]   who have a mortgage have a rate 4% or below.
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.220]   And I thought for those people,
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.140]   I can't see a world where that makes sense.
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.380]   But if you're having a 7% or 8% hurdle,
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.300]   now that makes more sense to me
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.660]   because it's a bigger hurdle.
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.480]   However, how much benefit are you really gonna get?
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.640]   Because if you have a 7% or 8% mortgage,
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.940]   aren't you hoping to refinance at 5% or 6%
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:42.760]   in the coming years?
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.700]   So if you're paying it off early now,
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:46.980]   are you really gonna get that big of a benefit
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.420]   if you're just going to refinance anyway?
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.100]   I mean, I guess it's kind of the idea
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.580]   of making a bigger down payment now for that.
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.580]   But I can see the benefit if you have a 7% or 8%
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.940]   over 30 years, the life of the loan,
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.460]   but what if you're gonna have it for two years
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.380]   and you're gonna refinance at six in a couple years?
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.660]   Does it still make sense to repay it early?
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.500]   That's where I think you can kind of think through like,
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.620]   oh, well, maybe it doesn't.
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:08.860]   - Yep, and so fair point.
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.540]   So I think Ben, the way to actually solve the equation,
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:12.960]   again, like a mortgage, typically,
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.680]   you're looking at 15 to 30 years.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.600]   So yes, you can refinance, yes, you can move,
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.760]   but what do you know what you're refinancing to?
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.240]   I think it comes down to arbitrage.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.160]   What can I earn on my cash or short-term investments
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.440]   in the market relative to what am I paying?
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.120]   And I think you do have to do the tax math
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.200]   on either side to get an actual answer.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.440]   And right now it favors paying down that mortgage
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.960]   if you're, I'd say above 6%, 7%.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.800]   - And what's your, not only the investment hurdle,
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.520]   what's your liquidity profile?
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.000]   Because putting that money into a mortgage
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.940]   means liquidity is drained and you're not gonna see it
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:46.100]   versus you could say, I can earn 5% in T-bills right now,
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.900]   but I get 8% in the mortgage if I'm paying it off,
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.800]   but that 5% gives me more flexibility and more optionality.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.640]   And that could be,
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.740]   so I think that's what you have to weigh as well.
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.380]   How much liquidity and flexibility
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.220]   do you have in your finances?
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.180]   - Precisely, and so for my 15-year career, Ben,
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.380]   I usually have not been in favor of paying the mortgage off,
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.620]   but the math changed a lot this year.
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:03.860]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.100]   Looking at a 7% or 8% mortgage,
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.660]   I would be thinking much harder
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.060]   about making a bigger down payment
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.120]   or making bigger payments.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.660]   - Amen, you've got it.
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:12.500]   - All right.
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.720]   - Sorry, guys, I zoned out there for a second.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.760]   I'm of the generation who can only dream
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.060]   of owning a home at some point, so.
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.520]   - I was gonna say, what's anti-Duncan doing these days?
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.760]   Duncan, what's your alter ego?
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.320]   Does he eat pork and ribs and fry steak?
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.720]   Like, what does this dude do?
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.720]   - Probably, like heavily, heavily into fossil fuels.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.560]   Yeah, something like that.
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.080]   - He's buying a stock that trades on real milk instead of--
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.280]   - Drives a Ford F-350?
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.360]   - Yeah, rolling coal in a dually or something, yeah.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.520]   - Drinks milk directly from the cow's udder.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.820]   - Yeah, there you go.
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.260]   - All right, next question.
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:43.280]   - All right, up next we have a question from Wade.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.820]   I recently retired in my 50s,
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.820]   and while 80% of my portfolio is in index funds,
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:52.280]   I have a substantial amount tied up in Microsoft from RSUs.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.760]   You guys will have to remind me what that stands for.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.620]   This position now accounts for almost 15%
[00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:57.820]   of my total portfolio
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:01.320]   and a hefty 30% of my after-tax assets.
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.160]   It's a great company,
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.940]   but even great companies face challenges,
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:06.660]   and I'm concerned about having too much in one stock.
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.200]   The long-term capital gains on this position
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.820]   are substantial due to my low-cost basis of $60 a share.
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.560]   Wow, not to brag.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.260]   I've been gradually selling and diversifying into ETFs,
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.840]   but the stock keeps rebounding,
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.520]   leading to an overweight position.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.440]   I'm considering holding it long-term for heirs
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.120]   with a stepped-up basis or donating it to charity,
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.060]   but I'd like to hear your suggestions.
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.400]   - John, real quick, first of all,
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.360]   congrats to Wade for retiring in his early 50s.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.320]   I guess that Microsoft stock paid off pretty well.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.680]   John, show up the chart.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.520]   Microsoft actually hit new all-time highs recently.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.600]   The stock market is still close.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.700]   Microsoft was there.
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:39.540]   - Amazing.
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:40.720]   - So he said he's got a $60 cost basis,
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.520]   and he's at $370 for Microsoft stocks, so not bad.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.360]   One of the--
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.120]   - $300 per share of capital gains, yeah.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:47.960]   That's great.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.780]   - That's pretty good.
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.840]   - One of the two biggest stocks that there is.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.000]   So it sounds like he made off pretty well here.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.220]   I guess, first of all, 15% doesn't sound egregious to me.
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.040]   We've heard way higher numbers than that.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:01.960]   We've heard people come to us with 90% of their net worth,
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.780]   liquid net worth in their company stock.
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.360]   So 15% doesn't sound terrible to me,
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.320]   but it sounds like he is just worried
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.000]   that that's still a big chunk,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.640]   especially if you had index funds.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.280]   Microsoft is the second largest company,
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.280]   so you already had exposure there as well.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.800]   So maybe you don't want to overexpose yourself.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.160]   So what are the options here?
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.320]   'Cause it sounds like he's up for anything.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.120]   - Yeah, and so Wade, I mean, first off, Ben,
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.520]   like you mentioned, Wade's kind of built his portfolio
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.960]   around this position.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.160]   I think that's the intelligent thing.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.720]   Wade's done a lot, I think, to kind of help with this.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.180]   But the reality has been, as far as index funds,
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.560]   Microsoft makes up 7% of the S&P 500 index today
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.400]   and 10% of the NASDAQ composite.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.480]   And so it's not just the stock that he owns directly,
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.960]   but if you own an index passive weighted portfolio,
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.180]   you own more.
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.020]   But again, Wade, you've done--
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.760]   - Also, Duncan, sorry, RSU, Restricted Stock Unit.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:49.600]   - Yeah.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.560]   - Yeah, actually, Wade's in the chat.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.160]   Wade just answered my question.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.000]   - He answered your question.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.560]   Wow, a listener question.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.280]   Wade's gonna answer your question, Duncan,
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.120]   during the show today.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.760]   - For the record, that was gonna be my guess.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.580]   - Great, great, yeah.
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:00.420]   - I just couldn't remember
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.560]   if it was restricted or registered.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.740]   - Yeah, so he got paid in company stock.
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.180]   And again, that worked out tremendously.
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.180]   And congrats, Wade.
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:08.400]   'Cause ultimately, this is what victory looks like, Ben.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.460]   I mean, this is what you would want
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:10.500]   your portfolio to look like.
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.200]   These are problems that I want to have, right?
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.340]   - The other side of the equation is,
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:17.700]   I had 15% in this stock, and it crashed, and now it's 3%.
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:21.020]   - Yeah, and there's that famous Reddit post of ExxonMobil.
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.600]   You can go through the names of companies
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.740]   that were the largest, Kodak, Eastman, et cetera.
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.780]   So I think this would be my order of operations
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:29.900]   for Wade in the chat.
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.160]   Number one, I would decide
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.560]   what percentage are you comfortable with,
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.080]   and let that be your North Star,
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.040]   and let that be the thing that you're building towards.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.960]   And if that's 10%, I think that's completely reasonable.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.000]   To your point, Ben, 15% doesn't sound that crazy to me.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.200]   So I don't think you're far away
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.880]   from what I would recommend.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.840]   Now, and that might be 5% though.
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:47.960]   You might not want to take on that risk
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:48.920]   going into retirement.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.100]   I think you'd have to sit down,
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.080]   maybe with a competent certified financial planner
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.200]   at Real Wholesale Wealth Management,
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.960]   or otherwise, I'm a company man, and whittle that down.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.840]   So that brings us to number two.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.520]   How do you start to whittle this thing down?
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.140]   Wade kind of hit, for me, the number one option,
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.100]   and he mentioned it in his question,
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.040]   which is charitable donations.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.880]   Ben, a donation to a donor advised fund in property,
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.080]   you do not have to pay the capital gain on the transaction.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.840]   So Wade would say for each share he donates,
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.440]   he's saving $300 of capital gains income,
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.800]   and that probably translates to $600 of tax.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.880]   However, you also get to take a deduction
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.000]   at the market value.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.920]   And so at $370 a share,
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.680]   he's able to not only avoid capital gains,
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.340]   but then he gets the deduction too.
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.120]   So just hypothetically, if he's paying,
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.120]   if he donates $10,000, let's say,
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.440]   he would avoid a $2,000 capital gains tax,
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.320]   and he would get a $3,000 tax deduction.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.160]   So $10,000--
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.240]   It's like a double whammy,
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.800]   avoiding paying taxes and saving taxes.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.520]   Double benefit, I wouldn't even call it a whammy, Ben.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.840]   Yeah, double whammy.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.820]   It's like a double boost.
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.560]   But to think about it conceptually,
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.800]   Wade would donate $5,000 after taxes, right,
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.560]   to be 10K on the transaction,
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.000]   but after the tax benefits,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.240]   he'd still have 5K net market value,
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.400]   but the charity would get the full $10,000.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.640]   So it's basically a way to turn 5,000 into 10
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.480]   for the charity.
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.340]   I think that's a great way to play the game.
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.300]   And the way I would do that, Wade, is bunch.
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.220]   So if you're gonna think forward,
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:08.520]   bunch all your charitable projections,
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.300]   the money you're gonna give to your church,
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.100]   to your charity, to the local library,
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.540]   do that all for five years.
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:14.500]   Do it in one tax year.
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.660]   Take all that tax deduction up front.
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.700]   Once the transaction occurs through donor-advised fund,
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.780]   you can sell that position capital gains tax-free
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.620]   and effectively rebalance that portfolio
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.780]   with now a large charitable component.
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.300]   Now, what if Wade is not Mother Teresa
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.940]   and doesn't wanna just give away his wealth?
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:28.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:29.600]   Yeah, so totally.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.440]   So Wade might need it.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.420]   And so I think that the next thing for me would be,
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.540]   again, over time, to look for ways
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.180]   to offset gains with losses.
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:40.220]   So Wade mentions he's running an index-based portfolio.
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.060]   I would probably-
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.640]   How about 10% of your portfolio, let Duncan manage it.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.900]   (laughing)
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.680]   I'll add in some tax loss.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.780]   Put it in a not-cow stocks.
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.940]   Yeah, and then, but ultimately, yeah,
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.100]   I would seek ways to potentially realize
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.620]   some capital losses, right,
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.660]   and offset those gains with losses over time.
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.060]   And again, if he's at 15,
[00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.020]   and he said he'd make a target of 10%,
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.180]   over the next three tax years,
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.580]   Wade mentioned he's thinking about retirement,
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.300]   so income should be lower today
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.580]   than maybe it was two years ago, three years ago.
[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.280]   Begin to whittle that down in chunks, right?
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.180]   So you don't have to do it all in one year,
[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.620]   but in January, realize a bunch of capital gains
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.700]   and then seek opportunities with that capital
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:19.460]   that you reinvested to look for tax losses
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.320]   throughout the rest of the year.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.540]   That's probably the game to play.
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:22.960]   And look, if the markets go up
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.420]   and you don't get those tax losses,
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.340]   again, you won the game then twice, Wade.
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.820]   So, and for me, Ben, if you won the game,
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:30.500]   it's time to stop playing.
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.540]   - Right, and you always say, like,
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:35.140]   listen, it's no fun to pay those taxes,
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.500]   but it also means that you won.
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.140]   It's better than the alternative.
[00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:41.260]   So if he wants it or needs to use it or whatever,
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.660]   and he actually said in the chat here,
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.100]   he's looking for a 10% overall target.
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.900]   So take it down five more percent.
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.980]   So if you have to pay those taxes, that's also paid.
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.860]   So you could do a combination there too.
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:50.820]   You could give some to charity.
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.540]   You could sell some of them off to lock in the gains
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:54.380]   to more diversify. - Exactly.
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:58.620]   - He also says his main holding is BTI.
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.860]   Is there an easy way for people to be able to see
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:03.180]   the overlap and like what their actual percentage
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.100]   of a holding like that? - Just Vanguard.com.
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.060]   I mean, yeah, that would be it for me.
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.580]   - But I mean, to see your portfolio
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:10.740]   and see across all of your ETF holdings
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:11.740]   and your single stock. - Yeah, portfolio.
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.980]   X-Ray Morningstar had a product a couple of years ago
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.260]   that was free for subscribers. - Yeah, there's a few
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:16.620]   free stuff that you can do there.
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:17.980]   - The other thing, and again, I'm a company man,
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:18.820]   so I need to mention this,
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.880]   but there are companies that'll do tax-less harvesting
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.720]   for you, right?
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.900]   So Ritholtz Wealth Management,
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:25.480]   we have a partnership with O'Shaughnessy Asset Management
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.460]   at Canvas.
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.720]   We run, I mean, my portfolio is at Liftoff,
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.420]   which is a Ritholtz Wealth platform
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.380]   that's run through Betterment.
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.540]   And tax loss has happened while I sleep
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.180]   for my portfolio. - Hold that thought.
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.840]   Next question is right on this.
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:37.680]   That's a cool transition. - Let's do it.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.940]   - Bill says Ritholtz Wealth Management.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.060]   One more time, he turns into a pumpkin.
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:42.380]   - I'm a company man, though. - All right, next question,
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:45.160]   and we'll talk a little bit about this other option
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.060]   of direct investing.
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:46.900]   So let's do it. - Let's do it.
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.740]   - Last but not least, we have a question from Sam.
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.940]   I'm 38 and have $175,000 in a brokerage account,
[00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:55.400]   mostly in U.S. large-cap index funds.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.260]   My federal tax rate is close to 35%.
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.760]   An advisor suggested an SMA that does tax-less harvesting
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.180]   to boost returns while being tax-efficient.
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:06.720]   Is this a good idea?
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.540]   Can it consistently outperform the market
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.060]   after accounting for taxes?
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:14.100]   The fees are 10 to 15 times higher than low-cost ETFs,
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:17.620]   but I'm tempted if it can help my long-term savings.
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:19.780]   What do you think about this strategy?
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:21.360]   - Okay, so the fees sound high,
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.200]   but VTI is three basis points,
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.780]   so we're talking 30 to 45 basis points,
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:26.620]   whatever, for this SMA.
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:27.580]   - Also, sorry to interrupt,
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.900]   but that's a separately managed account, right?
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.380]   I hear this term thrown around a lot.
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.700]   What exactly does that mean, the cliff notes of that?
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.100]   - So it's like you're buying and selling
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.700]   the actual individual holdings yourself
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.780]   as opposed to buying an ETF for a mutual fund.
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.740]   So Bill mentioned, we do direct indexing,
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.620]   and one of the reasons we do it for
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.860]   is people who have a large position with a gain,
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:46.940]   and then what you do is you turn up
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.260]   the dial on tax-loss harvesting
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.100]   to try to offset some of those gains,
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.740]   and you can't always do it one for one,
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.620]   but that's the goal.
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.920]   And then so the question is,
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.820]   for Sam here who asked the question,
[00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.900]   is it worth it to pay higher fees?
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.540]   Does the tax-loss harvesting piece
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:06.260]   more than make up for those higher fees?
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.460]   So for people who aren't aware,
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.700]   direct indexing is essentially,
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.500]   instead of buying an S&P 500 index fund,
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.100]   an SPY or VTI, that sort of thing,
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.740]   from iShares or Vanguard or Charles Schwab,
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.740]   I'm gonna have this company buy all 500 stocks for me
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.060]   in proportion to the way that they are,
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.720]   and they can also do some tax-loss harvesting
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.500]   'cause in that 500 mix,
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.100]   some of those stocks are gonna go down each year,
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.460]   and we're gonna sell off the losers
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.140]   to lock in those gains as losses,
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:34.180]   and that's how tax-loss harvesting works.
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:36.820]   - Yep, precisely. - What did I miss, Bill?
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.300]   - Yeah, that's it, and that did directly bend your point.
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.500]   We segued directly in this from Wade's question.
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:43.020]   This is one way to potentially solve
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.700]   a concentrated position,
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.540]   and that if you have an algorithm
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:49.580]   that's trading to mimic an index for you,
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:50.980]   you can effectively set the dials
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.740]   such that you can lock your capital gains.
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:53.940]   You can tell the algorithm
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.580]   what you want your capital gains to be,
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.700]   and it'll figure it out over the course of a year
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.540]   if you give it enough time. - Right, you're essentially
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:00.620]   creating a customized index fund
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.700]   with a tax-loss harvesting piece on top of it.
[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.260]   - Yep, so yeah, I think concentrated positions
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.340]   make a lot of sense.
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.180]   If there's a lot of capital gains activity,
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:09.940]   let's say, elsewhere in your portfolio,
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:11.140]   if you're a real estate manager
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:12.980]   or you're buying and selling properties,
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.100]   there's sometimes a lot of gains,
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.420]   depreciation, recapture going out there.
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.180]   And I guess the question,
[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.660]   can a strategy outperform is unanswerable, right?
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.980]   A lot of strategies outperform,
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.700]   a lot of strategies underperform a baseline index.
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.700]   I think for us, Ben, kind of our philosophy is,
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.460]   don't make things too complex, right?
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:34.540]   And so most of our exposure is index-based.
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:35.700]   I think that's the way to go.
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.260]   However, O'Shaughnessy, other companies,
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.540]   they do have specialties,
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:41.340]   and so they might factor weight is a great example
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.660]   to get a little bit of active passive exposure.
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:44.660]   And that does help a lot.
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:46.460]   Another really neat application
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.340]   of directing indexing through an SMA
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.260]   is you can effectively screen out portfolios.
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:53.020]   So in our example, you would not, for Wade,
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.100]   in the previous question,
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.300]   buy additional Microsoft stock, right?
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.580]   So instead of shorting it or some other instrument,
[00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:00.500]   you just use the direct index.
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.620]   And Canvas, the name says it all.
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:03.500]   It's a blank Canvas.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:04.980]   And so you can paint the picture--
[00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:05.940]   - And you can basically X out.
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.780]   I want S&B 500 X Microsoft, if you want it.
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.700]   The other thing is, what I wanna ask here for Sam
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.860]   is what are the cases where, okay,
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.060]   'cause a lot of people come to us
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.540]   who have complicated tax pictures
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:16.380]   or state planning or whatever,
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.060]   and Canvas makes a lot of sense to them.
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.420]   When does this type of strategy not make sense?
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:22.900]   Is there a tax rate or an amount of money?
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:23.740]   Where do you go?
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:26.180]   You know what, it's not worth the hassle.
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.620]   - Yeah, I think one big thing that comes to mind, Ben,
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.740]   if most of your assets are in tax-qualified accounts,
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:31.780]   like you're not gonna get any benefit
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:32.780]   from tax-less harvesting.
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.260]   You would get benefits from factor weighting
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.980]   and other methodologies.
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:38.500]   But yeah, investing is more or less a problem
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:39.540]   that's been solved,
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:41.700]   specifically through the vanguardization,
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.500]   lower-cost active exposure.
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.340]   So I think the other primary factor
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:48.500]   would simply be a lower-asset portfolio, right?
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.420]   So if and when, until we have fractional shares available,
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:52.740]   you know, buying a share of Microsoft,
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:53.900]   as we discussed in the last question,
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.420]   is going to cost you $370.
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:58.100]   So to replicate that for a $10,000 portfolio
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:59.500]   is nearly impossible.
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.780]   So that's why fractionalization does occur
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:03.340]   with ETFs and other accounts.
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.220]   But yeah, for me, it's a cost-benefit.
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.900]   Are the benefits I'm gonna get
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:09.300]   from tax-less harvesting and other factors,
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:12.020]   are those gonna outweigh the additional cost
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:15.220]   that Sam lays out, that I'm gonna pay a manager
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:16.260]   to manage this for me?
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.180]   And again, I think that typically happens, Ben,
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:19.220]   at higher tax rates.
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.700]   So we're talking higher-income folks
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:21.980]   and higher dollar amounts.
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:22.820]   Fortunately or unfortunately.
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.100]   - So him, in this question,
[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:26.260]   he said we're up near the 35% range.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.540]   That's probably a pretty good candidate
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.380]   for tax-less harvesting.
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:30.100]   - I would think so, especially if he's in a high-tech state
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.660]   like our guy, John, in the first question, right?
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:34.900]   So unfortunately, it depends.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.540]   But that's the sketch that I'd play.
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:38.740]   And again, I can't say it more strongly.
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.260]   Like, we are playing this game for our clients.
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.900]   So we do think that there's a lot of value here.
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.300]   - And I think this, the hard thing for a lot of people
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:45.620]   who are retail investors is,
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:48.140]   this is really more of a financial planning tool
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.260]   than it is an investment tool.
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:50.260]   It can help with investing,
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.540]   but I think you need someone helping you with it
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:53.740]   who knows what they're doing.
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.540]   Because it'd be hard to do something like this on your own
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.140]   and know when to turn that dial up and turn it down,
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.660]   depending on your tax situation.
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.940]   It's financial planning software,
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.380]   even though it's really applied to investments.
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.540]   - Just to give our guys on the team a big shout out,
[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:08.340]   Patrick Haley, Dylan Klonder, Alex Messer, Nick Gomes,
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.020]   the folks that put this together for us on our company,
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.420]   they're the ones who implement this.
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:14.820]   And what we learned over the last three, four years
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.780]   of working with Canvas, looking at our Shaughnessy,
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:18.580]   a lot of work has to go in upfront to get this right,
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:20.100]   to fine tune all the dials.
[00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.780]   And it does take that amount of expertise.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.940]   And so some advice is worth paying for, in my opinion.
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.540]   - Right, it's run by an algorithm,
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.380]   but there's a lot of heavy lifting manual labor
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.060]   that's done upfront to make sure that algorithm
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:30.020]   is doing what you want it to do.
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.460]   - I'm not gonna say the company we work for again,
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.300]   'cause Duncan will jump out of a New York City window,
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.100]   but you know what I'm talking about.
[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.860]   - Everyone knows, everyone knows.
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:40.620]   Speaking of algorithms, though,
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:43.660]   you just made me think of something John was just telling,
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:46.100]   John, our chart on John was just telling us
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.220]   about the other day.
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:51.020]   He went somewhere in New York City that has coffee
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.140]   that's served by a robot.
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:56.220]   And I jokingly asked, did it ask for a tip?
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:58.140]   And he was like, yes, actually.
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:00.460]   On the screen, it asked if I wanted a tip.
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:01.820]   What part of the economy, you know,
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.100]   like what part of the cycle are we at
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.460]   when we have robots asking for tips
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.660]   and people giving them, apparently?
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:10.420]   - I mean, Robert Cialdini is gonna be running these things
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.140]   and people are gonna be just handing their money over.
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.460]   - I'm not tipping a Keurig, Duncan,
[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:14.420]   if that's where you're going.
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:17.380]   Like, that coffee tastes like ass, so I'm not doing it.
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.580]   - Well, this wasn't that.
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.140]   This was like an actual robotic arm
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:21.260]   that like moved the cup over
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:22.940]   and put it down on the counter for him and stuff.
[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:23.780]   It was kind of cool.
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:24.860]   - If you don't drink coffee, you don't have to tip.
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:25.780]   That's my strategy.
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:28.100]   - Hey, those GPTs don't pay for themselves, you know.
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.500]   - It's true, that's true.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.380]   - All right, thanks as always
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.740]   to my personal tax consultant, Bill Sweet.
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:35.180]   - Got your back. - Appreciate it.
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:38.180]   Thanks to Duncan for sharing his portfolio once again.
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.700]   Oatly's gonna have a Santa Claus rally, Duncan.
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:40.940]   It's coming.
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:41.780]   - We'll see.
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:44.140]   - Remember, email us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:45.180]   Thanks to everyone in the live chat.
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.020]   That was nice.
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.780]   We had Wade in here listening to his own question today.
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.780]   That was fun.
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:51.620]   Subscribe, rate, review, all that kind of stuff.
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.140]   If you're watching on YouTube,

[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.540]   We always appreciate it.

[00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.700]   - Thank you. - See you, everyone.
