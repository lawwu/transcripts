[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   You can study chemistry, you can study physics, you can study geology, anywhere in the universe,
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.120]   but this is the only place you can study biology.
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.640]   This is the only place to be a biologist.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.400]   Earth.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.120]   That's it.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.620]   Yeah.
[00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.000]   So, definitely something very fundamental happened here, and you cannot take biology out of the equation.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.520]   If you want to understand how that vast chemistry space, how that general sequence space got narrowed down to what is available,
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:34.200]   or what is used by life, you need to understand the rules of selection, and that's where evolution and biology comes into play.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:42.320]   The following is a conversation with Batul Kachar, an astrobiologist at University of Wisconsin,
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.800]   studying the essential biological attributes of life.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.720]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.680]   To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.640]   And now, dear friends, here's Batul Kachar.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.280]   What is the phylogenetic tree, or the evolutionary tree of life,
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.840]   and what can we learn by running it back and studying ancient gene sequences as you have?
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:14.720]   I think phylogenetic trees could be one of the most romantic and beautiful notions that can come out of biology.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:22.400]   It shows us a way to depict the connectedness of life and all living beings with one another.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.240]   It itself is an ever-evolving notion.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.080]   Biologists like visualizations, they like these graphics, these diagrams, and tree of life is one of them.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.520]   So the tree starts at a common ancestor?
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.240]   It's actually the other way around. It starts from the branches.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.880]   It starts from the tip of the branch, actually.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.560]   And then, depending on what you collected to build the tree.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.960]   So depending on the branches, depending on what's on the tip of the branch,
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.760]   and I will explain what I mean,
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.080]   the root will be determined by what is really sitting on the tip of the branch of the tree.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.120]   So we could study the leaves of the tree by looking at what we have today,
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.920]   and then start to reverse engineer, start to move back in time to try to understand
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.000]   what the rest of the tree, what the roots of the tree look like.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.840]   Exactly. So the tree itself, by just taking a few steps back and looking at the entire tree itself,
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.080]   can give you an idea about the connectedness, the relatedness of the organisms,
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.640]   or whatever, again, you use to create your tree.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.560]   There are different ways, but in this case, I'm imagining entire diversity of life today
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.360]   is sitting on the tips of the branches of this tree.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.520]   And we look at biologists, look at the tree itself,
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.000]   we like to think of it as the topology of the tree,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.400]   to understand when certain organisms or their ancestry may have merged over time.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:01.920]   Depending on the tools you use, you might use this tree to then reconstruct the ancestors as well.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.800]   And so what are the different ways to do the reconstruction?
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:12.640]   So you can do that at the gene level, or you could do it at the higher complex biology level, right?
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.520]   So in which way have you approached this fascinating problem?
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.560]   We approached it in every way we can.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.560]   So it's the gene, could be protein, the product of the gene, or species,
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.480]   or could be even groups of species.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.760]   It totally depends on what you want to do with your tree.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.240]   If you want to understand certain past events,
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.600]   whether an organism exchanged a certain DNA with another one along the course of evolution,
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.880]   you can build your tree accordingly.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.960]   If you rather use the tree to reconstruct or resurrect ancient DNA, which is what we do,
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.680]   then in our case, for instance, we do both gene, protein, and species,
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.400]   because we want to compare the tree that we create using these different information.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.760]   - Okay, well, let me ask you the ridiculous question then.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.240]   So how realistic is Jurassic Park?
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.360]   Can we study the genes of ancient organisms, and can we bring those ancient organisms back?
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.640]   So the reason I ask that kind of ridiculous sounding question is
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.280]   maybe it gives us context of what we can and can't do by looking back in time.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.600]   - Yeah, so dinosaurs or all these mammals, at least for us,
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:36.320]   is the exciting thing already happened by the time we hit to larger organisms or to eukaryotes.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.000]   - Or to you, the fun stuff is before we got to the mammals?
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.640]   - The fun stuff is what people think is boring, I think.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.560]   The phase that's, well, there's two different times in the geologic history.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:53.600]   One is the first life, past origin of life, how did first life look like?
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.280]   And the second is why do we think that over certain periods of geologic time,
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.640]   no significant innovation happened to the degree of leaving no record behind?
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.000]   So what do we not have a record of?
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.920]   Which part?
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.040]   So you say, the fun stuff to you is after the origin of life,
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.000]   which we'll talk about, after the origin of life, there's single cell organisms,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.920]   the whole thing with the photosynthesis,
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.600]   the whole thing with the eukaryotes and multicellular organisms,
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.160]   and what else is the fun stuff?
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.320]   The whole oxygen thing, which mixes in with the origin of life.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.720]   There's a bunch of different inventions,
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.200]   all they have to do with this primitive kind of looking organisms.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.200]   That we don't have a good record of.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.680]   So I will tell you the more interesting things for us.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.800]   One is the origin of life or what happened following the emergence of life.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.360]   How did the first cells look like?
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.200]   And then pretty much anything that we think shaped the environments
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.600]   and was shaped by the environments in a way that impacted the entire planet
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.400]   that enabled you and I to have this conversation.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.320]   We have very little understanding of the biological innovations
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.560]   that took place in the past of this planet.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.200]   We work with a very limited set of,
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.440]   I don't want to even say data because they are fossil records.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.800]   So let's say imprints, either that comes from the rock and the rock record itself,
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.120]   or what I just described, these trees that we create
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.720]   and whatever we can infer about the past.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.920]   So we have two distinct ways that comes from geology and biology
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.560]   and they each have their limitations.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.600]   - Okay, so, right, so there's an interplay.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.240]   The geology gives you that little bit of data
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.960]   and then the biology gives you that little bit of kind of constraints
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.480]   in the materials you get to work with to infer
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.480]   how does this result in the kind of data that we're seeing.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.360]   And now we can have this through the fog.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.080]   We can see, we can look back hundreds of millions of years,
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.680]   a couple of billion years and try to infer.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.160]   - Even further, and I like that you said fog.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.520]   It is pretty foggy, what we are, and it gets foggier and foggier
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.560]   the more you, the further you try to see into the past.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:23.440]   Biology is, you basically study the survivors, broadly speaking.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.360]   And you're trying to pitch the, sort of put together their history
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.360]   based on whatever you can recover today.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.040]   What makes biology fascinating also let it,
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.200]   it's erased its own history in a way, right?
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.720]   So you work with this 4 billion year product,
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.200]   that's genome, that's the DNA.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.200]   It's great, it's a very dynamic, ever evolving chemical thing.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.760]   And so you will get some information,
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.200]   but you're not gonna get much unless you know where to look
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.680]   because it is responding to the environment.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.520]   - Yeah, so what we have, that's fascinating.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.520]   What we have is the survivors, the successful organisms,
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.320]   even the primitive ones, even the bacteria we have today.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.240]   - So bacteria is not primitive and we--
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.720]   - Sorry, sorry to offend the bacteria.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.720]   - We should be very grateful to bacteria.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.800]   First of all, they are our great, great ancestors.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.440]   I like this quote by Douglas Adams,
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.000]   "Humans don't like their ancestors.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.200]   They rarely invite them over for dinner."
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.520]   - Yeah. - Right?
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.160]   But bacteria is in your dinner, bacteria is in your gut,
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.000]   bacteria is helping you along the way.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.080]   - So we do invite them for dinner.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.520]   - Well, they get themselves invited in a way.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.960]   And so we, and they're definitely older
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.880]   and definitely very sophisticated,
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.360]   very resilient than anything else.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.520]   As someone working at, as a bacteriologist,
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.800]   I feel like I need to defend them in this case
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.640]   because they don't get much shout out
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.480]   when we think about life.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.840]   - So you do study bacteria.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.800]   So which organisms gives you hints that are alive today
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.800]   that give you hints about what ancient organisms were like?
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.040]   Is it bacteria, is it viruses?
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.480]   What do you study in the lab?
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.560]   - We study a variety of different bacteria
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.720]   depending on the questions that we ask.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.040]   We engineer bacteria.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.120]   So ideally, we wanna work with bacteria
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.320]   that we can engineer.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.600]   Seldom we develop the tools to engineer them.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:31.080]   And it depends on the question that we are interested in.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.840]   If we are interested in connecting the biology and geology
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.560]   to understand the early life
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.560]   and fundamental innovations across billions of years,
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.480]   there are really good candidates like cyanobacteria.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:48.480]   So we use cyanobacteria very frequently in the lab.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.160]   We can engineer its genome.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.560]   We can perturb its function by poking its own DNA
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.720]   with the foreign DNA that we engineer in the lab.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.840]   We work with E. coli.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.480]   It's the most simple in terms of model systems goes.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.320]   Organism that one can study well-established,
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:14.120]   sort of a pet, lab pet that we use it a lot for cloning
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.520]   and for understanding basic functions of the cell
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.520]   given that it's really well studied.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.280]   - So, and what you do with that E. coli,
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.560]   you said that you inject it with foreign DNA?
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.480]   - We inject pretty much all the bacteria
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.440]   that we work with, with foreign DNA.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.200]   We also work with diazotrophs.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.360]   These are azotobacteria.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.640]   They're one of the prime nitrogen fixers,
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.120]   nitrogen-fixing bacteria.
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.240]   - Can you explain what that is, nitrogen-fixing?
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.640]   Is that, is the source of its energy?
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.720]   - So nitrogen is a triple-bond gas
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.240]   that's pretty abundant in the atmosphere.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.800]   But nitrogen itself cannot be directly utilized by cells
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.320]   given it is triple-bond.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.560]   It needs to be converted to ammonia
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:02.560]   that is then used for the downstream cellular functions.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.200]   - And that's what counts as nitrogen-fixing.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.280]   - Yes, so nitrogen needs to be fixed
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.800]   before our cells can make use of it.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.120]   And it's--
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.400]   - No offense to nitrogen either.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.520]   - Well, it's actually a very important element.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.320]   It's one of the most abundant elements on our planet
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.760]   that is used by biology.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.080]   It's in ATP, it's in chlorophyll
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.040]   that's uses, that relies on nitrogen.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.680]   So it's a very important enzyme
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.040]   for a lot of cell functions.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.800]   - And there's just one mechanism
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.920]   that evolution invented to convert it, to fix it.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.680]   - So far we know there's only one nitrogen-fixation pathway,
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.280]   as opposed to, say, carbon.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.160]   You can find up to seven or eight different carbon-based
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.360]   microbes invented to fix carbon.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.040]   That's not the case for nitrogen.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.280]   It's a singularity across geologic time.
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.840]   We think it evolved around 2.7, maybe,
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:04.600]   roughly three, probably less than three billion years ago.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.920]   And that's the only way that nature invented
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.760]   to fix the nitrogen in the atmosphere
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.480]   for the subsequent use.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.760]   - Would we still have life as we know it today
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.720]   if we didn't invent that nitrogen-fixing step?
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.360]   - I cannot think of it, no.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.320]   It's essential to life as we know.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.160]   You and I are having this conversation
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.760]   because life found a way to fix nitrogen.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.480]   - Is that one of the tougher ones?
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:34.480]   If you put it, sort of, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon,
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.160]   what are, in terms of being able to work
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.160]   with these elements, what is the hardest thing?
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.240]   What is the most essential for life?
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.240]   Just to give context.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.520]   - Well, we think of this as the cocktail.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.480]   You may hear schnapps. - What's in the cocktail?
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.640]   - It's the schnapps, right?
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.920]   Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.000]   So there are five elements that life relies on.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.680]   We don't quite know whether that's the only,
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.160]   out of many options, that life necessarily
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.280]   needs to operate on, but that's just how it happen
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.720]   on our own planet.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.600]   And there are many abiotic ways to fix nitrogen,
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.880]   like lightning, right?
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.560]   Lightning can accumulate ammonia.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.680]   Humans found a way about 100 years ago,
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.680]   I think around World War I, the Haber-Bosch process
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:34.000]   that we can abiotically convert nitrogen into ammonia.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.640]   Actually, 50% of the nitrogen in our bodies
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:42.640]   comes from the human conversion of nitrogen to ammonia.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.800]   It's helped, it's the fertilizer that we use,
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.360]   urea comes from that process.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.600]   It's in our food.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.000]   So we helped, we found a way to fix our own nitrogen
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.200]   for ourselves.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.760]   - Yeah, but that's way after the original invention
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.480]   of how to fix nitrogen. - Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.400]   - And without that, we wouldn't have all the steps
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.680]   of evolution along the way.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.760]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.800]   We tried to replicate in the most simplest way
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.200]   what nature has come up with, right?
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.520]   We do this by taking nitrogen, using a lot of pressure,
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.320]   and then generating ammonia.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.960]   Life does this in a more sophisticated way,
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.200]   relying on one single enzyme called nitrogenase.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.400]   It's the nitrogen that is used together
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:33.120]   with eight electron donor and ATP,
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.880]   together with a lot of hydrogen.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.880]   Life pushes this metabolism down to create fixed nitrogen.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.640]   It's quite remarkable.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.400]   - So the lab pet E. coli, inject them with DNA,
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.680]   so E. coli does nitrogen fixing in part,
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.200]   or is that a different one?
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.000]   - So some biological engineers engineered E. coli
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.760]   to fix nitrogen, I believe, not us.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.600]   We use nature's nitrogen fixing bug
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:07.400]   and engineer it with the nitrogen fixing metabolism
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.240]   that we resurrected using our computational
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.880]   and phylogenetic tools.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.920]   - How complicated are these little organisms?
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.280]   What are we talking about?
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.040]   - Depends on how we define complication.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:23.040]   - Okay, so I can tell that you appreciate
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.080]   and respect the full complexity
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.760]   of even the most seemingly primitive organisms,
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.480]   'cause none of them are primitive.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:36.120]   Okay, that said, what kind of, what are we talking about?
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:40.760]   How, what kind of machineries do they have
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.280]   that you're working with when you're injecting them with DNA?
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.960]   - So I will start with one of the most fascinating
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.280]   machineries that we target,
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.880]   which is the translation machinery.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.880]   It is a very unique subsystem of cellular life
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:01.200]   in comparison to, I would say, metabolism.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.040]   And we used to, you know,
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.440]   when we are thinking about cellular life,
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.280]   we think of cell as the basic unit,
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.040]   or the building block.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.840]   But from a key perspective, that's not the case.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.320]   That one may argue that everything that happens
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.920]   inside the cell serves the translation
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.680]   and the translation machinery.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.640]   There is a nice paper that called this,
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.400]   that the entire cell is hopelessly addicted
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.920]   to this main informatic computing,
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.960]   biological chemical system that is operating
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.320]   at the heart of the cell.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.720]   - Which is the translation?
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.560]   - It is the translation.
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.200]   - What's the translation from what to what?
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.240]   So RNA to enzymes?
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:53.160]   - It converts a linear sequence of mRNA
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.500]   into a folded, later folded protein.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:01.800]   That's when the, that's the core processing center
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.360]   for information for life.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.520]   It has multiple steps.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.040]   It initiates, it elongates,
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.980]   it terminates, and it recycles.
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:17.980]   It operates discrete bits of information.
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:22.760]   It's itself is like a chemical decoding device.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.860]   And that is incredibly unique for translation
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:29.920]   that I don't think you will find anywhere else
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.840]   in the cell that does this.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.620]   - So even though it's called translation,
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:39.520]   it's really like a factory that reads the schematic
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.320]   and builds a three-dimensional object.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.680]   It's like a printer.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.080]   - I would divide it into actually even four more
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.220]   additional steps or disciplines
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.800]   than what would it take to study it
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.520]   by the way you described it.
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.760]   It's a chemical system.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.800]   It's the compounds that make it up, or chemicals.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.760]   It's physical.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:05.760]   It tracks the energy to make its job, to do its job.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.180]   It's informatic.
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.380]   What is processed are the bits.
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.420]   It's computational.
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:16.140]   The discrete states that the system is placed
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.700]   when the information is being processed,
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.100]   that's itself is computational.
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.260]   And it's biological.
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.460]   It's, there's variability and inheritance
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:27.800]   that come from imperfect replication even
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.340]   and imperfect computation.
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.860]   - Oh man, that's so good.
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.140]   So from the biology comes the,
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.340]   like when you mess up, the bugs are the features.
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.900]   That's the biology.
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.660]   Informatics is obvious in the RNA.
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.300]   That's a set of information there.
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.500]   The different steps along the way
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.600]   is actually kind of what the computer does with bits.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.740]   It's done computation, physical.
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:56.740]   There's a, I guess, almost like a mechanical process
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.140]   to the whole thing that requires energy.
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.980]   And actually, it's manipulating actual physical objects
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:06.540]   and chemicals 'cause you have to,
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.020]   ultimately it's all chemistry.
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.860]   - Yeah, and it tracks this information.
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:13.860]   So it is almost a mini computer device inside ourselves.
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:18.300]   And that's the oldest computational device of life.
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:23.300]   It's likely the key operation system
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:28.620]   that had to evolve for life to emerge.
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:33.620]   - It's more interesting or it's more complicated
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.780]   in interesting ways than the computers we have today.
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.380]   I mean, everything you said, which is really, really nice.
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.100]   I mean, I guess our computers have the informatic
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.940]   and they have the computational,
[00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:45.540]   but they don't have the chemical,
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.620]   the physical or the biology.
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.620]   - Exactly, and the computers don't have,
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.900]   don't link information to function, right?
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.340]   They are not tightly coupled,
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.660]   nowhere close to what translation
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.740]   or the way translation does it.
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.020]   So that's the number one, I think, difference
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.580]   between the two.
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.900]   And yes, it's informatic
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:09.980]   and we can discuss this further too.
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.900]   - 100%, let's please discuss this further.
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.220]   Which part are we discussing further?
[00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:17.100]   Each one of those are fascinating worlds,
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.500]   each of the five.
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.980]   - Yeah, so well, we can start with the more,
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.660]   I guess the ones that are more established,
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:28.260]   which is the chemical aspect of the translation machinery.
[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:33.140]   It's the specific compounds make up the assembly of RNA.
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.740]   Chemists showed this in many different ways.
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.060]   We can rip apart the entire machinery.
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:40.900]   We know that at the core of it,
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:45.780]   there's an RNA that operates
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.540]   not only as an information system itself
[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.180]   or information itself, but also as an enzyme.
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:54.900]   And origin of life chemists make these molecules easily.
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.740]   Now we know we can manipulate RNA,
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.900]   we can make even with single pot chemistries,
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.380]   we can create compounds.
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.980]   - What's a single pot chemistry?
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:07.100]   - I would say when you add all the recipes
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.980]   that you know that will lead you to the final product.
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.020]   - This is what original life chemists do
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.820]   is they come up with this pot,
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.340]   they throw a bunch of chemicals in
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:20.020]   and they try to, they're basically chefs of a certain kind.
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.500]   - I'm not sure if that's what they call it,
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.660]   but that's how I think of it
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.740]   because it is all combined in a test tube
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.180]   and you know the outcome.
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.860]   And it's very mathematical
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.860]   once you know the right environment
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.420]   and the right chemistry that needs to get
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.020]   into this container or this pot.
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.020]   You know what the outcome is.
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.820]   There is no luck there anymore.
[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:42.420]   It's a pretty rigid, established input-output system
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.820]   and it's all chemistry.
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.620]   - So you actually wear a lot of hats
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.460]   as one of them original life chemists?
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.860]   - My PhD is in chemistry,
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.580]   but I don't do original life chemistry.
[00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.260]   - But you're interested in original life?
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.380]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.940]   - So some of your best friends are original life chemists.
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.380]   - Just make sure that you have good chemist friends
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.380]   if you're interested in original life.
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.900]   That's 100% requirement.
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.060]   It should be mandatory.
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.900]   - Okay, so chemistry.
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.340]   So what else about this machinery
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.700]   that we need to know chemically?
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.700]   - Well, chemically I think that's it.
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.740]   You have enzymes, you have proteins.
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.260]   Enzymes are doing their thing.
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:23.380]   They know how to chew energy using ATP or GTP.
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.740]   They know what to do in their own way.
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.980]   They do their enzymatic thing.
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.420]   So it's not just the ribosome
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.420]   that is at the heart of the transition,
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.580]   but there are a lot of different proteins.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.300]   You're looking at about 100 different components
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.580]   that compose this machinery.
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.300]   - Well, let me ask, maybe it's a ridiculous question,
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:47.940]   but did the chemistry make this machine
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:52.940]   or did the machine use chemistry to achieve a purpose?
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:58.900]   So like, I guess there's a lot
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.460]   of different chemical possibilities on earth.
[00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:07.340]   Is this translation machinery just like picking
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:10.980]   and choosing different chemical reactions
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.020]   that it can use to achieve a purpose?
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.860]   Or did the chemistry basically,
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:20.980]   there's like a momentum, like a constraint to the thing
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.460]   that can only build a certain kind of machinery?
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:29.460]   Basically, is chemistry fundamental or is it just emergent?
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:33.260]   Like how important is chemistry to this whole process?
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.820]   - You cannot have life without chemistry.
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:40.540]   You cannot have any cellular process without chemistry.
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.060]   What makes life interesting is that
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.100]   even if the chemistry isn't perfect,
[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.340]   even if there are accidents along the way,
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.860]   if something binds to another chemical
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:54.500]   in a way it shouldn't, there is resilience
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.340]   within the system that it can maybe not necessarily
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.300]   repair itself, but it moves on.
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.700]   However imperfect, mistakes can be handled.
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:03.740]   - That's where the biology comes in.
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:04.780]   - That's where the biology comes in.
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.100]   But in terms of chemistry, you absolutely cannot have
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.300]   a transition machinery without chemistry.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:12.620]   And so as I said, there are four main steps.
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.700]   These are the core steps that are conserved
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.020]   in all transition machinery.
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:20.900]   And I should say all life has this machine, right?
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.460]   Every cell, everything. - On Earth.
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:24.580]   - On Earth. - Yeah.
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.340]   - Yes.
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.140]   - When you think of this machine,
[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.620]   do you think very specifically about the kind of machinery
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.860]   that we're talking about?
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.140]   Or do you think more philosophically,
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:37.940]   a machine that converts information into function?
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.980]   - I cannot separate the two.
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.700]   I think what makes this machinery fascinating
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.460]   is that those five components that I listed,
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.180]   they coexist.
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.820]   So for instance, if we, let's just,
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:53.860]   talking about the chemistry part,
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:25:00.460]   we know the certain rate constant,
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.820]   all these proteins that operate in this machinery
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:07.820]   needs to harbor in order to get the mechanism going, right?
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:12.700]   If you are bringing the information
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.700]   to the transition machinery and you are the initiator
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:20.020]   of this computation system, you need to have,
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.500]   you can only afford a certain range of mistakes.
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.900]   If you're too fast,
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.500]   then the next message cannot be delivered fast.
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.580]   If you're too slow, then you may stall the process.
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:34.180]   So there is definitely a chemistry constant going on
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.180]   within the machinery.
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:39.540]   Again, it's not perfect, far from it,
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:44.140]   but they all have their own margin of error
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:45.860]   that they can tolerate versus they cannot,
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.660]   otherwise the system collapses.
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.900]   - So it's like a jazz ensemble, the notes of the chemistry,
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.620]   but you can be a little off- - I love that you said jazz.
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:54.500]   It's definitely true.
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.780]   It's a party and it's like everybody's invited
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.540]   and they need to operate together, right?
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:03.820]   And what's really cool about it, I think,
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.140]   there are many things that are very interesting
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.380]   about this thing, but if you take,
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.700]   if you remove it from the cell
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.700]   and put it in a cell-free environment,
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.060]   it works just fine, right?
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.700]   So you can get cell-free translation systems,
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.660]   put this translation in a test tube
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.020]   and it is doing its thing.
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.980]   It doesn't need the rest of the cell
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.940]   to translate information.
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.900]   Of course, you need to feed the information,
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.180]   at least so far,
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:36.180]   because we are far from evolving a translation,
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:40.620]   maybe not so far, evolving a translation in the lab
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.780]   or a machinery that can process information
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:44.900]   as it generates it.
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.620]   We have not done that yet.
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:47.980]   - That's a pretty complicated machinery,
[00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:51.860]   so it's hard for those origin of life chemists
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.580]   to find a pot that generates.
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.620]   - Because it's far more than chemistry.
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:58.980]   You need biology, obviously.
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.660]   You need biochemistry.
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:04.940]   You need to think as a, I think, network systems folk.
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.340]   You need to think about computation.
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:07.820]   You need to think about information.
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.180]   And that is not happening yet,
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:14.220]   except we are trying to bring this perspective.
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:18.540]   But the more you understand how information systems work,
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.780]   you cannot, once you see it, you cannot unsee it.
[00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.020]   It's one of those things.
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.580]   - So, but you could still rip it out
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.100]   and the chemistry happens.
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.100]   - Yes, and chemistry can happen
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:31.620]   even if you strip some of the parts out.
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.260]   It can, you can get very minimal level
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:38.780]   of information processing that does not look anything
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.420]   like the translation that cells relies on,
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.740]   but chemists showed from linear,
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:48.060]   you can generate information that arrives
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:52.620]   to the processing center in the form of a linear polymer.
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:55.740]   The informatic part of this system
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:59.300]   that I think sets it apart from computation
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.820]   and from metabolism comes in,
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:05.300]   if you think about the information itself, right?
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:09.940]   So we have four nucleotide letters that compose DNA
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:14.380]   and they are processed in the translation in triplets.
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:18.220]   So you have in triplet codon fragments.
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:21.060]   So you have four times four times four.
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:25.340]   So you have 64 possible states that can be encoded
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:28.820]   by four letters in three positions.
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:30.500]   All right, so.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.780]   - It's so amazing.
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:32.900]   - Yeah. - It's so amazing.
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:36.020]   - There is only one code that says start.
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.180]   That's the, there's only one.
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.820]   And then there's two, if not three, that says stop.
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:45.100]   So that's what you work with,
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.460]   but you can have 64 possible states,
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:52.460]   but life only uses 20 amino acids.
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.540]   So we use six, life uses 64 possible states
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.340]   minus four of the starts and stops.
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:01.900]   To code for 20 amino acids in different combinations.
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:05.100]   That is really amazing.
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.380]   If you think about,
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:09.420]   there are 500 different amino acids life can choose, right?
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:12.180]   Narrowed it down to 20.
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.340]   We don't know why a lot of people think
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.820]   about this genetic code is quite fascinating.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.220]   - So far, right? - Right.
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.980]   I mean, it didn't do it for 4 billion years.
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:22.340]   I don't know, we may wait for another 4 billion years, but.
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.820]   - But you didn't have those amino acids
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:24.860]   in the very beginning, right?
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:25.820]   Like. - We don't know.
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.100]   So we wouldn't be fooling ourselves
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:32.420]   if we said we know exactly how many amino acids existed
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.060]   early on, but there's no reason to think
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:37.300]   that it wasn't the same.
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.060]   - Or similar. - Yeah.
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.860]   We don't have a good reason,
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:45.860]   but because roughly 20 out of 60 states are used,
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:50.180]   you're using one third of your possible states
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:52.300]   in your information system.
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.580]   So this may seem like a waste,
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.060]   but informatically it's important
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:02.380]   because it's abundant and it is redundant, right?
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:07.060]   So this code degeneracy, you see this in,
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:09.220]   that's implemented by this translation machinery
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:10.100]   inside the cell.
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.220]   So it means you can make errors, right?
[00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:16.460]   You can make errors, but the message will still get through.
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.060]   You can speak, missing some letters,
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:20.940]   the information can miss some parts,
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.700]   but the message will still get through.
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:26.180]   So that's two thirds of the not used states
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.980]   gives you that robustness and resilience within the system.
[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:32.260]   - So at the informatic level, there's room for error.
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.140]   There's probably room for error probably
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:38.420]   in all five categories that we're talking about.
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.100]   There's probably room for error in the computation.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.780]   There's probably room for error in the physical.
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.460]   - Yes, exactly. - Everywhere there's room
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.420]   for error. - Yeah, because
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.260]   the informatic capacity is made possible
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.980]   together with the other components.
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:53.980]   And not only that, but also the product yields
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:59.900]   a function, no, in this case, enzyme or protein, right?
[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:04.500]   So that's really amazing to me.
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.780]   - It is, I mean, in my head, just so you know,
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:10.060]   because I'm a computer science AI person,
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:13.900]   the parallels between even like language models
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:17.740]   that encode language, or now they're able to encode
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:22.740]   basically any kind of thing, including images and actions,
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.500]   all in this kind of way.
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:30.700]   The parallel in terms of informatic and computation
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.380]   is just incredible.
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:36.260]   - Actually, I have a image, maybe I can send you.
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:37.340]   - Can we pull it up now?
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:40.780]   - If you just do genetic codon charts, we can pull that up.
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.980]   Yeah, it's a very standard table.
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:47.340]   So I can explain why this is so amazing.
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.340]   So you're looking at, this is life's alphabet, right?
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.860]   And so I also wanna make a very quick link now
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:55.140]   to your first question, the tree of life.
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:32:01.380]   When we try to understand ancient languages,
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:06.380]   or the cultures that use these extinct languages,
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:10.220]   we start with the modern languages, right?
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:14.420]   So we look at Indo-European languages
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.300]   and try to understand certain words.
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:20.580]   And make trees to understand,
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:25.580]   this is what Slavic word is for snow, something like snig.
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.780]   - Now we jumped to languages that humans spoke.
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.100]   - Humans spoke, exactly.
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.260]   So we make trees to understand
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:33.620]   what is the original ancestor,
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:35.980]   what did they use to say snow?
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:38.740]   And if you have a lot of cultures who use the word snow,
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.740]   you can imagine that it was snowy,
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.460]   that's why they needed that word.
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.220]   It's the same thing for biology, right?
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:50.580]   If we understand some function about that enzyme,
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.580]   we can understand the environment that they lived in.
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:56.260]   It's similar in that sense.
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:59.380]   So now you're looking at the alphabet of life.
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.940]   In this case, it's not 20 or 25 letters,
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.820]   it's you have four letters.
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:08.740]   So what is really interesting that stands out to me
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:11.020]   when I look at this, on the outer shell,
[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:12.940]   you're looking at the 20 amino acids
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.780]   that compose life, right?
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:18.980]   The one, the methionine that you see, that's the start.
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:21.020]   So the start is always the same.
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.660]   To me, that is fascinating
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:24.940]   that all life starts with the same start.
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.820]   There's no other start code.
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:31.820]   So you sent the AUG to the cell,
[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:33.540]   when that information arrives,
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:36.460]   the translation knows, all right, I got to start,
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:37.420]   function is coming.
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:40.980]   Following this is a chain of information
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.500]   until the stop code arrives,
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.340]   which are highlights in black squares.
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:47.540]   - So for people just listening,
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:50.300]   we're looking at a standard RNA color table
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:51.780]   organized in a wheel.
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:54.060]   There's an outer shell and there's an inner shell,
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.100]   all using the four letters that we're talking about.
[00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:59.220]   And with that, we can compose all of the amino acids
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.940]   and there's a start and there's a stop.
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:03.980]   And presumably you put together,
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:07.860]   with these letters, you walk around the wheel
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:10.620]   to put together the words, the sentences
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:12.060]   that make-- - Yeah, the words, the sentences.
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:15.500]   And again, you get one start,
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.180]   you get three, there are three different ways to stop this,
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:19.780]   one way to start it.
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:24.060]   And for each letter, you have multiple options.
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:26.300]   So you say you have a code A,
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.820]   the second code can be another A.
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:30.540]   And even if you messed that up,
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:32.100]   you still can rescue yourself.
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.620]   So you can get, for instance,
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.860]   I'm looking at the lysine K,
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:37.540]   you get an A and you get an A
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:40.100]   and then you get an A that gives you the lysine.
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.060]   Right, but if you get an A and if you get an A and a G,
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.100]   you still get the lysine.
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.980]   So there are different combinations.
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.340]   So even if there's an error,
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:49.700]   we don't know if these are selected
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:53.020]   because they were erroneous and somehow they got locked down.
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:56.660]   We don't know if there's a mechanism behind this too,
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:00.380]   or we certainly don't know this definitively.
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:03.220]   But this is informatic part of this.
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.220]   And notice that the colors, and in some tables too,
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.300]   the colors will be coded in a way
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:13.340]   that the type of the nucleotides can be similar chemically.
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:16.180]   But the point is that you will still end up
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.260]   with the same amino acids or something similar to it,
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.740]   even if you mess up the code.
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.140]   - Do we understand the mechanism,
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.580]   how natural selection interplays
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:27.420]   with this resilience to error?
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:32.460]   So which errors result in the same output,
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:36.940]   like the same function and which don't?
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:40.580]   Which actually results in a dysfunction, which are?
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:44.540]   - We understand to some degree how translation
[00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:47.100]   and the rest of the cell work together,
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:50.100]   how an error at the translation level,
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:54.060]   this is the really core level, can impact entire cell.
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:55.820]   But we understand very little
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.660]   about the evolutionary mechanisms
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:01.500]   behind the selection of the system.
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.220]   It's thought to be as one of the hardest problems in biology,
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.620]   and it is still the dark side of biology.
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:11.060]   Even though it is so essential.
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:16.060]   So this is, yeah, you're looking at the language of life,
[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:20.020]   so to speak, and how it can found ways
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:23.980]   rather to tolerate its own mistakes.
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:26.020]   - So the entire phylogenetic tree
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:31.940]   can be like deconstructed with this wheel of language.
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:35.300]   - Because all the final letters,
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.100]   those are, that's the 20 amino acids,
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.340]   that's our alphabet.
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.580]   They are all brought together
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:43.340]   with these bits of information, right?
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.820]   So when you look at the genes,
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.180]   you're looking at those four letters.
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:47.460]   When you look at the proteins,
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:50.020]   you're looking at the 20 amino acids,
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:53.340]   which may be a little easier way to track the information
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.980]   when we create the tree.
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.060]   - So using this language,
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:01.080]   we can describe all life that's lived on earth.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.500]   - I wish. - One perspective.
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.980]   - We are not that good at it yet, right?
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:11.460]   - So in theory, this is one way to look at life on earth.
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:14.740]   - If you're a biologist and you want to understand
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:18.940]   how life evolved from a molecular perspective,
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:21.220]   this would be the way to do it.
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:25.180]   And this is what nature narrowed its code down to.
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.860]   So when we think of nitrogen,
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:29.820]   when we think of carbon, when we think of sulfur,
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.300]   it's all in this,
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:36.300]   that all these nucleotides are built based on those elements.
[00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:39.060]   - And this is fundamentally the informatic perspective.
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.820]   - Exactly, that's the informatic perspective.
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.860]   And it's important to emphasize
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:47.340]   that this is not engineered by humans.
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.680]   This evolved by itself.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.940]   - Right, humans didn't invent this
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.020]   just because we were just describing,
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.340]   we're trying to find,
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.620]   trying to describe the language of life.
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:03.140]   - It appears to be a highly optimized chemical
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:04.440]   and information code.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:10.700]   It may indicate that a great deal of chemical evolution
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:15.820]   and this may indicate that a lot of selection pressure
[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:18.060]   and Darwinian evolution happened
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.860]   prior to the rise of last universal common ancestor.
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:23.260]   Because this is almost a bridge
[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:24.860]   that connects the earliest cells
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:26.500]   to the last universal common ancestor.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.500]   - Okay, can you describe what the heck you just said?
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:34.500]   So this mechanism evolved before the,
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.260]   what common ancestor?
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.260]   The last universal common ancestor.
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.540]   - Yes, so when we talk about the tree,
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.020]   when we think about the root,
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:46.020]   if you ideally included all the living information
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:49.620]   or all the available information
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:52.740]   that comes from living organisms on your tree,
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.340]   then on the root of your tree
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:57.580]   lies the last universal common ancestor, LUCA, right?
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:58.720]   - Why last?
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.580]   Last universal?
[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:02.460]   Because the earlier universal,
[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:04.860]   it also had trees, but they all died off.
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:08.820]   We call it the last because it is sort of the first one
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:13.580]   that we can track because we don't know
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.300]   what we cannot track, right?
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:19.580]   - There's one organism that started the whole thing.
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:21.540]   - It's more like, I would think of it
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:23.780]   as more like a population, a group of organisms.
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:24.620]   - Okay, hold on a second.
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:27.340]   I tweeted this, so I wanna know the accuracy of my tweet.
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:28.180]   All right.
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:31.300]   Sometimes early in the morning,
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:33.860]   I tweet very pothead-like things.
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:38.860]   It said that we all evolved from one common ancestor
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:46.820]   that was a single cell organism 3.5 billion years ago,
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:49.260]   something like this.
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.420]   How true is that tweet?
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:52.420]   Do I need to delete it?
[00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.900]   No, there's not actually, correct.
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:58.900]   I mean, I think, of course, there's a lot to say,
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.540]   which is like, we don't know exactly,
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:05.100]   but to what degree is the single organism aspect,
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:09.180]   is that true, versus multiple organisms?
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:10.780]   - Do you want me to be--
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:11.620]   - Brutally honest?
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:12.460]   Yes, please.
[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:16.300]   There's still time.
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:19.860]   This is how we get like caveats to tweets.
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:22.540]   - All right, so first of all, it's not,
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:25.460]   3.5 is still a very conservative estimate.
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:27.340]   That's what's-- - In which direction?
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.700]   - I would say it's 3.8 is probably safer
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:31.980]   to say at this point.
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.580]   - A bunch of people said it probably way before.
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:36.820]   - If you put an approximately, I'll take that.
[00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:37.660]   - I didn't.
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:42.100]   I just love the idea that I was once,
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:46.220]   first of all, as a single organism, I was once a cell.
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:47.700]   - Well, you're still is.
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:49.100]   You're a group of cells.
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:53.060]   - No, but I started from a single cell, me, Lex.
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:55.340]   - You mean like you versus Luca?
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.180]   Are you relating to Luca right now?
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.700]   - No, no, no, I'm relating to my--
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:40:59.860]   - Your own development.
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:02.620]   - My own development, I started from a single cell.
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:05.500]   It's like, it built up a cell, okay.
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:09.820]   That, and then, so that's for a single biological organism.
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:13.020]   And then from an evolutionary perspective, the Luca,
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:16.540]   like I start, like my ancestor is a single cell,
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:20.180]   and then here I am sitting half asleep tweeting.
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:23.780]   Like I started from a single cell,
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:26.220]   evolved a ton of murder along the way
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:33.100]   through this brutal search for adaptation
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:37.460]   through the 3.5, .8 billion years.
[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:40.020]   - So you defy the code of Douglas Adams.
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:41.340]   You are proud of your ancestors,
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:42.900]   and you invite them over to dinner,
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.580]   and you invite them over to your Twitter.
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:47.860]   - Yeah, and it's amazing that this intelligence,
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.620]   to the degree you can call it intelligence,
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:52.780]   emerged to be able to tweet whatever the heck I want.
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:55.740]   - Yes, it's almost intelligence at the chemical level,
[00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:59.580]   and this is also probably one of the first
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:01.780]   chemically intelligent system
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.140]   that evolved by itself in nature.
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:06.060]   - Yeah, so you see that translation
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:10.140]   is a fundamentally intelligent mechanism.
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:12.940]   - In its own way, and again,
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:18.980]   if we manage to figure out how to drive life's evolution,
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:25.220]   if it can evolve a sophisticated
[00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:30.220]   sort of informatic processing system like this,
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:34.780]   you may ask yourself what might chemical systems
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:37.860]   be capable of independently doing
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:40.900]   under different circumstances?
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.860]   - Yeah, so like locally, they're intelligent locally.
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.660]   They don't need the rest of the shebang.
[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:47.820]   They don't need the big picture.
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:50.820]   - So that's a great segue
[00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:53.580]   into what makes this biological, right?
[00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:57.500]   The heart of the cellular activities are translation.
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.860]   You kill translation, you kill the cell.
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.460]   Not only the translation itself,
[00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:05.740]   you kill the component that initiates it,
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:06.580]   you kill the cell.
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:09.180]   You remove the component that elongates it,
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.460]   you kill the cell.
[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:13.340]   So there are many different ways to disrupt this machinery.
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:16.180]   All the parts are important.
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:19.500]   Now, it can vary across different organisms.
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.820]   We see variation between bacteria
[00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:24.020]   versus eukaryotes versus archaea, right?
[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:26.740]   So it is not the same exact steps,
[00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:29.900]   but it can get more crowded
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:32.740]   as we get closer to eukaryotes, for instance.
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:34.140]   But you are still computing
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:37.820]   about 20 amino acids per second, right?
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.740]   This is what you're generating every second.
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:43.060]   - That single machinery is doing 20 a second?
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:47.740]   - 21 for bacteria, I believe eight for eukaryotes, or nine.
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:49.140]   - 21 a second.
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:51.660]   I mean, that's super inefficient or super efficient,
[00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:53.700]   depending on how you think about it.
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:54.940]   - I think it's great.
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:55.780]   I mean, I can actually do nine amino acids.
[00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:58.260]   - Yeah, but it's way slower than a computer
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:00.180]   could generate through simulation.
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.740]   - I think, if you can show me a computer that does this,
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:04.580]   we are done here.
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:08.420]   - Well, this is the big, this includes the five things,
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.220]   not just, but I could show you a computer
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.060]   that's doing the informatic, right?
[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:14.540]   - Yes, you can show me that,
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:16.580]   but you cannot show me the one that has all.
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:17.820]   - For now.
[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:18.660]   - For now.
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:22.100]   - I'm gonna ask you about probably what, alpha fold, right?
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.460]   - I think the more we learn about,
[00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:27.380]   and this is why early life and origin
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.900]   is also very fascinating and applicable
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:32.380]   to many different disciplines.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:35.580]   There is no way you see this the way we just described it,
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:39.580]   unless you think about early life and early geochemistry
[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:42.900]   and earliest emergent systems.
[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:47.700]   But going back to the biological component,
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:53.620]   all of these attributes that we think about life
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:55.740]   or that we associate with biology
[00:44:55.740 --> 00:45:00.300]   stems from translation as well as metabolism.
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:04.420]   But I see metabolism as a way to keep translation going
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:07.100]   and translation keeps metabolism going.
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:11.060]   But translation is arguably a bit more sophisticated process
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:14.100]   for the reasons that I just described.
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.960]   - So metabolism is a source of energy
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:17.620]   for this translation process.
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:21.260]   - It's a way to process materials
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:25.460]   and it is inherently dynamic and it is flexible,
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:29.900]   but it is not focused on repetition as translation does.
[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:30.940]   So that's the main difference.
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:34.180]   Translation is the kind of in a way, just it's repeats.
[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:38.460]   So you have the metabolism that can synthesize materials,
[00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:41.660]   creates or benefits from available energy.
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:43.580]   And again, it's a dynamic system.
[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:45.940]   And then you have computation
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:49.260]   that is inherently repetitive, right?
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:51.260]   Needs to carry out repetitive processes.
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:56.000]   And it does the tasks and it implements an algorithm,
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.540]   but it is not dynamic.
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:01.420]   So you see both of those attributes in translation combined.
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:04.840]   It is repetitive and it is dynamic
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.720]   and it also processes this information.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.260]   So they are fundamentally different.
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:14.180]   I don't know if you can get life
[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:17.340]   if you don't find a way to process the information
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:18.200]   around you.
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:20.940]   - In a repetitive dynamic way.
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:25.460]   - Yeah, and somehow that's what got selected,
[00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:28.820]   maybe not selected, I don't know if it was accidental,
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:31.900]   but that's what it seems to be conserved
[00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:35.700]   for four billion years, that that's what life established.
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:37.580]   - What's the connection between translation
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:40.180]   and the self-replication, which seems to be
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:44.140]   another weird thing that life just started doing,
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:45.540]   wanting to just replicate itself.
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:47.620]   - I think when we truly understand the answer
[00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:50.460]   to that question, we may have just made ourselves life.
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:54.460]   I don't think we know quite how translation machinery
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:57.180]   as a whole fits into equation.
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:02.180]   'Cause we try to understand ribosomes, RNA,
[00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:05.640]   how the linear information is processed.
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:11.040]   Or the genetic code, why this codon's not others,
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:14.200]   why 20 not more, not less.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.120]   And we are sort of moving towards translation,
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:19.720]   that's what we are working on anyway.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:21.720]   To finally look at the patterns
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:25.080]   in which this system operates itself.
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:28.000]   And if you understand that, you're really unlocking
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.060]   a very emergent behavior.
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:34.560]   - One of the things you didn't mention is physical.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.440]   Is there something to mention about that component
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:37.320]   that's interesting?
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:41.320]   - There's actually a paper published in 2013,
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.600]   I wanna say the first author is Zirnoff.
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:49.600]   So they surveyed a computational,
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:56.720]   engineered systems level computation energy consumption.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:01.360]   And they tried to understand whether the universe
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:05.760]   is using its own, or life is using its full capacity
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.320]   of energy consumption.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:10.760]   And whether if different planets in the universe
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:14.080]   had life, would the capacity would increase or decrease?
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.360]   Does life operate at its energy maximum?
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:20.960]   And they think that it does,
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:23.520]   that it actually operates at an efficiency
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:27.440]   that is far more above and beyond any computational system.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:29.400]   - How is that possible to determine at all?
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:32.200]   - That you tell me, that's why I dropped the citation.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:35.000]   I found the citation, it's quite an interesting paper.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.500]   It's a bit, you know, it's a,
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:42.520]   obviously we can only calculate and infer these things.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.720]   But-- - That's a good question to ask.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.800]   Is the life that we see here on earth
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.680]   and life elsewhere in the universe,
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:54.000]   is it using the energy most efficiently?
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:57.120]   - It seems to be very efficient.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.600]   Again, if we compare it to computers,
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.360]   it seems to be incredibly efficient at using energy.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:04.240]   - I think they look at the theoretical optimum
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:05.960]   for electronic devices. - Got it.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:09.520]   - And then try to understand where life falls on this.
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:12.040]   And life is certainly more efficient.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.520]   - And that's ultimately the physical side.
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:16.080]   How well are you using for this entire mechanism,
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:18.480]   the energy available to you?
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:22.560]   And so given all the resilience to errors
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:23.400]   and all that kind of stuff,
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:26.080]   it seems that it's close to its maximum.
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:30.320]   And this paper aside, it does seem that life,
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:33.440]   obviously that's the constraint we have on earth, right,
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.480]   is the amount of energy.
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:36.320]   - Yeah.
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.320]   - So that's one way to define life.
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:44.280]   Well, the input is energy and the output is what?
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.800]   I don't know.
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:47.340]   Self-replicating.
[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:50.280]   Wait, how, okay, let's go there.
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.480]   How do you personally define life?
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:55.320]   Do you have a favorite definition
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:57.120]   you try to sneak up on?
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:02.680]   Is it possible to define life on earth?
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:03.520]   - I don't know.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:05.600]   It depends on what you are defining it for.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:08.840]   If you're defining it for finding different life forms,
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:12.760]   then it probably needs to have some quantification in it
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:17.760]   so that you can use it in whatever the mission
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.040]   that you're operating to.
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:20.480]   - So you mean like it's not binary,
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:23.560]   it's like a seven out of 10?
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:26.720]   - Life-like?
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:27.920]   - Life-like.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:28.760]   - I don't know.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:32.400]   I don't think that defining is that essential.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.520]   I think it's a good exercise,
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:39.520]   but I'm not sure if we need to agree
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:42.640]   a universally defined way of understanding life
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.960]   because the definition itself
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.880]   seems to be ever evolving anyway, right?
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.480]   We have the NASA's definition.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:53.240]   It has its minuses and pluses,
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:55.120]   but it seems to be doing its job.
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.400]   - Well, what are the different,
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:59.680]   if there is a line and it's impossible
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.720]   or unproductive to define that line,
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.840]   nevertheless, we know it when we see it
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:09.400]   is one definition that the Supreme Court likes.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:12.200]   And that's kind of an important thing
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:17.200]   to think about when we look at life on other planets.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:23.440]   So how do we try to identify if a thing is living
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.560]   when we go to Mars,
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:29.480]   when we go to the different moons in our solar system,
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.000]   when we go outside our solar system
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.280]   to look for life on other planets?
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:37.520]   - It's unlikely to be a sort of a smoking gun event, right?
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.640]   It's not gonna be, hey, I found this.
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:40.480]   - You don't think so?
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:42.640]   - I don't think so, unless you find an elephant
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.880]   on some exoplanet, then I can say,
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.240]   yeah, there's life here.
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:49.920]   - No, but isn't there a dynamic nature to the thing?
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:54.600]   Like it moves, it has a membrane
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.520]   that looks like there's stuff inside.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.880]   - It doesn't need to move, right?
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:00.480]   I mean, like look at plants.
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.600]   I mean, they grow, but there are plants
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.640]   that can be also pretty dormant.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:08.400]   And arguably they do everything
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:12.480]   that one of my favorite professors once said,
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:13.560]   that the plant does everything
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:15.760]   that a giraffe does without moving.
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:19.240]   So movement is not necessarily.
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:21.480]   - But on a certain timescale,
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:24.120]   the plant does move, it just moves slower.
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:24.960]   - Yes.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:25.800]   - It moves pretty quickly.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.840]   - I would say that, it's hard to quantify this
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.340]   or even measure it, but it is,
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:36.560]   life is definitely chemistry finding solutions, right?
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:39.960]   So it is chemistry exploring itself
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:45.000]   and maintaining this exploration for billions of years.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.480]   - So, okay, so a planet is a bunch of chemistry
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:52.360]   and then you run it and say, all right,
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:56.080]   figure out what cool stuff you can come up with.
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:58.080]   That's essentially what life is.
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:01.120]   Given a chemistry, what is the cool stuff I can come up with?
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.720]   - If that chemistry or the solutions
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:08.720]   that it embarks upon are maintained in a form of memory.
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:12.520]   Right, so you don't just need to have
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:16.720]   the exploring chemical space,
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.760]   but you need to also maintain a memory
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:23.760]   of some of those solutions for over long periods of time.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:28.880]   So that's the memory component makes it more living to me.
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:32.000]   Because chemistry can always sample, right?
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.020]   So chemistry is chemistry,
[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:36.420]   but are you just constantly sampling
[00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:39.560]   or are you building on your former solutions
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:42.040]   and then maintaining a memory of those solutions
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.120]   over billions of years?
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:45.680]   Or at least that's what happened here.
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:47.400]   - Chemistry can't build life
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:49.520]   if it's always living in the moment.
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.960]   The physicists will be very upset with you.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:56.960]   Okay, so memory could be a fundamental requirement for life.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:02.840]   - I mean, life is obviously chemistry and physics
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:04.960]   leading to biology.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:09.760]   So this is not a disciplinary problem of one discipline
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:11.600]   trying to bring other disciplines.
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:14.560]   But what you need to have is definitely,
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:15.640]   chemistry is everywhere, right?
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:19.240]   I tend to think you can be a chemist,
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:21.040]   you can study chemistry, you can study physics,
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:23.500]   you can study geology anywhere in the universe,
[00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:26.340]   but this is the only place you can study biology.
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.960]   This is the only place to be a biologist.
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:28.800]   - Earth.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.640]   - That's it.
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:30.460]   - Yeah.
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:32.880]   - So definitely something very fundamental happened here
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:35.200]   and you cannot take biology out of the equation.
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:38.440]   If you wanna understand how that vast chemistry space,
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:43.160]   how that general sequence space got narrowed down
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:47.800]   to what is available or what is used by life,
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:50.520]   you need to understand the rules of selection.
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:53.000]   And that's where evolution and biology comes into play.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.280]   - So the rules of natural selection operate to you
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:57.640]   on the level of biology?
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:59.800]   - Rules?
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:02.080]   I don't know if there are any rules like that.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:04.160]   It would be fascinating to find
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:06.560]   in terms of the biology's rules.
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.200]   That's a very interesting
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:12.440]   and it's a very fascinating area of study now.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.680]   And probably we will hear more about that decades to come.
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:19.900]   But if you wanna go from the broad to specific,
[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:22.160]   you need to understand the rules of selection.
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:26.000]   And that is gonna come from understanding biology, yes.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   - Well, actually, let me ask you about selection.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.040]   You have a paper on evolutionary stalling
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:36.480]   where you describe that evolution's not good at multitasking.
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:41.160]   Or like in populations that evolve quickly.
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:42.560]   I mean, it's a very specific thing,
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:46.320]   but there could be a generalizable fundamental thing to this
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:48.520]   that evolution is not able to improve
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:51.680]   multiple modules simultaneously.
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:53.500]   I guess the question is,
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:56.080]   what part of the organism does evolution
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.760]   quote unquote focus on to improve?
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:00.900]   - Yeah, that was the driving question.
[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:04.040]   We meddled with the part
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:06.560]   where you shouldn't be messing up with translation.
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:07.600]   This is the--
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:08.920]   - Should or should not?
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:09.760]   - You shouldn't.
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.560]   As I said, there are many ways to break it
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.120]   and all life needs it.
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:16.000]   - That's one of your favorite things to do
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.420]   is to break life to see what happens.
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:22.520]   - Yeah, because that's how kids learn, right?
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:23.680]   So you have to break something
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.520]   and see how it will,
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:26.660]   then you do it over and over again
[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:29.480]   to see if it will fix itself in the same ways.
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:31.560]   So it's our, I don't know,
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:33.160]   it's the most fundamental properties
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.520]   of ourselves as human beings.
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.040]   So if we shouldn't break translation,
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:38.600]   then we should try to break it
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:39.880]   to see how it will repair.
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:41.200]   - So which part did you break?
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.820]   - I broke elongation.
[00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:46.560]   - What's the role of elongation in this process?
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:50.720]   - So we have four steps of the translations,
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:51.960]   initiate, elongate.
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:53.400]   So you elongate the chain,
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.020]   of the information chain
[00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:57.740]   that you're now creating, the peptide chain,
[00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:01.100]   or let's say broadly polymer chain.
[00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:03.820]   And there's a termination step
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.380]   and there's the recycling.
[00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:09.340]   So all of these steps are carried out by proteins
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:11.660]   that are also named after these steps.
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:14.420]   Initiation is the initiation factor,
[00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:17.520]   protein elongation is the elongator protein.
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:23.380]   We broke elongation.
[00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:27.140]   So the cell, the starting codon could still arrive
[00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:29.260]   to where it's supposed to go,
[00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:34.120]   but the following information couldn't get carried out
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:36.820]   because we replaced elongation
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:39.540]   with its own ancestral version.
[00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:44.540]   So we inserted roughly 700 million year old
[00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:47.100]   elongation factor protein
[00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:53.240]   after removing the modern gene.
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:57.660]   So we made this ancient modern hybrid organism.
[00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:59.940]   - And that essentially creates in some way
[00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:01.860]   the ancient version of that organism.
[00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:04.100]   - I wouldn't say so.
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:06.420]   It's a hybrid organism.
[00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:07.240]   It's not necessarily,
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:09.500]   because the rest of the cell,
[00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:14.500]   the rest of the genome is still modern.
[00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:17.380]   And that goes back to the difference between Jurassic Park.
[00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:19.340]   There are many differences, obviously,
[00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:21.460]   given that this is not fiction, we are doing it.
[00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:24.820]   But also we are not necessarily,
[00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:27.060]   I think in Jurassic Park they are taking
[00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:29.940]   an ancient, they find an ancient organism
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:32.740]   and then put a modern gene inside the ancient organism.
[00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:35.420]   In our case, we are still working with what we got,
[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:38.500]   but putting an ancestral DNA inside the modern organism.
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:40.100]   - So you're like taking a new car
[00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:42.620]   and putting an old engine into it.
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:43.980]   - In a way, yeah, yes.
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:45.260]   - Seeing what happens.
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:47.660]   - Yes, but in our case, it's more like a transformer
[00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:51.060]   than just a regular car, which is doing things.
[00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:54.220]   - Yeah, so it's a more complicated organism
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:55.060]   than just a car.
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:56.540]   - Yeah.
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:57.380]   - I got it.
[00:58:57.380 --> 00:59:00.000]   So what does that teach you?
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.900]   - We wanted to understand multiple things.
[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:07.100]   One is how does the cell respond to perturbation?
[00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:09.460]   And we didn't just put the ancient DNA,
[00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:14.460]   we inserted, we sampled DNA from currently existing organisms
[00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:16.700]   or the cousins of this microbe,
[00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:21.020]   and collected DNA sequences from the cousins as well.
[00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:25.700]   So both ancestor and the current cousin DNA, so to speak.
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:28.900]   And engineered all of these things to the modern bacteria
[00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:32.460]   and generated a collection of microbes
[00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:35.140]   that either have the ancient component
[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:40.140]   or the variant elongator component that still alive today,
[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:43.980]   but coming from a different part of the tree.
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:45.960]   - So you broke elongation.
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:49.740]   Was that something you did as part of the paper
[00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:52.820]   on evolutionary stalling to try to figure out
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:55.860]   how evolution figures out what to try to improve?
[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:56.920]   Did that help?
[00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:59.700]   - Yes, because we were not supposed to
[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:01.060]   mess with the translation.
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:02.900]   That's exactly what we did.
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:07.460]   And we altered elongation by changing it
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:09.900]   with different versions of elongation
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:13.100]   that are either coming from species
[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:16.140]   that still are around today.
[01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:19.240]   You can imagine them as sitting on the tips of the tree
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:23.640]   near branch, far branch, compared to the organism
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.820]   that we're working with, distant cousins,
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:31.140]   as well as the ancestors of the bacteria
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:33.260]   that we are now modifying.
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:35.640]   - How much different variation is there
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:36.880]   in that elongation step?
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.120]   Like what are the different flavors of elongation?
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.060]   - That's a very good question.
[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:43.880]   So mechanistically or mechanically, it's the same.
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.360]   It's very conserved.
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.200]   So all life elongates the same way.
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.760]   It's nothing but a shuttle.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:54.280]   You just carry the chemical with you,
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:58.240]   the bit, to the heart of the machine.
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:01.000]   - Is it essentially doing like a copy paste operation?
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   - It has its tail that's attached to the code,
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.420]   which is then carried biochemically to the linear chain,
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:13.240]   to the core of ribosome.
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.560]   And it sits on there.
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:18.120]   It's released and the peptides click.
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.600]   The codes rather click.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:23.960]   Once that chemistry, that's at the tail end, occurs,
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:28.680]   the protein leaves the center.
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:31.700]   So you can imagine it's like it hops in there and hops out.
[01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.040]   And when it hops in, hops out,
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.980]   it leaves the information behind.
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:35.820]   That's all it does,
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:37.720]   is bring the information, get out of there.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:42.040]   And it's all triggered by biophysics, biochemistry,
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.560]   because of the way the enzyme choose energy,
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:48.640]   in this case, GTP, how the phosphor leaves the center,
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:51.480]   that kicks, that gives the additional kick
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:55.240]   to the enzyme to leave the center.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.080]   - So which parts are different then?
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.840]   Where's the flavors, different flavors of the location?
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:03.480]   - Usually the parts that matter don't change over time.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:07.120]   Nature conserves the sites of these proteins
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.840]   that are important for its job.
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:12.920]   If there's a difference, then we wanna know,
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:16.960]   especially if there's a difference between two cousins.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.480]   And we look at the sites that interact
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:24.640]   with the most important parts of this machinery.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.800]   If we see any difference, we tend to mutate,
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.960]   or we revert, we engineer that part, we alter that part,
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:30.880]   because it gives us a clue
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.520]   that there must be something interesting
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:33.920]   going on here or not.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:37.280]   - Okay, so that's not the fundamental part of the machinery,
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.960]   but it's some flavorful characteristic
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:40.800]   that you can play with.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.400]   - So now you stripped the machinery down to its parts,
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:46.160]   and now you're looking at the parts of the parts.
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.880]   And it depends where you're looking
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.160]   and how you're looking and what you're looking at.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:57.160]   But usually we see up to 70% level conserved identity
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:02.320]   across all modern versions.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.360]   When you travel back in time, the identity decreases.
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:08.240]   So elongation likely existed.
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.400]   We have good reason to think that it existed
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.280]   at the dawn of life.
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.920]   So you're looking at a 3.8 billion year old mechanism.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:19.000]   And when we look at the ancestors that we resurrect,
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.640]   we see about 40% identity.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:25.040]   So the identity definitely decreases as you go back in time.
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:29.560]   But still 60% shared information over four billion year,
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:30.640]   it's pretty good.
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.920]   - Is that just for elongation
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.040]   or for the entire translation?
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.280]   - Depends on what you do.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:37.760]   So for initiation, we've also recently published this.
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:40.200]   It's a different story.
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:44.600]   But overall you see high level of identity
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.440]   that is kept intact,
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:49.360]   especially if the component is essential for life.
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:53.520]   - Okay, so 40% and 60%, 70% you said.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.800]   But like from generation to generation,
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:57.520]   how does evolution,
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.800]   and presumably that's what that paper is looking at
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.200]   is the parts of the parts.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.040]   - Yeah.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:07.040]   - How does it able to say, like mess with the parts
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.480]   and try to come up with a cooler,
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:12.000]   improved version of the organism?
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.080]   - Yeah, so let me describe to you
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:14.320]   what we did in that experiment.
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:17.160]   We took bacteria,
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:20.200]   we perturbed the elongation in all of these
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.360]   with different variants.
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:26.360]   So we had an initial set of a group of bacteria that we had.
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:30.960]   We then subjected these bacteria to evolution in the lab.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.640]   So first of all, we knew we broke it
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:35.000]   because upon engineering,
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.320]   we measured what's going on with the cell.
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.520]   It's not growing as well.
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.360]   They're not healthy.
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:40.720]   We can see it with our eyes.
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.040]   We can measure it.
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:45.040]   That if they were generating an offspring every 20 minutes,
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.560]   now it is 40 minutes, right?
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.800]   So we really messed them up.
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.040]   They don't wanna work with this thing.
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:52.560]   They don't want each other, but they need each other.
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:55.360]   So we created that situation for them,
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:58.360]   which is good because we wanted to see
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:03.360]   how they will cooperate with each other to fix this problem
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:07.880]   because we know that that's not the condition
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.520]   that they wanna live in,
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.760]   especially when they know what they can do.
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:15.240]   So with that, we subjected these organisms
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:17.240]   to evolution in the lab.
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:21.680]   We refer to this as experimental evolution.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:26.680]   We subject bacteria to different selection pressure,
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:30.600]   project them through bottlenecks.
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:35.440]   Every day, we randomly collect a handful of bacteria
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:38.800]   from the flask, put them in a new fresh environment
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.520]   with fresh food, keep them in this environment for 24 hours
[01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:45.160]   until they reach a more dormant state.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:48.600]   And then we subject, introduce them to a new environment.
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:53.600]   So we repeated this for about, I will say, 150 days.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:58.280]   So every day, nonstop, we repeated this experiment.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:02.240]   - So kind of how many different kinds
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.640]   of environments are there?
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:06.200]   - We kept the environments to the same
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.040]   because we had different initial conditions.
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:10.920]   We kept the environment constant, same temperature,
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:14.160]   same food, same source of carbon,
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:19.160]   but we created replicates for each lineage.
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:22.720]   So in some ways, we created our own fossil record
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:25.840]   in the lab by evolving and generating these flasks.
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:30.680]   And every step of the way, we also froze these cells
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:33.760]   and took stocks of them in the cryo-freezer.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.760]   - How long does it take to go from one generation
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.080]   to the next of bacteria?
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:41.300]   - For E. coli, it's usually 20 minutes.
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:43.480]   - Okay, great.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:46.600]   So that's the experiment. - That's the experiment.
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:50.480]   - And you're always messing with it in the same way
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:52.600]   for the initial condition? - It's the same way.
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:55.720]   So we introduced variation at the elongation level
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:59.880]   because we perturbed it with different elongations.
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:03.320]   We found that if we introduce a different protein
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:06.600]   that is very different, the cells don't like that, right?
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:11.600]   So if the distance is larger, the consequences also large,
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.680]   meaning that you hit them harder.
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.280]   If you introduce a variant that is really foreign to them,
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:17.560]   that's really distant.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.520]   In our case, it was the ancestor.
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.340]   They really did not like the ancestor,
[01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:23.640]   but they were okay with their nearest cousin.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.000]   - Right, okay, great.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.840]   So you did vary in the distance.
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:29.680]   - We varied the evolutionary distance
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:33.440]   and then we kept the experimental conditions the same
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:38.280]   and we propagated these populations every day for 150 days
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:42.880]   and we collected bacteria at every step of the way
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.920]   and looked at the sequence.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:47.240]   We wanted to understand what sort of changes
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:49.020]   may have happened in the genome
[01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:53.940]   to respond to the variation that we've introduced.
[01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:56.180]   - So what kind of changes would you be seeing
[01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:57.680]   depending on the evolutionary distance
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.100]   of the thing you shoved into it?
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:01.080]   - Exactly, so we knew where we punched, right?
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.560]   We punched right at the heart, right?
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:03.960]   We punched the translation.
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:08.800]   So we expected, is it gonna be, is it translation?
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:10.760]   Are we gonna see a change?
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.120]   Will translation respond to this
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:13.840]   by fixing itself right away?
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:18.360]   Or will it be another, outside of translation,
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:20.320]   something completely different, a different module,
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:23.000]   because translation itself is a module?
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.480]   Or will it be within elongation,
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:28.080]   a really sub-protein level thing?
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:33.080]   So we had a strategy to identify the mutational pathways
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:37.640]   by categorizing what we expected to find or where.
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:43.280]   - Okay, so why does it not do multitasking?
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:48.740]   Why is it not improving multiple things simultaneously?
[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:51.980]   - It turned out that what we observed in general
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:54.980]   is that first of all, the harder we hit the cells,
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:57.500]   the more likely they were to respond to our changes, right,
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.820]   at where we hit it.
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:00.700]   - When you say hit it,
[01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:02.380]   you mean like changing something about the elongation?
[01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:03.380]   - I like to think of it as hitting,
[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:06.260]   because I like to think of this as breaking the cell, right?
[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:08.300]   I mean, not breaking enough to kill it,
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:10.520]   but we still, because they're still alive,
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.340]   they're not doing their job well.
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:16.040]   - So the bigger the evolutionary distance
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.900]   of the thing you put in there,
[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:20.980]   the harder the hit is how you think about it?
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:21.980]   The bigger the hammer?
[01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:22.820]   - Bigger the hammer, exactly.
[01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:24.340]   - That you hit it with, okay.
[01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:25.420]   - That's what it turned out to be,
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:26.820]   'cause that's what the data told us,
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:30.160]   that if the variation is higher,
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:34.140]   then the consequences will also be higher,
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:36.580]   in the sense that the cells will not grow as healthy
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:40.620]   compared to a variant that is coming from a near,
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:43.900]   or a variant that is coming from a near evolutionary distance.
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:45.860]   - Is it wrong to think of this kind of hitting
[01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:49.980]   as akin to a mutation, or no?
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:51.580]   What are we supposed to learn from this hitting?
[01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:55.800]   Like how the thing evolves after it's being hit in this way,
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:56.820]   what does that teach us?
[01:09:56.820 --> 01:10:00.460]   - Because we see translation machinery as almost,
[01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:03.780]   it is so conserved and so essential,
[01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:06.500]   it is not even clear whether we can remove some of the parts
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.740]   or whether the entire translation will need
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:11.100]   all of the same parts in the same efficiency.
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:14.540]   We don't understand the rules of this machinery.
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:16.980]   So the first thing we understand is that,
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:17.820]   what is the resilience?
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:19.300]   What are we really talking about here
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:22.100]   when we talk about you cannot mess with this translation?
[01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:23.460]   Is this true?
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:26.160]   Because it is so conserved and so similar
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:29.320]   and functions in the most conserved ways,
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.160]   that was the first thing that we wanted to understand.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.240]   - Did you learn anything interesting about the resilience
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:35.160]   at the chemical, physical, informatic,
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:36.000]   computational, biological?
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.320]   - No, I wouldn't say that,
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.480]   I think the biological level, yes,
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.800]   because we found that the different modules
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:46.520]   started responding to the changes that we've introduced,
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:50.320]   and that we could never recover the translation
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.000]   as effectively as it used to be.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   So that it never reached to it is optimality,
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.900]   that it was always suboptimal.
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:01.460]   It needed say one more mutation perhaps to get there,
[01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:04.660]   it accumulated four mutations that was,
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:07.700]   we did a lot of experiments to understand this of course,
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:09.460]   it was accumulating mutations,
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:11.680]   it was getting better at its task,
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.780]   maybe it needed a couple other mutations
[01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:14.940]   to get really good at it,
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:16.860]   but somehow those mutations never happened.
[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:18.820]   And before those mutations happened,
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:23.320]   we saw another module emerging through mutations
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.680]   and getting better at its own different tasks
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:27.340]   that is not translation.
[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:30.460]   You can think of cell as a web of networks, right?
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:34.180]   And we think of these as multiple almost airports
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:36.880]   that are proteins that are more central hubs,
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.280]   versus their proteins that maybe are not as important hub.
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:43.280]   If you introduce a problem in the most populated hub,
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:46.340]   you're gonna mess up the traffic system more drastically.
[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:49.000]   And that's what we were messing with
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.720]   in the biological terms as well.
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.000]   - So when we say module,
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.600]   like translation would be one of the modules.
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:55.520]   - Translation would be one.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:59.120]   - So you're basically saying when you mess with translation,
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:04.120]   the organism would choose to either try to fix that module
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.860]   or another module, depending.
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:07.700]   - Exactly.
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:09.040]   - But it wouldn't do multiple modules.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:10.220]   - It wouldn't do multiple modules.
[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:12.240]   It focused on one module at a time.
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:14.160]   And right before that module maybe reached
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:18.160]   to its own maximum, it stalled its optimality
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:19.080]   at a certain degree.
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:23.200]   So you never get to a degree that is more optimal
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:24.320]   than you can achieve,
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:26.960]   even though perhaps another mutation could get you there.
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:29.720]   - Since you messed with the translation
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.400]   from a sort of optimal perspective,
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:33.240]   wouldn't it make sense for the cell
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:35.960]   to try to start fixing the translation?
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:37.520]   - That's exactly what we thought.
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.980]   And it was not the case
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:41.240]   for all the broken translation missionaries.
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:44.640]   For instance, if the variant was coming from a near ancestor,
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:45.880]   that didn't happen.
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:49.000]   It was almost cruising around, trying different modules
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.960]   and sort of living its best life still without,
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:53.720]   because there is no real urgency in the system
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:56.040]   to fix the most important problem.
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:58.640]   - And there's also not a direction.
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:02.520]   Maybe to you it's obvious that's the problem,
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:05.320]   but to the cell, maybe you're the problem.
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:08.320]   I'm living, like you said, my best life.
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.240]   I mean, I guess that's the thing about evolution
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:14.040]   is we don't know what the right direction to-
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:15.800]   - Yeah, it's almost like you can imagine
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:19.000]   that you have this messy closet and you can-
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:19.840]   - Go on.
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:25.040]   Happens to be an accurate representation of my life.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.880]   - So you take a look at it
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:30.680]   and you see all the sweaters or jeans all over the place.
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:32.280]   And then you look at a drawer
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:34.480]   that has socks coming out of it.
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:35.880]   And you'd think that's the most important one.
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:37.600]   I'm just gonna fix that one.
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.760]   And then you fix that one.
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:40.160]   And then you think you will get to the other one,
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.960]   but you don't because you just fix the most important one.
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.000]   That is the, whatever that was getting into your way.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.240]   That's really what evolution is.
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:48.120]   It's quite lazy.
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:50.520]   It fixes the problem that seems to be the most immediate
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:53.280]   and it doesn't go beyond what it really needs to.
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.080]   It seems like at least for our experimental setup,
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:56.800]   that was the case.
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:59.640]   - Especially for rapidly evolving systems.
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:02.000]   So like, or is the environment they're operating
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.800]   in pretty constrained?
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:06.200]   Like, is there an urgency?
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:07.520]   - I would say that we definitely
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:08.560]   constrain the environment.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:13.560]   It's definitely removed from their natural setup.
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:16.120]   We are not evolving them in a gut.
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.600]   It's a very homogeneous system,
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:20.360]   very controlled temperature,
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.880]   controlled food, controlled carbon.
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.200]   - So just looking at that,
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.200]   let me ask the romantic question.
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.160]   How did evolution create so much beautiful,
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:30.440]   complex variety on earth?
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:34.080]   Like from that, you're saying that we're talking
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:35.520]   about improving different modules,
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:37.800]   but if we step back and look at the entirety of the tree
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:39.720]   or the different organisms that created
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:41.760]   all throughout history,
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:45.960]   the stuff that's fun to you with the first few billion
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:49.480]   and the stuff that's fun to me when I watch on YouTube,
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:53.280]   which is like the lion versus gorilla fights and so on,
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.200]   but the whole thing is fun.
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:56.880]   So with all that beautiful variety
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:58.440]   from the predator and the prey,
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:01.640]   from the self-replicating bacteria
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:04.560]   and all that kind of stuff, how did it do it?
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:07.240]   - How is a very difficult question,
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:11.360]   especially when we don't understand the past
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:13.120]   with clarity at all.
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:17.480]   I can tell you that there seems to be very critical
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:21.320]   innovations that happened throughout the history of life
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:26.320]   that are each themselves very sophisticated singularities
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:30.360]   that emerged once and then they set the tone.
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:34.160]   One of which is emergence of translation.
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:36.240]   It's seems like it happened once.
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.640]   It had to happen once.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:39.880]   It seems like that's all it took.
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.000]   3.8 billion year, maybe older,
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.720]   clearly subjected to a lot of chemical evolution
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:50.120]   even prior to last universal common ancestor.
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:55.120]   And then you jump and you see emergence of cyanobacteria
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:16:01.760]   that's undeniably changed the course of those planets
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:07.680]   in the subsequent aerobic photosynthesis that's life learned
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:12.480]   how to utilize what's available in the environment
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:14.440]   in the most profound way.
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:15.640]   And then you move forward,
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:18.720]   you see the emergence of eukaryotes,
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:23.040]   that is endosymbiosis, also another singular event.
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.960]   And then you move forward and then comes the plants.
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:29.880]   So these are, I counted, I think six different things
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:32.920]   that seems to have happened just once.
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:34.640]   - And the singularity events
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.320]   in the history of evolution of life on earth.
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:39.400]   - So what's really fascinating here
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:42.000]   is that there seems to be two different courses,
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.440]   the time course.
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:46.520]   Evolution is operating at the molecular level.
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:49.040]   We're talking about seconds.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.360]   We're talking about mutations that happen every second.
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.680]   We're talking about selection
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:55.240]   that's also happening under a minute.
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:57.540]   So that is a very fast process.
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:00.800]   The fact that I can evolve bacteria in a lab
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.120]   and I say, almost complaining,
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:06.160]   "Oh my goodness, it took me 150 days."
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:10.100]   I mean, that's pretty rapid for a change to be seen.
[01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:14.400]   But then the big changes and the ones that I'm talking,
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:18.560]   the really big innovations that caused an increase
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:22.160]   of oxygen on this planet or even its own mere presence
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.640]   are due to these molecular innovations.
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.280]   Seems to only happen a handful of times
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:29.400]   over billions of years of timescale.
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:30.800]   - Let me ask you this question
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:33.260]   having to do with my half asleep tweet.
[01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:37.880]   So saying that we all originated from one common ancestor,
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:43.480]   that's just one of the miraculous things
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:45.640]   about life on earth.
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:47.960]   Of course, you could say there's multiple common ancestors
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:50.480]   in the beginning, multiple organisms and so on.
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:52.440]   But the other stuff that you're talking about
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:54.540]   is these singular events,
[01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:58.840]   these leaps of invention throughout evolutionary history.
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.820]   Now there's a bunch of people who were commenting,
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:03.580]   a bit surprising to me,
[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:06.860]   who were basically skeptical of this idea.
[01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:07.860]   - The idea of?
[01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:10.780]   - Well, I would say evolution, honestly.
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:12.020]   The process of evolution,
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:15.460]   but when you just actually focus in on like,
[01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:20.460]   "Holy crap, eukaryotes were invented.
[01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:23.180]   "Holy crap, photosynthesis was invented."
[01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:25.380]   Like those are incredible inventions.
[01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:27.980]   And also, we can even go to Homo sapiens,
[01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:30.780]   like intelligence, like where did that come from?
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:33.580]   It's these mysteries.
[01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:37.180]   I think where that skeptical comments are coming from
[01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:40.760]   were also just the general skepticism of science.
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:43.940]   I think from the pandemic,
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:46.680]   people, maybe a failure of institutions and so on,
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:51.900]   there's been a growing distrust of science.
[01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:55.180]   And it's not so much that it's anti-evolution,
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:57.980]   it's more of a stepping back and saying,
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:18:59.080]   "Wait a minute,
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:01.780]   "maybe scientists don't have it all figured out."
[01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:06.780]   And I think to steel man that case
[01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:09.780]   is almost a step back into realize
[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:13.400]   there's so much mystery to each of these leaps.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:14.900]   So it makes you wonder,
[01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:16.980]   is there something that in 100, 200 years
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:20.020]   we'll figure out that we totally don't understand yet?
[01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:22.580]   Like some, you know, there's,
[01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:25.740]   I talked to a bunch of people about another mystery,
[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:27.420]   which is consciousness, right?
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.420]   And there's people called panpsychists
[01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:31.500]   who believe consciousness
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:34.020]   is one of the fundamental laws of the universe.
[01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:36.260]   So there could be, you know,
[01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:39.300]   like we have laws of physics that could be something
[01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:43.300]   that's like a consciousness field or something
[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:45.220]   that permeates all matter.
[01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:47.480]   And so like there might be,
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:49.140]   it's kind of like Newtonian physics
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:50.940]   versus general relativity.
[01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:54.580]   Like we have a good understanding of how things happen,
[01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:57.420]   but we need another layer of understanding
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:20:00.420]   to fill in the gaps of the mysteries of it all.
[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:03.940]   And that sort of is a sobering reality
[01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:05.620]   that maybe there is something
[01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:07.460]   we really deeply don't understand.
[01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:11.900]   Do you have a sense of where the biggest mysteries here are?
[01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:14.540]   Is it at the origin of life itself?
[01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:18.360]   Is it the leaps that we're talking about?
[01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:20.660]   So you see the beauty,
[01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:23.160]   you're fascinated about the translation mechanism.
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:27.780]   What are the deep mysteries there to you?
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:33.240]   - We are nothing but chemical systems
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:36.940]   capable of formulating or answering questions
[01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:38.900]   about our own existence.
[01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:42.980]   - We humans or all of life, you think?
[01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:44.820]   - Humans, humans are,
[01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:45.900]   I mean, the fact that we can,
[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:48.200]   we even have this conversation about
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:52.360]   our place in the universe is,
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:54.320]   at least to our knowledge,
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:58.120]   is quite specific to our own chemical species.
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:00.300]   But-
[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:02.280]   - Yeah, it's kind of wild.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:05.700]   We're introspecting on our evolutionary history
[01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:08.240]   and we're just a couple of organisms.
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:09.080]   - Yes, and we're-
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:11.560]   - We're like another organism listening to this
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.960]   and like they're mind blown.
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:16.020]   There's like three organisms,
[01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:18.820]   two of them talking and the third one's like, holy shit.
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:22.940]   - I think that understanding the,
[01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:24.380]   what I really find interesting
[01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.100]   about understanding origin of life
[01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:29.700]   or even contemplating about our own place in the universe,
[01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:33.740]   if at the end of this would come down to appreciating
[01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:36.040]   or even before appreciating,
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:39.700]   really truly comprehending what it is that we got here,
[01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:43.500]   that to me is a huge gain.
[01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:47.600]   'Cause there's no single question in biology,
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:49.860]   I think, that will give that,
[01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:51.540]   that will deliver that magnitude
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:53.540]   of that message and understanding.
[01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:57.340]   But understanding how life here started at first place,
[01:21:57.340 --> 01:22:00.220]   if we truly comprehend that.
[01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:03.740]   This is not a concept that is well thought in schools.
[01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:07.180]   We ask students to memorize these concepts.
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:09.640]   If they are lucky, they learned RNA world,
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:13.220]   chicken and egg problem, et cetera.
[01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:14.900]   That's the extent to which that got,
[01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:17.540]   maybe their biology teacher was personally interested
[01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:20.180]   in the subject matter, if they're lucky.
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:25.180]   You know the saying that the brains are evenly distributed
[01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:31.860]   across any metric you can imagine, but opportunities are not.
[01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:38.340]   So if people aren't understanding the importance of this
[01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:40.860]   is because that's a lack of opportunity right there.
[01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:45.260]   That's was skipped through the proper education
[01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:49.940]   and training in the delivery of why science matters
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:51.140]   or how science actually works.
[01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:56.140]   - Yeah, but how do you even begin to seriously think
[01:22:56.140 --> 01:22:57.880]   about the origin of life?
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:04.060]   I mean, every problem of existence, of life has its time.
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:11.980]   So I don't know if it's time to understand consciousness yet.
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:14.940]   We might be a hundred years away from that.
[01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:17.900]   The origin of life, I don't know if it's time for us
[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:18.860]   to understand that yet.
[01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:22.420]   Maybe we need to solve so many more problems along the way.
[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:24.980]   - It's not a competition of problems, right?
[01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:26.980]   So there are all kinds of problems
[01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:28.900]   and it takes a lot of people to make the world.
[01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:31.940]   So you will always have some interesting brain
[01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:35.220]   going after an interesting problem to their own.
[01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:38.220]   The issue here is that we need to first of all
[01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:42.380]   understand that what we have going on on this planet
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:43.860]   is pretty good.
[01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:46.380]   Good planets are hard to find.
[01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:49.760]   If we are alone in the universe, that's huge.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:53.500]   We need to take care of what we got here.
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:57.980]   And we are incredibly vulnerable to the changes
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:24:00.860]   that our own species also helped create
[01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:04.260]   at the biosphere, at the ecosystem level.
[01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:05.980]   We take it for granted.
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:08.040]   We take what we created for granted.
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:10.860]   Because of the fact that we think we are some sort of
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:14.400]   ultimate end point, the most sophisticated, amazing thing
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.080]   that nature could generate.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:21.340]   I think understanding, not even understanding,
[01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:25.880]   but asking these questions of where did this even come from?
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:28.060]   How did this even begin?
[01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:32.940]   And attempting to understand that using chemistry
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:36.480]   and physics and biology, and because we can,
[01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:39.440]   that's the ultimate gift we can give back
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:41.580]   to the entire species on this planet.
[01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:44.600]   - Yeah, I mean, it's humbling.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.960]   It's humbling to realize the complexity
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:48.040]   of this whole mechanism.
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:51.240]   It certainly puts humans in their proper perspective.
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:54.640]   That we're not, just 'cause we have brains
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:57.080]   and brains are intelligent, doesn't mean
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:59.580]   we're the most intelligent thing.
[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:02.080]   Because ultimately the whole mechanism of nature
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:04.560]   seems to be orders of magnitude more intelligent.
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:06.580]   All of it, like we're a bunch,
[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:09.220]   we're like a hierarchy of organisms
[01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:12.100]   that have a history of several billion years.
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:14.820]   And that all somehow came together to make a human.
[01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:18.860]   And there'll be life after us, just as it was life before us.
[01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:21.100]   And something that comes after will be
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:23.180]   perhaps even more fascinating.
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:25.620]   - Yeah, I think when you understand the magnitude
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:29.060]   of what happened here, there is no room for arrogance.
[01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:31.220]   It should overwhelm you and humiliate.
[01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:32.540]   It's pretty humiliating.
[01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:33.380]   - Yeah.
[01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:38.140]   - You know, it's quite amazing what happened here.
[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:42.420]   And there is no other discipline that will deliver that.
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:46.980]   But exploring our own origins and looking at life
[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:49.340]   as a more planetary system phenomena
[01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:54.140]   rather than one single species at a time, a collective look.
[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:58.660]   - You mentioned this question in your TED Talk is,
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.000]   the two possibilities of the universe being full of life
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.040]   and the universe being empty
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:09.140]   and we're the only life in the universe.
[01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:12.760]   How do you feel about both options?
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:16.960]   Just actually you as a single chemical organism
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:21.000]   introspecting about its existence in this world.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.780]   - It's having a planet flow of life is interesting
[01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:28.400]   because there are, we talked about life being all about
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.440]   chemistry exploring solutions.
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:33.360]   And having solutions in front of you is great.
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.440]   It's beneficial, right?
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:37.120]   - Solutions being different organisms.
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:38.960]   Like other humans, you see them as a solution
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:39.800]   to a chemistry problem.
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:41.120]   - Different, yeah.
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:42.600]   - That's an interesting solution.
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.400]   That's not, next time we're in Austin
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:45.560]   so there's a bunch of weirdos.
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:47.040]   Every time I see a weirdo, I'll be like,
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:48.760]   oh, that's an interesting solution
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:50.160]   to this chemistry problem.
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:54.480]   - Now you think like an origin of life science.
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:55.320]   But it's--
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:57.480]   - Funny that that one worked out.
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:58.840]   Let's see where else it goes.
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:03.080]   - But having this emptiness and unpredictability
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:05.920]   of uncovering a novel solution
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:08.000]   can also have its own benefits.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:13.000]   And we should be open to what other solutions
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.120]   might be out there and exploring those solutions.
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:17.560]   - Or to different chemistry problems.
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:18.720]   So that's where you see-- - Different chemistry problems.
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:20.440]   - You see the other planets out there
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:21.520]   as different chemistry problems.
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:23.360]   - To their own local environment, yes.
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:28.360]   So how many chemistry problems have solutions
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:33.200]   that are lifelike to you out there in the universe?
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:35.560]   - It's a wide open palette if you think about it.
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:36.520]   I don't quite know.
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:39.560]   It's the, we know the chemistry is chemistry.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:41.720]   I don't think the chemistry will be different elsewhere.
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:43.840]   But again, what is selected by chemistry
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:46.560]   will be determined by the environment most likely.
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:51.560]   - See, I think there is life everywhere out there.
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:54.360]   So there's a guy named Nick Lane
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:59.440]   whose gut, and it's interesting to me,
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.360]   I wonder what you think about it,
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:04.240]   his gut is there's life everywhere out there,
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:06.880]   but it stops at the bacteria stage.
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:11.880]   So he says the eukaryotes is the biggest invention
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:13.440]   and the hardest one.
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:16.480]   - I wonder if he thinks that's an accidental outcome,
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:18.000]   if he thinks that's inevitable.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.520]   I wonder what that means.
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:22.200]   But it's a likely possibility
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:25.480]   that the bacterial or microbial life
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:27.240]   is definitely more attainable.
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:31.160]   - So that's a weird world
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:34.840]   where our entire galaxy just has bacteria everywhere.
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:37.280]   - So you know, if you don't like microbes,
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:39.200]   you are on the wrong planet.
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.200]   - No, I know, yeah.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:44.360]   And viruses, I don't know which one there's more of.
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:48.000]   But they're both, and most of them are productive.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:48.840]   - They're fascinating.
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:50.760]   They do everything for us.
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:53.720]   - I don't like microbes, you're on the wrong planet.
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:54.760]   You're full of good lines.
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:56.480]   Okay, right, right.
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:00.440]   I just can't, there's like an imperative to the whole thing.
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:05.440]   To me, the origin is the hard question.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:09.920]   But once it gets going, I just don't see--
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:11.080]   - Wait, go ahead.
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:13.160]   - It seems like it's constantly creating
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:15.040]   more intelligent things,
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:19.440]   more fascinating, complex things
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:21.080]   that are able to solve complicated problems.
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:23.120]   - That's a very interesting,
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:26.680]   I definitely agree that the initial steps
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:28.080]   may be the ultimate determinants.
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:31.320]   That once it's, you cannot stop it once it starts.
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:33.400]   It's possible, right?
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:34.280]   And--
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:37.880]   - I just have never on Earth, maybe, but maybe,
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:42.880]   I just, whenever I see life, it seems to flourish.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:45.320]   Everywhere.
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:49.000]   The thing is, I don't,
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.760]   the only thing I haven't seen is the start of it.
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:56.400]   - Exactly, but, and how are we gonna understand that
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:58.600]   if we don't know the origin of life science?
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:03.000]   I mean, that's the, and the question here isn't exactly
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.560]   our ability to recapitulate everything that happened
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:08.280]   in the exact way that it happened, right?
[01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:11.440]   This is about what can happen, rather than,
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:12.920]   or maybe how it can happen.
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:17.320]   - You think it's possible to study the origin of language
[01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:19.160]   using English?
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:22.720]   So, like, there's a very particular chemistry here.
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:25.160]   There's a particular set of assumptions,
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:26.880]   understanding about what life is,
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:29.720]   what everything is, our perception of reality
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:32.960]   is very specifically constructed
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:34.680]   through the evolutionary process.
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:38.640]   I wonder if it's possible to get to some first principles,
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:42.080]   deep understanding of how life originates
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:44.160]   in such a way that you can actually
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:46.760]   construct it on other planets.
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:49.160]   Ultimately, it feels like if you're doing it
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:53.360]   in a lab on Earth, you're always going to be using
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:56.840]   some aspect of the life that's already here.
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:31:01.840]   - So, that's what I sort of talked about in my talk as well.
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:05.440]   And-- - Everyone should go
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:08.800]   watch the TED Talks, very good.
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:10.960]   The annoying thing to me about TED Talks,
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:13.320]   I guess it's by design, is they're too short.
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:14.880]   It's like, come on.
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:19.720]   - And did you know that there's no prompter involved?
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:21.280]   - There's no, wait, there is?
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:22.440]   - There isn't.
[01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:24.320]   - Yeah, you have to memorize stuff.
[01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:26.040]   - It's a--
[01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:27.720]   - It must be a grueling process.
[01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:30.520]   - Amazing editor who probably is watching this too,
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:33.200]   David Bielo, that was very, very helpful.
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:34.720]   But I would say that--
[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:35.560]   - Very professional organization.
[01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:38.920]   I like this podcast, it's a very professional organization.
[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:40.760]   I respect that medium.
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:45.640]   Yeah, anyway, in the TED Talk about, yeah, life,
[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:46.880]   life creating life.
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:51.880]   - So, it's a likely scenario that once we understand
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:57.120]   how life as a chemical system is capable
[01:31:57.120 --> 01:32:04.440]   of formulating its own expression and generating a memory
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:08.800]   and manages its existence on a planetary body
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:11.000]   for billions of years,
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:16.000]   once we understand what conditions gave rise to that,
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:21.120]   we may be very likely to understand
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:26.040]   whether a different planet also be likely
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:29.480]   to instigate its own chemical revolution
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:34.480]   if it was provided through some missing ingredients.
[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:37.480]   So you can think of it as a sending fertilizer
[01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:39.240]   to a different planet that is missing
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:41.840]   its own chemical composition or lacking
[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:46.280]   or that it needs more of what it has.
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:50.040]   The difference between making that planet Earth-like,
[01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:52.040]   which was, this is not what that's about.
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:53.880]   We're not talking about terraforming
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:56.040]   or we're not talking about turning that planet
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:58.400]   into Earth-like system.
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:01.960]   We are talking about first understanding that planet,
[01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:06.320]   studying its chemistry, studying its properties well enough
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:08.960]   to understand whether it is close
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:11.080]   to its own chemical revolution
[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:14.240]   and maybe giving it that extra nudge.
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:19.160]   So this is obviously a pretty big speculation and suggestion.
[01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:22.080]   And it's a very interesting proposition
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:24.920]   because this is a yes or no question, right?
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:26.840]   This is the ultimate would you rather.
[01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:31.560]   And I think it says a lot about the perception
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:34.080]   of the person who's answering this question.
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:37.160]   That if the answer is no, no, no, absolutely not.
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:39.000]   That's not something we wanna do.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000]   I wanna know why that is the case.
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.600]   - So just to be clear, what we're talking about
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:45.560]   is looking at the chemical cocktail of a particular planet
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:51.640]   and having like tasting it and seeing what's missing.
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:55.040]   So having a very systematic, rigorous,
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:58.320]   scientific process for understanding what is missing.
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:00.720]   Not what is missing in terms of to make it Earth-like,
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:05.320]   but what is missing in order to be sufficiently,
[01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:09.000]   have the spark or the capacity of the spark
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:13.320]   to launch the evolution revolution,
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:14.960]   the evolutionary process.
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:15.800]   - Exactly, so--
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:16.720]   - And then the question is,
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:21.480]   do we want to then complete the cocktail?
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:24.640]   - The proposition is to also make us think
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:28.160]   that we will likely have this capacity at some point,
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:32.400]   especially when we understand origin of life
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:34.320]   better and better, right?
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:37.440]   So we will be asking ourselves this question.
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:40.400]   I guess I wanted to bring this to daylight a little bit
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:44.920]   because maybe in 10, 20 years, maybe more.
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:46.800]   - So you wanted to ask the ethical question,
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:51.800]   should we basically start life elsewhere on another planet?
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:59.920]   Or enable the chemical capacity of that planet
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:03.840]   that it may one day itself get there?
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:07.360]   - Okay, so for me, the answer is yes.
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:10.900]   So if you were to try to argue against my yes,
[01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:11.740]   what would you say?
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:12.720]   Why not?
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:14.880]   What's the worst that can happen
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:17.880]   if we seed another planet with life?
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:19.720]   What are the things we should think about?
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:23.280]   Is your main concern a chemical biological one
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:25.360]   or is it an ethical one?
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:26.200]   What do you think about?
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:27.440]   - Well, the worst thing that can happen
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:29.240]   is that it wouldn't work, right?
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:34.240]   So that it's not likely that an attempt like this would work.
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:38.880]   That's probably, 'cause how do you--
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:39.720]   - I think so.
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:43.580]   - You gotta be very, you have to have an understanding
[01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:45.760]   that I don't think we have just yet.
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:47.820]   - I see 'cause if it doesn't work,
[01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:50.040]   then we could try again, right?
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:56.360]   - To me, the worst case, the thing I would be worried about
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:00.600]   is we create life, I mean, the same stuff I worry about
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:04.800]   like with plants is things that might have
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:06.800]   a conscious experience.
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:11.240]   And then the dark aspect of life
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:15.560]   is life is increasingly a complex life.
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:17.160]   Maybe I'm anthropomorphizing,
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:19.960]   but it seems to have the capacity to suffer.
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:24.800]   And so we're creating something.
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:26.600]   It's like when you have children,
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:29.720]   you put creatures into this world
[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:36.100]   that will suffer, can suffer and may suffer
[01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:40.000]   depending on how you view life, may likely suffer.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.540]   And so now you carry this responsibility
[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:45.520]   for doing your best to alleviate any suffering
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:46.680]   that might go through.
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:51.000]   And that perhaps is a romanticizing this notion
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:55.240]   of life, perhaps bacteria are not capable of suffering,
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:58.000]   but perhaps it'll create more complex life forms
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.620]   that would be able to suffer.
[01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:05.360]   And that feels like a responsibility as well.
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:07.680]   Of course, other people would be concerned.
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:10.360]   The more obvious concern is like,
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:12.040]   well, you just created a life form.
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:14.920]   How do you know it's not gonna be a super deadly virus
[01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:17.740]   that somehow is able to hurt humans?
[01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:19.200]   Yeah, my concern is more,
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:21.240]   I feel like that's a solvable problem.
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:24.760]   The problem of creating conscious beings
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:27.280]   that are able to suffer, that's a tricky one.
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:31.600]   - Yeah, I can see why, because it goes back to, again,
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:36.600]   would we, first of all, do we have a responsibility
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:41.940]   to propagate more of this chemistry
[01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:45.000]   that we have on this planet elsewhere,
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.880]   given that we know ultimately we will be vanished
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:52.000]   by the entire planet?
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:58.360]   And if this is in fact a very rare chemical event
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:02.200]   that happens because all the right circumstances
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:05.520]   came together and we were the lucky one,
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:09.960]   do we have a responsibility to sponsor it?
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:12.880]   If we were to back up--
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:14.040]   - Sponsor, I like it.
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:14.960]   (Lex laughing)
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:16.360]   That's a good way to put it, yeah.
[01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:21.000]   - If we try to back up remnants of our civilization,
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:26.000]   so we wanna potentially create conditions
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.560]   on the different planets so that humans can survive,
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:32.360]   given that we know, or we want to,
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:35.480]   just for the sake of growing.
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:39.240]   - Yeah, propagating, becoming a multi-planetary species.
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:42.320]   - Exactly, but what really is at stake here,
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:44.840]   I think is actually, or what is really more interesting
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:48.640]   is what we don't see, which is, again,
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:51.400]   that chemical behavior that enabled everything
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:52.440]   in the first place.
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:56.360]   That's different than sending potato crops
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:59.000]   or engineering bacteria to live on a different planet.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.560]   That's very different.
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:05.560]   You are really stripping it down to what is possible
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:08.000]   at the chemical level.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.000]   So even if you are instigating the chemistry
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.040]   on different planets, you are letting that very planet
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:16.720]   to do its thing.
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:19.320]   You're not necessarily contaminating this planet
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:22.880]   with different chemistry, because the idea behind this,
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:26.080]   at least the way I thought about,
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:28.320]   is that you understand that planet,
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:29.560]   you understand the conditions,
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:32.440]   you understand the chemistry of the planet really well
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:37.440]   before choosing the planet as a candidate at first place.
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:42.480]   And then it's not about sending a missing ingredient per se,
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:45.760]   but again, just sending more of what it already has.
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:50.280]   That will be respecting that planet's condition too.
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:52.440]   So I'm not suggesting any occupation.
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:54.600]   I'm not suggesting any colonization.
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:57.400]   I'm not suggesting any, like, let's just strip everything
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:39:59.480]   and make everything Earth-like.
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:00.800]   That's not what I'm saying.
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:03.360]   It's more about empowering that place.
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:06.960]   What you are saying is likely to be
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:10.000]   the motivator behind all this.
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.240]   That's not, because I see suffering, I see pain.
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:14.680]   It's very interesting.
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:17.000]   I think this is a question that really reveals
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.040]   a lot about the person who's answering it.
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:24.120]   - Well, okay, so the pushback on my pushback.
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:28.840]   If I saw deeply troubled by suffering,
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:30.800]   then I should be probably paralyzed
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:32.520]   about the history of life on Earth.
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:36.560]   And, you know, there's--
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:38.560]   - Can you elaborate, what do you mean?
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:41.640]   - Most of life who's ever lived,
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:45.400]   suffered in ways that are almost unimaginable to me.
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:48.360]   - You mean, like, our own species?
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:51.920]   - Our own species and before, and animals living today.
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:54.400]   And we're not even talking about factory farms.
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:41:01.120]   We're just animals living in extreme poverty in the jungle.
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:04.240]   You don't, people think like in the natural environment,
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:06.120]   animals live in a happy place.
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:10.240]   No, it's a brutal place of desperately trying to survive,
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:12.400]   of desperately trying to look for food.
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:15.520]   And it's just like all of that life, that's just mammals.
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:18.640]   And we understand mammals, but like throughout,
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:22.520]   like trillions of organisms that led up to those mammals.
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:25.640]   And the organisms living everywhere, like even bacteria,
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:27.320]   there's death everywhere.
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:31.600]   So maybe this idea of death, this idea of suffering,
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:35.160]   is actually, this thing that we see as a bug,
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:37.280]   is actually a feature.
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:39.960]   - I don't think suffering is a linear property
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:42.040]   like that with life.
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:44.160]   And I may be with Nick Lane on this one,
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:46.600]   that the likeliness of anything similar
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:49.920]   to what we got here, evolving in another planetary body,
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:51.800]   I think is quite low.
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:55.920]   - Where would you say is the biggest unlikely thing?
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:57.000]   Do you mean humans,
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.160]   or do you mean even multicellular organisms?
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:01.720]   - Probably multicellular, multicellularly.
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:07.480]   But I understand both sides of the equation, right?
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:12.440]   In one level, I can see that we may not have
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:17.440]   any other choice, but to back up this chemistry
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:18.640]   somewhere else.
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:22.600]   So you would be saving, it's the ultimate saving,
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:24.920]   or our own record.
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:29.640]   It's not about, yes, let's also save Beatles
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:32.120]   and all the amazing songs, but this would be
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:35.720]   the ultimate repository of life.
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:39.600]   But I can also see your point of view, for sure.
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:40.760]   - It's really interesting.
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:44.480]   So like, don't seed a plant with a missing ingredient.
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:47.640]   Try to understand what the ingredients it has.
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:49.640]   Is it possible to construct life?
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:53.720]   For me, from a computer person,
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:54.760]   it just feels like something
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:56.800]   that could be solved computationally.
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:00.280]   We can learn from the mistakes that we've done here
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:03.760]   and aspire not to repeat them.
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:05.280]   It is possible.
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:07.040]   We do amazing things as humans.
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:08.080]   There's a lot of suffering,
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:09.560]   but there's also a lot of beauty.
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:14.560]   And we could choose what we want to be,
[01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:20.520]   or what we want to see, right?
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:23.360]   So these attempts don't need not to come from,
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:25.800]   need not to come from a place of fear,
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:27.040]   but it can be ultimately,
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:29.120]   can come from a piece of hope and love.
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:32.000]   - I think we're just very recently figuring out stuff.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.800]   Like we've, even just a century ago,
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:36.600]   we're doing atrocities that weren't seen
[01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:38.400]   as atrocities at the time.
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:42.040]   I mean, I think we're learning very quickly
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:43.280]   of what is right and wrong.
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:45.400]   - Yes, and I work with a lot of,
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:47.200]   maybe because I'm at the university,
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:50.640]   I get to teach young people every day,
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:56.600]   even at a time of four year or three, few years,
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:44:01.480]   you see generational difference already
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:03.360]   unfolding in front of you.
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:05.920]   And maybe that's why I see hope,
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:10.920]   because I think what we get to interact with in classrooms,
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:14.000]   every year, it's just getting better.
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.520]   They are aware of issues in a way
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:19.760]   that I sure wasn't at their age.
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:20.800]   Some levels I was,
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:23.600]   but in many levels I didn't think about.
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:25.960]   I wasn't concerned of the problems.
[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:28.360]   Well, they maybe have to be concerned
[01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:30.360]   because it's hitting the reality,
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:31.360]   he's hitting them hard,
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:34.800]   but younger people are not afraid of these things.
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:37.520]   An 18 year old can face these brutal facts
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:39.840]   about the planet in ways that I don't think
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.920]   any other generation before them did.
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:42.800]   - Yeah, it's super cool.
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:45.560]   And like the, you know,
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:47.480]   there's all these cool technologies
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:51.880]   that aid in the process of a human being
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:55.320]   being able to see the truth at deeper, deeper levels,
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:58.400]   like, you know, Wikipedia and just the internet in general
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:00.400]   is enabling education at a level
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:02.160]   that was unimaginable before the internet.
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:05.040]   - Yes, and I think space exploration,
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:07.400]   even contemplating about these possibilities,
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:10.560]   ultimately, and I will emphasize this again,
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:14.440]   should make us think about our own place in the universe.
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:17.320]   If we are alone, that is quite fascinating.
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:19.280]   And we definitely have a responsibility
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:22.200]   to guard what we got better and protect it better
[01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:24.040]   and don't take it for granted.
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:25.680]   If we are not the only one,
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:27.320]   that's also a lot of responsibility
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:30.240]   to understand what else is out there.
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:33.840]   So either proposition, as famously being told,
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:38.560]   is fascinating, but as a scientist, I think,
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:41.760]   and I think that's a general behavior,
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:44.320]   maybe not my fellow scientists listening to this
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:45.720]   can correct me if they aren't like this,
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:49.920]   but you need to have a level of optimism and hope.
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:51.800]   That's something, you know,
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:54.640]   that things are worth working for,
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:57.120]   worth dreaming, worth imagining.
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:46:01.320]   And we cannot just have fear of suffering or fear of pain
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:05.840]   stopping us from doing marvelous things.
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:08.040]   - I've talked to quite a few people in my life
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:10.840]   who've gotten a lot of shit done,
[01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:13.040]   have helped a lot of people.
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:15.600]   And I don't know a single one of them
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:17.560]   who's not an optimist.
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:20.920]   Now, there's a place for critics and cynicism in this world,
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:24.360]   but in terms of actually building things
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:27.660]   and creating things in this world that help a lot of people,
[01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:32.520]   I think optimism is a requirement, is a precondition,
[01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:33.840]   in almost all cases,
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:38.160]   in my limited, humble human experience.
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:40.280]   But I tend to, when I look out there,
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:42.240]   think that aliens are everywhere.
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:43.380]   I think there's,
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:47.280]   to me, I have a humility about,
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:51.300]   I tend to see us humans as being very limited cognitively.
[01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:55.800]   Like, there's so many things we don't understand.
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:58.280]   I think eventually we'll understand,
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:01.200]   of course, we don't know this, but my gut says,
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:04.520]   we'll understand that alien signals
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:08.080]   and life has been all around us,
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:09.660]   and we're too dumb to see it.
[01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:14.080]   Like, whatever life is, whatever the life force is,
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:16.240]   whatever consciousness is, whatever intelligence,
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:21.240]   whatever the mechanism that led to the origin of life
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:25.560]   on Earth was everywhere, and we're just too dumb to see it.
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:26.600]   It's in the physics.
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:29.380]   It's somewhere, we'll find it somewhere in the physics.
[01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:34.880]   - I think that's one of the most humbling parts
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:37.200]   of also being a scientist,
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:41.080]   that we know that we never know for sure.
[01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:45.200]   And for the outsiders, perhaps,
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:50.200]   that may be a very strange way of living,
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:55.400]   especially when your pursuit is about creating knowledge,
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:59.320]   and that you'll know that what you created can also be,
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:02.760]   and hopefully will be disproven
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:04.940]   so that another level will rise.
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:11.240]   And I think we've seen that, this lack of maybe connection
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:14.640]   between the approach to science or knowledge
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:17.520]   versus folks who are maybe not thinking
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:19.200]   about these problems every day,
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:21.600]   that we are okay with being wrong.
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:23.880]   In fact, we know that that's the only way
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:26.160]   to push the limits of knowledge.
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:29.480]   - How do you think life originated on Earth?
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:31.480]   We've talked about this a bit.
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:34.400]   Do you have a gut feeling about,
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:36.440]   first of all, actually even to step back,
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:39.720]   do you think, 'cause you were flirting with this idea,
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:42.760]   did the translation mechanism came before life?
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:44.640]   - I think that you cannot separate
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:47.560]   from emergence of translation machinery
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:48.800]   from emergence of life,
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:51.200]   or something like translation machinery,
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:55.720]   this whole informatic chemical computing system
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:49:00.560]   that is also capable of dynamism and evolvability
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:04.080]   that comes with biology, biological behavior,
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:06.240]   from emergence of life itself.
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:08.720]   We've definitely took a lot of steps
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:10.040]   towards understanding origins.
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:15.040]   We are able to create molecules from environments,
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:20.640]   lightning, heat, and you make amino acids.
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:23.200]   So we are able to create the building blocks,
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:27.860]   the Miller-Urey experiment, that's now 60 years ago.
[01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:32.400]   We are able to create the building blocks,
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:34.760]   we are able to make them interact with one another.
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:37.680]   They can get more complex, some call this messy,
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:39.200]   there's all this chemistry that's going on.
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:43.480]   We are able to have these chemicals interact with one another,
[01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:48.480]   maybe have even some emergent properties
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:49.880]   that we can quantify.
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:53.240]   Definitely there is this trend
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:57.360]   towards more systems-level approach to origins,
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:00.560]   more introduction of systems-level chemistry,
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:02.720]   more network-level chemistry,
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:05.040]   and complex system integration
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:07.240]   in order to understand how,
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:08.760]   now that we can make these building blocks,
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:10.160]   we can make them interact with one another,
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:11.760]   but how do we make them interact with one another
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:12.880]   in more intelligent ways
[01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:16.840]   that will have the properties of a biological system,
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:20.120]   will be heritable, it will be responding to the environment,
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:22.960]   it will mutate, and it will sustain itself.
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:25.080]   That is the final bit, I think,
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:29.480]   in our origin of life adventure.
[01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:31.600]   And we are extremely close.
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:33.560]   I'm very optimistic that our community
[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:37.200]   will get a handle of this problem in this decade.
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:38.040]   This is, in fact, I think,
[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:41.040]   one of the most exciting times to be doing this work.
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:43.320]   - What would be super convincing to you,
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:48.320]   like incredibly amazing, would blow your mind
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:52.400]   if X was done in a lab?
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:55.560]   Like what would, I mean,
[01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:58.000]   I don't know if you would call it origin of life,
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.480]   but something really truly remarkable
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:01.840]   and special done in a lab.
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:03.400]   What would that look like to you?
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:05.480]   - The properties that I listed,
[01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:08.200]   this was five properties that I listed about
[01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:11.480]   in the machinery that is capable of sensing
[01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:13.200]   and responding to the environment.
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:17.960]   If we can, I would imagine,
[01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:19.800]   similar to Miller-Urey experiments
[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:24.800]   where they only sparked particular environmental forces
[01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:29.400]   and were able to produce a chemical
[01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:30.600]   that is important for life,
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:33.760]   or a mix of chemicals important for life,
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:35.120]   or building blocks rather,
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:39.480]   if I saw that a similar experiment
[01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:43.000]   that a well-defined geochemical parameter
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:46.840]   was subjected on a mix of chemistry,
[01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:51.840]   which led that chemistry to form some level of computation,
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:55.560]   informatic, biological property,
[01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:58.200]   and by biological, I'm gonna keep it to very minimum,
[01:51:58.200 --> 01:52:01.400]   as I defined early on,
[01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:04.600]   that would be super exciting to me,
[01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:07.400]   a self-organizing chemistry
[01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:10.160]   that we can create experimentally in a flask
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:13.600]   by simulating the conditions of early Earth,
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:17.440]   be it radiation, be it temperature, or mix of both,
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:20.280]   that would be very cool.
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:21.520]   - And doing all the five,
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:24.880]   the chemical, physical, informatic, computational, biological.
[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:26.280]   - Yes.
[01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:29.880]   - So like simulation and a computer would not--
[01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:30.720]   - No.
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:31.560]   - Would not be good enough.
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:33.520]   - It would be great because they help
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:36.520]   to understand the parameters,
[01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:39.680]   maybe formulate, maybe quantify, create models,
[01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:41.720]   but ultimately you need to experiment.
[01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:43.680]   - Unless it's quantum mechanical simulation,
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:45.520]   but that's going to be extremely difficult.
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:47.680]   So simulating from the physics up,
[01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:49.920]   that's going to be very,
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:51.920]   'cause you're gonna have to simulate
[01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:54.920]   the physical, the chemical, the informatic.
[01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:59.040]   I mean, honestly, it's very difficult
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:01.080]   to start the quantum mechanics
[01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:04.360]   and end up in biology all through simulation.
[01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:06.800]   But the stuff that DeepMind did with alpha fold
[01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:08.800]   and protein folding is really inspiring.
[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:13.360]   It's inspiring in that you're able to do,
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:14.800]   to solve a difficult biology problem.
[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:15.800]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:19.160]   That's why there's definitely a lot of benefits
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:21.240]   to those models, predictions,
[01:53:21.240 --> 01:53:25.440]   'cause they at least help the experimentalist
[01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:27.640]   to come up with the priors
[01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:29.240]   and parameterize things better,
[01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:33.160]   maybe eliminates very obvious dead ends early on,
[01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:35.480]   given that experiments take such a long time
[01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:36.880]   and it's a huge investment.
[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:42.160]   And no one's a better experimentalist than nature, so.
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:46.800]   - Let me ask you perhaps a depressing, sad for you question.
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:47.640]   - You really want to make me sad.
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:48.800]   You're not gonna win.
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:50.240]   - No, I know.
[01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:52.120]   There's a flame of optimism in you
[01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:53.360]   that will never be extinguished.
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:57.120]   Okay, the idea of panspermia.
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:54:02.540]   You mentioned would we seed another planet with life?
[01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:04.880]   Is it possible that our planet
[01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:06.920]   was seeded with life from elsewhere?
[01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:10.120]   - So what the proposition I made,
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:12.640]   I like to think of it as protospermia
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:13.760]   rather than panspermia,
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:15.480]   because it's even more,
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:19.320]   it's a more proto state than acknowledging.
[01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:23.440]   Because in panspermia, you still have a cell, right?
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:25.520]   You still have something that is very,
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:28.600]   even a cell to me would be very Earth-like, right?
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:31.680]   I'm talking at sub-cellular level
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:36.680]   in the proposition of spreading chemistry.
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:40.400]   - So spreading chemical ingredients, not spreading life.
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:41.400]   - Exactly.
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:43.160]   It will be more like the fertilizer
[01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:45.880]   that is well-adopted and compatible
[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:46.880]   with that planetary body.
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:49.240]   In panspermia, you're still imagining
[01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:52.680]   either an entire bacteria or microbe or a cell
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:55.920]   or something that is DNA, which is still Terran.
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:59.840]   - So in that sense, that doesn't matter to you
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:02.760]   'cause it's chemistry, that's the initial conditions.
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:05.160]   It doesn't matter how the initial conditions came to be.
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:07.600]   They are what they are and let's go from there.
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:11.400]   And there's all kinds of fascinatingly different
[01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:13.120]   initial conditions in terms of chemistry
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:13.960]   on different planets.
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:16.080]   - Yes, but in terms of panspermia,
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:19.360]   I mean, obviously there's gonna be always room
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:22.840]   for those sort of discussions or there will be,
[01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:26.080]   those discussions will always be present,
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:30.160]   I think, in any life in universe debates.
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:33.120]   But the problem I have with panspermia
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:34.720]   is that it removes the problem
[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:38.040]   from the planet to somewhere else.
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:43.040]   It makes it very difficult to answer scientifically, right?
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:47.160]   You just took the problem away from this planet
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:51.360]   and formulate it in a way that I cannot go
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:54.120]   and try to understand in the lab,
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:56.200]   doing experiments or even through models.
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:58.960]   - Does it though, so I've heard brilliant biologists
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:02.920]   like yourself say that, but I just, to me,
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:05.160]   okay, here's how I think of Earth.
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:08.080]   So I actually am able to hold all these possibilities
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:11.120]   in my head and all of them are inspiring to me.
[01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:12.880]   I kind of think there's a possibility
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:17.080]   that Earth is just an experiment by a graduate student,
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:18.920]   by an alien graduate student.
[01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:21.160]   - So I know the exact episodes
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:23.600]   of "Star Trek" you're talking about.
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:26.800]   - But there is some, to me, that's inspiring.
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:28.120]   If we are--
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:31.760]   - But that's not what panspermia is about.
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:33.600]   You're talking about my proposition.
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:35.320]   That's not what panspermia is.
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:36.880]   - What's panspermia?
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:39.360]   Oh, life just came from elsewhere.
[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:42.800]   Still, that's interesting because there's still giant leaps
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:45.720]   that happened on Earth, it seems like,
[01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:49.200]   beyond the initial primitive organisms like eukaryotes.
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:52.200]   - I don't think panspermia usually articulates
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:56.080]   at the level of eukaryotes.
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:57:00.320]   I think they talk about bacteria primarily.
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:01.160]   I think so.
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:02.040]   - Right.
[01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:04.400]   So that's still interesting 'cause all the different leaps
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:06.040]   of evolution still happen here on Earth.
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:06.880]   That's still interesting.
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:10.040]   - Yeah, but it's, I mean, it's definitely
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:16.320]   interesting to listen to, but I wouldn't place it in,
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:17.880]   I wouldn't know how to place it
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:20.400]   in the studies of origin of life, I guess, or--
[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:21.640]   - Here's how we place it.
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:24.800]   You have the initial conditions for the origin of life,
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:27.840]   and you try to create life in that way
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:30.160]   that you've described in the five components,
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:32.000]   and it keeps failing.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:35.280]   So what panspermia allows you to do
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:37.620]   is to also consider the question,
[01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:40.920]   maybe there's missing components.
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:43.160]   How do you answer that question?
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:45.160]   - Through exploration and through science.
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:46.000]   - Yes, yeah, tell me--
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.400]   - Looking outside of Earth,
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:51.000]   looking at the fundamentals of chemistry and physics.
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.160]   - How do you understand that with fundamentals
[01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:55.280]   of chemistry and physics?
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:58.120]   - How do you understand gravity?
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:00.280]   - But you're talking about panspermia, right?
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:02.600]   Just I don't understand how would you,
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:05.160]   it's different than, if you think it's similar
[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:07.280]   to looking for life in the universe,
[01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:08.760]   is that what you're thinking?
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:10.680]   - No, I'm saying there's a missing component
[01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:12.160]   that came from elsewhere.
[01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:13.680]   - But a whole entire organism
[01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:15.480]   is not a missing component right there, right?
[01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:17.320]   I mean, when you're thinking about origin of life.
[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:19.480]   - No, no, no, that's an assumption.
[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:22.680]   Your assumption is all the ingredients
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:24.840]   for the origin of life are here on Earth.
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:28.000]   Now, I tend to believe that most likely that's the case.
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.320]   I'm just saying it's inspiring
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:33.400]   to think that there is some ingredients
[01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:35.360]   you're gonna push back 'cause that's not panspermia.
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:36.320]   That's part of it.
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:37.960]   But-- (laughs)
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:39.000]   - See, okay, so think,
[01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:41.280]   but yeah, I'm like--
[01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:43.840]   - It's also kind of fun to push back on you.
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:46.360]   No, I understand, I understand.
[01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:49.800]   I understand if actually a living organism
[01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:51.960]   ended up here from elsewhere,
[01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:54.560]   that means a lot of the exploration we're doing here
[01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:56.520]   with the ingredients that we know
[01:58:56.520 --> 01:59:01.520]   will not give us the clues to the origin of life.
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:07.080]   But it just seems like it's still very useful
[01:59:07.080 --> 01:59:10.400]   to try to create life here
[01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:12.360]   and then we'll see, wait a minute,
[01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:15.280]   don't you think we'll be able to prove,
[01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:18.680]   not prove, but show that panspermia is very likely?
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:20.480]   Like if we just keep failing,
[01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:22.120]   we understand biology deeply,
[01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:22.960]   we understand chemistry deeply.
[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:23.800]   - See, that's the thing.
[01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:24.640]   I don't think so.
[01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:26.680]   I mean, there will be,
[01:59:26.680 --> 01:59:29.560]   the failure is not gonna indicate
[01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:31.480]   that this must have been,
[01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:34.320]   I don't think anyone will put the problem
[01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:37.920]   to something else just because our failures,
[01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:39.680]   our experiments failed.
[01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:41.240]   So failure means we don't understand
[01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:42.320]   the chemistry deeply enough.
[01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:45.560]   - Yeah, and given the progress we made
[01:59:45.560 --> 01:59:49.040]   and how many brilliant people are working on this right now,
[01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:51.720]   and it's definitely more,
[01:59:51.720 --> 01:59:53.920]   I would say that we are approaching this problem
[01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:57.480]   in more broader ways, different ways possible.
[01:59:57.480 --> 01:59:59.040]   I'm confident that we will get there.
[01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:04.040]   For us, again, we are interested in early cells
[02:00:04.040 --> 02:00:06.160]   and first cells and what followed origin of life,
[02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:08.960]   but we cannot, given that it's a continuum,
[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:13.680]   that's between the origin and emergence of first cells,
[02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:17.520]   it's hard to separate these two ends from one another.
[02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:21.400]   - So given that life is a solution to a chemistry problem,
[02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:25.120]   if we re-ran Earth a million times,
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:29.160]   how different would the results be?
[02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:31.760]   If we look at that wheel,
[02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:34.440]   how different would be the tree of life, do you think?
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:35.940]   Like what's your gut say?
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:42.000]   - My mind asks, are you imagining,
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:45.160]   if we are repeating the planet one million times,
[02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:50.160]   are we seeing, are the things that happened,
[02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:52.240]   I'm not talking at the chemical level,
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:54.000]   but at the environment level,
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:57.120]   do they happen at the same time, at the same frequency,
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:01:00.720]   at the same intensity every time you're running this tape
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:02.000]   over and over again?
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.200]   - Yes, you mean like geological stuff?
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:05.040]   - Yeah, like so is the same--
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:06.560]   - So you're saying those are important.
[02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:09.600]   I mean, the fact that you would ask that question
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:11.880]   is also fascinating, so that's important?
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:14.920]   The timing, the frequency, the intensity of geological--
[02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:16.960]   - Yeah, so when we run this imaginary
[02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:19.400]   rewind and replay experiments in our minds,
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:22.120]   I wanna know whether we are positioning
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:23.640]   all the same geologic events
[02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:25.880]   at the same chronological order as well,
[02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:28.880]   or whether we are also giving them more randomness.
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:31.720]   So if the volcano erupted, is it happening at the same time?
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:35.200]   If you have, are dinosaurs getting wiped off every time
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:38.000]   with the same meteorite that's hitting the same--
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.680]   - But also like temperature changes and all that--
[02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:41.520]   - Temperature changes, everything.
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:43.480]   - That's actually, I've heard you say somewhere
[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:45.960]   that one of the things that's fascinating to you
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:48.240]   about this whole process of evolution
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:53.240]   is that the process of evolution,
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:56.280]   all the mechanisms were invented and developed
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:00.600]   despite all the variation geologically
[02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:03.040]   through the hardship that Earth has gone through.
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:06.560]   - That the biological innovations persisted despite that?
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:09.720]   - Yeah, despite that, which is interesting.
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:12.480]   You kind of think of the biological innovations
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:13.880]   kind of happening on their own.
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:17.240]   - Because we, so we actually have a center
[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:18.520]   exploring this problem.
[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:21.760]   We wanna understand whether,
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:24.060]   it's almost like judging a book by its cover, right?
[02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:25.840]   Do you just look at an environment
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:28.320]   and then see whatever is present
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:30.000]   or scarce in that environment,
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.360]   and then think that, okay, the life form
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:34.080]   that will exist in this environment
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:38.240]   will obviously have a lot of molybdenum in its system.
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:40.520]   Look at all this molybdenum around here.
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:43.760]   Or will it be, because if you say that,
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:45.520]   you are now putting the environment
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:49.760]   in the more prime driver role, right?
[02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:52.000]   That you're saying that environment will determine
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.460]   what biology will or will not use.
[02:02:55.800 --> 02:02:59.600]   But we've done studies that show
[02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:02.640]   that it's not necessarily this straightforward.
[02:03:02.640 --> 02:03:06.240]   That for instance, we looked at going back to nitrogen.
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:09.440]   One thing that's fascinating about the way cells
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:13.520]   fix nitrogen, the ones that can do,
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:16.560]   is that they also do this through a lot of help
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:19.640]   of a lot of metals, a lot of elemental support really.
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:25.680]   And which geologists use to understand
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:29.160]   where did this metabolism even evolved,
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:30.840]   where at first place.
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:32.280]   So we look at ancient oceans,
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:34.280]   we try to understand the elemental composition
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:35.900]   of ancient oceans.
[02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:39.520]   And what we see is that in some cases,
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:42.560]   the metabolisms, even though they prefer a certain metal
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:44.560]   or an element that is in the environment,
[02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:48.640]   that metal wasn't abundant in the environment,
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:51.040]   but still life chose that.
[02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:53.920]   So it's not that straightforward as though whatever,
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:56.760]   you are what you eat,
[02:03:56.760 --> 02:03:59.880]   but you don't necessarily eat what is obvious to you.
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:01.560]   Just because there's a lot of that food around
[02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:03.320]   it doesn't mean life will ultimately go there.
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:05.200]   Maybe most of the time it will,
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:07.560]   but it seems like in the case of nitrogen fixation,
[02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:09.480]   it didn't and maybe that made the difference.
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:12.520]   - It's so cool that, right, it's not the abundant resource
[02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:13.760]   that's going to be the definition
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:15.740]   of what kind of life flourishes.
[02:04:15.740 --> 02:04:21.000]   So it's not a straightforward thing.
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:21.840]   - Yes.
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:24.920]   - My sense is that the different timing,
[02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:26.720]   the different conditions of the environment
[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:29.880]   would change the way evolution happens.
[02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:33.080]   - Yeah, for instance, I mean, I think it's in the 80s,
[02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:35.040]   maybe earlier than that,
[02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:37.800]   Stephen Jay Gould's book, "Wonderful Life,"
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:41.720]   which changed, I think, a lot of scientists' life,
[02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:42.740]   including mine.
[02:04:42.740 --> 02:04:48.500]   He contemplates on this notion of the tape of life.
[02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:51.360]   Of course, I hope people still know what tape is,
[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:53.480]   but I think your listeners will know what tape is.
[02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:54.400]   I don't know.
[02:04:54.400 --> 02:04:55.520]   It's the--
[02:04:55.520 --> 02:04:56.340]   - Tape?
[02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:58.120]   Go on, tell me about the tape.
[02:04:58.120 --> 02:04:59.840]   Is it like a TikTok?
[02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:01.080]   Can you swipe on it?
[02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:04.040]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:06.720]   I apologize for my rude interruption.
[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:07.840]   - I kind of ask for it.
[02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:11.000]   But he speculated or he suggested
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:12.560]   this hypothetical experiment,
[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:16.240]   whether if life was recorded on,
[02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:19.840]   or can be imagined to be recorded on a linear,
[02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:22.840]   is it linear chain of events recorded on a tape?
[02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:24.440]   And if we were to rewind the state,
[02:05:24.440 --> 02:05:26.040]   would we listen to the same song?
[02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:27.120]   Right, so this was,
[02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:29.060]   and in his proposition, I also thought,
[02:05:29.060 --> 02:05:32.720]   yeah, but are we replaying the tape
[02:05:32.720 --> 02:05:33.880]   in the same exact manner?
[02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:36.800]   Or are we, meaning all the geological
[02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:38.000]   and environmental events,
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:39.620]   are they happening at the same time?
[02:05:39.620 --> 02:05:41.920]   Because then you removed the randomness
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:43.620]   from equation a little bit, right?
[02:05:43.620 --> 02:05:45.880]   You just removed it,
[02:05:45.880 --> 02:05:47.680]   because you're assuming everything will happen
[02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:49.040]   at the same time, at the same intensity.
[02:05:49.040 --> 02:05:50.600]   So that's not too contingent.
[02:05:50.600 --> 02:05:53.280]   That means that the natural selection,
[02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:55.160]   you're thinking is really operating at more,
[02:05:55.160 --> 02:05:57.520]   or evolution is operating at more,
[02:05:57.520 --> 02:06:00.220]   under more random forces,
[02:06:00.220 --> 02:06:02.280]   than that can be dictated by the environment.
[02:06:02.280 --> 02:06:04.880]   So in our way of understanding
[02:06:04.880 --> 02:06:06.440]   or thinking about rewinding, replaying,
[02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:08.000]   I don't think we're thinking about
[02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:09.800]   the role of the environment as clearly,
[02:06:09.800 --> 02:06:13.180]   or don't seem to be integrated as much.
[02:06:13.180 --> 02:06:15.720]   - But I also wonder if it's possible
[02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:19.600]   that the chemistry ultimately defines the destination,
[02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:23.500]   that despite all the environmental changes,
[02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:26.240]   despite all the randomness,
[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:28.200]   we'll end up in something.
[02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:29.400]   - But we are not talking about
[02:06:29.400 --> 02:06:31.960]   whether life will emerge and sustain itself.
[02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:33.680]   We are talking about whether life will emerge
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:36.040]   and sustain itself in the shape and form
[02:06:36.040 --> 02:06:38.220]   that is similar to what we have right now.
[02:06:38.220 --> 02:06:40.720]   So you are chemistry, I'm chemistry,
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:41.960]   we're having this conversation,
[02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:43.800]   and your plants are chemistry too.
[02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:45.720]   They're also having their own conversation.
[02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:47.560]   - These plants are fake, but yes.
[02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:49.000]   - I knew that, I didn't wanna say that,
[02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:50.160]   but they're fake.
[02:06:50.160 --> 02:06:52.080]   - But do you look at my place,
[02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:54.480]   of course they would be fake, otherwise they would die.
[02:06:54.480 --> 02:06:56.400]   - What's wrong with this place?
[02:06:56.400 --> 02:06:57.400]   - It's wonderful.
[02:06:57.400 --> 02:07:02.280]   I'm Alice and this is Wonderland, this is great.
[02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:04.280]   This is great, it's just that,
[02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:06.120]   this is a place where robots flourish,
[02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:09.360]   and those plants are fake.
[02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:10.320]   - Are you saying that you and I
[02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:11.400]   are the only living organisms?
[02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:13.160]   Well, obviously there are microbes in this room,
[02:07:13.160 --> 02:07:15.000]   but-- - Yeah, we are
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.680]   the only living organisms.
[02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:18.840]   Let's take care of getting a dog.
[02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:20.960]   - This is not a clean room, so you have microbes here.
[02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:22.160]   - Yes, many, millions.
[02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:25.240]   - Yes, so you and I and all the microbes in this room,
[02:07:25.240 --> 02:07:27.600]   we are chemical systems that are operating
[02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:29.260]   in a way that we can respond and sense
[02:07:29.260 --> 02:07:31.660]   and our environments and whatnot.
[02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:34.400]   But if you are asking if we are gonna be here,
[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:36.960]   then you're imagining that another solution
[02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:39.720]   is also possible, which is different
[02:07:39.720 --> 02:07:41.940]   than the fundamentals of life.
[02:07:41.940 --> 02:07:44.800]   Because life will do always, life will do its life thing.
[02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:48.800]   - I guess it goes all the way back
[02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:51.360]   to the things we were talking about, translation,
[02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:53.060]   and the stuff you were messing with,
[02:07:53.060 --> 02:07:56.000]   is figuring out what is the important stuff and what isn't.
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:02.280]   Makes me wonder about, just like with the translation
[02:08:02.280 --> 02:08:04.960]   machinery with human beings,
[02:08:04.960 --> 02:08:06.160]   I wonder what's the important stuff.
[02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:07.860]   Is it important to have two limbs?
[02:08:07.860 --> 02:08:10.500]   Is it important to have eyes?
[02:08:10.500 --> 02:08:13.840]   Like it was obvious that the sensory mechanism of eyes,
[02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:16.480]   like sight, were to develop.
[02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:18.400]   How many times if we re-reinter Earth
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:21.880]   would the sensory mechanism of sight develop?
[02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:22.960]   And what would it look like?
[02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:25.000]   Would it be one giant eye?
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:26.200]   Or would it be two?
[02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:27.160]   What's with the symmetry?
[02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:29.360]   Why are we so damn symmetrical?
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:32.340]   - In response to Steve Jay Gould's proposition,
[02:08:32.340 --> 02:08:38.680]   most people who argue that life is convergent
[02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:43.480]   and it will in fact lead to a few determined outcomes,
[02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:47.160]   or it's not that the outcome is determined per se,
[02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:50.160]   but the pathways are restricted
[02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:54.920]   and the mutational trajectories that life can act upon
[02:08:54.920 --> 02:08:56.880]   are already very limited,
[02:08:56.880 --> 02:08:59.600]   so that the final outcomes are a few,
[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:01.940]   and eyes being one of them.
[02:09:01.940 --> 02:09:06.940]   So the convergence at the eye level was suggested
[02:09:07.700 --> 02:09:11.020]   as an example, was presented as an example
[02:09:11.020 --> 02:09:14.460]   of why life may actually embark on the same solution
[02:09:14.460 --> 02:09:17.140]   over and over again, given that many species
[02:09:17.140 --> 02:09:19.300]   evolved independently from one another.
[02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:21.900]   - Do you think there's any inkling of truth to that?
[02:09:21.900 --> 02:09:25.540]   Like is it just us humans thinking we're special?
[02:09:25.540 --> 02:09:30.100]   - I think those innovations came again so far after the...
[02:09:30.100 --> 02:09:31.660]   (laughing)
[02:09:31.660 --> 02:09:34.620]   I know it's the fun stuff, yes.
[02:09:34.620 --> 02:09:36.500]   Because it's--
[02:09:36.500 --> 02:09:38.540]   - Thank you, I mean, thank you.
[02:09:38.540 --> 02:09:41.340]   We humans tend to talk about the later stuff,
[02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:42.540]   but without the earlier stuff--
[02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:44.340]   - Yeah, so when we think of earlier,
[02:09:44.340 --> 02:09:47.500]   and I ask this to my students too,
[02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:49.300]   I want them to close their eyes
[02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:52.260]   and think about just nothingness but dust.
[02:09:52.260 --> 02:09:54.140]   We don't have trees, we don't have plants.
[02:09:54.140 --> 02:09:57.700]   When we say an empty place, or visually at least,
[02:09:57.700 --> 02:10:00.600]   we are talking about a planet that is really alien.
[02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:03.100]   So understanding our own past is similar
[02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:05.680]   to understanding an alien planet altogether,
[02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:07.860]   given that it is a very different planet
[02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:10.820]   that did not have any oxygen for two billion years.
[02:10:10.820 --> 02:10:13.700]   There's nothing that is familiar to us
[02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:17.900]   that we would even think about when we think about life
[02:10:17.900 --> 02:10:20.820]   that is present in our past, yet here we are.
[02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:23.900]   - So cool, that from that came this,
[02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:24.900]   like houses and people--
[02:10:24.900 --> 02:10:26.700]   - And we are very, very,
[02:10:26.700 --> 02:10:30.100]   we are the super late arrivals to the party, right?
[02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:33.060]   So this is definitely not our planet.
[02:10:33.060 --> 02:10:35.020]   It's the microbial planet that we live in.
[02:10:35.020 --> 02:10:37.580]   - But the potential to create us was always there.
[02:10:37.580 --> 02:10:40.700]   - How do you know that?
[02:10:40.700 --> 02:10:42.040]   - 'Cause we were created.
[02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:45.920]   Oh, I don't know.
[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:48.680]   What is it, you think it's possible that it's,
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:51.060]   even for the early stuff, yeah,
[02:10:51.060 --> 02:10:53.180]   maybe if it's super unlikely, yeah,
[02:10:53.180 --> 02:10:54.620]   that we just got super,
[02:10:54.620 --> 02:10:56.740]   this is the planet that got really lucky,
[02:10:56.740 --> 02:10:57.860]   given the chemistry.
[02:10:57.860 --> 02:11:02.980]   Like maybe to create the bacteria is not so lucky,
[02:11:02.980 --> 02:11:05.180]   but to create complex organisms
[02:11:05.180 --> 02:11:07.740]   all the way up to mammals, that's super lucky.
[02:11:07.740 --> 02:11:10.840]   - Yes, and it may all come down to a few innovations
[02:11:10.840 --> 02:11:12.660]   that happened at the molecular level
[02:11:12.660 --> 02:11:15.740]   that may or may not be inevitable.
[02:11:15.740 --> 02:11:22.220]   So all these molecular tricks may have enabled
[02:11:22.220 --> 02:11:26.500]   the sort of mere existence of whatever you are able
[02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:28.660]   to define as familiar to yourself.
[02:11:28.660 --> 02:11:31.020]   - And you have a hope that science can answer
[02:11:31.020 --> 02:11:33.780]   these questions to reconstruct?
[02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:35.340]   - Science is answering these questions.
[02:11:35.340 --> 02:11:40.340]   I mean, we are limited to going back to the beginning
[02:11:40.340 --> 02:11:41.840]   in our ways, right?
[02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:45.380]   So we rely on biology, it's overwritten.
[02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:47.860]   You're talking about four billion year old records
[02:11:47.860 --> 02:11:50.380]   that is ever changing, that again makes it beautiful,
[02:11:50.380 --> 02:11:52.080]   but also makes it difficult.
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:53.900]   It's not tractable.
[02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:58.900]   Geology has to some degree, it has a record,
[02:11:58.900 --> 02:12:03.900]   of a more static, frozen state record
[02:12:03.900 --> 02:12:09.100]   that is embedded on itself, on the surface of this planet,
[02:12:09.100 --> 02:12:11.060]   if we can find them.
[02:12:11.060 --> 02:12:16.060]   And that's the key that most of these recorded remnants
[02:12:16.060 --> 02:12:21.380]   are, if we're lucky, we find them.
[02:12:21.380 --> 02:12:23.200]   They are not naturally selected.
[02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:27.500]   They're found, they need to be found for us to be able
[02:12:27.500 --> 02:12:32.500]   to read them, so we work with a very handful set of samples,
[02:12:32.500 --> 02:12:36.860]   especially when we talk about the deep past,
[02:12:36.860 --> 02:12:40.580]   the planet with no oxygen, when we passed
[02:12:40.580 --> 02:12:42.300]   the Great Oxidation Event threshold,
[02:12:42.300 --> 02:12:44.460]   that is about 2.5 billion years.
[02:12:44.460 --> 02:12:46.780]   So the earliest life is even harder.
[02:12:46.780 --> 02:12:49.860]   You are trying to write the story of life
[02:12:49.860 --> 02:12:53.420]   based on a handful of rocks and what is recorded on them.
[02:12:53.420 --> 02:12:58.420]   Speaking of finding select remnants of our deep past,
[02:12:58.420 --> 02:13:02.980]   you said that you've been thinking about Nick Nealon's
[02:13:02.980 --> 02:13:05.940]   essay on scientific knowledge and scientific abstraction.
[02:13:05.940 --> 02:13:09.100]   So let me ask you, where do you think scientific questions
[02:13:09.100 --> 02:13:11.860]   and answers, or in general, ideas come from?
[02:13:11.860 --> 02:13:17.500]   You're a scientist, you ask very good questions,
[02:13:17.500 --> 02:13:19.940]   and try systematically and rigorously
[02:13:19.940 --> 02:13:22.260]   to answer them through experiment.
[02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:24.380]   Where do you think ideas come from?
[02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:26.500]   - So ideas come all the time, right?
[02:13:26.500 --> 02:13:27.340]   There are all kinds of ideas.
[02:13:27.340 --> 02:13:29.980]   There are good ideas, there are not so good ideas.
[02:13:29.980 --> 02:13:34.980]   There are really exciting ideas, maybe some boring ones.
[02:13:34.980 --> 02:13:39.980]   But if you are really interested
[02:13:39.980 --> 02:13:43.300]   in doing something different, then you need to be willing
[02:13:43.300 --> 02:13:45.100]   to take the risk to be wrong.
[02:13:45.100 --> 02:13:50.260]   And that's incredibly difficult, even though we talked
[02:13:50.260 --> 02:13:54.340]   about the idealist notion behind science
[02:13:54.340 --> 02:13:56.500]   that we ultimately want to be rejected,
[02:13:56.500 --> 02:13:58.100]   or our ideas need to be rejected
[02:13:58.100 --> 02:14:01.820]   for the entire infrastructure to move forward.
[02:14:01.820 --> 02:14:06.620]   There is a level of risk-taking, I think,
[02:14:06.620 --> 02:14:11.620]   behind any creative idea.
[02:14:11.620 --> 02:14:14.220]   And I mean that in a true sense.
[02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:18.100]   If you are disappointed that your idea didn't work,
[02:14:18.100 --> 02:14:20.260]   then it wasn't a risk,
[02:14:20.260 --> 02:14:22.300]   'cause you still hoped that it will work.
[02:14:22.300 --> 02:14:25.860]   True risk is that you accept that it may not work,
[02:14:25.860 --> 02:14:28.260]   so that the failure shouldn't also surprise you.
[02:14:28.260 --> 02:14:30.780]   - Yeah.
[02:14:30.780 --> 02:14:35.060]   Is it when you embark on stuff, when you embark on an idea,
[02:14:35.060 --> 02:14:40.060]   do you actually contemplate and accept failure?
[02:14:40.060 --> 02:14:42.660]   Like as a possibility? - Not consciously,
[02:14:42.660 --> 02:14:43.620]   I wouldn't say so.
[02:14:43.620 --> 02:14:48.620]   But I eliminated a lot of the things out of my work line
[02:14:48.620 --> 02:14:55.980]   by simply not feeling like studying them.
[02:14:55.980 --> 02:14:59.260]   I was bored chasing certain questions.
[02:14:59.260 --> 02:15:04.300]   - So you trusted the signal of boredom as a good sign
[02:15:04.300 --> 02:15:06.260]   that it's not a good question?
[02:15:06.260 --> 02:15:09.340]   - It should definitely be,
[02:15:09.340 --> 02:15:11.980]   whatever you're doing should be exciting to you.
[02:15:11.980 --> 02:15:14.100]   If there's only one person that should be ever excited
[02:15:14.100 --> 02:15:16.860]   about what you're doing, that should be you.
[02:15:16.860 --> 02:15:19.740]   And that's enough for that idea to go somewhere.
[02:15:19.740 --> 02:15:22.140]   I think that you need to believe in the idea,
[02:15:22.140 --> 02:15:23.700]   but at the same time,
[02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:26.700]   I think it's important to not fall in love
[02:15:26.700 --> 02:15:28.020]   with your mistakes.
[02:15:28.020 --> 02:15:34.500]   That if something isn't working, you should let it go
[02:15:34.500 --> 02:15:37.420]   instead of trying to fix it.
[02:15:37.420 --> 02:15:39.260]   Even though you feel that this is a mistake
[02:15:39.260 --> 02:15:41.380]   or you know that it's a mistake,
[02:15:41.380 --> 02:15:46.380]   in order to, sorry, instead of trying to fix it,
[02:15:46.380 --> 02:15:51.620]   you should wrap it up and move on to something else,
[02:15:51.620 --> 02:15:52.940]   which is incredibly hard.
[02:15:52.940 --> 02:15:54.260]   - Good advice for science,
[02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:56.260]   but also good advice for relationships.
[02:15:56.260 --> 02:16:00.900]   But okay, so that's actually really hard,
[02:16:00.900 --> 02:16:02.900]   especially, I mean, this is like PhD stuff.
[02:16:02.900 --> 02:16:06.100]   Like if you sink in so much of your time,
[02:16:06.100 --> 02:16:09.340]   not even PhD, the entire scientific career,
[02:16:09.340 --> 02:16:11.300]   it's really tough to let go.
[02:16:11.300 --> 02:16:15.460]   - Yes, and there is not a lot of room for true freedom,
[02:16:15.460 --> 02:16:19.620]   maybe at this certain degree.
[02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:22.020]   So first you need to be trained, right?
[02:16:22.020 --> 02:16:25.900]   It's not that scientists are just brilliant, amazing humans.
[02:16:25.900 --> 02:16:28.260]   I mean, they just know and learn,
[02:16:28.260 --> 02:16:29.780]   they know how to do science
[02:16:29.780 --> 02:16:32.460]   because they're trained in how to do science.
[02:16:32.460 --> 02:16:35.980]   So that is important because as someone
[02:16:35.980 --> 02:16:39.820]   who wants to definitely, I'm hoping,
[02:16:41.060 --> 02:16:43.500]   giving the message that this is for everybody,
[02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:45.900]   that there's this notion of science,
[02:16:45.900 --> 02:16:47.260]   scientists being super smart people,
[02:16:47.260 --> 02:16:50.740]   that's definitely not true, right?
[02:16:50.740 --> 02:16:53.980]   It is a method that you learn to solve a problem.
[02:16:53.980 --> 02:16:55.780]   That's really what science is.
[02:16:55.780 --> 02:16:57.820]   And some are really good at it,
[02:16:57.820 --> 02:17:01.540]   and they get better at it under really good guidance,
[02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:02.700]   maybe good mentorship.
[02:17:02.700 --> 02:17:06.740]   And ultimately everyone finds their own style
[02:17:06.740 --> 02:17:09.460]   of problem solving and what sort of problems they solve.
[02:17:09.460 --> 02:17:10.900]   But I have not met a scientist
[02:17:10.900 --> 02:17:13.500]   that finds their own pursuit boring.
[02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:17.300]   - Well, it can happen,
[02:17:17.300 --> 02:17:18.420]   but they're not going to be effective,
[02:17:18.420 --> 02:17:20.620]   just like you said, I think.
[02:17:20.620 --> 02:17:24.260]   It's kind of interesting because in the age of social media
[02:17:24.260 --> 02:17:26.860]   and attention economies and stuff like that,
[02:17:26.860 --> 02:17:29.780]   I've interacted with a lot of folks,
[02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:31.380]   like YouTubers and so on.
[02:17:31.380 --> 02:17:34.300]   I think a lot of their work is driven
[02:17:34.300 --> 02:17:36.140]   by what others find exciting.
[02:17:37.380 --> 02:17:39.540]   And I think that ultimately leads
[02:17:39.540 --> 02:17:41.900]   to a life that's not fulfilling.
[02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:44.540]   - I can see the reason behind it,
[02:17:44.540 --> 02:17:48.900]   or perhaps there's a fear of failure
[02:17:48.900 --> 02:17:53.860]   that can be a major determinant of that pattern, right?
[02:17:53.860 --> 02:17:57.940]   So you try to do something that is accepted by others
[02:17:57.940 --> 02:18:02.940]   because that's maybe unlikely to give results right away.
[02:18:02.940 --> 02:18:06.100]   But it's a long game, it's a very long game.
[02:18:06.100 --> 02:18:08.900]   And if you are aiming a long-term change
[02:18:08.900 --> 02:18:10.660]   and long-term impact,
[02:18:10.660 --> 02:18:13.020]   you've got to be very, very patient about it.
[02:18:13.020 --> 02:18:17.020]   And you better tame your ego.
[02:18:17.020 --> 02:18:20.900]   - I mean, on YouTube and those kinds of places
[02:18:20.900 --> 02:18:23.160]   on the internet, on social media,
[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:26.580]   you get feedback right away.
[02:18:26.580 --> 02:18:29.180]   And so it's even harder to be patient.
[02:18:29.180 --> 02:18:34.060]   Because change and ideas develop
[02:18:34.060 --> 02:18:37.540]   over a period of months and years, not decades.
[02:18:37.540 --> 02:18:40.300]   And the response from social media and so on
[02:18:40.300 --> 02:18:43.220]   is on the rate of seconds, minutes, and hours.
[02:18:43.220 --> 02:18:46.420]   - So I recommend actual physical libraries
[02:18:46.420 --> 02:18:49.540]   for people who may wanna appreciate
[02:18:49.540 --> 02:18:52.180]   or remember the sense of time
[02:18:52.180 --> 02:18:55.580]   and how long it takes to build something.
[02:18:55.580 --> 02:18:57.980]   I think it is, you're right,
[02:18:57.980 --> 02:19:01.460]   that's the immediacy and the right response.
[02:19:01.460 --> 02:19:05.900]   And the fact that these places,
[02:19:05.900 --> 02:19:07.940]   the algorithm wants you to respond right away
[02:19:07.940 --> 02:19:09.740]   and interact with itself, right?
[02:19:09.740 --> 02:19:13.100]   So I can see the appeal,
[02:19:13.100 --> 02:19:16.740]   but true innovation, I think, doesn't even scream.
[02:19:16.740 --> 02:19:20.400]   It's not shiny, especially in the beginning.
[02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:23.420]   But it's also important to not fool ourselves
[02:19:23.420 --> 02:19:25.620]   and think that everything that people criticize
[02:19:25.620 --> 02:19:28.180]   has some super important meaning behind it.
[02:19:29.220 --> 02:19:31.340]   So it's a mix of the technique,
[02:19:31.340 --> 02:19:33.600]   the methods, and your gut feeling.
[02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:38.380]   - Yeah, and a weird dance between learning
[02:19:38.380 --> 02:19:43.380]   and accepting the ideas of the current science,
[02:19:43.380 --> 02:19:48.460]   and at times trusting your gut and rejecting those.
[02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:52.580]   'Cause science progresses by sometimes rejecting
[02:19:52.580 --> 02:19:55.180]   the ideas of the past or sometimes building on them
[02:19:55.180 --> 02:19:57.180]   in a way that changes them, transforms them.
[02:19:57.180 --> 02:19:59.420]   - Yes, and I think what is hard
[02:19:59.420 --> 02:20:04.420]   is to really drill down into a concept, right?
[02:20:04.420 --> 02:20:07.740]   So you can create a new thing,
[02:20:07.740 --> 02:20:12.620]   and then it may be appealing and gain a lot of traction,
[02:20:12.620 --> 02:20:15.460]   but to sustain that, to continue that,
[02:20:15.460 --> 02:20:17.900]   you really need to show the true expertise.
[02:20:17.900 --> 02:20:20.320]   And so it's not only about defining a problem,
[02:20:20.320 --> 02:20:23.420]   but then really systematically solve that problem
[02:20:23.420 --> 02:20:26.820]   maybe over the course of decades.
[02:20:27.820 --> 02:20:30.380]   - You mentioned the library.
[02:20:30.380 --> 02:20:33.260]   I've also saw that you've translated scientific documents,
[02:20:33.260 --> 02:20:35.460]   or at least mentioned that you did it
[02:20:35.460 --> 02:20:37.120]   at some point in your life.
[02:20:37.120 --> 02:20:40.980]   So let me ask you, how much do you think
[02:20:40.980 --> 02:20:44.660]   is lost in translation in science and in life?
[02:20:44.660 --> 02:20:48.100]   How many languages do you speak?
[02:20:48.100 --> 02:20:49.660]   - Two. - Two.
[02:20:49.660 --> 02:20:54.220]   How much is lost in translation in science
[02:20:54.220 --> 02:20:55.500]   and in life between those two?
[02:20:55.500 --> 02:20:56.980]   - No, it's actually three, because science
[02:20:56.980 --> 02:20:58.860]   is like another language, right?
[02:20:58.860 --> 02:20:59.740]   - It is.
[02:20:59.740 --> 02:21:02.340]   I speak Russian, a little bit of French,
[02:21:02.340 --> 02:21:04.500]   and it's always fascinating to see how much is lost.
[02:21:04.500 --> 02:21:07.580]   And the Soviet Union has a tradition of science
[02:21:07.580 --> 02:21:10.120]   and mathematics and so on, and it's interesting
[02:21:10.120 --> 02:21:12.580]   that a lot of the wisdom gained
[02:21:12.580 --> 02:21:16.500]   from that part of the world is lost,
[02:21:16.500 --> 02:21:19.220]   basically because it was never translated.
[02:21:19.220 --> 02:21:24.700]   - Well, I'm not sure if it is lost per se.
[02:21:24.700 --> 02:21:28.820]   I mean, maybe it's more like a gain in some sense, right?
[02:21:28.820 --> 02:21:30.380]   Because you understand,
[02:21:30.380 --> 02:21:35.300]   science is ultimately a human pursuit,
[02:21:35.300 --> 02:21:39.300]   so you cannot separate as much as,
[02:21:39.300 --> 02:21:43.800]   maybe it's the best system that humans ever came up with
[02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:47.440]   to seek knowledge, to generate and make sense of the world.
[02:21:47.440 --> 02:21:50.340]   It works most of the time.
[02:21:50.340 --> 02:21:52.580]   It doesn't mean it's perfect.
[02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:54.220]   - Did the kind of translation you do, by the way,
[02:21:54.220 --> 02:21:55.940]   was for scientific work?
[02:21:55.940 --> 02:21:59.260]   - I directly translated for scientific work, yes.
[02:21:59.260 --> 02:22:03.180]   I think that, again,
[02:22:03.180 --> 02:22:06.340]   brains are equally distributed,
[02:22:06.340 --> 02:22:08.540]   but opportunities are not, right?
[02:22:08.540 --> 02:22:13.500]   So if you want to include,
[02:22:13.500 --> 02:22:16.180]   if you want to benefit from all human power,
[02:22:16.180 --> 02:22:18.060]   whatever we can generate as human beings,
[02:22:18.060 --> 02:22:20.700]   you need to include everybody on the table.
[02:22:20.700 --> 02:22:23.900]   And that is by extending the opportunity.
[02:22:23.900 --> 02:22:26.940]   I think most of us that make it
[02:22:26.940 --> 02:22:28.100]   tend to think that we did
[02:22:28.100 --> 02:22:30.820]   because of something special about ourselves.
[02:22:30.820 --> 02:22:33.140]   But it is important to know that,
[02:22:33.140 --> 02:22:35.420]   no, we were given opportunities,
[02:22:35.420 --> 02:22:36.540]   and that's why we are here,
[02:22:36.540 --> 02:22:41.020]   not because there was something inherently special about us,
[02:22:41.020 --> 02:22:45.420]   or that the system truly selects for the ones
[02:22:45.420 --> 02:22:46.940]   that really are--
[02:22:46.940 --> 02:22:49.420]   - Yeah, and language is a part of the opportunity.
[02:22:49.420 --> 02:22:50.700]   - Yeah, language is an opportunity
[02:22:50.700 --> 02:22:53.700]   because it comes with, similar to bacteria, right?
[02:22:53.700 --> 02:22:55.420]   They speak these languages.
[02:22:55.420 --> 02:22:59.620]   Even we call culturing the bacteria,
[02:22:59.620 --> 02:23:01.100]   we call it culturing, right?
[02:23:01.100 --> 02:23:02.500]   When we grow bacteria
[02:23:02.500 --> 02:23:05.220]   that we isolate from the environment in the lab,
[02:23:05.220 --> 02:23:06.860]   meaning that you create an environment
[02:23:06.860 --> 02:23:10.300]   for them to grow and thrive and sustain themselves.
[02:23:10.300 --> 02:23:11.380]   That's what we say,
[02:23:11.380 --> 02:23:14.700]   but culture is for microbiologists.
[02:23:14.700 --> 02:23:18.060]   For language, with language comes a different culture,
[02:23:18.060 --> 02:23:19.420]   a different perspective,
[02:23:19.420 --> 02:23:23.420]   and you bring that to the table.
[02:23:23.420 --> 02:23:26.460]   I mean, it brings the sense of diversity
[02:23:26.460 --> 02:23:30.060]   that can only be achieved by clashing, perhaps,
[02:23:30.060 --> 02:23:32.540]   two different cultures, two different languages,
[02:23:32.540 --> 02:23:33.740]   two different approaches,
[02:23:33.740 --> 02:23:36.860]   maybe in some cases, four different approaches.
[02:23:36.860 --> 02:23:39.420]   - Yeah, I think language is not just
[02:23:39.420 --> 02:23:41.140]   a mechanism of communication.
[02:23:41.140 --> 02:23:42.180]   It's a way to,
[02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:46.700]   it's a dynamic system of exploring ideas,
[02:23:46.700 --> 02:23:47.980]   and it's interesting to see
[02:23:47.980 --> 02:23:50.740]   that different languages explore ideas differently.
[02:23:50.740 --> 02:23:52.140]   - Yes, and I think that,
[02:23:52.140 --> 02:23:55.180]   so when I said science is like a language itself,
[02:23:55.180 --> 02:23:56.500]   I said it in two different ways.
[02:23:56.500 --> 02:23:59.780]   One is very literal meaning,
[02:23:59.780 --> 02:24:01.180]   that you can speak English,
[02:24:01.180 --> 02:24:02.820]   but that doesn't mean you will understand
[02:24:02.820 --> 02:24:04.620]   the scientific paper.
[02:24:04.620 --> 02:24:06.180]   It's a different level of English
[02:24:06.180 --> 02:24:08.140]   that you need to learn to understand.
[02:24:08.140 --> 02:24:10.420]   Even, not just for scientific papers,
[02:24:10.420 --> 02:24:12.580]   even from discipline to discipline.
[02:24:12.580 --> 02:24:15.660]   I challenge any chemist to read
[02:24:15.660 --> 02:24:18.820]   an evolutionary biology paper, and vice versa.
[02:24:18.820 --> 02:24:21.220]   It may sound extremely different,
[02:24:21.220 --> 02:24:23.140]   and a different language altogether.
[02:24:23.140 --> 02:24:25.860]   But there's also the language of communicating,
[02:24:25.860 --> 02:24:28.900]   and because words matter, how we talk matter,
[02:24:28.900 --> 02:24:30.820]   how we represent our science matters.
[02:24:30.820 --> 02:24:34.340]   So yes, just learning English as a second language alone
[02:24:34.340 --> 02:24:37.700]   is not gonna make you fluent in science either.
[02:24:37.700 --> 02:24:40.220]   - And it's interesting 'cause in that sense,
[02:24:40.220 --> 02:24:42.180]   you speak many more than three languages
[02:24:42.180 --> 02:24:45.220]   because you're pretty cross-disciplinary.
[02:24:45.220 --> 02:24:49.660]   It seems like you have a foot in a lot of disciplines.
[02:24:49.660 --> 02:24:52.660]   I mean, you're mentioning geology, biology,
[02:24:52.660 --> 02:24:57.460]   evolutionary biology, I mean, there's chemistry.
[02:24:57.460 --> 02:25:02.380]   - Biochemistry, biophysics, even we do a lot of statistics.
[02:25:02.380 --> 02:25:04.420]   So there's a lot of mathematics to what I do as well.
[02:25:04.420 --> 02:25:06.660]   Yes, we like to think of it as this,
[02:25:06.660 --> 02:25:12.180]   now it's astrobiology program, I repeat it because it's fun,
[02:25:12.180 --> 02:25:17.180]   that it is not a fruit salad, but it's a smoothie.
[02:25:17.180 --> 02:25:19.380]   That that's what we are generating.
[02:25:20.380 --> 02:25:21.500]   (laughing)
[02:25:21.500 --> 02:25:23.140]   It's not a fruit salad.
[02:25:23.140 --> 02:25:28.140]   So a smoothie is a successful combination of those fields
[02:25:28.140 --> 02:25:30.380]   and a fruit salad is not.
[02:25:30.380 --> 02:25:32.580]   - I wouldn't say it's success unnecessarily.
[02:25:32.580 --> 02:25:37.580]   If you put the wrong ingredient and you press the blender
[02:25:37.580 --> 02:25:38.740]   and you've made it a smoothie,
[02:25:38.740 --> 02:25:41.500]   you mean it can ruin the entire mix.
[02:25:41.500 --> 02:25:42.340]   - Can it though?
[02:25:42.340 --> 02:25:43.420]   Because I feel like--
[02:25:43.420 --> 02:25:45.380]   - Yes, I can definitely assess that for ginger,
[02:25:45.380 --> 02:25:47.020]   for instance, that ruins every smoothie.
[02:25:47.020 --> 02:25:47.940]   I don't like it. - Ginger?
[02:25:47.940 --> 02:25:50.020]   - I think so, but it's just a personal thing.
[02:25:50.020 --> 02:25:51.540]   And also I don't like cinnamon.
[02:25:51.540 --> 02:25:54.740]   - Ginger has a cinnamony taste?
[02:25:54.740 --> 02:25:55.580]   'Cause I thought ginger was--
[02:25:55.580 --> 02:25:57.540]   - No, I don't think they do, but I also don't like--
[02:25:57.540 --> 02:25:59.900]   - Wasn't that a thing they add in a lot of smoothies?
[02:25:59.900 --> 02:26:01.660]   I was forced a smoothie.
[02:26:01.660 --> 02:26:04.500]   I went to Malibu with a good friend of mine, Dan Reynolds,
[02:26:04.500 --> 02:26:07.020]   and he forced me to consume a smoothie.
[02:26:07.020 --> 02:26:10.460]   And it was probably the first smoothie I've ever had.
[02:26:10.460 --> 02:26:12.180]   'Cause I always said it was very judgmental
[02:26:12.180 --> 02:26:14.580]   of the kind of places and people that drink smoothies,
[02:26:14.580 --> 02:26:16.100]   but it was good, it was good.
[02:26:16.100 --> 02:26:17.380]   - Well, smoothie is very American,
[02:26:17.380 --> 02:26:19.140]   so I-- - Yeah, it is an American thing.
[02:26:19.140 --> 02:26:20.700]   - I wouldn't say success per se,
[02:26:20.700 --> 02:26:23.500]   but it is true that when you dance
[02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:25.060]   at the edge of different disciplines,
[02:26:25.060 --> 02:26:29.300]   that that's when inevitably the innovation will rise,
[02:26:29.300 --> 02:26:33.500]   because you will see things maybe a little differently
[02:26:33.500 --> 02:26:34.500]   when you're on the edge, right?
[02:26:34.500 --> 02:26:38.860]   So, but it will probably take longer,
[02:26:38.860 --> 02:26:41.540]   and it may not be understood right away.
[02:26:41.540 --> 02:26:45.300]   It may not come into final form quickly,
[02:26:45.300 --> 02:26:48.300]   given that it is a new concept rising.
[02:26:48.300 --> 02:26:55.300]   So, therefore, the patience will make more sense.
[02:26:55.300 --> 02:26:57.300]   I'm sorry, patience will be even more important.
[02:26:57.300 --> 02:26:59.900]   So, if you are, in other words,
[02:26:59.900 --> 02:27:04.380]   if you are into immediate appreciation,
[02:27:04.380 --> 02:27:07.260]   that's probably not the way to go.
[02:27:07.260 --> 02:27:11.220]   - You're one chemical organism.
[02:27:11.220 --> 02:27:14.780]   So, let me ask maybe a little bit more of a personal thing.
[02:27:14.780 --> 02:27:18.020]   Where did your life form originate?
[02:27:18.020 --> 02:27:21.140]   And what fond memory do you have
[02:27:21.140 --> 02:27:23.020]   from the early days of childhood
[02:27:23.020 --> 02:27:28.300]   that are representative of your bacteria culture?
[02:27:28.300 --> 02:27:34.640]   - I was born in Istanbul, so I grew up in Turkey.
[02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:39.220]   It's a city that has two continents,
[02:27:39.220 --> 02:27:41.260]   which is quite interesting.
[02:27:41.260 --> 02:27:45.180]   You have a, you see a "Welcome to Europe" sign,
[02:27:45.180 --> 02:27:48.540]   and then "Welcome to Asia" sign, same day,
[02:27:48.540 --> 02:27:50.840]   depending on which part of the bridge you are.
[02:27:50.840 --> 02:27:53.740]   So, that's where I was born,
[02:27:53.740 --> 02:27:57.300]   and I spent about roughly 20 years of my life,
[02:27:57.300 --> 02:28:00.380]   and then I immigrated to United States.
[02:28:00.380 --> 02:28:01.780]   - And it's a very proud culture.
[02:28:01.780 --> 02:28:03.260]   It's a beautiful culture.
[02:28:03.260 --> 02:28:04.980]   It's a very flavorful culture.
[02:28:04.980 --> 02:28:09.900]   What aspects of it is part of who you are?
[02:28:09.900 --> 02:28:11.620]   What are the beautiful aspects
[02:28:11.620 --> 02:28:13.520]   that you carry with you in your heart?
[02:28:13.520 --> 02:28:20.540]   - I think we are very sincerely human as a culture.
[02:28:20.540 --> 02:28:26.100]   I think that we have the saying that don't go to bed full
[02:28:26.100 --> 02:28:29.820]   if your neighbor is hungry.
[02:28:29.820 --> 02:28:34.700]   So, you wouldn't eat any food in front of someone
[02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:38.580]   where I come from without offering to share the bite.
[02:28:38.580 --> 02:28:41.320]   So, I think those things, however small they may sound,
[02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:44.300]   they're really big deal,
[02:28:44.300 --> 02:28:48.340]   especially when you are put in or move to a place
[02:28:48.340 --> 02:28:51.020]   that may not have those attributes.
[02:28:51.020 --> 02:28:55.900]   So, I think that culturally, we had a lot of conscious,
[02:28:55.900 --> 02:29:00.900]   like, just raw, deep human--
[02:29:00.900 --> 02:29:03.140]   - The connection, you value the connection
[02:29:03.140 --> 02:29:04.100]   between human beings.
[02:29:04.100 --> 02:29:05.060]   - I think so, yeah.
[02:29:05.060 --> 02:29:07.020]   I think I definitely carried that with me.
[02:29:07.020 --> 02:29:08.900]   - We talk a lot about biology.
[02:29:08.900 --> 02:29:11.220]   Let me ask you about the romantic question.
[02:29:11.220 --> 02:29:15.020]   What role does love play in the human condition
[02:29:15.020 --> 02:29:18.760]   or in the entirety of life on earth?
[02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:25.340]   - It's not easy to learn how to love if you're not loved.
[02:29:25.340 --> 02:29:28.700]   Okay?
[02:29:28.700 --> 02:29:31.060]   So, this is something, but the good news
[02:29:31.060 --> 02:29:35.540]   is that it is something that you can learn, I think.
[02:29:35.540 --> 02:29:40.480]   That you can practice and teach yourself
[02:29:40.480 --> 02:29:42.740]   how to maybe give yourself the thing
[02:29:42.740 --> 02:29:43.900]   that wasn't given to you
[02:29:43.900 --> 02:29:46.340]   and then ultimately give it to others.
[02:29:46.340 --> 02:29:49.660]   I think it would be quite arrogant to think
[02:29:49.660 --> 02:29:52.820]   that we will be capable of loving.
[02:29:52.820 --> 02:29:54.620]   It could be anything, really.
[02:29:54.620 --> 02:29:56.740]   - So, just like translation,
[02:29:56.740 --> 02:29:59.500]   it's a repeating and a dynamical process.
[02:29:59.500 --> 02:30:00.500]   - That you can learn.
[02:30:00.500 --> 02:30:01.580]   - Yeah, that you can learn.
[02:30:01.580 --> 02:30:03.300]   - Yes, and you should learn.
[02:30:04.260 --> 02:30:06.940]   There's no excuse to not learning.
[02:30:06.940 --> 02:30:07.900]   - To love. - Yeah.
[02:30:07.900 --> 02:30:09.340]   - 'Cause that's a deeply human thing.
[02:30:09.340 --> 02:30:10.380]   - It is a deeply human thing.
[02:30:10.380 --> 02:30:13.580]   It is a very sad thing if any one of us
[02:30:13.580 --> 02:30:18.260]   passes this planet without knowing what love is.
[02:30:18.260 --> 02:30:21.740]   And that could be a love to a pet, a love to a plant.
[02:30:21.740 --> 02:30:22.580]   - To a robot.
[02:30:22.580 --> 02:30:24.580]   Just kidding.
[02:30:24.580 --> 02:30:27.580]   Or a fake plant.
[02:30:27.580 --> 02:30:31.180]   We can't help who we love.
[02:30:31.180 --> 02:30:33.860]   What advice would you give to a young person today?
[02:30:33.860 --> 02:30:35.300]   High school, college?
[02:30:35.300 --> 02:30:42.060]   How to have a career they can be proud of
[02:30:42.060 --> 02:30:44.420]   or how to have a life they can be proud of?
[02:30:44.420 --> 02:30:46.540]   You said an interesting thing about brains
[02:30:46.540 --> 02:30:49.180]   being distributed evenly but opportunities not.
[02:30:49.180 --> 02:30:52.620]   It's really interesting to think about.
[02:30:52.620 --> 02:30:55.020]   I've talked to folks from Africa.
[02:30:55.020 --> 02:30:58.380]   You realize that there's whole areas of this earth
[02:30:58.380 --> 02:31:00.860]   that have so much brilliance.
[02:31:00.860 --> 02:31:03.020]   But unfortunately so little opportunity.
[02:31:03.020 --> 02:31:06.780]   And one of the exciting things about the 21st century
[02:31:06.780 --> 02:31:09.140]   is more and more opportunities are created.
[02:31:09.140 --> 02:31:10.580]   And so the brilliance is unlocked
[02:31:10.580 --> 02:31:12.100]   in all those different places.
[02:31:12.100 --> 02:31:15.940]   And so all these young people now have the opportunity
[02:31:15.940 --> 02:31:19.620]   to do something to change the world.
[02:31:19.620 --> 02:31:24.620]   - I had a chance to visit Bosnia.
[02:31:24.620 --> 02:31:29.820]   So I was invited to give a talk in a very,
[02:31:30.660 --> 02:31:35.020]   very northern most part of the country
[02:31:35.020 --> 02:31:38.500]   that was impacted by the war tremendously.
[02:31:38.500 --> 02:31:42.660]   And it was a public talk.
[02:31:42.660 --> 02:31:45.180]   It was open to everybody in the village.
[02:31:45.180 --> 02:31:48.780]   And I was told even people drew from Sarajevo to attend.
[02:31:48.780 --> 02:31:54.820]   Whenever I think about our role as a scientist
[02:31:54.820 --> 02:31:59.580]   or the beneficiaries of the knowledge
[02:31:59.580 --> 02:32:03.180]   that we create, I always think about that night.
[02:32:03.180 --> 02:32:05.780]   That's how many people were in that room.
[02:32:05.780 --> 02:32:09.260]   It was incredibly crowded.
[02:32:09.260 --> 02:32:14.260]   And lots of young people who were trying
[02:32:14.260 --> 02:32:19.300]   to start everything new and not do or not carry,
[02:32:19.300 --> 02:32:26.580]   replace whatever maybe the feeling that was taken
[02:32:26.580 --> 02:32:31.020]   from them with hope and love, start a new beginning,
[02:32:31.020 --> 02:32:33.740]   be the seed for the next generation.
[02:32:33.740 --> 02:32:36.540]   And it's moved me so much that they all came
[02:32:36.540 --> 02:32:40.260]   to hear about early life space,
[02:32:40.260 --> 02:32:41.780]   something maybe different for them
[02:32:41.780 --> 02:32:43.660]   that maybe they were always interested in
[02:32:43.660 --> 02:32:44.860]   and never thought about.
[02:32:44.860 --> 02:32:50.180]   But what stayed with me was just the look and the feeling,
[02:32:50.180 --> 02:32:52.820]   the look on their faces and the feeling in the room,
[02:32:52.820 --> 02:32:55.340]   the energy just was really moving to me.
[02:32:55.340 --> 02:32:58.180]   - Their willingness to be the seed,
[02:32:58.180 --> 02:33:01.220]   the first of their family and generation
[02:33:01.220 --> 02:33:02.540]   to do that big new thing.
[02:33:02.540 --> 02:33:07.540]   - Yes, and that's exactly why I'm telling this whole story.
[02:33:07.540 --> 02:33:13.340]   Because for most of us, we may have to be that seed
[02:33:13.340 --> 02:33:16.700]   in our families, the first one to do something new,
[02:33:16.700 --> 02:33:20.700]   to break that cycle, whatever it is
[02:33:20.700 --> 02:33:22.940]   that you want to break free from.
[02:33:24.260 --> 02:33:27.500]   I would want the young people to know that you can be that,
[02:33:27.500 --> 02:33:32.500]   that there are just wonderful things
[02:33:32.500 --> 02:33:35.700]   to learn from this life.
[02:33:35.700 --> 02:33:39.060]   And it's just incredible to be living.
[02:33:39.060 --> 02:33:42.300]   And I would want them to know that their voice matters
[02:33:42.300 --> 02:33:47.300]   and they need to use it, especially those who think
[02:33:47.300 --> 02:33:49.500]   that their voice doesn't matter.
[02:33:49.500 --> 02:33:54.140]   And ultimately, I think what it comes down to
[02:33:54.140 --> 02:33:59.100]   is to trusting yourself, trusting and respecting your voice.
[02:33:59.100 --> 02:34:01.540]   If you're not loved, learn how to love.
[02:34:01.540 --> 02:34:04.540]   If you are not respected, start by respecting yourself.
[02:34:04.540 --> 02:34:05.780]   Learn how to respect yourself.
[02:34:05.780 --> 02:34:07.280]   You can teach yourself things.
[02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:11.300]   - Yeah, it's really difficult when you're surrounded
[02:34:11.300 --> 02:34:14.180]   by people that don't believe in you.
[02:34:14.180 --> 02:34:17.900]   - Yes, I definitely know the feeling.
[02:34:17.900 --> 02:34:20.500]   And I would just want them to know
[02:34:20.500 --> 02:34:23.580]   that they don't need to be defined.
[02:34:24.540 --> 02:34:29.020]   By or reduced down to what others see in them.
[02:34:29.020 --> 02:34:32.300]   - Believe in yourself, have the respect,
[02:34:32.300 --> 02:34:35.700]   try to develop the respect and the love for yourself.
[02:34:35.700 --> 02:34:38.260]   And then from that, it flourishes.
[02:34:38.260 --> 02:34:40.020]   You'll find others that'll give you love.
[02:34:40.020 --> 02:34:41.300]   - It may not.
[02:34:41.300 --> 02:34:43.260]   I mean, life is not fair, it's true.
[02:34:43.260 --> 02:34:44.460]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:34:44.460 --> 02:34:49.460]   - Be prepared that it's not very fair, unfortunately.
[02:34:49.460 --> 02:34:52.940]   And so I don't want to depict this Disney story
[02:34:52.940 --> 02:34:56.220]   that, and then yes, and everything will be just fine.
[02:34:56.220 --> 02:34:58.460]   It's mostly isn't, but you learn a way.
[02:34:58.460 --> 02:35:00.780]   Learn, you know, life does it all the time.
[02:35:00.780 --> 02:35:05.660]   - Speaking of which, what do you think
[02:35:05.660 --> 02:35:07.820]   is the meaning of all this?
[02:35:07.820 --> 02:35:09.260]   What's the meaning of life?
[02:35:09.260 --> 02:35:12.060]   Why are we here?
[02:35:12.060 --> 02:35:13.020]   - Why we are here?
[02:35:13.020 --> 02:35:16.580]   - All the beauty you've discussed.
[02:35:16.580 --> 02:35:21.580]   Why is the translational mechanism machinery here?
[02:35:22.300 --> 02:35:23.140]   - Why?
[02:35:23.140 --> 02:35:23.980]   - I don't think there's--
[02:35:23.980 --> 02:35:26.180]   - Why so much beauty?
[02:35:26.180 --> 02:35:27.300]   - Why so much beauty?
[02:35:27.300 --> 02:35:30.860]   It is because we choose to see it that way.
[02:35:30.860 --> 02:35:32.380]   It's beautiful.
[02:35:32.380 --> 02:35:35.580]   But there is no meaning, I don't think, no, yeah.
[02:35:35.580 --> 02:35:38.100]   - But why is it so beautiful?
[02:35:38.100 --> 02:35:39.620]   Why did we choose?
[02:35:39.620 --> 02:35:44.060]   Why, from where is the imperative to see it,
[02:35:44.060 --> 02:35:48.020]   to see so much beauty in a thing
[02:35:48.020 --> 02:35:50.980]   that scientifically speaking,
[02:35:50.980 --> 02:35:55.700]   or from a rational perspective, is void of beauty?
[02:35:55.700 --> 02:35:57.440]   It's just, it just is.
[02:35:57.440 --> 02:36:01.540]   - Not everybody chooses to see the beauty.
[02:36:01.540 --> 02:36:04.940]   - Haters gonna hate.
[02:36:04.940 --> 02:36:09.100]   I mean, we have the capacity to see the beauty.
[02:36:09.100 --> 02:36:12.340]   - We have the capacity, so why not use it to the fullest?
[02:36:12.340 --> 02:36:14.100]   Right, we have the capacity.
[02:36:14.100 --> 02:36:16.700]   - But that capacity, isn't that fascinating?
[02:36:16.700 --> 02:36:18.020]   That we developed that?
[02:36:18.020 --> 02:36:20.860]   It feels like that was always laid in there
[02:36:20.860 --> 02:36:22.580]   in the whole process of life,
[02:36:22.580 --> 02:36:28.420]   this ability to find, to introspect ourselves.
[02:36:28.420 --> 02:36:31.980]   - I mean, it's definitely soothing to think like that,
[02:36:31.980 --> 02:36:35.020]   but I don't think there is a meaning like that way.
[02:36:35.020 --> 02:36:38.520]   It's fascinating that we can understand it.
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:41.460]   - But why is it soothing?
[02:36:41.460 --> 02:36:44.940]   There's a desire, there's a longing for it.
[02:36:44.940 --> 02:36:48.980]   - But soothing doesn't mean that there's a meaning.
[02:36:48.980 --> 02:36:51.460]   Why is soothing a meaning?
[02:36:51.460 --> 02:36:52.820]   Let me just put it this way,
[02:36:52.820 --> 02:36:56.320]   because there is just, I think, so much unfairness going on,
[02:36:56.320 --> 02:37:00.780]   I wouldn't even dare myself to think that there's a meaning
[02:37:00.780 --> 02:37:03.520]   out of respect to the ones that are suffering.
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:05.740]   - I see.
[02:37:05.740 --> 02:37:12.540]   I think out of suffering emerges flourishing and beauty.
[02:37:12.540 --> 02:37:13.980]   I mean, that's what I see.
[02:37:13.980 --> 02:37:15.100]   - I agree with you.
[02:37:15.100 --> 02:37:16.980]   - When I went to Ukraine,
[02:37:16.980 --> 02:37:20.620]   it's all the people suffering in their eyes
[02:37:20.620 --> 02:37:23.940]   and in their stories is a hope for the future,
[02:37:23.940 --> 02:37:28.380]   is a love for the people who are still living,
[02:37:28.380 --> 02:37:29.500]   is a love for life.
[02:37:29.500 --> 02:37:32.060]   So it's there, and that's the dark thing,
[02:37:32.060 --> 02:37:35.620]   is the suffering and the loss somehow intensifies
[02:37:35.620 --> 02:37:39.420]   your appreciation of the life that is still left.
[02:37:39.420 --> 02:37:40.260]   That's a weird thing too.
[02:37:40.260 --> 02:37:44.340]   - I think that there is something about
[02:37:44.340 --> 02:37:49.800]   still doing your best and believing that there's,
[02:37:49.800 --> 02:37:56.480]   whatever goodness is worth working for,
[02:37:56.480 --> 02:38:03.160]   is beyond, and to do that without a meaning,
[02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:09.140]   there's something more humbling and profound about that.
[02:38:09.140 --> 02:38:13.780]   And we have a,
[02:38:13.780 --> 02:38:19.800]   this will come out very random, okay, so just.
[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:27.060]   In Turkish bathrooms, there is this sign that says,
[02:38:27.060 --> 02:38:32.340]   "Leave it as you want to find it."
[02:38:32.340 --> 02:38:35.220]   - Yeah.
[02:38:35.220 --> 02:38:38.620]   - And I think that's a pretty good--
[02:38:38.620 --> 02:38:41.220]   - That's your meaning of life found in the Turkish.
[02:38:41.220 --> 02:38:42.460]   There's wisdom to that.
[02:38:42.460 --> 02:38:45.180]   - There's wisdom to that, but it also is because
[02:38:45.180 --> 02:38:49.260]   however you leave defines you, right?
[02:38:49.260 --> 02:38:52.460]   So I think there's some profound meaning to that too,
[02:38:52.460 --> 02:38:57.180]   that just leave it as you would want to find it.
[02:38:57.180 --> 02:39:03.620]   - So that your little scribble in the long story
[02:39:03.620 --> 02:39:06.740]   of life on Earth is one that ultimately
[02:39:06.740 --> 02:39:10.780]   did a pretty good job, at least kept it the same
[02:39:10.780 --> 02:39:11.620]   as you found it.
[02:39:11.620 --> 02:39:15.780]   - Or at least I left it in the way that I wish I found it.
[02:39:15.780 --> 02:39:17.020]   - Yeah, yeah, right.
[02:39:17.020 --> 02:39:20.420]   Oh man.
[02:39:20.420 --> 02:39:22.620]   - Yes, that's the wisdom from Turkish bathrooms.
[02:39:22.620 --> 02:39:25.260]   - That's where I search for wisdom as well.
[02:39:25.260 --> 02:39:29.860]   And as we started with the origin of life
[02:39:29.860 --> 02:39:33.140]   and ended with the wisdom in a Turkish bathroom,
[02:39:33.140 --> 02:39:34.740]   I think that's a perfect conversation.
[02:39:34.740 --> 02:39:36.140]   You're an incredible person.
[02:39:36.860 --> 02:39:38.780]   The humor, the humanity,
[02:39:38.780 --> 02:39:40.700]   but also the brilliance of your work.
[02:39:40.700 --> 02:39:43.300]   I really appreciate that you would talk with me today.
[02:39:43.300 --> 02:39:44.780]   This was really fun.
[02:39:44.780 --> 02:39:46.780]   - Thanks for having me.
[02:39:46.780 --> 02:39:48.380]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:39:48.380 --> 02:39:49.900]   with Batool Kachar.
[02:39:49.900 --> 02:39:51.060]   To support this podcast,

[02:39:53.660 --> 02:39:56.820]   And now let me leave you with one of my favorite quotes
[02:39:56.820 --> 02:39:57.980]   from Robert Frost.
[02:39:57.980 --> 02:40:00.780]   "In three words, I can sum up everything
[02:40:00.780 --> 02:40:02.900]   "I've ever learned about life.
[02:40:02.900 --> 02:40:05.940]   "It goes on."
[02:40:05.940 --> 02:40:07.260]   Thank you for listening.
[02:40:07.260 --> 02:40:09.020]   I hope to see you next time.

[02:40:11.620 --> 02:40:14.220]   (upbeat music)
