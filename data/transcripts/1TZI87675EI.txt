[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   what kind of returns do you think people can expect in their real estate investing?
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.960]   So let's say that we assume that real estate is going to appreciate at an average of 3.4% per
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.600]   year. And if you lever that 5 to 1, at least in the early years, you're going to get an
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.480]   appreciation rate that multiplies 3.4 times 5. You're going to be amortizing your debt during
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.800]   that debt service on that for the 80% of the value that is levered. And then you're going to
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.600]   hopefully be producing some cash flow as well. Over the 30 year period, you're slowly deleveraging,
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.720]   assuming things go reasonably well, right? You're paying down the loan,
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.800]   the property is appreciating, so your equity balance grows. And once it's paid off,
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.400]   now you're getting the unlevered real estate return of like 3.4% plus maybe a 4% to 5% cap
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.440]   rate. You're probably looking at a 7.5% to 8.5% unlevered return at the end of that whole period,
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.320]   once you've paid off the debt, and you're looking at more than that in the early parts of it.
