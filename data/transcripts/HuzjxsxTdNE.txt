[00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.200]   lifestyle creep is this idea that i'm gonna make more money and i'm just gonna blindly spend it on
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.280]   whatever comes in front of me and i will grant that a lot of people do that when i say i don't
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.080]   believe in lifestyle creep i don't believe in it for me and for my readers because when i go and
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.200]   buy something really expensive i'm not creeping anything i'm not lifestyle creeping anything i am
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.080]   running my numbers i am always leaving a fat buffer because i don't ever want to get close
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.120]   to the red line and i'm gonna buy it if i make more money of course i'm gonna spend more money
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.720]   that's the point the point is not to save this money like freaking scrooge mcduck no i'm actually
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.960]   going to be methodical i even have a number for every bit of unexpected income that comes in my
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.640]   wife and i have a plan this percentage goes to investments this percentage goes to travel this
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.600]   percentage goes to permanent lifestyle increases like going out for an extra date night something
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.920]   like that you better believe if i work hard and if i make more money my life is going to get better
