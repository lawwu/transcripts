[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.040]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.840]   with author and longtime pastor, John Piper.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.380]   Pastor John, you've just completed
[00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.720]   an eight week writing leave.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.040]   It's been a fruitful one from what you've said.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.520]   Can you give us a window into how it went
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.360]   and perhaps maybe more importantly,
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.760]   give us a sneak peek as to what you wrote
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.560]   and what you expect to come out of it.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.560]   - Tony, I really want to thank any of our listeners
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.560]   who prayed for me during that leave.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.560]   Here's a little example of the kind of merciful providence
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.600]   that I received and I believe it's 'cause people
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.860]   cared enough to pray.
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.920]   So you start to write at the beginning
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.440]   of an eight week writing leave,
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.200]   you have a general idea of the kind of book
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.080]   you want to write.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.920]   I wanted to write a book about how to read the Bible
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.880]   in the most Christ exalting, God-centered,
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.880]   life-changing, mission advancing way possible.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.000]   I had no idea how long this book would be.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.100]   I had no idea how many chapters it would have.
[00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.100]   I only had the vaguest idea of the several focuses
[00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.840]   I wanted it to have and so I just started
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.340]   gathering material and pondering and thinking
[00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.660]   about structure and doodling down ideas
[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.620]   and finally getting to work on pounding out chapters
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.620]   and lo and behold, on the very last day
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.440]   of the eight week writing leave,
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.440]   130,000 word book is finished on the very day.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.160]   - Nice.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.280]   - Now to me, that is astonishing.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.160]   It's just astonishing.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.540]   I didn't plan that.
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.800]   I had no idea how long the book would be.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.700]   At any given point, I didn't know whether
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.400]   I was halfway done or three quarters done.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.400]   I didn't have any idea and so the entire project
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.680]   lands on that last day.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.820]   So that, to me personally, that just felt
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.820]   like an evidence of the kindness of God
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.440]   and the power of God to take those eight weeks,
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.320]   take people's prayers, take some ideas
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.760]   and perform what felt to me like a marvel.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.120]   So as far as going about how you go about it,
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.520]   the answer is sitz fleisch.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.000]   The Germans call it, you gotta have sitting flesh.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.320]   You gotta care about sitting all day long.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.080]   So I get up at six in the morning,
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.240]   I exercise, I shower, I eat my cereal,
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.640]   I read my Bible, I pray, I sit down
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.680]   and I get up at seven o'clock in the evening
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.280]   and you do that every day for five days
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.840]   and at the end, actually I did it on Saturday
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.680]   as well for a couple of weeks, but I think only two.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.080]   And that's the sneak peek.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.840]   There's nothing magical about it.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.840]   You chop down a tree with lots of chops
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.800]   and you sit down and you try not to get discouraged
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.280]   that one day wasn't so fruitful and another day was.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.880]   But what I'm really excited about sharing
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.600]   with the folks is the content.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.520]   So let me just quick give a preview
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.720]   into what I hope it's gonna be.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.320]   I don't know for sure what the title will be,
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.240]   but my suggested title right now
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.080]   is "Reading the Bible Supernaturally,"
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.600]   subtitle, "Seeing and Savoring the Glory of God
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.760]   in Scripture."
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.720]   So it's a big book, probably 350 pages.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.840]   It's not a technical book.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.840]   It's not written mainly for scholars.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.080]   It is a serious book.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.480]   It's mainly biblical explanations and applications.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.160]   And my hope is that it will inspire people
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.680]   to love the Bible and to give their most serious
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.840]   mental, spiritual attention to the Bible.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.800]   I've been more deeply impressed than ever
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.760]   on this writing leave with the wonderful truth
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.120]   that the creator of the universe has communicated
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.360]   so fully to us about himself and his purposes
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.120]   for the world and his great salvation
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.320]   and his future plans for us and the world
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.860]   in a book, a book that we have.
[00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.720]   Just think of it, the God who made and rules the world
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.320]   has given us a book about himself
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.320]   and about the way he does things.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.160]   That's simply staggering to me.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.080]   And oh, how I want to be faithful to the sacredness
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.080]   of that deposit in our world and in our lives.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.280]   So my fallible book about his infallible book
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.120]   has three parts.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.240]   And the first part is called,
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.240]   "The Ultimate Goal of God in Reading."
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.440]   And there I try to make the case that the ultimate purposes
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.200]   of God in the universe will fall to pieces
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.200]   and abort if Christians don't read their Bible
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.280]   the way God intends.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.680]   And that's shocking when you say it like that.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.480]   But of course, God's purposes will not fall to pieces
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.320]   and abort because Jeremiah says,
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.040]   "He is watching over his word to perform it."
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.360]   God doesn't set out his word in the world
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.240]   and then walk away and watch from a distance
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.720]   to see what's gonna come of his word.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.760]   He watches over his word to perform it.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.960]   He's in his people by his spirit.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.520]   And those who are truly his people will in fact
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.200]   read their Bibles and will be changed by that reading.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.720]   And so the ultimate purpose of God in the universe,
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.720]   I argue, is that he be worshiped with white hot affection
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.360]   as the supreme excellence and value of the universe
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.480]   by a people gathered from all the nations
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.000]   and tribes of the world.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.640]   So the Bible is the place where people see God
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.880]   clearly enough that the Holy Spirit might be moving them
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.880]   to savor him supremely enough that they'll be changed enough
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.760]   into his likeness so that he will get the white hot worship
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.120]   that he deserves.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.120]   So Bible reading is a necessary, indispensable instrument
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.840]   in the hand of God to bring about the ultimate purposes
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.040]   of the universe.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.280]   That's part one.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.280]   Part two is called the supernatural act of reading.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:50.480]   And the point is that if we have to see the glory of God
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.600]   in scripture, and if we have to savor the glory of God
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.720]   above all things, that's a miracle.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.520]   Because by nature, John Piper and nobody else
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.240]   reads the Bible and sees the glory of God
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.980]   and savors it above all things.
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.860]   That's contrary to fallen human nature.
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.460]   So a miracle has to happen.
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.440]   Something super natural has to happen
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.560]   in the reading of the book, or the book is going to abort
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.220]   in its ultimate purposes.
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.600]   For example, one of the chapters that moved me most
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.280]   was the one I did about the Pharisees
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.540]   and the Jewish leaders.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.380]   Jesus said six times to them, "Have you never read?"
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.040]   And I thought, what?
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.300]   That's all they do is read.
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.080]   They are professional Bible readers.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.620]   That's what they do.
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.920]   They knew this book by heart.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.100]   And Jesus looked at them and said,
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.760]   "You talk like you've never read the Bible."
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.560]   That makes me tremble.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.100]   I mean, will he look at me someday?
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.400]   Will he say, "Piper, when you act like that,
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.080]   "when you talk like that,
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.420]   "when you have those kinds of discouragements or feelings,
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.200]   "you act like you've never read the Bible."
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.720]   So I need to know what did those Pharisees miss?
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.160]   Goodnight, how can you spend a lifetime reading the Bible
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.380]   and miss it?
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.720]   Because Jesus said, "Seeing you do not see."
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.280]   They didn't see.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.480]   So my aim in this book, for my sake and for others,
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.200]   is to figure out what did they do wrong?
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.640]   I wanna see what they didn't see.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.280]   And it takes a miracle for that to happen.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.960]   This is called supernatural reading of the Bible.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.800]   And the last part is called the natural act
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.880]   of reading the Bible supernaturally.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.160]   And it's supposed to sound paradoxical
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.160]   because reading the Bible is both natural and supernatural,
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.040]   just like the Bible itself is divinely inspired
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.100]   and yet in human language.
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.440]   And this is where I try to give my most practical help
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.480]   of what is good reading.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.080]   And I try not to get too bogged down
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.600]   in hermeneutical details,
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.760]   but keep it at the level of habits of mind
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.440]   and habits of heart that apply to all the passages
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.400]   of the Bible to make them as transformative
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.840]   in our reading as they can be.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.460]   And the last thing maybe it would be helpful to say
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.800]   is just to quote a scripture that perhaps,
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.880]   I don't know, I didn't do the count.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.400]   I quoted more than any other scripture,
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.040]   namely 2 Corinthians 3, 18.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:37.040]   "We all with unveiled face beholding the glory of the Lord
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.680]   are being changed from one degree of glory to another
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.920]   into the same image."
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.800]   So beholding or seeing God,
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.360]   seeing his glory in Christ especially
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.360]   is the key to being changed into the likeness of Christ
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:01.680]   that moves the church toward the consummation of all things.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.240]   So we have to behold the glory of the Lord
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:10.240]   and that happens decisively in the reading of the Bible
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.640]   or the hearing of the revelation of the glory of God
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.880]   in the face of Christ as it's told in the Bible.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.280]   And that's what I'm praying God will do with this book.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.160]   - That is beautiful.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.560]   Thank you Pastor John for the update.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.080]   And so how does John Piper get so much done?
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.300]   That's a question I wanna ask you Pastor John next week,
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.620]   actually on Monday.
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.280]   We'll talk about personal productivity.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.800]   But first tomorrow I wanna talk about
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.440]   the American cultural phenomenon.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.460]   For the first time in America,
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.760]   unmarried women outnumber married women.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.040]   What does that mean for Christians?
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.300]   What does that mean for the church?
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.840]   We'll talk about that tomorrow.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.680]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.240]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:05.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
