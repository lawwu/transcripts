[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.080]   that chapter, a portion of which we read at the beginning in the Book of Numbers, Chapter
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:23.000]   11, reading especially verses 4, 5, and 6. Verses 4, 5, and 6 in the eleventh chapter
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:33.620]   of the Book of Numbers. "And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a-lusting. And the
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:42.440]   children of Israel also wept again and said, 'Who shall give us flesh to eat?'" We remember
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:50.160]   the fish which we did eat in Egypt freely, the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:59.600]   and the onions and the garlic. But now our soul is dried away. There is nothing at all
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:10.560]   beside this manner before our eyes. Now some may well wonder, after I read three
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:21.100]   verses like that, as to what that has got to do with modern men and with this modern
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:34.440]   world in which we find ourselves this evening. I propose to deal with that question and to
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.120]   answer it, because I want to try to show you that those three verses that I have just read
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:50.580]   to you, more clearly than anything else that I know of at the present moment, deal with
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:58.520]   the world situation as it is at this very hour. And not only the world situation, but
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:07.720]   the whole case and condition of men at this very moment. I am claiming, in other words,
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.840]   for this book which we call the Bible, that it is the most up-to-date book in the world,
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.800]   that there is nothing which is so contemporary, and that there is nothing which gives us such
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.960]   an insight into all our problems and difficulties. There is nothing which helps us to get out
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:36.160]   of them in any way comparable to this book. Now what do I mean by all this? Well, I am
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:44.880]   referring, of course, to the facts of the present situation as they are being placed
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:52.680]   before us with a monotonous regularity in the daily newspapers. This is the time of
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.080]   the year when conferences are held. At this time of the year, the schoolteachers, the
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.120]   schoolmasters, people who are concerned about social and moral problems, they generally
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.720]   have their annual conferences, and they have been having them this year as usual. And their
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:22.880]   reports have been most illuminating, because we find that they all virtually and rarely
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:30.800]   are saying exactly the same thing. They all realize that in addition to the international
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:40.360]   situation, we are confronted by a very serious, a very grave moral problem in this country
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:49.960]   itself. Indeed, they seem to be coming more and more to see clearly that most of our problems,
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.800]   industrial problems, the problem of work, the problem of production, all these problems
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:04.760]   ultimately stem back to this common origin, which is the moral rot that has set in. And
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.160]   this is something which is showing itself in quite a variety of different ways.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:19.680]   They have been discussing again the problem of the children of today, and the difficulty
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:31.640]   of controlling them, the lawlessness that is rampant, the so-called problem of the adolescents,
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:39.400]   these youths and maidens, who seem to recognize no rules and regulations whatsoever, and who
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:47.520]   just, for instance, walk up to a bus and just strike a knife into the tires for no reason
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:55.000]   whatsoever, this destructive impulse that is manifesting itself and causing such acute
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:04.080]   concern to the authorities. And then, of course, the perennial problem today of marriage, and
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.600]   the breakdown in the marriage relationship, and in home life, and in the family life,
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.160]   and in all these things.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.680]   Now I say that once more, all this has come out, it's there before us, you've been reading
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:26.120]   the details probably, statements made by headmasters of schools who are in a position to know as
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:34.200]   to the prevalence of smoking amongst the boys under 13, and between 13 and 15, and so on,
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:40.400]   the number who drink at that age, and all the liberty in matters of sex at that age,
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.120]   well, it's all been put before us, there they are, they have produced statistics. And they
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:54.280]   are extremely concerned about the whole situation. And because of that, they are, of course,
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:02.480]   making their suggestions as usual. They all seem to be agreed that so far there is no
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:11.320]   solution. So they are all, in various ways and forms, suggesting the setting up of commissions,
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:17.560]   commissions of inquiry. Let me just give you one exact quotation. A statement was made
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:25.920]   by a leading mental health specialist. And he urged that we should set up a national
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:32.660]   center for advanced studies of marriage problems and how to solve them. He then went on and
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:39.320]   said this, this is actually, these are actually the words he used. He said, "These problems
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:48.220]   should be tackled as if it were cancer or polio we were having to treat." Now you see
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:54.920]   his suggestion. He says here is this great moral problem. And he was urging that at last
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:00.740]   it is surely time, and everybody should agree that it's time, that we should develop a kind
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:07.320]   of research unit. Now he says we are doing this with regard to cancer and poliomyelitis.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:12.960]   There is great organized research and men are being paid to do that. This great problem
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.240]   of cancer is being tackled along many lines. They are doing it on animals, experimenting.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.820]   They are doing it with x-ray and with treatment. Now he said this is excellent. Now what we
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:28.600]   want is a similar research center with regard to these great moral problems. And in particular
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:35.840]   he was referring to the whole problem of marriage. Now there, you see, is the confession of the
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:41.880]   bankruptcy of all this. But that is what they are saying. Now these are able men, these
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:47.480]   are learned men in professions, these are men who are taking the position very seriously
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:54.320]   and are indeed genuinely and gravely concerned. But that is what they tell us. They give us
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:08:03.560]   the facts and the statistics and the best that they can produce as a solution is investigation,
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:12.240]   research work, a commission of inquiry. Well now, what are we to say to all this? Well,
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:18.720]   I want to make just two comments in passing this evening. Here is the first. And I say
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:28.040]   this with the greatest possible respect. All that has already proved to be completely hopeless
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:35.800]   and useless. Man has never been so busy in doing that kind of thing as he has been during
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:43.760]   the past hundred years. Think of the commissions that have been set up. Think of all the new
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:50.220]   social arrangements that have been introduced, all the things designed for the amelioration
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:56.160]   of conditions. It has been tried and been tried with a great thoroughness. Never have
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:02.320]   we been so organized in that respect as we are now. And yet the problem seems to be going
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.940]   from bad to worse. I am constantly repeating these things and I will go on repeating them
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:13.640]   until people believe them. Never have we been so well educated in this country. Never have
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:20.560]   we had so many social institutions. Just make a list of them and it is quite astonishing.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.680]   Notice how every year there is something new being done in order to train people and to
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:31.920]   guide them and to teach them and somehow or another to solve this great moral problem.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:38.120]   And yet, you see, we are still proposing the same thing. Another commission, another attempt
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:45.400]   at investigation, a new research project, and on and on it goes. But after all, my important
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:56.600]   remark is the second one, which is this, that all this is totally and completely unnecessary.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:03.920]   Here is this great authority who proposes, you see, to set up a national center for advanced
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:10.200]   studies into this social problem. I say, before they have set it up, it is unnecessary. It
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:20.760]   isn't needed. Why? Well, because we've already got the complete answer to the whole situation.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:27.240]   And it is the answer that is to be found in this book. There is no need to set up a national
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:35.280]   center for investigation. There is a perfect diagnosis here in the Bible. Accurate, detailed,
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:42.400]   and comprehensive. Not only that, the treatment is already available. Now, this is, of course,
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:50.120]   the supreme tragedy in the world this evening, that men like this of learning and of understanding,
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.680]   genuinely concerned about the problem, say, "Ah, we must set up a new center. We really
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:59.560]   must tackle this now. We must organize teams as we do with cancer and polio. We really
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:05.120]   must do this in a scientific manner." And then we may arrive at the cause and may find
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:16.320]   a cure. And the whole time, here is the answer in the Bible. Why don't they accept this?
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:23.240]   Why don't they believe this? Well, the answer that they give, of course, is that this cannot
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:32.480]   possibly be the answer, because it's so old. This here, that old book of yours, both the
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:40.760]   Old Testament and the New Testament, are, at the very least, some sixteen hundred years
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:50.360]   old. The canon of the Old Testament was formed and completed before the birth of Christ.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:56.680]   The canon of the New Testament was settled and delimited soon afterwards, a few hundred
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:02.440]   years afterwards. Here you are, you are asking us to come back to a book that men have been
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:09.040]   reading and considering for at least sixteen hundred years. And they say the thing is patently
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:14.280]   monstrous and quite impossible. How can all that deal with the problems of the twentieth
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:19.560]   century? My dear sir, they say, when are you going to come up to date? When are you going
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.960]   to realize that we are living in a world that's so different from that ancient world? Now
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:33.400]   that's the argument, as you know. And there, of course, is the essential fallacy, the central
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:40.720]   trouble with the modern outlook and the modern man. For the Bible, you see, even answers
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:49.360]   that when it puts it like this. It says that all men's troubles are due to sin. That all
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:56.360]   men's troubles are due to his wrong relationship to God. And it goes further. It says that
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:03.040]   that has always been true of men since that point at the beginning when men sinned against
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:12.600]   God and fell. Now the Bible's claim is that from that moment men has rarely been in the
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:18.880]   same position and in the same condition. In other words, the Bible says, of course, there
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.960]   are developments as life has gone on. You see that very development even in the Bible
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:29.400]   itself. Yes, but, says the Bible, all these developments don't touch the radical and the
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:38.920]   fundamental problem. So the developments have been simply on the surface. There have been
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:44.360]   no developments in the spirit of men. There have been no developments in what is true
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:52.880]   of men fundamentally. The developments have only been in clothing and things like that.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:58.000]   Sometimes people dress like savages. They don't dress like that now. But, you see, it's
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.600]   only the clothing that has changed. The man is exactly as he was before. Oh, but, says
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:08.200]   someone, what about the aeroplane and what about the jet plane and so on? Surely there's
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:13.480]   a difference between that and men walking. Well, may I quote what I once said in this
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:22.640]   connection? Of course, I'm well aware of these great advances in locomotion and in a thousand
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:29.720]   and one other respects science has produced some astounding results and, well, let's thank
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:34.960]   God for them, although I'm doubtful of that at times. But let's thank God for the advances
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:42.000]   in the main and in general. But let me ask you the serious and the important question.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.440]   What has all that sort of thing got to do with men? You see, it's in spite of the jet
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:53.320]   plane and in spite of the atomic power that we've still got the problem of juvenile delinquency
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:58.560]   and all these other things that the statisticians have been putting before us these last few
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:03.640]   weeks. On the one hand, there is this phenomenal advance in scientific knowledge, but these
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:07.840]   old problems, they're still there. And, of course, they've always been there. They're
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:18.840]   in the Bible. Oh, let me put it like this, therefore, as I say I once put it before.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:27.000]   Man certainly travels at a much faster rate today than he did two thousand years ago.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.480]   But the interesting thing is this, is the object of his journey. The modern man tears
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:39.920]   along if you like at 700 miles an hour in a jet plane. Men two thousand years ago used
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.600]   to walk, yes, but the vital question is what are they going to do? Why are they traveling
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:50.680]   at all? And the answer is they're traveling for exactly the same reasons, to make love
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:57.400]   or to make war or to do business. Same thing. No difference whatsoever. The only difference
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:02.480]   is in the rate at which they do it. We do things in a hurry, no, they did it leisurely
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:12.000]   again, but the things we are doing are exactly the same. Man has always eaten and taken drink.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.040]   Man has always fallen in love and wants to get married. Man brings up a family. Still
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:20.480]   the same, you see. What's the atomic bomb and the jet plane got to do with this? These
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:26.440]   problems, says the Bible, are fundamental. These never change. They're always with us.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:31.640]   And all the changes that people talk about so much and all about the twentieth century
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:41.040]   is a complete irrelevance. The fact that we have got all these scientific advances and
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:49.080]   developments doesn't mean, you know, that stealing is no longer stealing, or that adultery
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:55.960]   is no longer adultery, or that any one of these things has become something different.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:01.120]   Very well then, that is, I say, the great fundamental case of the Bible. There is no
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:06.480]   need, I say, for these new investigations. The trouble has already been diagnosed, it's
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:11.520]   been analyzed, it's been exposed, it's set out before us. Here it is, and there's only
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:21.160]   one solution. Now I want to stress this point, that it is the failure to realize this that
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:26.760]   is not only the tragedy of the present hour, it indeed accounts for most of our modern
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:32.800]   problems. It's because the world will not realize that the Bible tells us the truth
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:40.720]   about ourselves, that we've got our urgent problems this evening. What do I mean? I mean
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:49.760]   this, that so many of our major problems today are due to the fact that because we have rejected
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:55.640]   the biblical view of man in sin, and sin is the explanation of man as he is, and have
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:01.440]   adopted certain other theories, that we've got our problems. What are they? Well, here
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:13.200]   I say, is the trouble. It is because men no longer believe that man is radically sinful
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:21.880]   and rotten and vile, that the heart of men is desperately wicked and deceitful. It's
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:29.080]   because they don't believe that, that they don't believe in discipline. And it's because
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:34.520]   they don't believe in that, they also don't believe in punishment any longer. And it is
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:39.760]   because of this view, I say, that so many of our problems are confronting us at this
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.920]   present time. You see, the modern view is this, "Oh," they say, "that biblical view
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:49.080]   of sin, it's insulting to men." That's not true. Man is not a miserable sinner. Man is
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:54.240]   not a vile creature. Man's a very noble character. They say man's essentially good, and if you're
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:59.040]   only kind and nice to him, he'll respond to the treatment. And if you'll only persuade
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.520]   him and plead with him, he's certain to follow you. No, no, they say, let's get rid of this
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:11.480]   biblical notion of sin. That's out of date. Man is essentially good. Every child that's
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:20.320]   born is a Peter Pan, nothing but beauty and goodness. Oh, if only we drew out the goodness
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:25.040]   in men instead of denouncing him and talking about sin, the world, they say, would be a
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:32.560]   much better place. So, you abolish discipline in the schools. You don't care in people any
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:44.040]   longer. And you abolish punishment to criminals. Though a criminal may enter into the house
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:50.440]   of a poor defenseless widow and beat her in order to rob her, oh, he mustn't be beaten.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:56.080]   No, no, there must be no punishment. Punishment is quite wrong. Punishment's based on that
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:01.400]   biblical view of sin and the wrath of God. No, no, we say we don't believe in that. We're
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:06.040]   emancipated out of all that. We believe that if you're only kind to people, and if you
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.940]   only shower your love upon them, oh, they'll become marvelous saints, and they'll give
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:16.760]   a wonderful response. Now, that's been the controlling theory for nearly a hundred years.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:22.440]   This was thrown overboard and was replaced by that. And as I say, we are reaping some
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:31.160]   of the major consequences of that today. I've already mentioned it, the problem of children,
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:39.480]   the lawlessness amongst children, the problem in the schools, this problem of behavior,
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:45.800]   the problem in the prisons. Yes, and you see, it's even appeared on the international scale
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:53.840]   and on the international sphere. Wasn't this rarely what was at the back of the attempt
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:21:04.280]   to appease a man like Hitler? Wasn't it that belief that if you only met him, he sits one
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:11.760]   side of the table, you sit the other, and talk reasonably to him, he's bound to respond?
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:16.120]   Now that was the attitude. There were many who advocated that in the church and outside
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:21.640]   the church. Statesmen believed it. They believed, you see, that if only you indulge in a sweet
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:27.560]   reasonableness, that everybody's bound to respond. They don't believe in the radical
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:33.040]   evil that is in men, and therefore all problems can be solved. And of course, it's being advocated
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:41.840]   at the present time. Sweet reasonableness and kindness. And no talk about this evil
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:46.840]   in the human heart, and the need of regeneration and a complete change, and the need of the
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:53.000]   coming of the Son of God from heaven to earth, and his death upon a cross on Calvary. No,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.960]   no. Education can do it. Meeting together can do it. But the question is, are they doing
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:06.600]   it? My dear friends, I'm regarded as a man who's not interested in the present modern
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:11.160]   situation, because I don't come into this pulpit every night and talk about the atomic
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:15.680]   bomb, or about Jordan, or about Egypt, or something like that. The fact of the matter
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:22.760]   is, I'm the only man, in a sense, who is dealing with these problems. There is only
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:28.840]   one thing that can deal with the situation. It's this. Everything else has been tried,
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.880]   is being tried. It leads to nothing, and it never will. Why? Well, because its whole basis
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:45.960]   is wrong. It doesn't know man. And the first thing we have to realize is to realize the
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:54.600]   need of man, the condition of man. There is no hope until we realize the seriousness of
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:59.880]   the problem, the fundamental character of the problem, the depth of the problem, that
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:06.720]   man, I say, is, as he is pictured here in the Scriptures, and that he is so bad that
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:13.240]   he can never cure himself. He takes the coming of the Son of God from heaven to earth, and
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:21.560]   to the cross, and to hell, in order to deliver him. That's the situation. Very well, it's
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:26.440]   because all that is outlined in these three verses that I'm calling your attention to
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:36.360]   them. Now, that's been a long apologia, hasn't it, and a long introduction. Yes, but it was
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:42.600]   necessary, you see, because if I'd just gone straight to my exposition, certain people
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.160]   would have gone out saying, "Well, of course, that's all right, that's all right for the
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:49.360]   individual, but of course he's not interested in the social problems, never talks about
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.720]   them, never hear him arguing politics in the pulpit, he's not interested." I want to show
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:58.400]   you that I'm so tremendously interested that I'm desperate about it, and that's why I'm
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:09.200]   advocating the only solution. It's all here, I say. And what we are told is, of course,
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:17.800]   that men's troubles are entirely and always due to this one thing, and that is sin in
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:23.520]   the human heart. And here we see it, you see, here are the children of Israel, traveling
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:29.520]   up from the bondage and the captivity of Egypt into the land, the promised land of Canaan.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:34.080]   And here they are, quite suddenly, and without any reason for it, we are told that the mixed
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:40.160]   multitude that was among them fell a lusting, which can also be translated like this, suddenly
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:49.520]   had a strong craving. And the children of Israel also wept and said, "Who shall give
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:58.600]   us flesh to eat?" and so on. Now, here I'm asking you to consider these three verses
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:09.600]   with me, because I want to try to show you that they give us such a perfect analysis
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:19.200]   and a description of men's condition in sin. The world is as it is, I say, because of what
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:27.160]   sin has done to men. What has sin done to men? Well, sin has done to men what is described
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:32.760]   in these three verses. I only have time to deal with the first aspect of this subject
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:39.240]   this evening. God knows, if God is willing, we'll come back to it on some future occasion.
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:43.800]   We'll come back to it a week tonight, and perhaps for two or three subsequent Sunday
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:54.840]   evenings. But now, here's the first thing. Sin, we are told here, has made men a victim
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:26:06.600]   of lust and of craving. The mixed multitude had a strong craving, fell a lusting. And
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:11.560]   the children of Israel also wept again and said, "Who shall give us flesh to eat?"
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:18.080]   We remember the fish which we did eat in Egypt, really the cucumbers, and the melons, and
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:24.400]   the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic. But now, our soul is dried away. There is
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:31.640]   nothing at all beside this manner before our eyes. Oh, what a perfect description of the
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.960]   modern man, what a perfect description of the modern world. What's the matter with
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:40.560]   men? What's the matter with the world? Why are the great men troubled and anxious and
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:49.560]   proposing to set up new centers of research? What's the cause of all the problem? Lust!
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:58.320]   Craving! Man is a creature of lust, and passion, and craving. What does this mean? Well, let
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:06.640]   me analyze it for you briefly. Let me put it in another form. The first thing I find
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:18.280]   here is this, that sin is something within us. Sin, which causes all our troubles and
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:26.860]   problems, is a principle within us. It's something in the very warp and woof of our
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:37.160]   very nature. Now, I find that in this way. Did you notice that these people fell a-lusting
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:44.440]   without any provocation whatsoever? They'd been brought out of the bondage of Egypt.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:49.440]   They'd been taken across the Red Sea, and here they are on the way to the Promised Land,
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.880]   and absolutely suddenly, without any provocation at all and no reason whatsoever, they begin
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:28:02.640]   to lust. What made them do it? I say it's this principle that is within. Something that
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:09.120]   is in our very nature and in the vitals of our being. Now, this is the most important
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:19.480]   thing of all to grasp. Man is a creature, as the result of the fall, that has this evil,
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:28.800]   wrong, foul principle within him. I have a supreme authority for saying this. The Son
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:35.480]   of God himself, you'll find it stated in the fifteenth chapter of the Gospel according
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:41.600]   to St. Matthew and the seventh chapter of Mark. "It is not that which entereth into
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:46.760]   the mouth that defileth the men," says our blessed Lord and Saviour, "it's that which
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:55.440]   comes out." It is out of the heart that come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications,
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:01.480]   lasciviousness, all the things that have recently been appearing in the press. Our Lord gave
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:08.400]   the list, the catalogue, long before these people ever came into the world. Out of the
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:19.120]   heart, from the center of a man's being. That is where all these things originate.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:24.480]   But you see, the teaching is not confined to our Lord. You get it in these epistles.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:30.640]   Let me read you how James puts exactly the same teaching, the same principle. He puts
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:37.760]   it in this way. Listen to him. Here's an analysis of modern men. "Let no man say
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:43.160]   when he is tempted, 'I am tempted of God,' for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:50.760]   tempteth he any man. But every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:57.960]   enticed. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin; and sin, when it is finished,
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:06.080]   bringeth forth death." There it is. That's the history of the whole thing.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:14.320]   And then you remember the way in which the Apostle Paul puts it. It's all there in
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:20.360]   that great seventh chapter of his epistle to the Romans. "What's the matter with
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:30.960]   me?" he asks, and he answers his own question. "I find a law within my members. Why can't
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:35.400]   I do what I want to do? Why am I always doing the thing that I know to be wrong? What is
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:41.200]   it? I delight in the law of God after the inward, but I find another law in my members."
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:46.480]   That's it. It's a principle within. And he goes further and he says, "I have come
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:53.240]   to this conclusion, that in me, that is to say in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing. Was
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:57.960]   he worse than anybody else? Of course he wasn't. He was the same as everybody else. And that
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:03.040]   is the simple truth about every one of us. There is within us a principle of evil. There
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:09.280]   is in us that which is rotten, that which is vile. These people fell a lusting. Why?
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:16.200]   Well, because there was lust within them. In other words, the principle that I am establishing
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:29.280]   you see is this, that sin is something that is in us, even apart from temptation. You
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:36.920]   needn't wait to be tempted in order to sin. And it's a very great fallacy to think that
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:45.080]   men only sin because of their temptations. Of course, that is of the very essence of
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:51.400]   the modern outlook. That's why they fondly believe, you see, that if you just give us
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:57.800]   all new houses and if you indulge in certain social improvements, that nobody will ever
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:02.360]   sin again. They really do believe that. They've believed that for a hundred years. They say
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:06.520]   keep temptation away from people and they'll no longer sin. What you call sin, of course,
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:11.480]   is just a response to an environment. Make the environment perfect and the men will be
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:16.560]   all right. But you see, that's a contradiction of this principle which tells us that sin
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:20.920]   is in our nature as a principle. And haven't we all proved it? Haven't you often found
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:25.760]   this the first thing when you wake up in the morning? You've been soundly asleep, you wake
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:33.000]   up and before you've done anything or anybody's done anything to you, an evil thought comes.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:41.360]   Where did it come from? You hadn't read a book. You hadn't seen one of these vile advertisements
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:46.400]   that's on the hoardings. You were in your bed with the blinds drawn. Nobody said a word
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:54.040]   to you. Nobody made any suggestion or insinuation to you. And yet there you were alone and suddenly
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:33:04.200]   this vile, evil thing came. Where did it come from? Sin is a principle in the heart. And
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:13.240]   if you read the biographies and the confessions of men who, because of this terrible problem
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:18.880]   and fight and battle, once believed that if only they could get out of the world and live
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:23.960]   in a cell that all would be well and they'd never have evil thoughts again, you read what
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.720]   they tell you and they'll tell you that they have as many evil thoughts in the cell as
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:36.880]   they had in the world. It's a principle within and it operates, I say, in spite of, apart
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:42.600]   from temptation and is not merely the response to temptation. Of course, it does respond
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:48.040]   to temptation. Temptation may draw it out still more, but if there were no temptation,
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:52.960]   if a man were segregated and isolated and in a kind of perpetual glasshouse, he'd have
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:34:00.160]   an awful struggle with sin and evil. Why? Well, it's in his heart. It is out of the
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:06.160]   heart that come evil thoughts, murders, etc. These people fell a lusting. Why? Well, because
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:15.520]   it was in them. Oh yes, but I want to go on to my second point which is this. According
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:22.040]   to this teaching, sin is not only a principle within, it is a principle that grips us. It
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:32.640]   is a principle that controls us. It is a principle that masters us and makes slaves of us. Now
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:41.820]   this is tremendously important. The whole modern fallacy appears at this point. The
[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:48.120]   moderns have said that what we call sin is merely something negative. They say what you
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:53.520]   call sin is just a negative failure to do good. What you call sin is just the absence
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:58.160]   of certain qualities. You mustn't say that anybody's bad. What you really mean is that
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.800]   he's not good. You mustn't say that that child is bad. No, no, it's just not a good
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:09.160]   child. And so with mankind in general, a mere negative condition, not positive evil. And
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:13.480]   they said therefore you mustn't be so harsh. You mustn't be so denunciatory. And you must
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:17.720]   just praise people and draw the best that's out of them. Draw it out of them. That's the
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:22.880]   great phrase. And you see why I'm opposing it is this. What you draw out, you draw out
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:29.440]   evil. You draw out lust and passion. And we're seeing it manifested in the life of men today.
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:39.560]   No, no, sin is not merely a negative phase. Sin is a terrible power. It's an awful tyranny.
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:44.360]   Had you realized how powerful it is, well let me remind you of its power. This is the
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:56.320]   power of sin in every one of us. It is something that suddenly grips us without any volition
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:02.960]   on our part at any moment, quite suddenly and unexpectedly. I don't stay with that.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:07.960]   I've already mentioned it rarely in my previous point, but I've got to put it in here again
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:13.280]   because it shows the power of the thing. Look at these people traveling along from Egypt
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:18.680]   to Canaan, going to the promise. Suddenly, they begin to lust. Why? Well, they've been
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:24.400]   taken hold of by this power that is within them. That's the measure of its power. But
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:35.400]   come, let me put it like this. Sin is as powerful as this. It's much more powerful than our
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:43.880]   reason. It's much more powerful than all our knowledge and all the teaching that we have
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:52.160]   ever received. Isn't this true? Isn't it the simple fact to say that men of great learning,
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:59.440]   great knowledge, great understanding, fall to sin like everybody else? Men who've even
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:06.840]   been moral teachers have been moral failures. Men with great understanding and knowledge,
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:12.960]   men who are famous for their reason and for their balance, have been helpless dipsomaniacs,
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:23.560]   have been helpless sex maniacs. No, this isn't imagination. I'm just giving you history.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:30.840]   There have been men, there have been great statesmen, even in this present century, famous
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:40.160]   for their balance, for their wisdom, for their logic and their reason. None of your rabble
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:45.640]   rousers, none of your demagogues, not the sort of men who plays superficially on people's
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:52.840]   feelings, a great mind, great statesman. Yes, and such men have been helpless victims, I
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:38:05.720]   say, of drink, and of other forms of lust, and of craving, and of desire. A man can be
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:15.760]   profoundly concerned about the sanctity of international contracts, and yet fail to honor
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:21.520]   his own marriage contract. It isn't that the men lack reason. No, no, it's that this other
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:27.040]   thing is more powerful than his reason. Let Paul say it once again for us, "I delight
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:32.200]   in the law of God after the inward men. To will is present with me. I want to do it.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:39.720]   I recognize it. I see that that's right, but I can't do it. Why, this other thing is stronger,
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:48.840]   the law in my members dragging me down. Oh, wretched men that I am." Yes, but it's not
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:57.160]   only more powerful than reason and knowledge, it is also more powerful than a man's will.
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:03.360]   Some men have got very powerful wills. They can impose their wills on others, and if they
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:08.360]   are determined to have a thing, they have it, and everybody has to give in. Strong will,
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:16.040]   yes, but look at that man with his powerful will, an absolute victim to sin in some shape
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:22.880]   or form. It's stronger than the will, the strongest will. To will is present with me,
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:29.960]   but how to perform, I find not. I know not. I try to exercise my will, says Paul. I've
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:35.000]   done my best. I really am putting my back into it, and haven't we all done this? We've
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.680]   really wanted to live a better life. We've taken our New Year's resolutions. We've taken
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:46.720]   a pledge. We've promised some loved ones. Oh, we want to do it, and yet we can't. Why?
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:53.360]   Well, because lust and sin are stronger than the will, but let me go on. They are stronger
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:40:03.680]   also than the memory. Look at these children of Israel. They'd just come out of the bondage
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:09.320]   and the captivity of Egypt, where they were being beaten by the taskmasters, and their
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:14.760]   poor backs lashed because they were not producing enough bricks, and they were not even supplying
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:22.880]   them with straw to make the bricks. The awful bondage and the cruelty, and yet here they
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:27.480]   are, you see, within a few weeks, forgetting all about it, and lusting, and wanting to
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:32.680]   go back, as it were, and say, "Oh, the fish, and the garlic, and the leeks, and the onions,
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:36.960]   and the melons, what's happened to them?" Well, there's something within them that is
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:45.000]   stronger than memory. Memory is very powerful. Memory can be very strong, and memory is often
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   a great aid in life, but you know this thing I'm talking about, sin, and lust, and desire,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.080]   and passion, they're more powerful than memory, and they can silence it, and they can explain
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:04.580]   it away, and they can blunt its edge, and we say to ourselves, "Oh, well, it wasn't
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:09.000]   quite as bad as that after all, was it?" We thought at the time it was, of course, and
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.960]   you see, what's happening is that this subtle, terrible power called sin, and lust, and desire
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:21.960]   is just taking the edge off memory. Memory stands a very poor chance up against the power
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:33.320]   of lust, and of craving. But finally, I would put it like this. Lust, and craving, and desire
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:46.040]   are even more powerful than the fear of consequences. I suppose that the greatest deterrent in life
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:55.520]   is the fear of consequences. What wouldn't everybody who's listening to me at this moment
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:03.480]   have done sometimes, were it not for the fear of consequences? Your reason had been silenced,
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:11.480]   your will had gone down, and you were on the verge, but you said, "Ah, if I do, what if
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:21.600]   I'm found out? What may happen to me if I do?" Fear of consequences, a tremendous power,
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:29.520]   a great deterrent. But you know, when lust, and passion, and craving, and desire really
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:39.120]   get going, though a man knows, he'll still do it. The poor drunkard knows perfectly well
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:46.840]   what he's going to feel like afterwards, but still he does it. He knows the consequences.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:54.280]   But the desire, the power of the craving, the lust, is greater than the fear of consequences,
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:43:01.200]   and he reaches a point when, come what may, he must.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:09.560]   Now my dear friends, I've been going through this terrible analysis for one reason only,
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:17.400]   because it is this and this alone that explains why man is as he is this evening. It is this
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:23.360]   that explains why the world is as it is this evening. It is this that is in the individual.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:30.240]   It's in groups, in nations, this urge, this drive, this passion, this craving, and suddenly
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:37.120]   it comes, and grips, and decency, and morality, and argument, and reason, and logic, and agreements,
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:47.360]   and fears of consequences, and everything is brushed aside, and on we go. What a terrible
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:58.640]   power it is, and how puerile are the medicaments that men are offering in an attempt to stem
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:06.600]   such a power. They're just as little children who are putting up their wooden barriers to
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:13.360]   try and stop an avalanche. They're like men putting up their little walls when there's
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:24.280]   a cloudburst, and a flood comes hurtling down the mountain. Can education solve this problem?
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:31.280]   Well, it's about time it did. Is there no sin, and vice, and evil in the universities
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:41.120]   and amongst graduates? It's in the whole of mankind. It's in every one of us since Adam
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:51.440]   and Eve fell in the Garden of Eden. And it all leads, you see, to perpetual restlessness
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:56.320]   and dissatisfaction. That was the trouble with these people. Though they've been brought
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:01.520]   out by the hand of God and are marching to liberty and to the promised land, suddenly
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:07.880]   they feel this desire. Why? Well, they're restless. Craving is the result of restlessness
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:17.800]   and dissatisfaction. And the world is as it is tonight because it's got a vacant heart.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:24.520]   That's why people must be always lusting after some new pleasure or enjoyment, some new thrill.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:29.840]   One thing going worse than the next. Why? Well, it's the vacant heart, I say. They're
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:35.360]   not satisfied. They're looking for something that they haven't got. What is it? Well, there's
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:45.400]   only one answer. Man, his life is empty. Why? Well, because God isn't in his life. He was
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:54.800]   made for God. And nothing and nobody else can satisfy him. And I trust that no one will
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:46:00.360]   imagine that I've been denouncing men tonight. I haven't. I've been describing him in his
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:06.000]   tragedy. He lusts after this and that. Why? Well, he can't find satisfaction. He's looking
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.880]   for it. He's seeking for it. And there's a void. There's this gulf. And he longs for
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:20.080]   one thing. He doesn't know what. But what he's really longing for is God. Oh, let me
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:31.040]   say it again. Augustine knew all about it. Brilliant philosopher as he was. And yet unable
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:37.280]   to control his passion and his lust. Able to talk and argue about goodness, beauty,
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:45.040]   and truth. But living with his mistress. He didn't know his real need, but at last he
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:57.000]   saw it. Thou hast made us for thyself. And our hearts are restless until they find their
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:06.040]   rest in thee. The wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest. Whose waters throw
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:12.800]   up mire and dirt. And that's your modern world. It's like the restless sea. And the mud and
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:17.640]   the dirt are very evident today. They've been produced in the statistics in the conferences
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:23.840]   recently. There it is. And they say let's upset. Let's set up a new commission of investigation.
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:33.000]   My dear friend, don't waste a moment of your time nor a shilling of your money. There is
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:47.240]   only one hope for men. And that is a new nature. Something more powerful than this foul and
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:57.600]   evil principle of sin. A new principle of life. The life of God in the soul. What does
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:08.640]   man need? He needs a final satisfaction. And where can he find it except in the Son of
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:21.920]   God, our blessed Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. He satisfies the mind. He satisfies the heart.
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:36.720]   He satisfies the whole man. He is enough. Whatever the need, he has the supply. Oh,
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:48.160]   the tragedy of men in this modern world. Oh, the superficiality of the diagnosis. Here
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:59.200]   is the trouble. Here, my dear friend, is your trouble. Are you unhappy and wretched? Are
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:06.200]   you struggling and failing and battling? Are you miserable and unhappy? Are you disappointed?
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:12.640]   Are you seeking after something? Are you clutching after this and that? Never to be satisfied.
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:24.080]   Always to go back in despair and in loss. Blaming others perhaps. Blaming friends. Blaming
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:35.720]   loved ones. Blaming circumstances. Blaming life. No, no. The trouble is in you yourself
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:44.800]   because it is in all of us. Sin and evil. Lust and craving. And there is only one answer
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:51.000]   and one solution. And I have told you what it is. How can I have it, says someone? Oh,
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:50:02.040]   it is so simple. Recognize the evil that is within you. Recognize that you will never
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:11.160]   master it and never deal with it. Go to God with the acknowledgment and with the confession.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:17.880]   And believe him when he tells you that it was because of that he sent his only son into
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:24.120]   the world and the son came. Why? Well, because man was lost. Because he was helpless. Because
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:28.560]   he was hopeless. They that are whole have no need of a physician but they that are sick.
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:37.720]   He came because of this terrible disease, this awful sickness called sin. Believe that
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:47.560]   and just cast yourself upon his love and mercy and compassion. Ask him to take charge of
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:57.560]   your case. Ask him to heal you. And he has promised to do so. He has said, "Him that
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:06.840]   cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out, just as you are therefore. Without one plea,
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:17.920]   go to him. Sight, riches, healing of the mind, yea, all I need in thee to find, O Lamb of
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:29.360]   God, I come." It's the only way to be delivered from this lusting, this craving. But if the
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:41.160]   Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed. Amen.
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:45.240]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones. All of
