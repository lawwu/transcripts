[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   The constitution of a polity is a very complicated thing, much of which is inexplicit.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.280]   The American founding fathers realized they had a tremendous problem.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.800]   In fact, they thought they were the defenders of the British constitution
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.320]   and that the British king had violated it.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.080]   They wanted to be democratic.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.280]   So the whole thing that they instituted was immensely sophisticated.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.080]   It's an amazing intellectual achievement.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.280]   But the inherent flaws are there.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.280]   And one of them is the fact that there are checks and balances
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.160]   means that responsibility is dissipated
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.320]   and nobody is ever to blame for anything in the American system.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.760]   In the British system, blame is absolutely focused.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:54.240]   Everything is sacrificed to the end of focusing blame and responsibility
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.560]   down to the government.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.640]   And there are no systems that do that better.
