[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:12.000]   the portion of scripture that we read at the beginning in the second epistle to Timothy,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.400]   in the second chapter, in the eighth verse.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.960]   The eighth verse in the second chapter of Paul's second epistle to Timothy.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:30.400]   Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.520]   my gospel.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.040]   Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.040]   my gospel.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.200]   Now those who meet here regularly will remember and will realize that we've been spending
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.600]   a number of Sunday evenings in considering these different descriptions which are given
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.920]   us here in the New Testament itself of the gospel.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.360]   And we've been doing that because of the tragic confusion that is so obvious and evident in
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.560]   this modern world of ours with regard to this vital question as to what the gospel really
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.000]   is.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.920]   We start from this assumption that there is no hope in the world tonight apart from this
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.360]   gospel.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.280]   If you can see another, I'd like to hear of it.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.160]   There is no other hope.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.920]   Civilization has been trying throughout the running centuries to deal with its own problems
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.000]   but has failed and is failing as lamentably and as tragically tonight as it has ever done
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   in the past.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.760]   There is but one hope and that is this gospel, the gospel which has never been tried.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.000]   Never been tried I mean by all in the world.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.240]   And so there is nothing more important than that men and women should know what this gospel
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.840]   is.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.160]   And that is why we've been looking at these various descriptions which are given of it
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.880]   in the New Testament itself.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.480]   Now it's been very interesting, I'm sure those who've been here right through this series
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.480]   will agree with me when I say it's been very interesting to notice how each one of them
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.600]   has something unique to say.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.560]   Each brings out some special facet or aspect of the truth.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.800]   The gospel is such a big thing, it's such a great thing, it's such a glorious thing,
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.480]   such a many-sided thing that you can't have one word which in and of itself is adequate
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.200]   and sufficient to describe it so you have to have a whole series of them.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.960]   And each one I say gives that special contribution and gives us some special insight and understanding.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.480]   And yet we must have noticed at the same time that they're all related to one another.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.200]   You can't take any one of them in isolation because there is this interrelationship that's
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.320]   of necessity true about anything that is whole.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.840]   The parts are all related.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.440]   They're not just a conglomeration of unrelated portions.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.880]   That is what really makes the perfection and the beauty of true wholeness, that every single
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.920]   part is related to every other part, and if any part is missing, well then you have detracted
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.360]   from this perfection and from this glory.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.680]   And we've been seeing that.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.480]   Or let me put it like this, that each one of these aspects in a sense implies the other,
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.040]   feeds on to it, asks for it, suggests it, and therefore we are not surprised when we
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.040]   come to it.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.880]   Now I'm saying all this because I'm trying to say just this, that everything we've said
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.960]   so far seems to me itinerant to lead to what we're going to consider together tonight.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.200]   And that is the description given of it in this eighth verse of this second chapter of
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:03.680]   Paul's second epistle to Timothy, where he refers to it as "my gospel".
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.520]   And here we are told something which is of very great importance for us, and it seems
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.720]   to me that we can do nothing more appropriate on this Sunday night before Christmas than
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:22.800]   consider this particular description of the gospel, because this season in and of itself
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:30.600]   is, as I'm going to try to show you, the best exposition that we can ever find of this
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:37.800]   interesting statement of the apostle when he refers to the gospel as "my gospel".
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.400]   Now what has he got to say?
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.000]   Well, I think as we analyze it you will agree with me that this is something that is of
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.800]   extreme importance at this present time.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:56.240]   You see, the apostle was confronted by a situation while not, of course, exactly like ours, had
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.940]   got already within it in an incipient form many of the things that trouble us at this
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.960]   present time.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.600]   I keep on saying this in order that I may itinerate establish this point in your minds.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.280]   There's nothing new about heresy.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.520]   There's nothing new about some aberration from the truth.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.400]   The apostle Paul was plagued with people like that, these false teachers.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:30.160]   He mentioned some of them, Hymenaeus and Philetus, Phygelus and Hermogenes, that sort of person.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.680]   There they were, even in the earliest days of the Christian church, sowing the seeds
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.240]   of error, teaching something that was not true.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.560]   It's been going on, you see, from the very beginning.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:49.880]   So let me say once more, there is nothing new about these modern aberrations from the
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.560]   gospel, these modern substitutes for the gospel.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.560]   There's nothing new about them at all.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.200]   They're all very old indeed.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.560]   But the devil in his subtlety persuades people that they're new and up to date in two ways.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.040]   One is that he keeps them in such a state of ignorance that they're unaware of church
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.880]   history, and the second way he does it, of course, is to put, if you like, new clothing
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.920]   on them, new terminology is used.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.880]   And because the terminology is new, people think they've got something brand new.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.800]   It's the old commodity with a new name on it.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.800]   Nothing else.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.440]   Still the same old errors that have been troubling the life of the church from the very beginning.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.680]   Well now then, let's listen to how the apostle handles this particular matter.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.240]   You've got to see that this statement we're looking at must be taken in its context.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:48.760]   The apostle has got his eye on these others as he puts it like this, "My gospel."
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.920]   You see, there were other gospels being offered, but the apostle says, "My gospel."
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.720]   You notice how he kept on saying this same thing, "Hold fast," he said, "the form
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.680]   of sound words which thou hast heard of me in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus."
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:11.240]   That good thing which was committed unto thee, keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.920]   This thou knowest that all they which are in thee shall be turned away from me.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.000]   Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus, and the things that
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:29.040]   thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men who shall
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.500]   be able to teach others also."
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.500]   And so on.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:41.320]   Now, here you see was the great fight of the faith, and this fight is still going on.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:47.280]   And there is nothing, I say again, that is more vital than that we should all be clear
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:53.400]   as to this gospel, "My gospel," the gospel of the apostle Paul.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.400]   Very well, what does it tell us?
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.320]   Well, I suggest to you that it tells us some things like this.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:08.360]   The apostle is here claiming that this is the only gospel, the only gospel.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.880]   Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.880]   my gospel.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.880]   Why does he put it like that?
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.840]   Well now, let's be clear as to what he doesn't mean.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:26.360]   I remember many years ago reading a sermon by a man on this very text, and this is how
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.800]   he handled it and interpreted it.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:35.520]   He said the vital question is, "Can you say, 'My gospel'?"
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:41.800]   His point was that unless it was something experimental, unless it meant something to
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.880]   you, that it was of no value.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.440]   He said if it's merely some theory or some philosophy that you're considering, and,
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.160]   well, you've read about it, but there it is, you're very detached from it, he says
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.520]   it's of no value.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.520]   He says the vital question is this, "Have you had such an experience that you can say,
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.960]   'My gospel'?"
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:09.400]   Of course he went on to say it may not be the other man's gospel.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.240]   He says the point is it's your gospel.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.320]   He says another man may disagree with you, but that doesn't matter.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.640]   Has he got something also that has made all the difference to him, which he calls his
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.640]   gospel?
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:29.320]   So you see, the whole point of the sermon was just to put this emphasis upon experience.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:35.080]   He was speaking in connection with a certain movement that was very popular at that time
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.920]   and is still in existence.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.800]   And the whole emphasis of that movement was that it didn't matter what you believed,
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.920]   as long as you could say, "Whereas I was once blind, now I see."
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:53.000]   As long as you could say that your life was changed, that you'd had some great climactic
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.460]   experience, it didn't matter what you believed.
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.520]   One man might say this and another man might say that.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.000]   One man might believe in the deity of Jesus Christ, another might say he was only a man.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.480]   One man might say that you must believe in his atoning death, the other said it doesn't
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.680]   matter as long as you see him displaying love.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.880]   Believe what you like, as long as you've had an experience.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.960]   That was the brunt of his argument and of his sermon.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.200]   We're saying, you see, that the Apostle Paul was virtually telling us here that the
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.840]   one thing that matters is that you should have this experience, this great change in
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.400]   your life, and as long as you've got that, all is well.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.960]   My gospel may not be the other man's, but don't quarrel with him, it's all right.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.560]   Believe what you like, as long as you've got an experience.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:45.320]   What is truly amazing is that anybody could ever say a thing like that in the light of
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:53.040]   this context, because, you see, the Apostle's whole argument is to say the exact opposite.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.760]   That's why he's concerned about these people like Phygellus and Hermogenes and Hymenaeus
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.840]   and Phyletus, because they were teaching something wrong.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:07.480]   He says you've got to hold on to this form of sound words that you've heard from me,
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.680]   this thing that has been committed to you.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.800]   It isn't, he says, what you may believe.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.320]   It's you've got to go on and give to other men who can pass it on to others this deposit
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.760]   of truth.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.840]   It's the whole argument of the Apostle.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.480]   And yet, you see, because of the two words "my gospel," the man takes it right out of
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:29.040]   its context and he preaches that nothing matters except that a man has an experience.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.360]   And it doesn't matter whether you've got it from one truth or another, as long as you've
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.520]   got an experience.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.800]   The Apostle certainly didn't mean that.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.960]   And the very verse we're considering, as I'm going to show you in and of itself, is proof
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.960]   positive that he meant nothing of the sort.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.480]   And then another misunderstanding of it is this.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.520]   It's very different from the first one.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.760]   Indeed, it's the exact opposite of it.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.480]   It's the case of those who say, "Ah, yes, that's typical, of course, of your Apostle
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.160]   Paul.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:04.320]   It's just the sort of thing he would say in his conceit and arrogance and intolerance."
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:10.680]   They say, "This has been the trouble, that this Pharisee came along, this clever man,
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:18.400]   this Saul of Tarsus, and feisted his own opinions upon the gospel and twisted it out of recognition,
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:24.120]   turned the simple gospel of Christ into a complicated theological, rabbinical system.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:29.120]   And now he's so intolerant and arrogant, he says, 'If you don't believe everything I say,
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.120]   you're wrong.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.840]   He alone is right and everybody else is wrong.'"
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.200]   You're familiar with that, I'm sure.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.800]   You've often heard that.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:43.880]   And so when the Apostle tells this young disciple of his, Timothy, "Remember that Jesus Christ
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:48.120]   of the seed of David was raised from the dead, a point of my gospel," he's just giving a
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.000]   display of this utter intolerance.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.600]   "Well, I needn't worry you."
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:58.160]   The answer to all that is found so abundantly in the New Testament itself.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.480]   The Apostle goes out of his way to tell us in the 15th chapter of the first epistle to
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.880]   the Corinthians that the gospel which he preached was the gospel that was preached by all the
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.420]   other apostles.
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:13.440]   He says exactly the same thing in the epistle to the Galatians in the second chapter.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.880]   He went up to Jerusalem specially to settle this matter and to get it clear.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.880]   There are repeated statements about this everywhere.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:29.600]   The gospel of the Apostle Paul was the same gospel as was preached by all the other apostles.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.600]   Very well.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.140]   He's not saying either of those two things.
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.140]   What is he saying?
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:38.680]   Well, I say what he's saying is that this is the only gospel.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:43.320]   And that is why he is urging upon Timothy to be quite clear and sure of it and to hold
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.080]   on to it at all costs.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.760]   Now the Apostle, as I'm reminding you, repeats this so often.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:54.480]   Take for instance a still more striking statement of this at the beginning of the epistle to
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.480]   the Galatians.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.360]   He turns to these Galatians who had become Christians under his own ministry, but then
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:04.320]   these other false teachers had come along and he says, "I marvel that you are so soon
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:09.880]   removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel which
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:15.880]   is not another, but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.760]   But though we are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.360]   we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:29.440]   As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:34.720]   that you have received, let him be accursed."
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.920]   This is the only gospel.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.040]   There is no other.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:44.480]   Now in putting it like that, the Apostle of course is just repeating what was so constantly
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:50.320]   on the lips of our blessed Lord and Savior himself.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:55.320]   He claimed that he was the Savior of the world.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.600]   He claims an utter, absolute uniqueness.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.680]   That was the thing that infuriated the Pharisees and scribes and led them in the end to encompass
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.680]   his death.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:11.040]   He didn't say that he was better, he just said that he was different.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.480]   He contrasted himself with all others.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:20.480]   He have heard that it was said by them of all time, "I say unto you, I am the light
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.480]   of the world."
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.040]   Now there's the most exclusive claim that could conceivably be made.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.160]   He says that there is no light in the world apart from him.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:35.000]   He says he is the bread of life, the very bread of life.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.040]   He says, "No man cometh unto the Father but by me."
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.880]   He says, "I am the door, I am the good shepherd."
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.160]   These are absolutely exclusive claims.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:55.720]   He stands before the world and he says, "Listen to me, come unto me, follow me."
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:02.720]   He claims that he and he alone is the Savior and that his and his alone is the gospel of
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.080]   salvation, the gospel of God.
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:13.880]   And therefore you see the Apostle Paul, not saying anything new, not saying anything fresh,
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:20.480]   the Apostle Peter had indeed said it all before the Apostle Paul and even before Saul of Tarsus
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.200]   ever became the Apostle Paul.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.880]   The Apostle Peter very early in the history of the early church uttered this tremendous
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:35.160]   statement, "Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other name under
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:40.200]   heaven given amongst men whereby we must be saved."
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.520]   It's the only gospel.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:48.360]   And when Paul says, "My gospel," he is referring to this only gospel, not because it is his.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.360]   Why then?
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:54.760]   Well, because he and all the other apostles are in exactly the same position.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.520]   They were taught it by the Lord himself.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:03.800]   The others had been with our Lord during his earthly ministry.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:08.920]   He had instructed them, they'd seen his miracles, they'd heard his words, they'd seen him dying,
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.560]   they'd seen him after the resurrection.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.240]   He had expounded the scriptures to them.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.680]   They have a message which is given to them.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.680]   It isn't theirs.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.960]   They all preach the same message because they've received it from the same source.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.200]   And it's the same with this man.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:28.920]   Here he was, a Pharisee, hating it all, blaspheming it all, doing his utmost to put an end to
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.920]   the early church.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:37.520]   And then, you remember the great story on the road to Damascus, how he met this blessed
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:44.720]   risen Lord and Savior, and there he was commissioned to go to be a witness, and a teacher to the
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.440]   people, and a light to the Gentiles.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.320]   He's commissioned, he's given his message, and he keeps on saying this.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.800]   A dispensation of the gospel, he says, is committed unto me.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.480]   That's why he says, "Well, unto me, if I preach, not the gospel.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.440]   I've been given this job, this task.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.520]   It's been given unto my charge.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.240]   I've received it," he says to the Ephesians, "by special revelation."
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.560]   That's why he can say, "My gospel."
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.320]   He's not asserting his own personality.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.040]   He's not just being intolerant.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.800]   He is simply saying, "Look here, this isn't a matter of opinion.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.680]   The Lord himself has given it to me as to my fellow apostles.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.800]   This is the only gospel.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.800]   Listen to it."
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:31.880]   Now then, that's the first thing that he means by saying, "My gospel."
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:38.920]   That in turn leads me to put a second point to you, namely to ask the question, "Well
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.640]   then, what is this gospel?"
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:46.960]   If it's the only one, the most important thing for us all to know is, "What is it?"
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.200]   And the apostle answers the question.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.720]   And you notice how he draws our attention to it and emphasizes it.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.240]   "Remember," he says, "Remember."
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:02.880]   Now this is the key word in many ways, and it leads us to say this, you see.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:08.800]   There's no difficulty about knowing what the gospel is, no difficulty at all.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.680]   The gospel is quite plain.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.000]   The apostle wouldn't be able to say, "Remember."
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.840]   He wouldn't be able to say, "My gospel," unless the gospel is something that is plain
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.780]   and clear.
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.560]   You can't contrast something with something else unless you know what this is and what
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.600]   that is.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.600]   You can only judge if you've got a standard.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.240]   And there is a standard.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.640]   The standard is, "My gospel."
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.040]   How can you tell that other teachings are wrong unless you know what the true teaching
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.040]   is?
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.480]   Well, the apostle says, "You know what the true teaching is.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.880]   It's the thing you've heard from me.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.440]   It's the thing that's been committed to you.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.720]   It can be defined.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.720]   It's absolutely clear."
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:53.180]   But that, you see, is the very thing that is not only forgotten today but is so tragically
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.180]   being denied.
[00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:00.500]   The impression given today is this, that, "Oh, as long as you've got the Christmas
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.500]   spirit in you, you're a Christian.
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.500]   It doesn't matter what you believe."
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.500]   And indeed, they say, "You can't.
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:04.500]   You can't describe it.
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.500]   You can't define it.
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.060]   It's something very wonderful.
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:13.660]   To be a Christian means you've got some marvelous spirit of benevolence in you, and you just
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.340]   put that into practice.
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.340]   Believe what you like doesn't matter."
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.720]   And they say, "It's no use a man saying, 'Now, this is Christianity.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.720]   That isn't Christianity.'
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.980]   It's no use a man arrogantly getting up and saying, 'I don't think that man's a Christian.'"
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:25.980]   Why?
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.300]   Well, they say, "Look at the good work he's doing.
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.300]   Look at the good life he's living.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.860]   Look at the sacrifice he's made."
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.260]   They say, "That's enough."
[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.580]   They say, "You mustn't criticize."
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:37.300]   But you see, that's a denial of everything that Paul says here and the whole of the Bible
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.860]   says.
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.260]   Remember?
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.260]   My gospel?
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:46.660]   There's no difficulty about defining Christianity.
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.040]   It's men who are creating the difficulties.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:53.260]   The thing itself, says the apostle, is perfectly clear.
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.500]   And I must go further.
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:00.900]   Not only was it clear in the first century, it's equally clear now because it's the same
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:01.900]   gospel.
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:08.740]   Again, let us get rid of this most ridiculous and fatuous of all ideas that the fact that
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.300]   we are in the twentieth century somehow makes everything different.
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:19.220]   My dear friends, the gospel that we are considering is about God acting, and he's the eternal
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.220]   God.
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.100]   There's no change.
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:27.220]   The only gospel we have tonight is the gospel that's come down to us from these apostles.
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:32.620]   The church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, and any men's modern
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:36.420]   ideas and theories I'm not interested in, and he shouldn't be interested in.
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.420]   Why?
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.420]   Well, he doesn't know.
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:43.620]   He's given once and forever the truth, once and forever delivered to the saints.
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:44.620]   Well, what is it then?
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:50.380]   Well, here in a most extraordinary manner, we have a wonderful summary of some of its
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.380]   main elements.
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.260]   What is this gospel?
[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.660]   This gospel of Paul?
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:04.300]   The answer is, it is the story concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and the meaning of the story.
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.140]   What am I to remember?
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:10.180]   I am to remember Jesus.
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:14.460]   Remember that Jesus.
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:15.460]   What else?
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:20.140]   Well, Jesus is of the seed of David.
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.740]   That defines it still more for me.
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:27.180]   That reminds me of a little place called Bethlehem.
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.180]   Jesus.
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:32.820]   Ah, we are looking at a man, at an historical person.
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:36.700]   It is not a philosophy or teaching, it's something that tells us about a person who's
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.220]   appeared in history, Jesus.
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:43.660]   And Jesus is of the seed of David.
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:51.300]   And that, I say, links me at once with some of these great, vital, historical facts concerning
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:55.380]   this most amazing person that the world has ever seen.
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.700]   Jesus of the seed of David.
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:03.540]   And it is because Jesus was of the seed of David that he was born in a little place called
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.540]   Bethlehem.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:05.540]   Do you remember Luke 2?
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:10.180]   It came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that the
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.220]   whole world should be taxed.
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.620]   And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:20.620]   And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea, and to the
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:25.820]   city of David, which is called Bethlehem, then in brackets, because he was of the house
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.060]   and lineage of David.
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:34.620]   So at once the apostle is telling us that he's talking about this Jesus that was born
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:39.580]   in that little place called Bethlehem, in the stable, and his little body was put into
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.300]   the manger.
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.980]   Seed of David.
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.780]   This is his lineage, you can trace it.
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:50.740]   He's, in other words, telling us that the gospel all centers on this person.
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:56.860]   The babe that was born, born of a virgin, or as he puts it in writing to the Galatians,
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.500]   born of a woman.
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:04.500]   They try to say sometimes that the apostle Paul didn't believe in the virgin birth.
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.420]   They say that because they say he doesn't mention it.
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.340]   He does mention it in my opinion.
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:12.880]   Born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem them that were under the law.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.540]   This was taken for granted by him in his epistles.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:19.580]   You wouldn't expect a great emphasis on the virgin birth in the epistles.
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.900]   That comes in the gospels.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.300]   That's the thing that had been preached.
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.900]   This was the thing that was believed.
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.860]   The deity and the virgin birth.
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:32.140]   But he was truly men, the apostle is emphasizing that.
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:36.640]   And it needed to be emphasized then as it does now.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.220]   It wasn't that there was a great appearance of the Godhead, a kind of theophany.
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.220]   No, no.
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:45.300]   Neither was it the case that the Son of God took on him a kind of phantom body.
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.260]   No, he was truly men.
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:51.460]   The word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us.
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:57.180]   This babe was a real babe with a real body.
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.480]   And he was born in the stable and put in the manger.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.500]   This is what the gospel is about, says Paul.
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:08.860]   And not only that, the whole story of this Jesus, all that you read in your gospels,
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:12.480]   all that he did and all that he said.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:17.780]   But then you notice he goes on to say, "Remember that Jesus Christ."
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:21.240]   Now here's the significant turn.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:25.640]   The gospel message was and is that this Jesus is the Christ.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.960]   In other words, he is the Messiah.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.200]   He is the deliverer.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.560]   And how does he deliver?
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.320]   Well, he says he was raised from the dead.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.680]   He tells us thereby that he died.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:45.040]   Not only can you define the gospel, not only can you say the gospel can be stated in propositions,
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:49.040]   you can very often put it in one verse and we've very nearly got it all here, haven't
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.040]   we?
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.040]   He died.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.720]   Yes, and he's the Christ because he died.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.680]   He's the Messiah, the deliverer, because he died.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.800]   This was gospel preaching.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.520]   First Adam prayed to John the Baptist.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.320]   "There he is," he said.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.640]   "Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world."
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.640]   There he is.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.640]   Listen to him.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:17.720]   "This is the one, but he dies and his body is taken down from the cross on which he died
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.120]   and it's buried in a grave."
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.240]   But if that were the end of the story, there'd be no gospel.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.520]   The apostle wouldn't be able to say, "My gospel."
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.760]   No, no, he rose.
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:33.800]   Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.800]   my gospel.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.520]   It was the risen Lord that he'd seen.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:43.040]   It was the risen Lord the others had seen and had received their commission from him.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:46.080]   Now, this is the essence of the gospel.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.720]   You see, the gospel is not just an appeal to people, "Now look here, Christmas time
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.720]   is coming.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.360]   Can't we all pull together?
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.000]   Can't capital and labor really forget their troubles and their problems?
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.760]   Let's put a little of this Christmas spirit into it all and let the nations of the world
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.000]   come.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.200]   It's being done every year and we're sick and tired of it, aren't we?
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.440]   It comes to nothing.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.160]   It's only when you're not quite sober that you can really believe there's any value
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.760]   in that sort of thing.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.760]   It's not true.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.760]   It doesn't work.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.760]   It's just playing.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:13.760]   It's being childish.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.040]   No, no, but it isn't the gospel.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:20.880]   The gospel, my friends, is to tell you of what's happened, what's taken place.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:29.480]   This Jesus, son of the seed of David, deathly him, died, buried, risen.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:35.200]   Now then, there are the great facts concerning him.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:40.880]   And it is because of those facts that the pronouncement is this, that in him and in
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.600]   him alone is salvation to be found.
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:50.320]   Listen to our Lord himself saying it, "After the resurrection, then opened he their understanding
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:54.520]   that they might understand the scriptures and said unto them, 'Thus it is written and
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:28:00.560]   thus it behoved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:07.160]   and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.880]   And ye are witnesses of these things.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:15.880]   And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you, but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:19.420]   until ye be endued with power from on high.'"
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.200]   This is the gospel.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:26.680]   This person, these facts, and this is the meaning of the facts.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:34.760]   Repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.760]   at Jerusalem.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:41.680]   And, of course, this is the precise thing that these apostles proceeded to do.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.200]   There are many examples of this.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:49.040]   Peter preached this very thing, you remember, on the day of Pentecost after Jerusalem.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:54.560]   The apostle Paul, in his great sermon at Antioch in Pisidia, as it is recorded in the thirteenth
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:59.400]   chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, does exactly the same thing.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:05.720]   He gives the facts concerning this Jesus and he takes them through the facts and ends with
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:10.520]   "but he whom God raised from the dead saw no corruption."
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:15.600]   He had already said, "but God raised him from the dead and he was seen many days" and so
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.600]   on.
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:20.120]   Then he goes on to say, "be it known unto you therefore," here's the application.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:25.800]   He gives them the facts, he preached the facts concerning Jesus, Jesus Christ of the seed
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:29.960]   of David, born in Bethlehem, dead, buried, risen.
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:30.960]   Here's the application.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:36.600]   "Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.240]   the forgiveness of sins.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:44.740]   And by him all that believe are justified from all things from which he could not be
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:48.280]   justified by the law of Moses.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:52.240]   Beware therefore lest that come upon you which is spoken of in the prophets.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.720]   Behold ye despisers and wander and perish.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:00.920]   For I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though men declare
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:01.920]   it unto you."
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:02.920]   There it is.
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.840]   This is precisely what the preaching of the gospel means.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:12.040]   There is our gospel, there is my gospel, says Paul, and there by the grace of God I can
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.560]   say this is my gospel.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.360]   It's the only gospel.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.460]   There is none other.
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:23.520]   It is concerning this person and the meaning of all that he came into this world to do.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.160]   Very well.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:28.520]   That's the proposition.
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:33.480]   But now let me ask my third and last question.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.360]   Why is this the only gospel?
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.360]   Somebody is probably anxious to ask that question.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:44.240]   You stand there, says this person, and say this is the only gospel.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.080]   Why do you say it's the only gospel?
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.300]   What right have you to say that?
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:49.580]   What about these other insights?
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:51.040]   What about these other world religions?
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:55.060]   Can't we be helped by Hinduism and Mohammedanism and Confucianism?
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.100]   Don't we need a great congress of the world faiths?
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:00.500]   Don't we need all these religions with their insights?
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.460]   Are you not being arrogant and intolerant again?
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.260]   Why do you say this is the only gospel?
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.540]   Why do you insist upon people believing these things?
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:12.420]   Why do you say that there is no salvation in any other?
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.140]   Now let me answer that question.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:17.900]   My first answer is this.
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:22.900]   And how appropriate it is on this Sunday night before we celebrate the birth of the Son of
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.460]   God, that's Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:28.620]   My first answer is this.
[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:34.220]   If there could have been any other gospel, well then the things I've been reminding you
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:38.260]   of would never have happened at all.
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:44.020]   If there had been any other way whereby mankind could be saved, do you imagine that the eternal
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:47.660]   Son of God would ever have come down from heaven to earth?
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:51.980]   Would the eternal Father ever have allowed him to come and to endure the contradiction
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:53.700]   of sinners against himself?
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:57.420]   The thing is impossible, it's inconceivable.
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:04.820]   I ask if there were any other way whereby mankind could be redeemed, these marvelous,
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:09.060]   amazing, astounding things would never have happened.
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.940]   But they have happened.
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:13.660]   The Word was made flesh.
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:19.340]   The Son of God did take unto him human nature and was born as a babe and he was despised
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:21.180]   and rejected of men.
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:23.480]   But come to the very height of it all.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:27.620]   Look at the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:33.140]   Look at him before he gets there, staggering up Golgotha with that cross too heavy upon
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:38.020]   him they have to call in another to carry it for him, Simon of Cyrene.
[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.260]   Look at them hammering in the nails.
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.540]   Look at the agony and the sweat.
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.300]   Look at the crown of thorns.
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.260]   Listen to him crying out, "I thirst."
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:50.100]   Look at the agony of Saul.
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:56.220]   Look at him crying out in the cry of dereliction, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:57.220]   me?"
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.300]   And I simply ask you this question.
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:05.340]   If there were any other way whereby mankind could be saved, would God in his eternal love
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:10.580]   ever have allowed this to happen to his only begotten, dearly beloved Son?
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:13.340]   The thing is monstrous.
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:18.540]   This most amazing thing that has ever happened in connection with him, this thing I say,
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:24.300]   if there had been a conceivable alternative, would never have happened.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:32.700]   He came and was born of a virgin and endured and suffered so much even to the death and
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:41.860]   the agony of the cross and rose again because there was no other way.
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:46.860]   But come, let me work that out with you.
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:56.740]   He is the only one in whom the promises of God are fulfilled.
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:00.940]   He is the only one who has fulfilled the promises.
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.900]   Have you ever thought of it like that?
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:07.140]   You see, the gospel in a sense doesn't start in the first verse of Matthew.
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:10.020]   The gospel starts way back in the Old Testament.
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:11.660]   God had been promising this.
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:14.260]   He had been telling the people he was going to send a deliverer.
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:18.700]   The gospel goes back, Paul speaks in writing to the Galatians, of the gospel preached in
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:19.700]   Abraham.
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:20.700]   It was.
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:23.060]   It was even preached in the Garden of Eden before that.
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:28.220]   Now, you see, God has been making promises throughout the running centuries of a deliverer,
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:29.300]   a Messiah.
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:35.340]   The only one who has fulfilled all those promises is this blessed person.
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:41.340]   And that again is an absolute proof in and of itself that this is the only gospel.
[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:48.020]   Paul tells the Corinthians, "All the promises of God in him are yea, and in him are amen
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:51.780]   to the glory of God the Father."
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:53.400]   He is the only saviour.
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:56.980]   This is the only gospel for this reason.
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:00.460]   He is of the seed of Abraham.
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.980]   That's why a Greek philosopher could never be the saviour.
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:04.980]   Seed of Abraham.
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:09.700]   Ah yes, even the natural seed of Abraham.
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.460]   You remember the great promise God gave to Abraham.
[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:18.660]   He said, "In thee and in thy seed all the nations of the world shall be blessed."
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:21.740]   That tremendous promise given to Abraham.
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:26.620]   So whoever the saviour is going to be, he's got to be of the seed of Abraham.
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:28.980]   And he was.
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:34.060]   Also of Isaac, also of Jacob, also of the tribe of Judah.
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:39.260]   That caused great confusion when our Lord was here on earth, because he was of the tribe
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:40.260]   of Judah.
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:44.380]   They couldn't understand how he could be the great high priest, because he didn't
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:45.380]   come from the tribe of Levi.
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:46.380]   Tribe of Judah.
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.380]   It had been promised.
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:52.500]   "The scepter shall arise out of Judah."
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.460]   This Shiloh that is to come.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.180]   All these things had been promised.
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:57.180]   Seed of David.
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:58.620]   It's all here.
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:02.020]   Why the little town of Bethlehem had been prophesied and predicted, you'll find it
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:04.020]   in the prophecy of Micah.
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:08.180]   You see my friends, there are tremendous promises and they're detailed promises,
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:13.380]   and the only one who answers to them all is of necessity the only Messiah.
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:16.380]   And here is the only one.
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:21.180]   And in exactly the same way, here's the only one who fulfills all the types and shadows
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:26.020]   that you see in the law that God gave to the people, the children of Israel, through Moses.
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.500]   There's another reason why I say this is the only gospel.
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:34.340]   There is no one else, there is nothing else that fulfills the prophecies apart from him.
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:36.140]   Let me have you on.
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.740]   And this is a most vital one.
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:45.180]   Here is the only one that can really teach us about God.
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:48.740]   And that's our fundamental and ultimate need.
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:52.700]   No man hath seen God at any time.
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.580]   No man can see God and live.
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:56.940]   How can a man know God?
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.300]   How can a man be just with God?
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:02.220]   Here's the only one who can teach us about God.
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:08.260]   You remember how he put it, talking to that great learned teacher of the Jews, Nicodemus.
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:12.900]   "Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel?
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.260]   And knowest not these things?
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:21.540]   Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Listen, we speak that we do know."
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:25.220]   "I'm not speculating," said Christ to Nicodemus.
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:27.180]   "I'm not a theorist.
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:29.340]   I'm not putting up an idea.
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:35.420]   I'm speaking that which I know and testify that which we have seen."
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:40.140]   "If I have told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.740]   you of heavenly things?"
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:47.740]   "Listen, and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, even the
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:52.540]   Son of Man which is in heaven."
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:58.860]   I alone have this knowledge, says Christ to Nicodemus, because I have come from heaven.
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.620]   You haven't, nobody else has.
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:02.780]   Mankind knows nothing about heaven.
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.460]   They've been trying to get there but they can't.
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:07.180]   They're pitting their little minds against the eternal.
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:08.180]   They don't.
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:09.180]   They're ignorant of God.
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:13.660]   The world by wisdom knew not God, but I've come from God.
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:17.580]   You know, there's that tremendous statement in the beginning of the prologue, "In the
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:25.300]   beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:30.580]   Some of those statements mean this, that he was looking into the face of God, and he was,
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:33.900]   the eternal Son, looking to the face of the Father.
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:37.660]   So when he comes he can speak and say, "I'm speaking what I know.
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.620]   I've looked into the face of the Father."
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:46.300]   Nobody else has, and therefore nobody else knows anything at all about him.
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.380]   That's why this is the only gospel.
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.780]   Your Greek philosophers, they did their utmost.
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.900]   I'm not here to criticize them, but they couldn't get there.
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.460]   They died in ignorance.
[00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:01.180]   No man can ever ascend to this knowledge of God.
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:02.180]   It is impossible.
[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:07.780]   It must come down, and it's come down in the Son in all its fullness.
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.420]   And this is, you see, what he keeps on claiming.
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:15.780]   He turns to the Pharisees with their carping criticisms, and he says to them one day, "You
[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.420]   have never heard his voice.
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:19.620]   You have never seen his shape."
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:24.180]   He says, "Who are you to be talking about God?
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.620]   Have you ever heard the voice of God?
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:29.940]   Have you any idea of the form, the shape of God?
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:30.940]   What a word!
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.020]   I don't understand it.
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.900]   Nobody does, but he meant it.
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:37.660]   He knows God in that ultimate sense nobody else has.
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:39.980]   He quietly says, "You're speculating.
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.260]   You're simply expressing your prejudices.
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:43.340]   You don't know."
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:46.620]   And there he is in his high priestly prayer at the end of his life.
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:52.980]   This is what he says, "Oh, righteous Father, the world hath not known thee, but I have
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:53.980]   known thee."
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:55.860]   He doesn't hesitate to say it.
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:56.860]   It was the truth.
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:57.860]   He knew him.
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:02.820]   He is the Son of God, comes from the bosom of the Father, and is still there, has looked
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:07.300]   face to face with the Father from all eternity.
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:11.020]   That's my third reason for saying this is the only gospel.
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:15.980]   But let me give you a fourth.
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.640]   This is the only good news.
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:26.020]   This is the only gospel, because he is the only one who could perform the task that is
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:29.460]   necessary to our salvation.
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.500]   What does mankind need?
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.520]   The fundamental needs of mankind are just these.
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:37.340]   We need forgiveness.
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:40.820]   We need to be reconciled to God.
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:44.660]   We need to be restored to the favor of God.
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:51.180]   The problem of our guilt and sin, the problem of our fallen nature, we need not only forgiveness,
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:54.500]   we need a new life.
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:59.600]   We need a new beginning, a new nature, a new heart.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:03.180]   We need someone who can bring us to glory.
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.800]   That's the task.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.220]   What the world needs tonight is not advice.
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:09.100]   We've been having it throughout the centuries.
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.920]   There's plenty of advice in the books tonight.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.920]   We all ought to be perfect.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.940]   If all we need is good advice, there are plenty of books which will tell you how to live,
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:20.940]   but the question is how to perform, as Paul puts it.
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:24.460]   I know, he says, what is good, but how to perform that which is good?
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:25.460]   I know not.
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:28.860]   The will is present with me.
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:30.180]   That's the whole problem.
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:36.020]   So this is what we need, and here is the only one who can meet the situation.
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.020]   What do we need?
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:43.200]   Here's mankind fallen and in sin, estranged from God and sunk in degradation.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.920]   What kind of a savior do we need?
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:49.400]   Well, we need someone who must be a man to represent us.
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:56.840]   We are men, partakers of flesh and blood, and we need someone who can stand as our representative.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:01.320]   So whoever the savior is to be, he must be a man.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.760]   The answer is he is.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:12.600]   Remember that Jesus, Christ of the seed of David, truly a man, the word was made flesh.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:16.320]   You see, every part of this gospel is an absolute essential.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:23.280]   He is man, as we are, truly man.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:27.880]   The incarnation is a fact.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:32.480]   Then he must be able to keep the law for us perfectly.
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:38.840]   You see, no one can help us and deliver us unless he can keep the law himself.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:42.240]   And all who have lived before him have not been able to keep the law.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:44.680]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:49.160]   By the law is the knowledge of sin, therefore by the deeds of the law shall no flesh be
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.600]   justified in his sight.
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:54.880]   The whole world lieth guilty before God, because all have come short of the glory of God.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:58.760]   It's the law that condemns us, and anyone who is to save us must obviously therefore
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:02.280]   be able to keep the law himself perfectly and absolutely.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:11.520]   The Saviour, as the apostle puts it, has been sent to redeem them that are under the law.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:16.920]   So it must be a man, and he must be one who can keep the law himself absolutely perfectly.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:19.080]   If he fails at one point, he's finished.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.720]   He can't save us, can't save himself.
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:25.560]   Is there any other who's ever kept the law perfectly?
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:29.720]   Is there any other who's ever appeared who could stand and say, "What evil do ye find
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:33.240]   in me, and the devil findeth nothing in me, nothing"?
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:36.680]   No one could bring any real accusation against him.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:41.560]   Satisfies the law of God perfectly and completely.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.880]   What else do we need?
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:52.020]   We need someone who can conquer our enemies, and particularly the devil and his hordes.
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:55.440]   No one can save us unless he can conquer the devil.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:58.520]   What would be the point of my being put absolutely right and clear tonight?
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:02.560]   I've still got to fight the world, the flesh, the devil, and he'll get me down as he's got
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.560]   me down.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:08.080]   Only the only one who can save me is one who can conquer, master, defeat the devil and
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.080]   all his powers.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.160]   There's only one who's ever done it.
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:16.320]   It's the same one, Jesus Christ of the seed of David.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:19.520]   But wait a minute.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.840]   Here is this terrible load of sin.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:28.280]   Here is the record that's against me, the writing that is against me, the indictment
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.680]   of the law.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:33.400]   And I can't be saved until that has been dealt with.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.760]   God is a just, righteous, holy God.
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:38.640]   He can't wink at sin and pretend it isn't there.
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:43.440]   He must deal with it, and therefore we need a Savior who's big enough to take our guilt
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:47.400]   upon himself and bear the full punishment and yet live.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:50.520]   That's the problem.
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:55.440]   He's got to be big enough and strong enough and great enough to do that, to take the full
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:45:01.560]   penalty and the wrath of God upon our sins so that God can be just and the justifier
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.120]   of him that believeth in Jesus.
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:10.000]   He's got to be able to bear it all and still remain to present us to God.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:18.520]   So the apostle says, "Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:24.000]   the dead according to my gospel, giving proof that he'd satisfied the law of God, that
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.040]   the books had been cleared, that all was well, and that God is fully satisfied.
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:36.080]   The resurrection is the justification delivered for our offenses, raised again for our justification,
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:41.320]   and in the resurrection God is pronouncing to the whole world that he's reconciled,
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:47.000]   that all is well, there is free forgiveness of sins.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:54.960]   But the resurrection in doing that proclaims at the same time that he is the Son of God."
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:46:01.120]   As Paul puts it to the Romans, "Of the seed of David according to the flesh but declared
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:07.440]   to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.440]   from the dead.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:19.080]   Here he is, man yet God, Jesus Christ, Son of man, Son of God, seed of David, seed of
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:28.720]   God, conceived of the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:39.000]   He is the only one who could take that load, God and man, the divine human Savior.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.360]   And he is the only one who can start a new humanity.
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:50.840]   He is the second man, he is the last Adam, he is the first begotten from the dead.
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:53.640]   He is the only one who can give us new life.
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:56.560]   He is the only one who can give us new birth.
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:04.960]   Yes, says Charles Wesley, born to raise the sons of earth, born to give us second birth.
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:13.320]   "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:14.320]   of God.
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:19.840]   Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:25.040]   He must be born again, and I am come that they might have life and that they might have
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.200]   it more abundantly.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:36.280]   The water that I shall give him shall be in him as a well of water springing up into everlasting
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:37.280]   life.
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.320]   I am the bread of life.
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:46.120]   Except a man eat my flesh and drink my blood, he hath no life in him.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:50.920]   He alone can give us life, and without it we are lost and helpless.
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:51.920]   Forgiveness isn't enough.
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:56.720]   I have got to stand in the presence of God, and I must have a new life and a new nature,
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:01.120]   and he gives it me all."
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:09.760]   And likewise, and lastly, we need someone who, having purchased our pardon, having reconciled
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:16.600]   us to God, having given us life anew, can take us by the hand and lead us and guide
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:22.680]   us and guard us and protect us as we go through the remainder of our journey in this evil
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.280]   and sinful world.
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:28.440]   And thank God it is the very thing he does.
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:33.400]   We need such a high priest that can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities.
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:38.440]   We need one to represent us with God that understands our case and condition, because
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.720]   he has been through it himself, tempted in all points like us.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:46.720]   We are yet without sin, and also at the same time able to sympathize with us, though he
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.840]   is God at the right hand of glory.
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:52.480]   He is touched still with the feeling of our infirmities.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:57.760]   He came down and had men spitting into his face in order that he might be able to help
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:58.760]   you.
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:48:59.760]   He can do it.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:05.280]   We need such a saviour, and he alone can do it.
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:17.680]   And then, the final event of all, to stand before God.
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:22.360]   Have you ever thought what it means?
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:29.760]   I had to try to help a lady the other day that came to see me from the country, one
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.520]   of whose main troubles was this.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:37.080]   She is a good Christian woman, she said, "But you know, there are times when I am terrified
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:38.560]   when I think of the second coming."
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:42.040]   Terrified!
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.080]   I said, "I am glad to hear it.
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:49.200]   I am far too familiar with people who can take it in their stride and just say it glibly.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.280]   It is a terrifying thing," I said.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:54.440]   "So far you are right, it is very good.
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:50:01.480]   Can you imagine what it is to stand before the presence of God's glory?"
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:09.520]   We need someone who can present us to him, and here is the only one who can.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:16.080]   Here is the one who is able to keep us from falling and to present us faultless before
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:21.640]   the presence of God's glory with exceeding joy.
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:26.800]   Here is one who saves you in life, will lead you to the end of the journey.
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:30.840]   He will be with you in the river of death, in the final crossing.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:37.160]   He will be with you on the other side, and he will present you before the presence of
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:45.040]   the glory of God with exceeding joy.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:50.680]   That is why, my friends, this is the only gospel.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:55.460]   It is the only message that can satisfy your every need and mine.
[00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:59.960]   It is the only message that covers all the things that are going to happen to us.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:01.280]   There is none other.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:04.480]   There was no other good enough to pay the price of sin.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:12.600]   He only could unlock the gate of heaven and let us in, and he has done it, this blessed,
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:13.600]   glorious Savior.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:26.400]   Remember, I say to you, remember, my friend, Jesus Christ of the seed of David.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:30.520]   Remember all the truth concerning him and what it means.
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:37.680]   Oh, I press it upon you on this Sunday night before Christmas.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:38.680]   Remember this, I say.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:40.480]   Remember, it is the only gospel.
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:41.480]   Why?
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:45.460]   Well, my dear friend, because of the dread alternative.
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:52.040]   If you do not believe this, there is nothing left for you, nothing at all.
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:58.440]   How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:02.640]   You see, your problem and mine, as a result of sin, were such that it took all this to
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:03.640]   save us.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:10.000]   You neglect this, there is nothing left but perdition.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:15.040]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:20.480]   him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:27.040]   He that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed on the name of
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.920]   the only begotten Son of God.
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:35.800]   My friend, listen, other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:38.240]   Jesus Christ.
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:43.320]   There is no foundation that is big enough and strong enough to support the need of man
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.320]   but this.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:45.320]   It is the only one.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:46.840]   It is the exclusive one.
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:51.720]   It needs no help, no addition.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:53:00.040]   And if you are not on this foundation, you will go to eternal misery and wretchedness,
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:02.880]   outside the life of God.
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:08.640]   Oh, my dear friend, remember this.
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:15.000]   Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the dead according
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.040]   to my gospel.
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:25.760]   Remember that if you believe this, your sins are forgiven, you are reconciled to God, you
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:28.840]   become at once a child of God.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:34.560]   You have a new nature, you will have a new heart, you will begin a new life, you will
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:39.240]   be an inheritor of these great, exceeding great and precious promises, you will get
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:41.840]   to know God.
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:46.680]   You will begin to experience joys that you would never have been able to imagine.
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:50.880]   You will find something happening within you, a process taking place within you, something
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:55.800]   you do not understand, a power within you leading you on, and a hunger and a thirst
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:54:01.920]   after God and righteousness, and it will go on and on.
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:05.160]   You will lose the fear of death and the grave.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:09.520]   You will know what it is at times, as I was saying in this pulpit last Wednesday night
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:14.840]   about the great George Whitefield, what it is even in your youth, the desire to go to
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:20.400]   be with Christ, which is far better.
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:27.000]   And you will be able to look forward to a glory that is beyond description in its magnificence
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.400]   and its splendor.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:43.800]   My dear friend, remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:47.120]   according to the only gospel.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:54.280]   Believe it and be saved, be safe.
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:57.920]   Amen.
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:05.160]   Now shall we join the hymn of praise and the hymn, hymn number 176, the second part.
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:10.480]   We are going to sing the second part, beginning at verse 7 of hymn number 176.
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:19.000]   Join all the glorious names of wisdom, love, and power that mortals ever knew, that angels
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:26.040]   ever bore, all are too mean to speak his worth, too mean to set my Saviour forth.
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:32.000]   The man who can sing that honestly is a man who can be certain of his salvation.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.160]   He can begin to look forward to the glory everlasting.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:39.640]   God give us grace, all of us, to sing it from the heart.
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:40.640]   176.
