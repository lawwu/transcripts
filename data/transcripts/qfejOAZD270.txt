[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.700]   - We're honored to be joined by author
[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.260]   and speaker Paul Tripp, and he joins us one last time.
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.320]   Paul, as a parent, I think of parenting as painting.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.840]   Each day I put one dab of paint on a canvas.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.000]   I hope it's the right color, I hope it's in the right spot.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.920]   But parenting brings with it a lot of uncertainty
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.000]   and insecurity and self-doubt.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.840]   As a parent with experience, what would you say
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.880]   is the goal of day in and day out parenting?
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.760]   - If I would say, this is big deal
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.680]   of parenting to be two things.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.320]   The first one is authority.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.120]   Children must early understand that they've been born
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.960]   into a world of authority and they're not it.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.800]   The sooner a child submits to that,
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.920]   the more blessed his life is gonna be.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.080]   And so my children don't belong to me, they belong to God.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.560]   He's the ultimate owner and authority.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.880]   That means that I'm a representative
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.680]   and ambassador of the authority of God.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.000]   I'm the tone of God's voice as a parent.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.880]   I'm the look on his face, I'm the touch of his hand.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.360]   Now, this will make you weak in your knees.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.440]   Here's what this means.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.000]   It means every time I exercise authority
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.720]   in the lives of my children,
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.840]   in all those mundane little circumstances,
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.040]   it must be a beautiful picture of the authority of God.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.240]   Because I want the children to see authority as beautiful
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.840]   and giving and serving and loving and compassionate
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.240]   and patient and gracious 'cause that's the authority of God.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.080]   Because children are born with a natural antipathy
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.000]   toward authority, a natural hatred of authority.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And I want to depict authority in its divine beauty
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.400]   so that they will say, "Authority is a good thing.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.920]   "Authority is a wise thing.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.760]   "Authority is a protective thing.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.520]   "Authority doesn't crush my freedom, it gives me freedom."
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.080]   So that's a big deal.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.520]   Here's a second thing that I know as a parent,
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.600]   there are mysteries of the universe
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.720]   that if you don't understand these mysteries,
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.720]   you won't be what you're supposed to be
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.000]   and you won't do what you're supposed to do.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.240]   The ultimate of that mystery is the mystery of the grace
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.840]   of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of Christ.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.280]   But there are many, many mysteries,
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.180]   the mystery of the sovereignty of God,
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.720]   many, many of these mysteries.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.100]   Well, I want to download those mysteries to my children.
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.320]   So I'm always looking for opportunities
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.600]   to take the mundane moment
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.880]   and unfold one of these mysteries to my children.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.880]   They're not in control, life is not about them.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.600]   Love of neighbor is an important thing.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.640]   Stewardship of resources is something God calls me to.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.600]   We live in a world that's not just a world of authority,
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.480]   it's a world of grace.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.000]   So I'm looking for all these opportunities
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.600]   to unfold the mysteries that have been trusted to me
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.240]   through the ministry of the Spirit,
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.720]   through the word of God to my children
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.640]   so they begin to understand things
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.840]   that become the tracks on which human life
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.640]   that was meant to be lived is lived.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.800]   And here's what I need to know,
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.560]   that if my eyes ever see and my ears ever hear
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.740]   the sin, weakness and failure of my children,
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.720]   it's never an accident, it's never an interruption,
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.280]   it's never a hassle, it's always grace.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.880]   God loves those children,
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.800]   he's put them in a family of faith,
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.120]   he will reveal their need to me as a parent
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.280]   so I can be a tool of his authority
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.760]   and his truth and his wisdom and his grace.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.280]   That's the system.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.680]   And so God will always give you more opportunities,
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.520]   you do the work in little moments,
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.160]   it's always unfinished because change is a process
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.120]   and not an event.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.440]   You have the wonderful position, this is amazing to me,
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.480]   of being a tool in God's hands
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.240]   for the forming of a human soul.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.600]   What could be more exciting than that?
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.440]   - Amen.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.600]   We are done now but I would love for you to return
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.800]   and talk more about parenting with us in the future
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.840]   and perhaps we can do a whole week on it.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.720]   But we are done for the week and sadly our time
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.520]   with Paul Tripp is done for now.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.040]   Paul is the author of many books,
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.440]   including the one we've been talking about
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.280]   for the last couple of weeks titled "Sex and Money."
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.660]   Be sure to check it out.
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.140]   Well, Monday, John Piper is back in the hot seat
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.440]   answering your tough questions.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.280]   I'm your host Tony Reinke,
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.760]   thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.040]   Have a wonderful weekend.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
