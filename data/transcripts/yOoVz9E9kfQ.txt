[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.680]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.880]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.120]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.160]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.280]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.240]   Recently, the Huberman Lab Podcast hosted a live event
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.120]   at the ICC Theater in Sydney, Australia.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.280]   The event was called the Brain-Body Contract
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.480]   and featured a lecture,
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.320]   followed by a question and answer session with the audience.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.200]   We wanted to make the question and answer session
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.240]   available to everyone, regardless if you could attend.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.660]   I also would like to thank the sponsors for the event.
[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.920]   They are 8Sleep and AG1.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.660]   8Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.120]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.280]   Now, I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.840]   about the fact that sleep is the critical foundation
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.180]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.120]   Now, one of the key things
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.800]   to getting the best possible night's sleep
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.280]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.240]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.120]   your body temperature actually needs to drop
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.600]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.840]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and alert,
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.040]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.520]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.040]   8Sleep mattress covers make it extremely easy
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.320]   to control the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.880]   and thereby to control your core body temperature
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.680]   so that you fall and stay deeply asleep
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.640]   and wake up feeling your absolute best.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.460]   I've been sleeping on an 8Sleep mattress cover
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.880]   for about three years now,
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.480]   and it has completely transformed the quality of my sleep
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.320]   for the better.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.360]   8Sleep recently launched their newest generation
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.440]   of pod cover, the Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.720]   The Pod 4 cover has improved cooling and heating capacity,
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.960]   higher fidelity sleep tracking technology,
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.200]   and the Pod 4 cover has snoring detection
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.220]   that will automatically lift your head a few degrees
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.440]   to improve airflow and stop your snoring.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.380]   If you'd like to try an 8Sleep mattress cover,
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.440]   you can go to 8sleep.com/huberman
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.880]   to save $350 off their Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.020]   8Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.360]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.560]   Again, that's 8sleep.com/huberman.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.040]   The other live event sponsor, AG1,
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.080]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.740]   that also contains adaptogens
[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.720]   and other critical micronutrients.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.580]   I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012,
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.460]   so I'm delighted that they decided to sponsor the live event.
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.640]   I started taking AG1,
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.100]   and I still take AG1 once or twice a day
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.880]   because it gives me vitamins and minerals
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.280]   that I might not be getting enough of
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.940]   from whole foods that I eat,
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.880]   as well as adaptogens and micronutrients.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.220]   Those adaptogens and micronutrients are really critical
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.820]   because even though I strive to eat most of my foods
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.740]   from unprocessed or minimally processed whole foods,
[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.780]   it's often hard to do so,
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.640]   especially when I'm traveling and especially when I'm busy.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.880]   So by drinking a packet of AG1 in the morning,
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.200]   and oftentimes also again in the afternoon or evening,
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.180]   I'm ensuring that I'm getting everything I need.
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.020]   I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.020]   And I, like so many other people that take AG1 regularly,
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.580]   just report feeling better.
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.860]   And that shouldn't be surprising
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.140]   because it supports gut health,
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.780]   and of course, gut health supports immune system health
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.780]   and brain health.
[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.860]   And it's supporting a ton of different cellular
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.340]   and organ processes that all interact with one another.
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.100]   So while certain supplements are really directed
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.660]   towards one specific outcome,
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.820]   like sleeping better or being more alert,
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.180]   AG1 really is foundational nutritional support.
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.480]   It's really designed to support all of the systems
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.700]   of your brain and body that relate to mental health
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.720]   and physical health.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.000]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.380]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.820]   to claim a special offer.
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.220]   They'll give you five free travel packs with your order,
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.860]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.180]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.040]   And now for the live event at the ICC Theater
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.580]   in Sydney, Australia.
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:52.120]   Does having an afternoon sleep
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.720]   affect your quality of sleep at night?
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.560]   Great question.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.520]   I can keep this one pretty brief.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.380]   We just recorded a six episode series
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.020]   that will be aired later this year
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.740]   with the one and only Mighty Matt Walker,
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.780]   who wrote the marvelous book, "Why We Sleep."
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.820]   And we went into this topic in depth.
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.500]   The business of naps is the following.
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.280]   Keep them shorter than 90 minutes,
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.320]   so you don't disrupt your nighttime sleep.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.340]   Don't do them at all.
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.900]   If it disrupts your nighttime sleep,
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.580]   so if you're somebody for whom even 10 minutes of napping
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.580]   disrupts your nighttime sleep, don't do that.
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.100]   If you're somebody who wakes up from naps feeling groggy,
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.100]   that's what's called sleep inertia.
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.500]   This is what gave rise to the ever-famous nappuccino
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.820]   of having some coffee and then taking a nap,
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.720]   or an espresso and then taking a nap.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.500]   Again, I get obsessed with nomenclature.
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.040]   Why didn't they call it espresso nap?
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.180]   I don't know.
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.100]   Naps are wonderful.
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.220]   If they're shorter than 90 minutes,
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.520]   don't interfere with nighttime sleep.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.860]   But I, in particular, am a big fan of,
[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.700]   as many of you know, this business of non-sleep deep rest,
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.900]   of putting the body into what?
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.380]   Body still, mind awake.
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.140]   And we know, based on several studies
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.520]   from the University of Copenhagen,
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.060]   that that actually replenishes levels of dopamine
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.140]   in certain key areas of the brain
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.220]   that restore mental and physical vigor
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.620]   and do not disrupt nighttime sleep,
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.220]   but rather enhance one's ability to fall and stay asleep
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.080]   or to fall back asleep.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.980]   So not only are these states of body still, mind awake
[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.380]   very beneficial, it seems,
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.700]   or I should say perhaps for creativity,
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.400]   'cause that was all anechoic data,
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.860]   but we know from real data,
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.720]   from laboratory data on many subjects,
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.320]   peer-reviewed, et cetera,
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.700]   that body still, mind alert is actually an effective means
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.500]   to improve one's sleep
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.780]   and perhaps even make up for sleep that one has lost.
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.700]   So I encourage you, if you're a napper, great,
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.060]   and if you have challenges with sleep
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.580]   in any way that you think might be related
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.540]   to your napping activity,
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.820]   that you consider short 10-minute
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.080]   or maybe 20-minute non-sleep deep rest protocols.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.600]   By the way, they're completely zero cost,
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.080]   and very soon we will be releasing
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.420]   to our YouTube Clips channel
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.200]   a 10-minute, 20-minute, and 30-minute
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.000]   non-sleep deep rest protocol that I've narrated.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.320]   If you don't like my voice,
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.680]   there are many out there of more pleasant voices,
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.000]   but what might be of particular interest to you
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.720]   is that the visual is of the beautiful sunrise over Sydney,
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.100]   so it'll bring you home as well.
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.240]   Sunrises here are absolutely spectacular.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.640]   Do you believe in the placebo effect?
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.840]   Absolutely, and there's probably a joke there,
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.080]   but I can't come up with it on the fly.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.360]   How would I know if it's real?
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.520]   Eh, eh, eh, eh, something like that.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.160]   So the placebo effect is real.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.580]   Our belief about what we've taken
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.420]   or what is happening to us has a powerful effect
[00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.740]   on our physiology.
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.580]   It's not purely psychological.
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.640]   The whole business of psychosomatic,
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.540]   even that word, is starting to fall away
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.900]   as we start to understand that our beliefs
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.580]   have a powerful effect
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.320]   on what happens to us physiologically,
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.460]   so much so that, for instance,
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.300]   my colleague Ali Crum,
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.220]   a tenured professor at Stanford's Department of Psychology
[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.540]   who's been a guest on the podcast who studies mindsets,
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.300]   has done beautiful experiments on stress,
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.220]   showing that if you watch a short video about stress
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.500]   and you learn all the terrible things
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.060]   that stress can do to your cognition,
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.680]   your sleep, and your well-being,
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.560]   well, that indeed that happens,
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.660]   and that if you watch a short video
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.660]   about how stress can be performance-enhancing
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.180]   by sharpening your mental acuity,
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.220]   your access to particular memory stores, et cetera,
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.900]   that indeed that happens.
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.540]   So-called belief effects.
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.420]   Why belief effects, not placebo effects?
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.420]   Well, placebo effects tend to be more general.
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.700]   Belief effects tend to be
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.400]   around specific types of information,
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.280]   but the placebo effect has recently been shown
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.180]   to extend to a dose-dependent placebo effect.
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.820]   One of the more remarkable papers, I think,
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:04.920]   published in the last few years,
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.940]   most people are unaware of,
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.540]   I talked about this in a journal club episode
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.520]   of the Huberman Lab podcast
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.480]   with the one and only Peter Atiyah,
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.700]   described a paper where people took either zero,
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:21.200]   I believe it was 0.25 milligrams,
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.400]   half a milligram or a gram of nicotine,
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.040]   which is known to be a cognitive enhancer.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.960]   Please don't smoke, dip, huff or snuff nicotine.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.860]   It's cancerous in those forms,
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.920]   and taking nicotine can increase blood pressure,
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.000]   vasoconstriction, et cetera,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.320]   but nicotine is a cognitive enhancer.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.960]   It is a cognitive enhancer,
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.720]   and I can't help but tell you one story about this
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.400]   before I get back to placebo effect.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.360]   Don't worry, I always make my way back.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.440]   Now you can see why living with me as a child
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.740]   was so challenging.
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:59.160]   Nicotine, I was told by a very, very famous Nobel Laureate,
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.820]   member of the neuroscience community,
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.440]   because I visited his office,
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.040]   I won't tell you who it is,
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.120]   at Columbia University.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.160]   I met with him, and he was telling me
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.880]   about what he studies,
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.240]   but I noticed he chewed no fewer than six pieces of Nicorette
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.720]   during the course of that conversation,
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.960]   and I had to just stop him at one point and say,
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.600]   "Why are you consuming all this nicotine?"
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.800]   And he said, "Well, it's what's going to allow me
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.060]   "to stave off Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, of course,
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.160]   "and I don't wanna smoke."
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.000]   And I said, "Really?"
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.160]   And he said, "Yeah, there's some evidence
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.120]   "that keeping levels of neuromodulators
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.360]   "like dopamine and acetylcholine elevated
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.920]   "despite the increases in blood pressure
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.360]   "that are caused by consuming nicotine
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.480]   "may indeed offset Parkinson's and Alzheimer's."
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.340]   I'm not telling you this as a clinical trial.
[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.880]   I'm telling you this as anecdata.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.000]   He is a Nobel Prize winner.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.400]   He's still very, very sharp in his 80s.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.540]   The point here is that in a study of nicotine and cognition,
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.080]   where people's cognition is indeed enhanced by nicotine,
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.540]   everybody knows that and agrees upon that,
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.260]   people who were told they had a higher dose of nicotine
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.160]   performed better in this cognitive task
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.940]   when, in fact, they consumed zero.
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.520]   And people who performed moderately,
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.140]   who were then told that they had consumed
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.320]   a higher dose of nicotine performed better
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.540]   than those that simply consumed a moderate dose
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.860]   and were told they had a moderate dose.
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.100]   In other words, everyone gets the same dose,
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.020]   either zero or moderate,
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.020]   but depending on what you're told,
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.940]   your performance changes accordingly.
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.620]   And that's cool, but what's really cool about the study
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.860]   is they actually recorded from brain centers
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.140]   of these individuals and the levels of activity,
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.540]   in particular areas of the brain
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.900]   that are relevant for cognition,
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.220]   changed according to what the people believe.
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.520]   So there you go.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.060]   Placebo effect is changing neural activity.
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.300]   It's not all just through what you think is happening.
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.580]   What you think is happening
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.060]   is the reflection of neural activity,
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.660]   and then you go, "Well, of course."
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.660]   But I think it's an important study.
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.020]   So I believe in the placebo effect,
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.740]   and it is dose-dependent,
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.900]   and that raises all sorts of scary concerns
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.520]   about the placebo effect,
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.980]   but it's also pretty darn cool
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.260]   because what it means is that our belief system,
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.460]   including our understanding of the mechanisms
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.100]   that are likely driving certain effects of drugs
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.340]   or protocols or what have you,
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.660]   is going to play a powerful role
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.520]   in whether or not we get the effect that we want.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.300]   And perhaps that's the most important thing,
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.900]   provided that you're going about it safely.
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.860]   How do I enter the rest and digest state
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.420]   and exit my constant fight-or-flight state?
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.700]   Well, the fastest way is gonna be physiological size,
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.620]   probably repeated two or three times in a row
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.940]   if you don't experience that the first time.
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.940]   The second would be to combine that with panoramic vision.
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.500]   I must say, and I don't wanna sound
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.620]   like a repeating record here,
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.380]   but there are certain things
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.980]   that if we're not doing on a regular basis,
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.840]   our nervous system is just going to idle at a higher,
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.580]   let's just call it autonomic RPM,
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.460]   which is not real science language,
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:05.940]   but if you've ever felt wired and tired from lack of sleep,
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.420]   you know what this is about.
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.220]   The key thing is to get enough sleep each night,
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.140]   so much so that I think we can safely say
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.260]   that stress is not bad for us,
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.180]   provided you sleep well at night.
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.380]   Now, the challenge is, for most people, including myself,
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.580]   if you stress a lot, sleep doesn't come easily
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.340]   or you wake from sleep in the middle of the night.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.440]   And here again is where zero cost behavioral protocols
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.920]   are truly, in my opinion,
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.460]   unless there's some dire clinical need,
[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.840]   the most effective and best practice.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.720]   And this non-sleep deep rest, which by the way,
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:45.640]   is indeed a renaming or a partial renaming of yoga nidra,
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.760]   which stands for yoga sleep.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.280]   And again, I have tremendous reverence
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.040]   for the yogic traditions.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.040]   It's just that I had to make a decision a few years ago
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.180]   when I'd been introduced to yoga nidra in 2015.
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.500]   I was down at a trauma treatment center,
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.700]   an addiction treatment center in Florida
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.680]   run by a friend of mine,
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.220]   essentially observing what they were doing
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.860]   with these addicts that couldn't recover
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.140]   no matter what their effort.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:12.260]   And they were able to recover to get sober and stay sober.
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.500]   And people were getting over other sorts of traumas
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.000]   through the use of many protocols, of course,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.460]   talk therapy, et cetera.
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.500]   But they would start their day
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.820]   with 30 minutes to an hour of yoga nidra.
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.000]   And I thought, what's yoga nidra?
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.360]   I learned it's yoga sleep.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.440]   You lie down, you do a self-directed relaxation.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.980]   It also involves intentions, et cetera.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.480]   And I thought this is really powerful.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.600]   And I spent a lot of time in my laboratory
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.320]   working on it and understanding it.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.720]   And there are other studies as well
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.080]   that now explain how these states of keeping the mind active
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.800]   while the body is still as a self-directed practice
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.240]   is immensely powerful for a number of reasons.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.920]   And the reason I decided to call it non-sleep deep rest,
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.920]   NSDR, was not to rob it of the official name of yoga nidra,
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.860]   but because unfortunately, unfortunately,
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.460]   names like yoga nidra, or proprietary names,
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.380]   or when we name protocols after people,
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.500]   it acts as a separator.
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.740]   It often deters people from trying things
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.000]   because it sounds esoteric.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.660]   So I went with a description of the thing
[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:18.020]   that relates to what the thing is supposed to do,
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.200]   non-sleep deep rest, or what it's all about.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.380]   So I actively avoided calling it Huberman breathing
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.140]   or something like that because that's not my interest.
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.940]   My interest is in people using these tools.
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.020]   And I have taken some heat for that one.
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.220]   I'm not interested.
[00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.380]   It was not an attempt to appropriate something.
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.580]   It was really an attempt to just try
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:35.740]   and distribute valuable tools
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.540]   because I see a lot of suffering
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.140]   and it seems like a useful thing to do.
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.660]   So I would encourage anyone that feels
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.260]   like they enter a stressed state too much
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.480]   to learn self-directed relaxation.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.380]   First and foremost, so do NSDR,
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.860]   anywhere from three to five times a week,
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.080]   10 minutes a day as a zero cost tool,
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.420]   as a way to be able to better access,
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.500]   better sleep at night.
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.660]   And then if the fight or flight state persists,
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:05.700]   then of course, things like physiological size, et cetera,
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.540]   should be incorporated.
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.060]   And then of course, of course, of course,
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.540]   I believe in modern medicine,
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.040]   there are excellent pharmaceutical tools,
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.640]   prescription drugs that can be used for that.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.060]   But of course, there's the intermediate stuff,
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.700]   things like theanine and magnesium
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.580]   that for all the world can be useful in some context,
[00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.580]   but they're not the be all end all.
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.660]   As much as I might reference supplements
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.260]   on the podcast from time to time,
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.500]   I don't think they're the place to start.
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.500]   I think one should always use behavioral tools first.
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.540]   And I've said this many times before,
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.780]   but I think it's worth saying again.
[00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.820]   Our muscles need rest days from the gym
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.140]   in order to grow back stronger.
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.140]   Yes, definitely true.
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.100]   Is the brain designed to be consistently learning
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.220]   and developing or does it need periods of rest
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.860]   from consuming new information?
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.020]   Or is the rest when we sleep?
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.900]   Great questions, thank you, Timothy.
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:56.020]   Yes, indeed, our muscles get stronger, grow,
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.620]   after a proper stimulus is applied to them
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:02.180]   in the time after we provide that stimulus,
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.540]   which typically is resistance.
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.740]   But since not everyone's interested in that,
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.380]   it's also the case that an endurance adaptation
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:14.260]   occurs after we embark on the run,
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.780]   the hike, the swim, et cetera.
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:16.820]   There's something kind of interesting,
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.140]   and I just want to take a moment and just mention
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.460]   that there's something kind of interesting
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.180]   about resistance training is that it's the one form
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.220]   of training that, because of the enhanced blood flow
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.820]   to the muscles while we do it,
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:31.300]   gives us a window into what the adaptation might look like
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.340]   once it occurs, if we allow proper rest.
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.700]   Whereas with endurance training, it's very different, right?
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.980]   You go further and/or you run up a hill
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.580]   until your legs burn and you want to vomit up a lung,
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.860]   and then the next time you do it,
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.500]   you don't feel quite as bad, right?
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.860]   The adaptation occurs, of course, in a very similar way
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.020]   to resistance training, different mechanisms,
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.260]   but there's a delay in adaptation, you get better.
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.060]   It's just that with resistance training,
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.260]   you can kind of sense the change before the change occurs
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.000]   because of the enhanced blood flow to the muscles.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.260]   With endurance training, you sense the limit
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.440]   of your ability, and then you exceed
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.220]   that limit subsequently.
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:10.900]   Now, in terms of cognitive learning,
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.380]   the same thing is basically true.
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.700]   If you want to get really technical about it,
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.400]   the computational biology, the modeling of this says
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.320]   that if you want to learn something,
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.300]   probably setting the difficulty
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.420]   of what you're trying to learn to about 85% correct trials,
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.220]   15% error trials is probably ideal.
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.060]   What does that mean?
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.420]   It means if you're trying to learn a new piano piece,
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.380]   you know, or you're trying to teach that to a child,
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.740]   if they're not starting from scratch,
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.900]   let them play something that they know pretty well
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.700]   and then introduce a small percentage,
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.460]   maybe 10 to 15, maybe 20%, you don't have to be exact
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:48.700]   about this, of novel material that's hard for them to learn.
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:53.700]   But yes, it is the focused, deliberate attempt
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.220]   to learn something that creates that sense
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.140]   of underlying agitation that is the trigger,
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:04.060]   the stimulus for neuroplasticity.
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:04.940]   This makes sense.
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.780]   If you could complete something,
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.460]   if you could do something, a scale of music,
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.460]   physical task, speaking a new language,
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.020]   if you could do that,
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.740]   why would your nervous system ever change
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.340]   and how does your nervous system know
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.140]   if it's supposed to change, right?
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.600]   Your nervous system doesn't know successful trial
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.920]   versus failure trial, right?
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.020]   I've tried many times to learn other languages
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.660]   and I'm, you know, modestly terrible at Spanish,
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.940]   but if I were to try and get better,
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.840]   my nervous system doesn't know when I'm failing.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.680]   It has no idea.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.860]   What it knows is the release of certain neuromodulators,
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.740]   namely adrenaline and norepinephrine
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.580]   and a few others as well,
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.060]   that are associated with the underlying agitation
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.740]   of like, oh, I'm failing at this.
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.020]   I'm not able to remember that Spanish class
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.820]   'cause I didn't attend in high school
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.260]   and this is really difficult.
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.560]   And that agitation, the frustration is the stimulus.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.000]   But when we say frustration, it's the neurochemicals
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.820]   that when they bathe the surrounding neurons,
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:05.760]   those neurons go, oh, something needs to change
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.620]   for next time.
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.740]   And lo and behold,
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.140]   the stimulus for neuroplasticity has occurred.
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.580]   But the actual rewiring of the neurons,
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:16.780]   either the improvement or the reduction
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.580]   in the strength of synapses, of connections between neurons,
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.900]   and in rare instances,
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.980]   the addition of new neurons for neuroplasticity occurs,
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:28.460]   yes, when we sleep in states of deep rest
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.220]   or non-sleep deep rest,
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.520]   although there's less data to support that,
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.100]   but the actual rewiring occurs away from the stimulus.
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.340]   So there's really two important principles here.
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:41.500]   One is that agitation and stress
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.320]   and the neurochemicals that underlie agitation and stress,
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.500]   that is the stimulus for learning.
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.340]   And goodness, do I wish they had taught me that in school.
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.180]   I mean, they taught me all sorts of things in school,
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:54.160]   but they didn't teach me that.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.900]   They didn't teach me the physiological side.
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.820]   Lord knows I would have done better in life
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.300]   if I had a couple of those tools.
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.120]   Instead they told me, look, you know,
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.940]   if you drive drunk, you could die.
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.860]   That was good information.
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.340]   But they didn't tell us about all the other stuff.
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.820]   So I wish they told us about the stimulus and rest thing,
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.260]   and somehow they had permission to talk about the rest.
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.820]   All right, what's my take on hallucinogens?
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:17.420]   Goodness gracious.
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:22.420]   My take on hallucinogens is I've taken 'em, clearly.
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:28.860]   Well, here's the real story on hallucinogens.
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:33.300]   First of all, I'm very open about most everything I've done,
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.740]   you know, trying to keep context appropriate,
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:39.620]   but I had the unfortunate experience
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:43.100]   of taking LSD and psilocybin when I was all too young,
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.940]   and those were bad experiences.
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.440]   Some of them were bad in the moment.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.580]   Some of them were bad after the moment.
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.080]   It is something I do not recommend,
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.380]   and I'm not saying that to be politically correct.
[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.260]   I'm not saying that because it's true.
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.760]   The reality is that being a child, an adolescent,
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.940]   or a teenager is a psychedelic experience,
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.860]   and your brain is still wiring up
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.460]   in all sorts of interesting ways,
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.420]   and everything seems chaotic,
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:10.780]   and even if you're one of those rare kids
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:15.080]   that seems to have everything rowed up appropriately,
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.440]   you don't want to throw massive amounts
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.500]   of neuromodulators in there haphazardly
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.180]   and start tampering with the wiring.
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.660]   That's my deep belief, okay?
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.700]   That's my deep belief.
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:32.300]   However, it does appear that at least for adults
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:36.900]   who are not suffering from particular psychiatric challenges
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.020]   namely forms of psychosis, right, this is real.
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.660]   I mean, one in 100 people
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.420]   experiences schizophrenic symptoms, et cetera.
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.660]   It's a very high number if you think about it.
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.460]   Certain forms of bipolar depression,
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.380]   that the clinical trials on psychedelics,
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.180]   and here I'm assuming when you say hallucinogens,
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.480]   you're referring to psychedelics,
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.520]   are very, very compelling.
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.140]   The psychiatric community is now being forced
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.580]   to look at these data because the data are very compelling.
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.020]   What do we know about these data?
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.900]   And yes, I've participated in two such clinical trials,
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.980]   one on high-dose psilocybin,
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:14.420]   high-dose meaning more than two grams taken twice.
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.420]   By the way, this is with the support
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.980]   of medically trained therapists,
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:24.600]   and the use of psychedelics such as psilocybin,
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.700]   mostly psilocybin, not so much LSD.
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.900]   Do you know why most of the trials
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.580]   are on psilocybin and not LSD?
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.080]   I do, but I'm curious if, you know, it's not to,
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.780]   what's that?
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.740]   LSD's too long, that's right.
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.500]   That people need to go home.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.340]   People need to go home, the technicians need to,
[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.680]   and LSD is a long ride.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.380]   It's a long ride.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:50.580]   So the thing about psilocybin is that the,
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.100]   you know, the sort of journey, the trip is,
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.300]   you know, somewhere on the order of anywhere from,
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.820]   you know, three to seven hours,
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.340]   which can fit into a reasonable workday
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.940]   for a technician, clinician,
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:04.320]   and LSD can be many, many hours longer.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.500]   The kind of Mount Everest of psychedelics,
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.700]   which is under investigation by a colleague of mine
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.860]   at Stanford School of Medicine, Nolan Williams,
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:16.940]   is Ibogaine, Iboga, which is 22 hours long.
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.220]   It has cardiac effects.
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.380]   This is not something to get cavalier with.
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.820]   This is something only to be done in a clinical context
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.180]   with medical experts there.
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.860]   And Iboga is very interesting.
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:28.700]   From what I'm told,
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.980]   I have not participated in an Iboga trial.
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:35.140]   Iboga allows for or induces a state
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:39.740]   in which you do not hallucinate at all with eyes open,
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.140]   but the moment you go eyes closed,
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.820]   you get a high-resolution,
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:48.820]   accurate picture of prior events in your life,
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.180]   but you have agency,
[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.220]   you have volition inside of those pictures,
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.940]   and you're able to change your behavior
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:00.420]   and re-sculpt your relationship to those experiences.
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.260]   Like, wow.
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.740]   And the state of Kentucky in California recently,
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.620]   excuse me, the state of Kentucky in the United States,
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.060]   thank goodness Kentucky isn't inside of California,
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:10.560]   that would be civil war.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:15.300]   The state of Kentucky recently took
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:20.300]   the $40 million settlement from the opioid thing, right?
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.460]   You've all heard about that, the opioid crisis,
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.740]   and applied that money to Iboga trials.
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.780]   So this stuff is happening.
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.660]   This stuff is really happening now in the US.
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.180]   In any event, psilocybin,
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:37.700]   these two sessions, medically supported two sessions,
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.780]   has been shown to be pretty effective
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.580]   in the treatment of major depression.
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:44.860]   Not completely effective.
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.900]   Sometimes there's adverse outcomes,
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.460]   but far more effective than the other
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:53.340]   pharmaceutical treatments that it's been compared to,
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:54.180]   so that's interesting.
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.860]   And psilocybin is serotonin.
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:58.540]   If you look at the structure of psilocybin,
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.460]   it looks like serotonin.
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:03.620]   So what we're talking about is a massive dose of serotonin,
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:07.060]   and psilocybin appears to bind near-selectively
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:08.720]   to a particular serotonin receptor,
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.940]   and the outcome seems to be enhanced
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:15.340]   or more broad connectivity between brain areas
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.300]   that normally are not communicating with one another.
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.020]   Probably not the growth of new connections,
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:26.020]   but the, let's say, the unveiling of the ability
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.340]   for certain brain areas to communicate with one another,
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:30.460]   whereas they couldn't prior.
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:34.740]   Different ways of thinking about the same problems,
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.020]   which is logically sound
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.940]   if you think about ways to deal with depression.
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.180]   Depression is characterized by a number of things,
[00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.220]   of course, but one of the hallmark features of depression,
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.460]   in addition to sleep challenges,
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:48.620]   is a lack of positive anticipation of the future,
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:53.220]   and it does seem that these macro-dose psilocybin trials
[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.180]   are helpful for that.
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.980]   Turns out that the micro-dosing of psilocybin
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.980]   has not been shown to be terribly effective,
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.260]   which is not to say it isn't,
[00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.540]   but the trials don't support that,
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:06.060]   although there aren't many trials of that yet.
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.340]   So it appears, you know, if you had to pick
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:11.620]   between micro- and macro-dosing, go macro.
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.420]   But be careful.
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.960]   Go, be careful, and set-in setting is important.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.540]   Safety is important, and certainly not for children.
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.740]   And as long as, or adolescents or teenagers.
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.460]   I really, again, want to reemphasize that.
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.620]   The other thing is,
[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.660]   as long as we're talking about psychedelics and hallucinogens
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.180]   we should probably just touch on MDMA for a moment.
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:36.780]   First of all, MDMA ecstasy has a number of challenges
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.900]   or potential problems that need to be highlighted.
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.260]   First of all, contaminants.
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.420]   You know, we have a fentanyl crisis in the U.S.,
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:46.100]   so contaminants, so purity is essential.
[00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.700]   Second of all, it is methylenedioxymethamphetamine.
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.360]   And the methamphetamine part
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.060]   often gets people thinking like, whoa.
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.600]   It seems, however, that the inclusion
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.480]   of the methylenedioxy component
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.540]   increases serotonin dramatically,
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:06.200]   and it is the increase in serotonin, perhaps,
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.000]   or at least it's now thought,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.800]   in addition to the increase in dopamine
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.960]   caused by the methamphetamine component
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.480]   combined that provides some sort of neuroprotective effect.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:20.880]   The early reports that MDMA ecstasy is neurotoxic,
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.420]   quote unquote, puts holes in your brain,
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:28.360]   was flawed, and indeed that paper was retracted.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.100]   The researchers did that study in earnest,
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.380]   but then later discovered that when they reached
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.160]   for the MDMA on the shelf
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.560]   they actually grabbed the methamphetamine.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.760]   But the news agencies didn't report that retraction.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.540]   Now, our best evidence that MDMA,
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:49.080]   taken in the appropriate clinically supported context,
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.880]   can act as an empathogen,
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.920]   can help people develop empathy for themselves,
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.660]   and help relieve trauma,
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:57.960]   and indeed the clinical trials show that
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.600]   at the proper dosing and the proper frequency
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.880]   with the proper support,
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:05.880]   there's up to 60% and as high as 67% remission of PTSD.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.360]   Remarkable.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.040]   With support, okay, not just taking Molly
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.840]   and like dancing in the desert.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.960]   We're talking about, we're talking about in the eye mask,
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.120]   we're talking about going inward,
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.720]   we're talking about relaying your experience,
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.880]   we're talking about talking about the challenging experience
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.680]   or experiences with someone who's qualified
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.520]   to help you deal with all of that, et cetera,
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.800]   and someone to drive you home
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.660]   'cause you feel like a puddle afterwards.
[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:29.580]   Talking about all of that.
[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:32.160]   We're not talking about eye gazing with your partner,
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.200]   telling them how much you love them.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.680]   You're talking about empathy for self, love for self,
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.700]   which is a concept that frankly I've often struggled with.
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:39.540]   I've thought, you know, people would say
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:40.460]   you gotta love yourself.
[00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.300]   I'm like, what is that?
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.140]   Like what is that?
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.860]   I love my bulldog, I love my friends, I love cuttlefish,
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.100]   but like what is that?
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:50.140]   And I think through the use of MDMA, you can,
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:51.780]   there seems to be this ability
[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.340]   to develop in pathogenic states to yourself,
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.780]   but of course the reason for the clinical trials
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.420]   insisting that people stay in the eye mask
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:28:59.620]   and communicate their experience,
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.300]   maybe popping out of it every once in a while
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.820]   and talking with somebody in a trusted person
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.060]   in a way that can be helpful
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:07.620]   towards dealing with the trauma
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:10.680]   is that the problem with having that much serotonin
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.900]   and that much dopamine in your system
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:16.740]   is that you can become empathic toward anything.
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.700]   So we've all known people that take MDMA,
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.260]   listen to a particular soundtrack,
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.620]   and they're like, I'm gonna become a musician.
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.180]   I love music.
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.540]   And again, I'm not recommending anyone do MDMA,
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:29.500]   but in recent years,
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.820]   I've really changed my stance on psychedelics.
[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.080]   Five years ago, 10 years ago,
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.100]   I never would have had this discussion,
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.580]   certainly not with a microphone in front of my face,
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.380]   anything being recorded,
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.980]   would have worried about losing my job
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.180]   at Stanford or elsewhere.
[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:47.720]   But we now have many laboratories at Stanford and elsewhere
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.980]   that are doing work that is federally funded
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:51.940]   on these compounds.
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.360]   And if you think about these compounds,
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.780]   while they have been used recreationally,
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:59.340]   are simply ways to adjust levels of neuromodulators
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:01.140]   in the brain, serotonin, dopamine, et cetera.
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.860]   That's really all they are,
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:04.220]   although they do it very potently
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:07.000]   and therefore caution needs to be applied.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.300]   And as long as we're on that topic,
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.500]   I should mention that ketamine,
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.620]   everyone's excited about ketamine.
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.820]   When I was growing up,
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:17.940]   I was taught that there's a compound
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:19.620]   that's really dangerous.
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:23.140]   It's called PCP, vancyclidine.
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.180]   They are the same compound.
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.020]   They don't tell you this.
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.820]   Ketamine and PCP, same thing.
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:29.860]   And I learned about PCP as the compound
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.140]   that was gonna make criminals like punch light poles
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:33.660]   and beat up 12 cops.
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.300]   And yeah, I watched too much "Chips" when I was growing up.
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:37.700]   For those of you old enough to remember,
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:38.580]   it was like "Punch" and "John."
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.100]   They were on the motorcycles with the shorts.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:40.940]   My sister watched it too,
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:42.860]   but for completely different reasons.
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:47.460]   So PCP was like this demonized drug,
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.380]   but ketamine and all this stuff about ketamine
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.140]   is now legal in the US.
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:53.580]   I don't know its status here in Sydney,
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.620]   so I'll see if I get arrested on the way out.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:59.500]   But, you know, ketamine is potentially addictive.
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.400]   People talk about the K-hole, et cetera.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.640]   Weird name, by the way.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.200]   The whole business with ketamine is, again,
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:10.320]   it's a potent MDMA, N-methyl-D-aspartate blocker,
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.740]   which blocks neuroplasticity in the short term,
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.040]   expands it in the long term.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.920]   So the way to think about these compounds, these drugs,
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.720]   is by way of their mechanism.
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.900]   And so it should be no surprise
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.700]   that they're able to induce neuroplasticity,
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.280]   but the goal is not plasticity.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:27.640]   This is very, very important.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.120]   The goal is not plasticity.
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.460]   The goal is plasticity directed
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:34.340]   toward a particular positive outcome.
[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:35.660]   Anytime you have plasticity,
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.980]   you have the potential for maladaptive plasticity as well.
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.180]   And so that's an additional cautionary note.
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.460]   As I often say on the podcast,
[00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:44.940]   I don't say that just to protect me,
[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:46.200]   although I am a little bit worried now
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.460]   about what I just said over the last five minutes.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.420]   I say that to protect you.
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:53.140]   Next question before I get myself in trouble.
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:53.980]   What about what?
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.740]   DMT.
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.180]   Yeah, dimethyltryptamine.
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:04.940]   Yeah, it leads to lower thresholds for impulsivity,
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:07.340]   like screaming out, "What about DMT?"
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:08.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.500]   Just kidding.
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:10.760]   I don't, sorry.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:15.100]   So I'm just joking.
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:15.940]   I'm just joking.
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:17.980]   You seem like you could take it, so I got, yeah.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:21.380]   So I've never done DMT,
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.340]   but I've heard it's a high-speed freight train
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:26.060]   into your consciousness,
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:28.220]   behind the circuit board and back again.
[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:33.860]   So there are a few great studies on DMT in ayahuasca,
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:35.140]   just as long as we're expanding
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.380]   into the full trip down to the jungle.
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:41.500]   And the data are interesting.
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:45.900]   It's harder to know what's going on
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:49.040]   in these very short trip,
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:54.040]   massive neuromodulator release type drug scenarios.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.320]   Robin Cardart-Harris
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.920]   at the University of California, San Francisco
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:03.120]   is somebody who's looking at DMT more extensively,
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.080]   and I don't want to avoid giving you an answer,
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.480]   but I do want to avoid giving you a wrong answer
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.600]   that's not informed.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.840]   One thing I'll say, and this is just,
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.920]   rarely do I plug anything related to the podcast,
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:16.400]   but we are actually providing some support
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.080]   to Robin and others' laboratory
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.740]   for the study of things like DMT.
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.360]   One of the things that we do at the podcast,
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.880]   and this is not a request for anything,
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.200]   we do take a significant portion of the proceeds
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.680]   from our premium channel,
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.480]   and we fund human studies of exciting things like DMT.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.820]   We're supporting Robin's lab this coming year.
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.780]   I've pooled together some other donors
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:36.800]   to provide support for all human studies,
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:37.920]   no animal studies.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.580]   And the goal is really to fill in important blanks,
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:44.180]   like the study of DMT, as well as other things.
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:47.660]   We're currently funding the eating disorders laboratory
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:48.820]   at Columbia University.
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:52.400]   Eating disorders, by the way, anorexia nervosa in particular,
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.800]   the most deadly of all psychiatric disorders,
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.920]   a really tragic challenge there.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.640]   So I just mentioned that.
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:03.040]   Getting funding for science on really
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:07.600]   kind of next level stuff is hard
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.920]   for reasons that would take up the whole night.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.580]   So that's one thing that I'm really trying to do
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:12.420]   in the next few years.
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:13.600]   And again, this is not a request,
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.380]   but to pool together donors
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.600]   and get them to give money to laboratories
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.360]   to do the kind of stuff that's gonna feed back
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.320]   to the general public very quickly,
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.880]   because I think we're all getting a little tired
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:26.440]   of the like, okay, mouse study, which are great,
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.640]   but in 10 years, this might lead to a blank for Alzheimer's
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.680]   or blank for autism.
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:33.040]   I think we're all getting a little tired of that narrative.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.040]   So we're trying to accelerate the process.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.000]   Okay, yeah, thank you.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.700]   And it's not a sole effort.
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:41.860]   It's just, I do happen to know a lot about the way
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:45.140]   that funding mechanisms can get a little bit clogged.
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:48.440]   And so just trying to clear some of those clogs.
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.340]   The brain and gut axis, is this a thing?
[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.820]   It is most definitely a thing.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.220]   So I think one of the more exciting areas
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:57.300]   is the so-called gut-brain axis.
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:59.580]   We all now hear about the gut microbiome.
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.340]   I must say, down here,
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:04.220]   y'all are really evolved in this dimension.
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:07.780]   The other day I noticed, probably from jet lag and travel,
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:10.060]   and I don't know, maybe I swam in some stuff
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:11.100]   that had too much chlorine or something.
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:13.500]   I was getting like some little like skin thing on my face.
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:14.920]   I was like, all right, I'll go get
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.620]   some triple antibiotic ointment like I do back home,
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.100]   clean it up, 'cause I forgot mine.
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:24.000]   So I go to the pharmacy here, what you call the chemist.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   I go to the pharmacy, and the guy behind the counter
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.420]   says, well, first of all,
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:34.500]   you can't get triple antibiotic ointment here.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:35.660]   You need a prescription.
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:37.580]   I'm like, all right, well, this is gonna get tricky now.
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:39.140]   I gotta forge a prescription.
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:42.760]   And I'm just kidding, don't do that, don't do that.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:46.880]   And he says, but you know, have you considered
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.580]   whether or not maybe your skin microbiome
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.340]   is struggling because of the lack of sleep,
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:52.840]   the jet lag, and maybe you were exposed
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:53.860]   to some chlorine or something.
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:57.620]   I thought, you know, that's a logical way to think about it.
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.620]   'Cause we just did an episode on oral health
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:00.860]   where I'm telling everybody, hey, like,
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:04.340]   avoid these like high alcohol astringent mouthwashes
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:05.620]   that kill your oral microbiome,
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.420]   'cause all the dentists and periodontists are telling me,
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:08.620]   yeah, they'll make your breath fresh,
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.420]   but actually it's wrecking your gut microbiome
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.740]   and it's bad for, but, so I take the probiotic.
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.340]   You guys have amazing probiotics here.
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.940]   And in a day, boom, it's done.
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:19.440]   Now, I didn't do a controlled clinical trial.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.220]   I don't know whether or not that was really what did it,
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.500]   but it's an interesting idea.
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.340]   This, we know, for instance,
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.320]   that we have a distinct microbiome niches,
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.040]   different bacteria that live in our nasal passages,
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:34.300]   on the surface of our eyes, on the surface of our skin,
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:37.300]   in the urethra, in essentially every orifice,
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:40.380]   mucous membrane, but everywhere in and around our body,
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.900]   and that these little microbiota are,
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:47.500]   provided they are supported, they do many things,
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.680]   but among them, the gut microbiome,
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.820]   which of course starts in the mouth,
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:55.380]   as the oral health episode describes,
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.480]   with a lot of protocols as well,
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:01.380]   the gut microbiome, when it's well-supported,
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:04.820]   creates certain fatty acids that are the precursors
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:06.360]   or catalysts for the production
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.800]   of certain neurotransmitters in the brain.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:13.800]   And it is now oh so clear that enhancing the diversity
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:19.200]   of flora of microbiota in the gut and mouth
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:24.680]   is great for the nervous system.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:28.800]   So much so that some of the studies on relief
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.080]   from certain neuropsychiatric conditions
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.720]   are being achieved through, and I know it's not pleasant,
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.520]   but microbiota transfer between individuals,
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.280]   so-called fecal transplants,
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.080]   which always makes me a little bit uncomfortable
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.920]   to think about, never had one,
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.360]   but it's pretty interesting,
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.160]   despite the discomfort of thinking about that process,
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:51.120]   at least for me, the whole business
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.760]   of taking the gut microbiota from one individual
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.200]   that's not suffering from something
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.880]   and putting it into another individual
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.700]   and seeing relief from certain symptoms
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:02.480]   of given conditions is really compelling.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.680]   So I think that we should all be thinking
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.600]   about ways to support our gut-brain axis.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.840]   It's very clear that the best low-cost,
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.360]   no-supplement way to do that is going to be
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:18.600]   to consume one to four servings of some fermented food.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:19.800]   No, beer doesn't count.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.640]   Low-sugar fermented foods, I suppose beer does count,
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.440]   but it comes with some other issues,
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:30.080]   such as kimchi or sauerkrauts or kefirs.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.580]   Every culture seems to have its own probiotic,
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.800]   prebiotic foods, and that's gonna be the best way.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.580]   And it's clear that it has immense benefit.
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:41.720]   And then when you don't have access to those foods,
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.480]   doing things like taking a pill probiotic now and again
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.600]   is probably not a bad idea if you're traveling
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.960]   or you're sleep-deprived.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.080]   The challenge with that sort of thing
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:55.400]   is that it's a generalized effect
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.800]   of supporting multiple systems in the brain and body,
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:01.520]   so it's going to be a long time, maybe never,
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:05.600]   before you see a really nice, clean study
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:07.400]   that says that, okay, increasing the amount
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.420]   of lactobacillus in the gut by taking X number
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:13.340]   of milligrams of lactobacillus improves your cognition.
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.660]   You're not gonna find that study.
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:15.500]   Why?
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:18.700]   Because in science, it's important, and in health,
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.780]   to distinguish between moderating effects
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:22.140]   and mediating effects.
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:25.820]   Lots of things can moderate a given feature
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.220]   of your brain or health.
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:29.300]   So, for instance, if, God forbid,
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:30.780]   a fire alarm went off tonight,
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:34.420]   it would moderate our tension, or excuse me, modulate,
[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:36.260]   modulate, Kentucky's in California,
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:40.400]   now I'm saying moderate, modulate your attention,
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.840]   but it doesn't mediate attention.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.240]   On a normal basis, the fire alarm isn't involved
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.800]   in your attention, whereas certain other things
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.600]   mediate those mechanisms of attention.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.800]   So, when you improve sleep, you're going to see
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.500]   positive effects on any number of things.
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.000]   When you sleep-deprive people, you're gonna see
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.520]   deficits in any number of things.
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.740]   These are not direct effects, these are indirect effects,
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:01.960]   likewise with the microbiome.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.920]   So, I think gut microbiome sits in the various,
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.480]   what I call pillars of mental health,
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.600]   physical health, and performance.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:08.720]   These are the things that we should try
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.880]   and tend to on a regular basis to give buoyancy
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.320]   to our mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.080]   But I wouldn't get too caught up in wondering
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:20.480]   which exact microbiota are important.
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.520]   I think diversity of the microbiome is key.
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.440]   If you're taking antibiotics, you wanna do something
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.120]   to counter that through pill probiotics, et cetera.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.280]   And certainly, antibiotics aren't bad,
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.760]   but the overuse of antibiotics certainly can be,
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:36.000]   and I'm good on you for having chemists
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.720]   that know better than to just hand me
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.720]   a bottle of triple antibiotic ointment.
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:42.880]   Quality of sleep, going to bed early
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.920]   compared to sleeping late but still for eight hours.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:49.680]   Depends, depends on whether or not your chronotype,
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.640]   which for a long time I did not think was real,
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.240]   but based on newer data, it's absolutely clear or real,
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.480]   whether or not you feel best going to bed early,
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.700]   waking up early, or going to bed at a more typical time
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:03.000]   of 10 p.m. to say, wake up, or 11 p.m.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.400]   and waking up at 7 a.m.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.200]   I see that, you know, for any folks leaving there,
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.840]   though, I'd like early to bed, right?
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.940]   I get it, I'm not offended, it's fine.
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:14.080]   I get it, it would not be the first time that people,
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.360]   I always say, if nothing else,
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.120]   the podcast will cure insomnia
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.740]   because the episodes are very, very long.
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:21.560]   You know, for some people, they just feel
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:24.120]   spectacularly better going to sleep early
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:27.560]   and waking up early, spectacularly better.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:28.600]   I'm one such person.
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.040]   Other people feel much better staying up late,
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.540]   waking up late.
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.960]   The total duration of sleep is important.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.120]   The regularity of sleep, it turns out,
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.920]   is becoming a very important variable,
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.460]   or it has always been an important variable,
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:44.200]   but the data are pointing to the fact that
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.440]   if you are somebody who feels best going to sleep
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:49.960]   around 11 p.m. and waking up at 7 a.m.,
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:53.660]   trying to keep that to bedtime within plus or minus one hour
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:56.760]   any time you can, except on a time,
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.320]   and on a night when there's a lecture at the ICC Theater,
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.840]   is a good idea.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.960]   But in general, five nights out of the week,
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.200]   you wanna go to sleep within plus or minus an hour
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.040]   of the same bedtime.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.960]   That's kind of the general goal.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.800]   And in the Sleep Series with Matt Walker,
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.200]   he talks about the quality, quantity,
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.280]   regularity, and timing, QQRT,
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:18.480]   quantity, quality, regularity, and timing of your sleep
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.800]   being the four key features of your sleep
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.800]   to try and dial in.
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.760]   But of course, life isn't about optimizing everything.
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.680]   It's good to get out and party every once in a while,
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.560]   stay up all night, watch the sunrise,
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.240]   and just live life also.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.120]   So I think sometimes people get the impression
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.320]   because I wear the same shirt all the time
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:37.040]   that I do everything in a hyper-regimented way.
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.760]   But actually, it's quite the opposite.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.380]   I try and do things regularly
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:42.800]   and as consistently as possible
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:45.880]   so that deviations from those protocols
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.360]   don't impact me negatively much at all.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.080]   That's the idea.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.880]   I have ADHD and I'm struggling to focus.
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.980]   What would be the best way to go about regaining my focus?
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:54.820]   Nick.
[00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:56.320]   - Okay, so I think that nowadays,
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:01.320]   many, many people struggle with issues with focus.
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:04.640]   I think we have our do's and our do nots.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.520]   And I'm obviously not a psychiatrist
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:08.400]   and I can't diagnose you, Nick,
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.440]   from a question on a slide.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.000]   But I just wanna start off by saying
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   that there are indeed people who truly struggle with focus
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.840]   to the extent that they have clinically diagnosable ADHD.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:23.000]   And I did two episodes on ADHD and focus,
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.980]   one that was mainly focused on behavioral tools
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:30.320]   and nutrition and to some extent, supplementation.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.620]   And when I put out that episode,
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:35.660]   about half of the comments out there were, how could you?
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:38.260]   You don't respect modern science.
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:41.140]   You have no integrity.
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:44.180]   How could you suggest that people use these tools?
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:45.760]   It's all about prescription drugs.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.280]   And the other half were like, yes,
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.220]   finally, some tools and some acknowledgement
[00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:51.380]   that these things actually matter and can help,
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:54.560]   maybe even in conjunction with pharmaceutical aids.
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.740]   And then we did a second episode,
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.260]   which was all about the prescription drugs
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:00.220]   and it was the exact reverse.
[00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:04.380]   People writing to me in droves saying, thank you so much.
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:06.220]   I've been prescribing these drugs
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:08.420]   or I've been giving these prescription drugs to my child.
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:09.640]   Rather, it's really been helping,
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.480]   but I'm embarrassed to tell everybody
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.540]   because then people demonize me
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:16.220]   and tell me I'm poisoning my kid, that they're on meth.
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.380]   And then the other half saying, how could you?
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:21.560]   The pharmaceutical industry, big pharma is out to get us all.
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:24.700]   I must say that, and I'm happy to be in this role.
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:27.020]   We're not happy, but I'm willing to be in the role of,
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.100]   I try and cover it all and give people options.
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:30.860]   I don't tell people what to do.
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:32.460]   I don't prescribe anything.
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.220]   I profess many, many things.
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:37.180]   And you should do as you decide is best for you,
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:38.180]   but just know what you're doing.
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:40.820]   And here's the deal, that drugs like Adderall,
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.860]   Vyvanse, et cetera, are indeed amphetamines.
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.300]   That's true.
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:48.060]   In the young brain, they can help enhance
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.140]   some of the neuromodulators that allow
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:54.420]   for elevated activity in areas like the prefrontal cortex
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:56.300]   and elsewhere that allow for more focused attention
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.300]   and less impulsivity because the main function
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:00.300]   of the prefrontal cortex, as you may all recall,
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:04.140]   is to say shh to the particular areas of the brain
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:06.380]   that want to move or cause us to move
[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:09.600]   or cause us to blurt things out like DMT or whatever it is.
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:12.660]   And, sorry, I didn't mean to pick on you.
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:13.800]   We'll do DMT together.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.460]   We'll do some MDMA also, and then we'll like,
[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:18.020]   we would like heart medicine.
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:24.740]   So the reality is that there are neurochemical tools
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:30.580]   that can help with ADHD, but there are also behavioral tools
[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:35.160]   and in countries outside of the U.S., namely in China,
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:39.860]   there are extensive efforts to train young people
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:42.340]   to focus for longer periods of time.
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:43.820]   And believe it or not, they're not doing that
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.220]   through any, at least in these experiments,
[00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:47.740]   through any draconian approach.
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:49.540]   They actually have them do what?
[00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:51.420]   They have them focus on visual targets.
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:53.420]   The longer you focus on a visual target,
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:56.140]   we know the longer you bring about the activation
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:58.100]   of certain neural circuits in the brain
[00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.860]   that allow for better focus.
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:02.260]   And while not everything is about vision,
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:05.140]   it is certainly the case based on those studies
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:07.480]   and the data, I've looked at them quite extensively,
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.760]   that even a short period of time of learning
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.980]   to entrain one's focus on a fixation points,
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.380]   this would be the virgin's eye movement,
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:15.200]   this is the cuttlefish ready to eat or mate,
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.100]   not the cuttlefish swimming around looking
[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.860]   for potential predators in panoramic mode,
[00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:21.400]   doing that for a short period of time
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:23.900]   of even a minute or three minutes
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:27.460]   can allow one to bring online the neural circuits
[00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:29.100]   that allow for enhanced focus
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:30.820]   in the subsequent 10 to 20 minutes,
[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:32.940]   which is a pretty reasonable bout of work
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.140]   if you think about it.
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.740]   And here's another important point.
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:40.120]   None of us, none of us, ADHD sufferers or otherwise,
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.700]   should expect ourselves to be in perfect trenches,
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:45.780]   deep trenches of focus all the time.
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:48.960]   That's an unreasonable request for your nervous system.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.820]   You can build up a capacity to focus,
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:53.660]   and of course, we can all focus best
[00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:54.860]   on things that we really enjoy.
[00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:56.940]   In fact, children and adults with ADHD
[00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:59.620]   are known to have tremendous focusing capacity
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:02.100]   if they're focusing on something they really enjoy.
[00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:03.560]   This has been shown over and over again,
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.460]   which means that the capacity to focus is there,
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:07.820]   it's just that the threshold to focus is higher,
[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:10.120]   which means that it's harder to access.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:11.980]   And these visual fixation,
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:12.980]   they're not even experiments.
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.700]   You can literally just place a visual target on the wall,
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:17.500]   you know, one to three feet away,
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:20.340]   force yourself to stare at that visual focus point
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:21.980]   and then move into your work.
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:23.840]   And you'll notice that your mind will flit away
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.740]   from whatever it is you're trying to focus on.
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:27.740]   But with some training,
[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:29.780]   you can build up an enhanced capacity to focus.
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:31.540]   It does require you flip your phone over,
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:33.220]   you turn it off, you leave it in the other room,
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:34.780]   you remove distractions.
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:35.780]   Some people even find,
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:38.420]   children will find if they wear a brimmed hat and a hoodie,
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:40.820]   which basically took me through most of high school.
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:43.900]   For other reasons, if you do that,
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:46.540]   you can create a more narrow tunnel of vision.
[00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:49.380]   This is the reason they put blinders on horses.
[00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:52.660]   So it sounds somewhat medieval,
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:55.780]   it sounds somewhat primitive or crude.
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:58.260]   But once again, what we're really talking about
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:01.460]   is removing the expectation
[00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:03.720]   that focus is like a square wave function
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.300]   where, you know, you sit down,
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.380]   you open your book and boom, you're focused.
[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:08.220]   I mean, you wouldn't expect
[00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:10.580]   that of physical performance, would you?
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:12.620]   There's a warmup, there's some dynamic stretching,
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:16.180]   there's perhaps some just getting your mind in the groove,
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.500]   you know, this sort of thing.
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.580]   Neural circuits are not on/off.
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:22.500]   It's not a square wave function.
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.780]   It takes some time to ease into a mode of focus.
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:27.540]   And so my suggestion, Nick,
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:30.160]   is that you and others that struggle with focus,
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.340]   think about the do-nots,
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:34.700]   the distractions that clearly are intervening
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:36.580]   in our ability to focus nowadays.
[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:38.460]   But also as you think about the things to explore,
[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:40.820]   which may include these pharmaceutical tools,
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:43.260]   of course, prescribed by a licensed physician,
[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:47.380]   but that you consider that perhaps the expectations
[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:51.260]   that you're placing on yourself to focus are too immediate
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:55.240]   and that you should train these up more gradually over time,
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:56.080]   which is not to say
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.940]   that you should settle on having limited focus,
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:01.660]   but that this is a skill that you can develop
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:02.620]   like any other skill,
[00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:04.640]   that your nervous system is capable of plasticity
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:05.620]   throughout the lifespan.
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:07.460]   We absolutely know that.
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:11.440]   And given that I'm presuming,
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.780]   I don't know why I'm presuming that you're a young person,
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:15.240]   but even if you're not,
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:17.660]   that you can increase your ability
[00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:21.260]   to access these narrow trenches of focus,
[00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:23.940]   even for things that don't delight you.
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:27.780]   But I hope you are also doing some things that delight you.
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:29.980]   So I was told that's the final question.
[00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:31.900]   I'm going to take that very seriously.
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:35.460]   And somewhat unfortunately for me,
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:37.220]   'cause I could go all night,
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.780]   I've really enjoyed tonight.
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:41.200]   Thank you very much.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.040]   Thank you.
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:42.860]   [audience applauding]
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:43.700]   Thank you so much.
[00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:50.060]   Just thank you so much.
[00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:53.540]   Thank you.
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:56.100]   Truly thank you.
[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:58.420]   I really appreciate this opportunity
[00:49:58.420 --> 00:49:59.700]   to connect with you all.
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:00.580]   Thanks for coming out.
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:02.440]   The fact that people come out to listen
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:06.360]   to a bunch of science and health discussion
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:08.400]   is greatly appreciated.
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.760]   All the tools, all the protocols,
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.840]   all the mechanisms, all the information,
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.480]   while some of it, a very, very small fraction of it
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:17.040]   was developed or discovered in my laboratory.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:19.480]   Virtually everything that I cover on the podcast
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:20.360]   and I've talked about tonight
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:22.760]   are the great discoveries of other people
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:23.720]   who deserve the credit.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:27.560]   And I've tried to give credit where credit is due.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.240]   The most important thing to me, of course,
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:33.200]   is that as you each learn and try these different tools
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.520]   and protocols as you see fit for you,
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.400]   that it would be wonderful
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:39.000]   if you'd pass them on to other people.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.540]   Please, please, please remove my name from that passage.
[00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:44.020]   This is not about me or the podcast.
[00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:47.280]   It's really about the one thing we know
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.180]   to certainly be true about our species
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:51.120]   is that we can communicate information
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.300]   to one another, hand off tools,
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.700]   and that in the case where these tools
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:57.680]   can help relieve suffering, wonderful.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:59.360]   In the case where these tools can help improve
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:01.480]   mental health, physical health, and performance,
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:05.440]   we need to, I believe, and should do that for one another.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:07.840]   And last, but certainly not least,
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.580]   thank you for your interest in science.
[00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:12.740]   (audience applauding)
[00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:15.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:17.900]   (upbeat music)
