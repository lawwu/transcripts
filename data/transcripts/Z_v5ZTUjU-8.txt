[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.840]   that chapter which we read at the beginning, the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, chapter
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:17.200]   24, looking particularly at verses 24 to 27.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:24.440]   Verses 24 to 27 in the 24th chapter of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.880]   And after a certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess,
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.000]   he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.160]   And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled and answered,
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.200]   "Go thy way for this time.
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.760]   When I have a convenient season, I will call for thee."
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.360]   He hoped also that money should have been given him by Paul that he might lose him.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.480]   Wherefore he sent for him the Afner and communed with him.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:08.400]   But after two years, Pontius Festus came into Felix's room, and Felix, willing to show
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.720]   the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.600]   Now here we are looking at one of the great dramatic incidents recorded in the Book of
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.960]   the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.120]   I suppose that is the peculiar feature and the most characteristic feature of this particular
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:40.440]   book, that it abounds in these human situations, in these dramatic incidents, which are recorded
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.120]   here in such a marvelous and extraordinary manner by the writer Luke.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:55.640]   It is an incident, like all these incidents, which is full of interest and full of matter
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.840]   which is most urgent for our consideration.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.480]   Now it seems to me that the best way to approach this particular incident is first of all to
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.800]   just look at the people, the figures concerned.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.160]   Felix, his wife Drusilla, and the Apostle Paul.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.360]   We cannot fully understand what happened on this occasion and its real significance unless
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:29.120]   we are aware of certain things about the three figures, and especially Felix and Drusilla.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:40.960]   Felix was a man who, like his brother, whose name was Pallas, had been born a slave.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:49.280]   But he had succeeded with his brother in becoming a free man of the Roman Empire.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.360]   They were obviously young men of real ability and added to that ambition.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.360]   And though they thus had been born in a condition of slavery, they had achieved freedom.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:09.520]   Not only that, Pallas, the brother of Felix, had succeeded in becoming a favorite of the
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.720]   Roman Emperor.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.320]   And as a result of his becoming a favorite of the Roman Emperor, he had secured a post
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.360]   for his brother.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.240]   And so this man Felix, who had been born as a slave, finds himself as the governor of
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.240]   Palestine under the Emperor from Rome.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.960]   And being put into this exalted position, he began to think and to feel that he could
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.120]   do almost anything that he might choose to do.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.040]   We have a character sketch of this man written by the historian Tacitus.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:54.160]   He describes him in this striking and pregnant phrase, "With all cruelty and lust, he exercised
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.360]   the power of a king with the spirit of a slave."
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.880]   What a terrible description to give of a man.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.040]   Well there he was.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.000]   His character was this.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.720]   He was a clever man, as I have said.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.440]   He was unscrupulous.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.800]   And as we see from this incident, he was avaricious, fond of money.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.840]   He was voluptuous and licentious.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.920]   And he was most unjust.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:35.960]   The Apostle Paul, you remember, in his defense, put a case that was quite unanswerable.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.800]   These charges that had been brought against him were pure invention, had no basis or substance
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.220]   in fact whatsoever.
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.520]   And these men who judged him had been quite unable to bring anything to substantiate their
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.360]   charge and their case.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.960]   In spite of the fact that Felix knew that and should have discharged the prisoner immediately,
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.240]   he did not do so.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.160]   He continued to keep him in prison because of these personal and unworthy motives that
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.080]   moved him and animated him.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.520]   He was an utterly unjust and unscrupulous man.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.880]   Well now that's Felix.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.880]   What about Drusilla?
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.320]   Well Drusilla, as we are told, was a Jewess.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.560]   And listen to her pedigree.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:28.920]   She was the daughter of Herod Agrippa I and the sister of Herod Agrippa II.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.360]   In other words, her father was the man who had murdered the Apostle James.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:41.440]   Her great uncle was the man who had likewise murdered John the Baptist.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.720]   And her great grandfather was the man who at the time of the birth of the Lord Jesus
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.800]   Christ had been guilty of murdering all those babes and innocents in the whole neighborhood
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.800]   of Bethlehem.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.640]   That is her story, except that I have to add this.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:07.600]   Though she was a Jewess, she had married a pagan king.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.880]   But eventually, circumstances brought her and Felix together.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.160]   They met.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.960]   And as the phrase goes, they fell in love with one another.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.320]   What it means, of course, is that they both felt a licentious desire for one another.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.760]   They were both married.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:39.040]   But Felix, voluptuous and sensuous as he was, as I've described him, he enticed Drusilla
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:46.320]   to leave her husband so that at this moment they were living together in a state of adultery.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.240]   Now it's very important, you see, that we should know that.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.120]   These are the people with whom we are dealing.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.760]   And here they are in a position of authority and of power.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.960]   And suddenly one afternoon they both feel it would be rather a good and an interesting
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:06.840]   thing to call the prisoner Paul, who was in their charge and in their care, and just listen
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.200]   to him, hear what he's got to say about himself and about this Christian faith.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.480]   So Paul is produced.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.400]   And there we see him confronting these two people, Felix and Drusilla.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:23.000]   Now I mustn't and I need not tonight to take any of your time in describing the character
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.720]   of the great apostle.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.720]   You're familiar with that.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.240]   But there is one thing in particular that stands out on this particular occasion, and
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.960]   that is his extraordinary courage.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.480]   Did you notice the way that he spoke to them?
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:47.560]   Indeed, there is almost an amusing side to this incident, because at the beginning Felix
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:55.480]   and Drusilla seem to be in charge and the apostle is the prisoner in chains.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.000]   And you would expect him to be doing the trembling, wouldn't you?
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   They are free.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   He is a prisoner.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.760]   They have got everything that can be desired.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.920]   He is languishing in a prison.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.680]   So I say, naturally you would expect that the apostle would be trembling in fear, and
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.440]   especially as he comes before them again, wondering what they are going to do with him,
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.280]   what they are going to decide with respect to his future.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:25.360]   But you notice that the position is very soon something very different from that which I
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.960]   have imagined.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:35.320]   The only trembling that I read about here is the trembling which afflicted Felix as
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:42.600]   the little apostle, in all the grandeur and the magnificence of his great faith, his knowledge
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:48.360]   of the Lord and his master mind, speaks to them and addresses them.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:53.800]   And there you seem to be the judges, prisoners as it were, trembling in the dark.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.960]   Well, now that is the scene, one of the great and one of the most dramatic incidents which
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.960]   is to be found anywhere in the Bible.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:06.320]   The persons, therefore, are of great interest to us, but it is to other aspects that I am
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.640]   anxious to direct your attention this evening.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:15.880]   Let us look at this to discover the apostle's method, how he deals with such a situation,
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.880]   how he evangelizes.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.240]   Let us also notice the content of the Christian gospel, for it is put before us here very
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.920]   plainly.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:31.880]   And let us end by looking at the appalling picture which we are given here of unbelief,
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:42.120]   the real character of unbelief, the essential truth about every person who is not a Christian.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.160]   Those are the things that are taught us here by this incident, and I am calling attention
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:52.000]   to them, because, as I say, I believe these things are more urgently needed today than
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.400]   perhaps ever before.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:00.480]   These things, unfortunately, are needed by the Christian church herself, and they are
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:08.040]   also needed by all who ever listen to the gospel, or who, like Felix and Drusilla, affect
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.400]   any interest in it and what it has to say.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:19.920]   There is great confusion today as to what the church is, as to what the gospel is, as
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.520]   to how the gospel should be presented, as to how it should be listened to, as to what
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.240]   should be done with respect to it.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.840]   Here is the answer.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:36.440]   Here is the authority, the called apostle of Jesus Christ, the man who was arrested
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:42.000]   in a career of persecution and turned into the apostle to the Gentiles, the man who brought
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.520]   Christianity first to the continent of Europe, the mighty apostle who has written these great
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.440]   epistles which we have in our New Testament canon.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.200]   Here is our authority.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.200]   Let us listen.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:58.560]   Let us discover what he has got to say on these momentous questions.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:04.000]   Let me encourage you to do so for this reason, that if you read the history of the past,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.440]   the history of the church in the past particularly, you will find that in every period of reformation
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:16.240]   and of revival, the church has always returned to this pattern.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:23.640]   I see another man, a pale shadow of this mighty apostle, but a man who reminds me of him.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:28.600]   I see a man called Martin Luther standing in similar circumstances and doing exactly
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.240]   the same thing.
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.480]   John Calvin, John Knox.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:38.680]   Don't you think of John Knox as you read this incident and the way in which he could terrorize
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.760]   Mary Queen of Scots?
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:48.400]   He was more afraid of his prayers than she was of legions of soldiers.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.600]   It is the same thing always, in every great period of reformation and of revival.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.720]   Very well then, let us look at these things.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.880]   First of all, let us look at this.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:03.360]   How I say the gospel is to be preached and presented and as to how it is to be listened
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.360]   to.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:09.400]   Notice, first of all, the negatives.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.640]   Felix and Drusilla send for Paul and here he is standing before them.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.640]   What happens?
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:21.000]   Well, may I indicate to you that they did not have a discussion.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.440]   That is the great thing today, isn't it?
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:29.160]   The religious department of the BBC does not preach on Sunday nights, so it has a discussion.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.160]   This is the thing.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.160]   Let us have a discussion.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.320]   Oh, they say the modern man, he will not listen to preaching, but he is always ready to have
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.320]   a discussion.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.680]   He has a certain interest in these things and he is interested in them intellectually
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:41.680]   and as a point of view.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.000]   Well, now, let us meet with him and let us have a friendly chat.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.360]   Let us hear what he has got to say and try to answer his criticisms and, of course, go
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.080]   as far as we can to meet him.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.960]   Let us have a wonderful discussion.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:56.160]   We have been told now for years that if only we did this instead of preaching dogmatically,
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.280]   the people would be won to the Christian church.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.880]   But the statistics are telling us that they are going further and further away from the
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.880]   church.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.040]   Of course they are.
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:10.000]   The Christian gospel is not to be discussed.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.200]   The gospel starts with this principle, that the natural man receiveth not the things of
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.120]   the Spirit of God, for there are foolishness unto him.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.040]   Not only that, he cannot understand them.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.520]   I believe there is a discussion taking place probably at this minute on one of the programs
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.520]   of the BBC.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:31.440]   A Christian minister and a man are having a discussion about the deity of Christ.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.960]   Can you imagine the Apostle Paul doing that?
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:41.000]   Oh, you see, this woman, Brucilla, she as a Jewess was interested, of course, in Christianity.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.160]   She had heard all about it.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.680]   Felix, as Paul reminds him, had been a number of years in that part of the world and he
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.680]   had heard all about these things and he again was very interested.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.960]   Well, you would have thought you had got the ideal circumstances for a round-table conference,
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.960]   for a discussion.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.960]   But there is no discussion here.
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:06.160]   The Apostle Paul never allowed anybody to sit in a spirit of detachment and objectivity
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.720]   and folded arms just considering it.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:14.960]   No, no, that sort of thing does not lead to people trembling.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.560]   Christianity is not a matter for discussion, still less for entertainment.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:22.960]   Have you noticed the increasing element of entertainment that comes in?
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.920]   You see, we must meet the people where they are.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:30.440]   Short prayers, bright and snappy, singing the same everything, that's the rule.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.720]   You see, even when we talk about prayer, we are not thinking about God, we are thinking
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.360]   about the people who are going to listen.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.840]   Young people don't like long prayers, give them short ones, therefore.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.840]   That's the argument.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:44.640]   Where does God come in in prayer?
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.960]   That wasn't the Apostle Paul's method.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.840]   It has never been the method of the saints and the men whom God has used throughout the
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.160]   running centuries.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.280]   What do we find then?
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.080]   What we find, of course, is authority.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.320]   We find a proclamation.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.400]   We find boldness of speech.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.800]   We find plainness of utterance.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:12.880]   Paul, we are told, reasoned with them.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:18.680]   There was a reasoned discourse, not flippant entertainment, not cracking jokes in order
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.800]   to put himself right.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:29.440]   Reasoned discourse on righteousness and temperance and judgment to come.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.280]   And let me emphasize this aspect.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.120]   Did you notice how personal he was?
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.840]   I'll show you in a moment.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:42.320]   Now how different the Apostle was from so much of what happens today.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.160]   Now you would have thought that these were the ideal conditions in which the Apostle
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.680]   would have voiced certain protests to the Roman governor.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:51.680]   Wonderful opportunity.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.360]   Here he is, the governor has actually sent for him.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.600]   Why doesn't he bring up a list of complaints?
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.600]   Why doesn't he tell him about the attitude of the church towards certain things that
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.920]   the Roman emperor was doing at that time?
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.480]   It's a marvelous opportunity.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.320]   There was slavery, there were many wrongs.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.720]   Now why doesn't the Apostle say, "Well, at last, it's a heaven-sent opportunity.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.640]   We've sent many messages up to the government making appeals and suggestions, but at last
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.920]   they're actually sending them for me themselves.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:19.400]   Now then, I'll tell him what I think about this, that, and the other."
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.280]   Not a word of it.
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:26.760]   Not a word about the politics of the Roman empire.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.280]   Not a series of protests against what the emperor or the governor or anybody else was
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.280]   doing.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.240]   The Apostle had got a wonderful case for this.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.440]   His whole imprisonment, as I say, was unjust.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:41.360]   If ever a man had a case along the political, social line, it was the Apostle Paul.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.720]   Doesn't mention it.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.080]   What does he talk to them about?
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:55.360]   Well, not about politics, but about themselves, about their personal lives, about their whole
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.120]   relationship to God.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:05.600]   It was not only bold, it was personal, it was convicting, it was disturbing to the extent
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.160]   of making them tremble.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:15.240]   And of course he was calling them to a decision, to abandon their life of evil and of sin,
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:20.560]   to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and to be saved.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:27.880]   Now Felix resented all this, and that is why, you see, he dismissed the Apostle Paul.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:32.160]   And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled and
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.320]   answered, "Go thy way for this time.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:41.960]   When I have a convenient season, I will call for thee."
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.920]   It had become so uncomfortable for him that he couldn't stand it any longer, and he
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.920]   gets rid of Paul.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:51.400]   My friend, I want to ask a question at this point.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.920]   Has the gospel of Jesus Christ ever made you feel uncomfortable?
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:03.160]   If it hasn't, if it hasn't, you've never really heard it.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.160]   You're not a Christian.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.960]   There is nothing more uncomfortable in the world than to listen to this gospel when it's
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.520]   truly preached.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.400]   If this gospel has never annoyed you, you've never believed it.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:21.080]   The gospel is something, I say, that is utterly opposed to the natural man and to the natural
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.080]   mind.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:27.960]   It's disturbing, it's upsetting, it's annoying, it's too personal, and Felix felt all that,
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.680]   and he dismisses Paul.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:37.600]   That is something that the gospel always does.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:42.240]   But as I was saying last Sunday night, of course, if you were just denouncing the people
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.260]   who were painting the swastikas, you won't feel uncomfortable at all.
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:50.640]   If you were just talking about anti-Semitism and protesting, nothing to make you uncomfortable.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.280]   You were right, you see, it's the other man who's wrong always, isn't it?
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.840]   But that's not the gospel.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:19:00.720]   If the gospel hasn't made you feel that you're a worm, and it condemns you and hurts you
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:07.560]   and makes you tremble, well then, I say, you've never heard it, and you are still outside
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.800]   its influence.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.440]   That is how the apostle presents the gospel.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:19.120]   That is how the gospel is to be listened unto and to be attended unto.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:25.000]   But now let us come to a second matter which is still more important, the message of the
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.640]   gospel.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.640]   What is it about?
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:34.360]   Well, in a sense, I've already been answering that question in reminding you of what it
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:40.040]   is not about.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:47.080]   The gospel, I say again, is not something general, not merely the Christian attitude
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:53.160]   of this or that or the other, and always social, always general and political.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.720]   No, no.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.680]   Well, what is it about?
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.720]   The matter is given here perfectly simply.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:04.320]   The first thing that it is about is our way of living.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:13.560]   The apostle, we are told, reasoned of righteousness and of temperance.
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.000]   Here is the supreme preacher of the gospel.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.280]   Here is the greatest evangelist and teacher that the world has ever known.
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:25.120]   Well, if we want to know what the message of the gospel is, what can we do better than
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:30.120]   look at this man and listen to him and observe what he does and what he doesn't do?
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:34.880]   These are the things he speaks about, even when he is addressing a Roman governor, a
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.360]   man who is in a high position of governmental authority.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.360]   Righteousness.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.360]   What is that?
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.360]   What is righteousness?
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:53.160]   This is the first thing about which the gospel speaks to us.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:58.520]   Not about war, not about your particular action in joining an army or whether you are a pacifist
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.520]   or not.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.520]   No, no.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.520]   That is not the first question.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.840]   The first question is righteousness.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.840]   And what is that?
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.600]   Well, the New Testament is full of it, so there need be no trouble in discovering what
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.080]   is meant by righteousness.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:22.240]   Righteousness means the life that God intended men to live.
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.280]   God made men and he made them perfect.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.840]   He made them righteous.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:33.160]   He endowed them with what is called an original righteousness.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:39.040]   He was free from sin and he desired good.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.560]   He desired to please God.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:47.920]   His ambition was to live the kind of life that God had made him for.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.580]   It means uprightness.
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:56.200]   It means a condition of men and a behavior on the part of men that is satisfactory in
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.320]   the sight of God and well-pleasing in God's sight.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.120]   That is what is meant by righteousness.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:07.280]   Of course it includes our conduct and our behavior in general.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.440]   You remember how our Lord put it in speaking to the Pharisees, for instance, in speaking
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:18.240]   about the Pharisees, he said, "Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:24.120]   of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven."
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:30.120]   Now, when he talks about the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, he is referring
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.040]   to their mode of living, to their practice and to their behavior.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:39.440]   And these, as I have been reminding you on previous Sunday nights, were religious men.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.960]   They went to their temple and they prayed and they gave a tenth of their goods to the
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:50.280]   poor and so on, and alms and things of that kind, and were punctilious about many matters.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:55.040]   Now, they thought that is righteousness, but Christ says, "Except your righteousness shall
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:01.040]   exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:05.320]   the kingdom of heaven."
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.800]   Righteousness.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:14.480]   In other words, you see, the Apostle Paul told Felix and Drusilla that as human beings
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:20.800]   they were expected to live a certain kind of life, that they, like all others, were
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.680]   creatures of God and that they were under God and that God had made it perfectly plain
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.160]   to them what he would have them do.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.800]   I can imagine him, for instance, turning to Drusilla and saying, "Well now, Drusilla,
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:38.640]   as a Jewess you will know perfectly well that God has made his will concerning men's life
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.400]   and way of living perfectly plain and clear.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:46.100]   You know that God called Moses up into the mountain, kept him there for forty days, talking
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:51.040]   to him about these very things, and sent him down with two tables of stone in his hands
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.160]   on which were written ten commandments."
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:59.200]   That is righteousness.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.640]   That is how God tells people to live.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.080]   You see, the first five describe our relationship to God.
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.760]   "Thou shalt have no other gods beside me.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.040]   Thou shalt not bow down to any graven image, nor make one.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.920]   Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.400]   Thou shalt not take the day of the Lord in vain."
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.080]   There they are, you see, relationship to God.
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.880]   That is a part of righteousness.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.380]   And Paul expounded that.
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.400]   And then he came to the second table.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.120]   "Honor thy father and mother.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.120]   Thou shalt not kill.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.120]   Thou shalt not steal.
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.440]   Thou shalt not commit adultery."
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.920]   How appropriate it was, you see.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:37.920]   Righteousness.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.280]   "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:48.000]   Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, or his man-servant, or maid-servant, or ox,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.120]   or ass, or anything else that belongs to your neighbor."
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.320]   That is righteousness.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.800]   Now Paul discoursed.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:25:02.720]   He reasoned in his discourse about righteousness, showing what God expected of man, the kind
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:07.160]   of life that God has mapped out for man, and pointing out, of course, that any failure
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:13.040]   to reach this constitutes what is called sin.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.200]   Man was made by God for God.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.440]   And the two biggest things, therefore, in the life of men, and these are the elements
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:23.440]   of righteousness, are these.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:29.200]   Men's relationship to God, summed up in the first great commandment, "Thou shalt love
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:35.360]   the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul, and all thy mind and all thy strength."
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:41.280]   And the second, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:49.000]   Men in his relationship to God, and men living a life that is worthy of a creature that is
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.320]   a companion of God.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.080]   That is righteousness.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:57.960]   And Paul reasoned about that, and pointed out, as the Old Testament does everywhere,
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:05.400]   that a failure to attain unto that is sin, is evil, is reprehensible in the sight of
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:10.080]   God, is something that is hateful in the sight of God.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:18.280]   Righteousness, the whole duty of man, man in his relationship to God, man in his relationship
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.760]   to his fellow man.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:25.400]   That is righteousness, and failure to attain unto that is sin.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.400]   But let me come to the second term, which is temperance.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:35.400]   He reasoned concerning righteousness, temperance.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.400]   What does this mean?
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.660]   Well, let's not be misled by this term.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.760]   It means more than abstinence from alcoholic drinks.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.760]   It means self-control.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:54.400]   Indeed, a very good word to translate temperance is the word "continence."
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:27:02.280]   The ability to control your desires and your lusts and your passions, self-control, self-mastery,
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.960]   self-discipline, continence.
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:11.560]   The ability to hold a firm rein on the desires that are teeming and working, that drives,
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:15.560]   as your modern psychologists call them, the ability to hold them in check, to hold them
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.560]   back.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.560]   Continence, temperance.
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:30.200]   Here, I think, the apostle Paul was impressing upon the minds of Felix and Drusilla that
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:38.680]   righteousness is not merely something general, it is also something particular.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:42.580]   Knowing the story of these two people as he knew, he knew that their greatest besetting
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.580]   sin was incontinence.
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:50.440]   Though they were both married people, they desired and lusted after one another, and
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.760]   they didn't control the desire and the lust.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:53.760]   They let it go.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.760]   They were incontinent.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:28:01.480]   They hadn't exercised self-control and they were continuing to live in that state of adultery,
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.000]   that evil-wrong association.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.720]   They were guilty of this personal sin of incontinence.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:12.520]   Now, the gospel of Jesus Christ, you see, always comes down to the particular.
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:19.080]   It's a very easy thing for certain intellectualists to talk about righteousness in general, and
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:22.440]   they've got their great codes and they can talk philosophically.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:27.440]   But you know, my friend, this isn't a discussion about philosophy and morals and ethics.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.800]   Now, philosophers are very fond of doing that.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:33.400]   You can see them doing it on the brainstust, often pipe in mouth.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:38.080]   Yes, but you see, you take the trouble to find out about their personal life and you'll
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.960]   have a shock sometimes.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:45.520]   You'll find that men who can talk so easily about goodness, beauty, and truth, and moral
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:51.520]   values, and moral points of view, are themselves guilty of adultery and are living in that
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.520]   state and condition.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.360]   So Paul doesn't stop at righteousness.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:01.880]   He goes on to temperance, continence, the personal sin.
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:06.680]   And unless you and I have felt and have heard this gospel speaking to us about our personal
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:12.000]   lives and about our personal sins, I say we've never heard it.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.360]   We are still in a state of sin.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:23.760]   And the Bible takes trouble, you see, to give us lists of sin.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.480]   If you'd like to hear a list, let me read it to you, in order that we all might know
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:31.680]   what it means by righteousness and what it means by sin.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:32.680]   Listen to this.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:40.520]   "Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness,
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:49.200]   full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, despiteful,
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:55.840]   proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, without understanding,
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:01.480]   covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful, and he's already
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.640]   said of them that they have turned their, even their women, they changed the natural
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.040]   use into that which is against nature.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:12.920]   And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:18.720]   toward another, men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.400]   that recompense of their error which was meat."
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:28.560]   Incontinence, intemperance, lust, ruling and governing.
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.920]   And it isn't only something that applies to the physical part, you notice, jealousy
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:38.320]   and envy, whispering, backbiting, and all these things.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.160]   The gospel is personal.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.360]   It doesn't want your views and mine.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:46.960]   In general about wrongdoing, it says, "How are you living?"
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.560]   What's true of you at this present moment?
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:56.520]   Who are you to give your great opinion about life and about God and whether Christ is the
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:57.520]   Son of God?
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.520]   Do you believe in the deity of Christ?
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.520]   Let's have a discussion.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:04.320]   "My dear men," says the gospel, "my dear woman, before you can open your mouth about
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:10.880]   that, what about that sin that gets you down day by day?"
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:14.680]   Righteousness and temperance.
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:20.640]   It's not interested in your views, but it's very interested in your life, what you're
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.080]   actually doing.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.440]   Righteousness and temperance.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.440]   What is the next thing?
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:32.040]   Well, the second great matter is, of course, judgment to come.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.040]   I'm not saying this.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:44.920]   It's what the apostle Paul actually reasoned about and discussed to Felix and Drusilla.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:49.280]   The Bible is full of this.
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:55.440]   Before you begin to talk and argue about making the world a better place, consider this.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.720]   The judgment that is to come.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.560]   This is the major theme of the gospel.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.240]   What was the message of John the Baptist?
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.280]   What did he say to people?
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:14.400]   This is the very thing he said, "Who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:21.400]   And our blessed Lord and Savior said exactly the same thing.
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:26.960]   The judgment that God is going to judge the world.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.640]   Read chapter 24 of Matthew's gospel.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.980]   Read the same thing in the 21st of Luke.
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:34.480]   Read the same thing in the 13th of Mark.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:40.640]   Our Lord is preaching and teaching about the judgment which is to come, that God is going
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.920]   to judge the world and everybody who has ever lived in it.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.880]   The apostle Paul, when he comes to preach, does the same thing.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.440]   Peter did it on the day of Pentecost.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:53.920]   There he is preaching the gospel and the men and women cry out saying, "Men and brethren,
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.920]   what shall we do?"
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:59.080]   And he says, "Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.080]   Christ."
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.080]   He is preaching judgment.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:07.040]   "Save yourselves," said the apostle, "from this untoward generation."
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:13.400]   And you remember the apostle Paul in Athens of all places, preaching to Stoics and Epicureans.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:20.760]   Now, if he were a modern man, of course, the apostle Paul, and if he were directing the
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:24.760]   religious policy of the BBC, he would have said, "Well, no, this is wonderful.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:29.320]   Philosophers, Stoics and Epicureans, what a wonderful opportunity for having a philosophical
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.960]   discussion about miracles."
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.400]   But this is what the apostle preached to them.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:39.160]   "The times of this ignorance God winked at.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:46.640]   But now calleth every man everywhere to repent, because he hath appointed a day in the which
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:52.760]   he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath appointed, above which
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:57.200]   he has given notice, in that he has raised him from the dead."
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.440]   Does he argue about the deity of Christ?
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:03.640]   Does he indulge in philosophical speculation about the miraculous and the supernatural
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.480]   and the two natures in one person?
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.160]   Not a word of it.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:12.160]   "Whom ye ignorantly worship him, declare I unto you."
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:17.600]   And what he declares is not only that Christ is the Son of God, but that he is the one
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:24.920]   who is going to come back and judge the world in righteousness.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:28.040]   Had you considered this, my friend, had you faced this?
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.200]   This is the message of the gospel to you.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:38.280]   It is to tell you and to tell me and to tell every one of us this evening that we shall
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:46.720]   have to stand before God and give an account of ourselves and of our lives.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:51.120]   Where is the righteousness which he gave men at the beginning?
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.120]   What have I done with my soul?
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.880]   What has been my attitude to the Ten Commandments?
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.520]   Have I kept them?
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.560]   How do I measure up to the Sermon on the Mount?
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:11.240]   These are the terms, and it is laid plainly before us by the Lord himself and all his
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:21.400]   servants that we shall all have to give an account of ourselves in those terms.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:27.960]   Now my dear friend, I know you do not like that, but what does it matter whether we like
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:28.960]   it or not?
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.320]   I am not here to voice even what I like myself.
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:38.800]   It is the plain teaching of this scripture that every single one of us is going to stand
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:48.600]   before God in judgment, in terms of righteousness and temperance, the moral law of God.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:52.200]   We have all got to face him, and we cannot evade it.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.400]   You can hate me, you can say you will never listen to me again, you know it will not make
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.040]   the slightest difference to you.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:01.000]   You are not dealing with me, you are dealing with God.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.680]   You have got to die as I have got to die.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:04.600]   That is why I am preaching like this.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.120]   I will have to give an account of my preaching, of my ministry.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.080]   I shall be asked, "What did you do in Westminster Chapel?
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:16.160]   Did you spend all of your time there in talking about South Africa or about the Germans or
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.160]   this or that?
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:21.360]   Why didn't you tell those people that they have got souls and that I was going to judge
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.940]   them at the end?"
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:29.180]   If I didn't, well then your blood is on my hands and I will have to answer for that.
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:36.880]   I have to go to judgment knowing the terror of the Lord.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:44.120]   I persuade men, righteousness and temperance and judgment to come.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:50.040]   But thank God he didn't stop at that.
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:53.640]   Did you notice the other thing?
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:59.760]   This is what I read, "And after certain days when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:08.120]   was a Jewess, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ."
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.760]   Thank God!
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.200]   Here is the gospel.
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.600]   What I have been saying is the introduction to it.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:20.000]   What I have been emphasizing is that which brings men and women to see their need of
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   the gospel.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.840]   It is because they don't see their need, they don't believe the gospel.
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.320]   The trouble with every man who is a Christian tonight is this, that he has never realized,
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:34.080]   as he should have done, that he is going to stand before God and that his eternal destiny
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.080]   is involved.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:39.880]   If a man only realized that, he would soon begin to listen to this gospel in a new way.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:40.880]   He wouldn't want a discussion.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.880]   He would say, "Tell me about it.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:43.880]   I see I am lost.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.360]   I see I am condemned.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.520]   I see I am hopeless.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:48.200]   I cannot lift myself up.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.840]   There is evil within me.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.280]   I have broken God's law.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.280]   I have forgotten God.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.400]   I have insulted Him.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.760]   I see I have been guilty of the most enormity in sin.
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.000]   What can I do?"
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   He listens.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.920]   He says, "Tell me, what is this faith in Christ?"
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:07.800]   Well, I can tell you, as the apostle told Felix and Drusilla, it is the great good
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.760]   news of salvation.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:14.080]   What is it, it is this.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:19.000]   The whole world lieth guilty before God.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.880]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:25.080]   All are condemned in the sight of God.
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.560]   We have all, I say, forgotten Him and insulted Him.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.960]   We have flouted His laws.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.960]   We have spat upon His sanctities.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.920]   We have thought we have been clever in doing so.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.280]   Men of the twentieth century who do not believe such fearful things.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.280]   No, no.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.280]   We have broken.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.280]   We have no hope.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.280]   We are utterly condemned.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:49.760]   Do you know what the message of the gospel is?
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:39:01.520]   That God so loved the world that was guilty of all that, that He gave His only begotten
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:11.440]   Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:16.720]   All of us by nature and by action are perishing, and we have no hope at all in the judgment.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:24.120]   But the message is this, the faith in Christ, who is Christ, Christ is the Son of God.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:29.760]   He gave His own begotten Son.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:34.680]   The babe of Bethlehem shall call His name Jesus.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:35.840]   Why?
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:41.880]   Because He shall save His people from their sins.
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:48.720]   The faith in Christ, that though we are so reprehensible and guilty and sinful and vile
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:55.400]   and foul, that God has sent His only Son into this world, what for?
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:02.920]   To rescue us from the wrath, to save us from hell and from eternal misery and unhappiness.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:03.920]   How did He do it?
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:09.360]   Well, this is the message, this is the thing that Paul explained to Drusilla and Felix.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:17.560]   It is the old message, you see, of the gospel, that this Son of God came into this world
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:23.000]   not only to teach and to tell us how to live, because that would be hopeless in itself.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   We could not do it, we could not even keep the Ten Commandments.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.200]   This is even higher, not to tell us to imitate Him.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.880]   Imitating Christ!
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:31.880]   Have you ever tried it?
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.440]   Well, go and try it, and you will give up after a day.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:38.760]   It is impossible.
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:41.840]   No, no.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:49.120]   He sent Him into this world to save, and so the Son said, "The Son of Man is come to
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:55.800]   seek and to save what is lost, to save us, to save our souls from this guilt, from this
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:56.960]   condemnation."
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:57.960]   How did He do it?
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.640]   Do you know how He did it?
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:05.680]   He identified Himself with us and with our sins.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:09.160]   Though He was Son of God, He took human nature unto Him.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.240]   He was born in the likeness of a man.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:16.280]   He lived an ordinary life, shared His existence with ordinary people, endured the contradiction
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.280]   of sinners.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.200]   "But, oh, let me come to it."
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.600]   This is how He saves.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.440]   He went to John the Baptist one day and said, "You must baptize me."
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:25.440]   "No, no," said John.
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.800]   "Who am I to baptize you?
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.400]   You are to be baptizing me."
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.080]   "No," said this Jesus.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:33.720]   "Thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness."
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:35.000]   What is He doing?
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.680]   He is identifying Himself with our sins.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.720]   He is putting Himself by our side.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.640]   He is taking our sins upon Him.
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:48.280]   He had come into the world to do that, and then, you see, He does it finally on the cross,
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:53.760]   not by water only, but by water and the blood.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.920]   What is the meaning of His death upon the cross?
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.800]   It is this.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:06.040]   He is taking your sins and mine upon Him.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.480]   God is laying them upon Him.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:13.040]   God hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:16.480]   God hath made Him to be sin for us who knew no sin.
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:19.200]   Your sins and mine are put upon Him.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.880]   He bears their punishment.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:26.520]   That is why He cried in agony, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.120]   That is why He died so soon of a broken heart.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:31.720]   It was the punishment of your sins and mine.
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:36.320]   The chastisement of our peace was upon Him by His stripes.
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.640]   We are healed.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:41.280]   He has taken it upon Himself.
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.600]   Your guilt and mine.
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.600]   He has stood in our place.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:46.840]   He has received our punishment.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.360]   The faith concerning Christ, what is it?
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:43:00.160]   It is this, that all you and I have to do is to believe that message, that Jesus is
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:07.400]   the Son of God and that He died for our transgressions and sins.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.520]   The faith in Christ, what is it?
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:18.000]   It is this, that the moment you believe in Him as Son of God and that He died for your
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:26.160]   sins, your sins are all blotted out, as if you had never committed a single sin.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:30.520]   They are cast into the sea of God's forgetfulness, nay more.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:37.120]   God takes His righteousness and puts it upon you.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:48.160]   Even the Felix and the Drusilla, licentious, voluptuous, carnal, incontinent, adulterous
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:53.840]   Felix and Drusilla, if they but believe on Him, confessing, acknowledging their sin and
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:59.600]   turning their backs upon it, and looking to Him for strength and power to live a new life,
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:05.600]   which He will give them, it is possible to them even at that moment, the faith that is
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:12.320]   in Christ, justification by faith only, in other words, that no man makes himself a Christian,
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:16.840]   no man ever can, no man can atone for his sins, no man can ever live a life that is
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:22.320]   good enough, no man can ever work out a righteousness of his own.
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:30.480]   But that God lays our sins upon Him and lays His righteousness upon us and clothes us with
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:37.840]   it, and in a moment we pass from judgment to life, from death to everlasting life, from
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:40.400]   despair to everlasting hope.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:52.960]   The faith that is in Christ, that is the message of the gospel.
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:45:05.960]   Righteousness, temperance, judgment come, faith in Christ, and immediate and complete
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:06.960]   salvation.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:14.960]   Very well, what a pity that I do not stop there, is it not?
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:20.080]   But I cannot stop there because my story does not stop there.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:25.040]   That is what Paul reasoned about, as he alone could do it.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.960]   But what happened?
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:27.960]   What happened was this.
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:31.720]   "Felix trembled and answered, 'Go thy way for this time.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:34.280]   When I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.'"
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:37.920]   He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul that he might lose him.
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.840]   "Wherefore he sent for him the offner and communed with him.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:46.240]   And then after two years another man came in Felix's room, and Felix, willing to
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:51.120]   serve the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound."
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:54.440]   He did not believe it.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.960]   He did not act upon it.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.960]   He did not become a Christian.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.960]   He rejected it all.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.900]   And especially the faith in Christ, he went on in unbelief as he was.
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:08.420]   Do you realize what that is?
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:11.980]   There are many people in this congregation who are like Felix and Drusilla.
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.540]   You have heard this gospel many a time.
[00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:15.120]   You have not believed it.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:18.740]   Can I tell you this evening very plainly why you do not believe it?
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:21.940]   "Oh," you say, "I have got my answer.
[00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:22.940]   It is a matter of intellect.
[00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:23.940]   I am a man of learning.
[00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:24.940]   I am a man of knowledge.
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:28.820]   I am a man of intellect and of understanding.
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:30.940]   And it is because of my intellect I reject it.
[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:32.000]   I reject your gospel.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.600]   Let me show you how you are fooling yourself."
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:43.700]   Can you honestly read this story and still tell me that it is a matter of intellect?
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:46.620]   You see what you are committing yourself to?
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:51.060]   You are saying that Felix and Drusilla had greater intellects than the apostle Paul.
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:53.700]   Have you ever thought of that?
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:55.780]   You are on the wrong side, my friend.
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.220]   You are in the wrong camp.
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:58.220]   Here is the colossus.
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:46:59.220]   Here is the genius.
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:03.300]   Here is the master mind of the centuries, the apostle Paul.
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:04.660]   Here is mind.
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:08.500]   Here is intellect and understanding.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:09.940]   You are in the other camp.
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:12.340]   It is not reason, you see.
[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:14.780]   It is never reason.
[00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:19.500]   It is never intellect and reason and knowledge and understanding that prevents anybody from
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:20.920]   becoming a Christian.
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:21.920]   What is it?
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:24.260]   Well, it is always what it is here.
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:27.100]   It is always moral.
[00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:29.020]   It is always moral trouble.
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:32.940]   The intellect is the camouflage that we put up to conceive the morality.
[00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:35.900]   But I want to prove this to you.
[00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:38.620]   What is it that left Felix and Drusilla as unbelievers?
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:44.580]   Oh, it is nothing but the power of sin and the debasing effect of sin.
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:45.900]   Where do you see that, says someone?
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:50.700]   I see it here.
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:56.860]   Do you see what the power of sin in Felix and Drusilla did to them?
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:01.740]   It made them go against reason.
[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:03.980]   All reasoned with them.
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:11.380]   Tell me, what can you say against the biblical way of life?
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:14.460]   What is the reasoned objection to the Ten Commandments?
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:17.140]   Tell me, what is it?
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:19.980]   What is your reasoned objection to the Sermon on the Mount?
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:20.980]   What is it?
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:27.300]   That is what the Gospel calls you to, righteousness and temperance.
[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:30.660]   Is there anything unreasonable about it?
[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:34.660]   Why do you say that you are not a Christian because of your reason?
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:41.020]   Tell me on the other side, is it because of your giant intellect that you fall a victim
[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:47.900]   to that personal sin of sex, or of drink, or of jealousy, or of envy?
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:52.860]   Is that because of your great reason and your great intellect?
[00:48:52.860 --> 00:49:00.660]   Can't you see that you have got the whole thing utterly reversed?
[00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:06.460]   It is the sinful life of Felix and Drusilla that is unreasonable.
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:11.540]   And there is nothing in the world more reasonable and intelligent and noble tonight than the
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:20.380]   Gospel of Jesus Christ with its call for righteousness and temperance.
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:26.980]   They went against reason, but there is something even worse.
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:30.340]   They even went against their conscience.
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.180]   Why did Felix tremble?
[00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:34.860]   Because of his conscience.
[00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:40.300]   As he listened to this great little man speaking, he knew he was right.
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:45.500]   He knew he was utterly wrong himself, and he knew it to this extent that he was trembling.
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:48.100]   His conscience was accusing him and condemning him.
[00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:51.740]   He knew that what he had done about Drusilla was wrong, and that many other things that
[00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:52.740]   he had done were wrong.
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.300]   That the fact that he was keeping Paul in prison was wrong.
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:58.180]   He knew it, and his conscience was accusing him.
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:06.620]   But in spite of his conscience, as well as his reason, he persists in his evil course.
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:10.540]   That is the power of sin, my friend.
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:14.180]   It makes a man go against his reason.
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:18.380]   It makes him silence and drown his own conscience.
[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:22.300]   I believe there was another factor here, the convicting power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:26.000]   He even fights against that and gets rid of Paul.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.460]   It makes a man go against everything that is highest and best in his own constitution,
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:37.780]   and the gracious influence of the Spirit of God upon him.
[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:45.580]   It was in spite of all this, and in spite of listening to this man of God, and his irrefutable
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:56.220]   argument and his holy, wonderful life, that Felix and Drusilla dismissed Paul.
[00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:57.220]   And why?
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:00.940]   Well, the answer is given.
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:03.340]   He wanted money.
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:07.580]   You see, the kind of life they were living was a very expensive life.
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:13.020]   And you're short of money if you're always gambling and drinking and indulging your sex
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:15.260]   and paying for your prostitutes.
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:16.540]   It takes money!
[00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:18.700]   The life of the world is a flashy life.
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:20.420]   You're always in need of money.
[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:21.780]   He wanted money.
[00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:26.780]   So he kept on sending even for Paul, hoping that Paul would bribe him to set him free.
[00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:32.860]   He had no conception of justice or of righteousness in his exalted position, but money to buy
[00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:34.860]   pleasure to get success.
[00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:36.020]   He lived for it.
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:37.020]   What else?
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:38.020]   Popularity.
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:43.700]   Felix, willing to show the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:49.940]   He knows nothing about rightness and righteousness and justice and equity, but he likes to be
[00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:50.940]   popular.
[00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:55.620]   He hopes the Jews will say, "Oh, Felix, he was a wonderful fellow after all, wasn't he?
[00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:58.980]   He wasn't a Jew, but you know, he left this man in our charge."
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:01.660]   He wanted the Jews to speak well of him.
[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:02.660]   Popularity.
[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:03.980]   What other people are going to say?
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:05.620]   What other people think?
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:07.260]   What other people do?
[00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:18.060]   To sum it up in a phrase, they were interested in their lives in this world only and saw
[00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:21.260]   nothing beyond it.
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:23.820]   That is why men do not believe the gospel.
[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:29.740]   It is the power of sin that paralyzes reason, silences conscience, and makes them live for
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:34.540]   such unworthy and base motives.
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:41.980]   They put money and pleasure before a righteousness that satisfies God.
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:46.620]   They put men and women, the Jews, the people in your office, your fellow students, the
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:52.580]   people in the same profession, they put their opinion before the opinion of God.
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:53:07.340]   They put this passing world and its glittering prizes before their eternal and everlasting
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:08.340]   welfare.
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:13.820]   I ask you, in the name of reason, is that intellect?
[00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:15.220]   Is that reason?
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:16.660]   Is that understanding?
[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:19.380]   It is nothing but sheer folly.
[00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:21.580]   Let me prove to you the height of the folly.
[00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:28.260]   I am going to end with just another little footnote of history.
[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:40.340]   Two years or so after this incident, in other words, about A.D. 63, Felix's brother,
[00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:46.260]   Pallas, fell out of favor with the Roman emperor and was dismissed.
[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:49.580]   And so was Felix.
[00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:51.740]   So what the Jews thought of him no longer mattered.
[00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:53.220]   He was no longer governor.
[00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:54.220]   He has lost everything.
[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:57.460]   He has been dismissed.
[00:53:57.460 --> 00:53:59.620]   The money had no value and he had not got any.
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:01.460]   The popularity had gone.
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:04.900]   His great position had vanished.
[00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:15.100]   All that he had built on suddenly went like that because of the passing whim of an emperor.
[00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:31.300]   As for Drusilla, in A.D. 79, Drusilla and her son were suddenly killed in an unexpected
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:38.780]   eruption of the volcano Vesuvius.
[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:49.820]   And in a moment, past, from time to eternity.
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:58.460]   That footnote of history is important and significant.
[00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:02.220]   What are you living for?
[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:06.620]   Why are you rejecting this gospel?
[00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:10.420]   Is it because it is going to put an end to the life you are living?
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:17.940]   Is it because it says no to certain darling pleasures, certain lusts that you enjoy?
[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:21.580]   Is it that?
[00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:28.540]   Is it that you are afraid of the opinion of others and want to be popular?
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:33.420]   Is it that you are thinking of your career and what happens to you and your life in this
[00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:37.540]   world?
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:43.020]   My dear friend, that is the height of folly.
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:50.780]   If you put things like that before the kind of life that was lived by Jesus of Nazareth,
[00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:59.140]   righteous and temperate, if you put that before the blessings of God in this gospel of salvation,
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:07.700]   if you put that, I say, before the smile and the favor of God and the certain knowledge
[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:16.140]   that you need no longer fear death and the grave, because when you come to die it will
[00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:22.100]   just mean that you are being ushered into heaven and into a glory which shall last throughout
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:27.940]   eternity, I plead with you.
[00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:33.420]   Look at the case of Felix and Drusilla.
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:45.660]   Listen to this message about righteousness, temperance, judgment to come, and the faith
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:53.100]   in Christ that is possible to you here this evening, which tells you that you have got
[00:56:53.100 --> 00:57:00.020]   nothing to do but to acknowledge your sin and folly to God and believe the message concerning
[00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:10.340]   his Son and his atoning, redeeming death and the glory that awaits you.
[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:17.620]   And immediately you are forgiven and become children of God and can begin to look forward
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:20.700]   to that everlasting glory.
[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:22.260]   Look at me.
[00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:23.260]   Do the exact opposite.
[00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:27.740]   Don't shake off what I've been saying as they shook off Paul.
[00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:28.740]   Follow it out.
[00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:29.820]   Reason it through.
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:30.820]   Think about it.
[00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:32.580]   Face yourself in the judgment.
[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:34.580]   See your lost condition.
[00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:35.580]   Repent.
[00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:40.300]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:46.300]   Go after him and be made eternally safe.
[00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:48.340]   Amen.
