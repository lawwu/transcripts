[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.380]   - We are coming off of our annual Pastors Conference
[00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.080]   here in Minneapolis this February.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.460]   It was a really sweet time of interacting
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.880]   with so many men who are faithfully pastoring small churches.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.440]   I mean, some large churches are represented,
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.240]   but most of the pastors pastor
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.040]   pretty ordinarily sized churches.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.840]   And from the perspective of this conference
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.000]   and your interaction with the pastors recently,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.800]   Pastor John, I wanna turn the tables.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.320]   I mean, if you can speak now to the churches
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.720]   that these men represent,
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.560]   why is it important for folks in those churches
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.120]   to pray for their pastors?
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.840]   - One of the sweetest times,
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.320]   and really for me, one of the most tearful,
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.040]   moving times during our Conference for Pastors recently was
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.800]   we set aside time after the evening service
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.680]   and just said, we're available.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.320]   We leaders of the conference are available.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.600]   And we lined up across the front of this huge auditorium
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.000]   and said, if you wanna go, you can go.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.320]   You can go linger and pray,
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.040]   or you can come up here and ask for prayer.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.440]   And I was there probably praying for, I don't know,
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.240]   half hour, 45 minutes with guys.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.240]   And the stories that were told to me of crises in church,
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.840]   leadership, agonizing over the next steps,
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.960]   children who are very sick or rebellious.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.680]   One pastor told me of a daughter
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.720]   who suffered from migraine headaches for six years now,
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.760]   and she's 14, and she could just hardly stand the pain.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.680]   They've gotten all the help they can from doctors,
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.640]   and nobody can seem to put their finger on it.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.400]   Another pastor who his own health was fading so fast,
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.680]   he didn't know if he'd live out the year,
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.280]   and he was trying to do his best in the ministry.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.240]   So the cumulative effect of just listening to about 10,
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.320]   maybe, of these pastors that I prayed with that evening
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.600]   just reawakened in me as a pastor
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.560]   and as one who wants to care for pastors,
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.960]   the extraordinary battle that we're in at every level.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.780]   The marriage is embattled, the children are embattled,
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.320]   the health is embattled, the faith is embattled,
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.160]   the gifts for ministry are embattled
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.720]   because we're in a spiritual warfare,
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.880]   and Paul just makes it so plain
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.560]   that we don't wrestle against flesh and blood,
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.640]   but against principalities, against powers,
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.680]   against the world rulers of this present darkness.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.680]   So I think right there in the spiritual armor
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.800]   that we're supposed to put on, he says,
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.680]   put on these things, praying in the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.680]   So our people, we pastors desperately need our people
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.600]   to intercede earnestly for us,
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.320]   that God would protect us,
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.080]   that God would provide every need,
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.560]   that he would guard our families,
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.020]   that he'd guard our marriages,
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.080]   that he'd make us mighty in the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.680]   So I don't think there's anything our people can render to us
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.240]   that would be of greater use to us
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.000]   than to earnestly intercede with God on our behalf.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.340]   - Well said.
