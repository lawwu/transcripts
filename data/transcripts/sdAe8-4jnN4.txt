[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.340]   Would it be possible to just pose the questions to them as an exercise that they could do
[00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.340]   in real time?
[00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.340]   Totally.
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.340]   Yeah.
[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.340]   Thank you so much.
[00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.600]   I think that would be tremendously valuable.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.680]   So I'm going to have to erase myself here for once.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.920]   I'm going to be quiet for a little while, folks.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:27.920]   And you are the lucky patient that gets to talk to Dr. Schwartz here, and he's going
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.400]   to pose a series of questions.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.680]   And we'll allow some moments of break or silence for you to be able to tap into the
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.720]   answers to these in real time.
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.960]   That way, you don't have to create a parallel construction of what we did earlier.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:51.120]   And let me lead by saying, please don't do this if you have fear about doing it.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:00.600]   But if you're interested in some inner exploration, then I'll lead you through some of the steps.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:09.000]   So as you've been listening to our conversation, I'm speaking to listeners, you may be thinking
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.360]   about some of your own parts, particularly your own protectors.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.480]   And if you can't think of any, most people have a kind of critic inside or part that
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:27.440]   makes them work too hard or a part that takes care of too many people.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:35.400]   So I'm going to invite you to pick a protective part to try to get to know for a few minutes.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:47.880]   And just notice that inner voice or that emotion, that thought pattern, that sensation.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.760]   Just focus on it exclusively for a second.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:59.480]   And as you do that, notice where it seems to be located in your body or around your
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.480]   body.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.800]   And just take a second with that.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.000]   And some people don't find a location.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.880]   Some people, they still sense it, but it's not clear where it seems to be located.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:29.920]   But if you do find it in or around your body, then just focus on it there.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.600]   And as you focus on it, notice how you feel toward it.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:44.680]   And by that I mean, do you dislike it and want to get rid of it?
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.720]   Are you afraid of it?
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.680]   Do you resent how it dominates?
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.400]   Do you depend on it?
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:08.640]   So you have a relationship with this part of you.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.000]   And if you feel anything except a kind of openness or curiosity or willingness to get
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.560]   to know it, then that's coming from other parts that have been trying to deal with it.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:33.020]   And we're just going to ask those other parts of you to relax back for just a few minutes
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.440]   so you can get to know it.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.800]   We're not going to have it take over more.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.840]   We're just going to get to know it better.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.880]   So see if they're willing to let you open your mind to it.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.520]   And if they're not, then we're not going to pursue this.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:59.960]   And you can just get to know their fear about letting you get to know this target part.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:11.360]   But if you do get to that point of just being curious about it, without an agenda, then
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.240]   ask it what it wants you to know about itself.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.840]   Just a kind of nice open-ended question.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.240]   And don't think of the answer.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.400]   Just wait and see what comes from that place in your body.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.880]   And don't judge what comes.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.720]   Just whatever comes, we'll go with it.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.720]   What does it want you to know about itself?
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:52.920]   And what's it afraid would happen if it didn't do this inside of you?
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.740]   If you got an answer to that question about the fear, then it was telling you something
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.040]   about how it's been trying to protect you.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:12.520]   And if that's true, then extend some appreciation to it for at least trying to keep you safe,
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.280]   even if it backfires or it doesn't work.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.520]   Let it know you appreciate that it's trying to protect you.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:32.140]   And see how it reacts to your appreciation.
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:41.840]   And then ask if you could go to what it protects and heal or change that so it didn't need
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.080]   to protect you so much.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.840]   What might it like to do instead inside of you if it was released from this role?
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.160]   And I'll repeat that.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:59.920]   If you could go to what it protects and heal or change that so it was liberated from this
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:17.260]   protective role, what might it like to do instead inside of you?
[00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.420]   And then ask it this kind of odd question.
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.220]   How old does this part think you are?
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.460]   Not how old is it, but how old does it think you are?
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.820]   And again, don't think.
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:47.260]   Just wait and see what comes.
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:07:13.100]   And if it got your age wrong, then go ahead and update it and see how it reacts.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:20.340]   And the last question for this part is what does it need from you going forward?
[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.580]   What does it need from you?
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:30.340]   And again, just wait for the answer.
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:47.100]   And when the time feels right, thank your parts for whatever they let you do in this,
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:53.540]   and then begin to shift your focus back outside and maybe take some deep breaths as you do
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:08:01.420]   that.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.420]   Thank you for that.
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.420]   That was awesome.
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:08.100]   I also was able to get some, I think, good work done in that.
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.100]   Is that true?
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.100]   Yeah.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.100]   Yeah.
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:18.740]   Totally different location, totally different set of dynamics.
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:25.260]   Even though what you just took us through is very experiential, what, if any, value
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.780]   do you think there is to writing down sort of key takeaways?
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.780]   A lot of value.
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:29.780]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.780]   Okay.
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:31.780]   Yeah.
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:39.180]   So it's great to do the work in a session or this exercise, but ideally it's the beginning
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:43.100]   of a new relationship with this part.
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.540]   And that takes work on your own.
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:52.020]   So what I advise people is as you get that ball rolling in that good direction, it'll
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:56.180]   reverse if you don't stay with it for a while.
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:01.020]   So every day, like you were saying, you wake up, rather than what am I going to do today
[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:06.380]   or what problems do I have in my life, how's that part of me doing that I've been starting
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.380]   to work with?
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.900]   What does it need from me today?
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.660]   What does it want me to know?
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.940]   Is it still feeling better?
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:21.060]   Do I still have compassion for it or appreciation for it?
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.260]   So like I said earlier, this kind of becomes a life practice.
