[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.040]   In our studies of the twelfth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans, as most of you will
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:16.240]   recall, we come this evening to verses seventeen and eighteen. Verses seventeen and eighteen
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.200]   in the twelfth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:29.120]   "Recompense to no men evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. If
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:36.680]   it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men."
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.360]   Now I suggested when we were making a general analysis of the chapter, and as we resumed
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.480]   three weeks ago, I suggested that here in the seventeenth verse we come to the final,
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:58.440]   the last subsection of this chapter. Here the apostle, as I have reminded you, is dealing
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.000]   with the practical application of the great doctrine that he's been laying down, especially
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.440]   in the first eight chapters, and indeed also in the subsequent chapters nine, ten, and
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.840]   eleven. But here he comes to this application. "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.920]   mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice and so on, that you be
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.400]   not conformed to this world, but that you be transformed by the renewing of your mind,
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.200]   that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God." And then he's
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.440]   proceeded to deal with this. We've got to exercise the gifts that are given to us by
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.760]   the Holy Spirit in the realm of the Church. He deals with that until the end of verse
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.160]   eight. The Church is the body of Christ, and as in the body are several members of their
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.760]   differing functions, but all serve the same common end and object and purpose, so it is
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.960]   in the Church. Well then, from verse nine and ten onwards, he deals with our general
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.240]   attitude towards other people and the way in which indeed we conduct ourselves in general.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.800]   Then from verse fourteen onwards, he is dealing with our reaction to what other people do
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.360]   to us. He begins with the statement, "Bless them which persecute you, bless and curse
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.800]   not." Until that point, he has been most concerned with what we do to others. Now,
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.400]   he's concerned with our reaction to what others do to us. And we have seen how in verses
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.960]   fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen, he's been laying down the general principles which should
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:47.400]   govern us in this respect. Now, here at the seventeenth verse, he goes beyond that. He's
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.360]   concerned about what we actually do in practice. The principle is, we must bless those that
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.200]   do harm to us and persecute us. We must bless them and not curse them. We are to rejoice
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.560]   with them that rejoice and weep with those who weep. But above all, we are to have the
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.800]   same mind one toward another, this unity of mind and of output that is always to characterize
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.720]   the members of the church and God's people. And in order to do that, we are not to mind
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.240]   high things or high people, but we are to condescend to be, allow ourselves to be carried
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:30.240]   along by men and things which are of low estate. And then, we last Friday night dealt with
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:39.040]   the final exhortation, "Be not wise in your own conceits." And that is, as we saw, a
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.920]   most important injunction. And we ended on this note, that the way to avoid being wise
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:52.040]   in our own conceits is to seek the wisdom that comes from above and from God. I was
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.160]   showing you how the best exposition of this injunction is the third chapter of the epistle
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.360]   of James, particularly towards the end, where James goes into this in great thoroughness.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.800]   And therefore, if we are not to be wise in our own conceits, well, the best thing for
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:14.160]   us to do is to ask God for that wisdom that he alone can give us. And we are assured that
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.360]   he will, that he "giveth liberally, and upbraideth not."
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:25.320]   Well, now, here I am trying to show you the connection between that and this final sub-section.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:33.080]   Here, you see, he says, "Recompense to no man evil for evil." Now, in other words, we
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:41.000]   are, as he goes on to show us, to try to live at peace with all men. So here is again the
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.520]   practical carrying out of what he has laid down for us. If we have that wisdom from above,
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.200]   we shall have a wisdom that is first pure and then peaceable. And you remember how James
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:05:00.360]   there works that out in describing this wisdom that is from above. He says that it is pure,
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.920]   and peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:15.040]   and without hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:21.840]   Well, now then, he is continuing that along a very practical level. And this is the thing
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.320]   that now is to engage our attention. The man of true wisdom, not the man who thinks he
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:35.120]   is wise, but the man who has true wisdom, is always a peacemaker. How does he do that?
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:42.000]   How does this peacemaker, this truly wise man, conduct himself? Well, here is the answer.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.120]   Now I would again urge the importance of carrying in our minds the background of verses 1 and
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:54.000]   2 of this chapter, and also verses 9 and 10, because there are the principles. "Let love
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.760]   be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil. Cleave to that which is good. Be
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:10.160]   kindly affectioned one to another, with brotherly love, in honour preferring one another."
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:16.680]   There is the great principle. In other words, I am reminding you again that it is only the
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:25.160]   Christian men who can carry out these injunctions. The natural men cannot do so. So we must always
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.920]   remember that these words are addressed to those who have got new life in them, who have
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:38.320]   the mind of Christ, who have life from above, in whom, as John puts it in his first epistle,
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:46.520]   there is this sea of eternal life. It is impossible to anybody else. Now let's see then, as we
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.240]   expand, we shall see that there is something which is inevitably true. Well now then, here
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:59.680]   is the first statement. "Recompense to no man evil for evil." Now this is the negative
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:06.200]   part of the statement. Here is somebody who does evil to you. What are you to do about
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:12.600]   this? Here is somebody who does you some wrong, who really has done you something, as I say,
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:18.480]   which is truly evil. What are you to do about it? Well, he starts with the negative. "Don't
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:25.440]   pay back," he says. "Don't recompense evil for evil." Now here you see at once, we see
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:33.160]   that we are told negatively not to do what we all instinctively want to do, and feel
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:39.200]   that we must do. The natural instinct is to hit back. It is to retaliate. That's the whole
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:46.200]   story of the human race. From the moment that men fell, this kind of spirit came in, inmate,
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:52.800]   self-seeking, hitting back, defending self. It's the whole tragedy of the story of mankind
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:59.880]   in its form, state, and condition. So the apostle, knowing as he knew himself, saw the
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:06.040]   wisdom of starting with the negative. Now this is a principle that you'll find constantly
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.120]   in the scripture, and it's a very wonderful thing, this. The scripture always starts with
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:17.160]   us where we are. It meets us on our own level, as it were, and gradually raises us up. It
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.760]   doesn't start with the positive generally, but almost invariably with the negative. You're
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.920]   told first of all what you mustn't. Here's the instinctive response. "Don't do that."
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.680]   Now you may for a while not be able to get beyond that, but that's something. Don't despise
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:39.440]   that. The negative is not to be despised. Whatever you may feel, don't do anything.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.400]   If you can't get beyond that for the time being, well, at any rate, do that. We mustn't
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:53.080]   ignore this negative. It's a very vital, it is a very essential bit of teaching. Cut right
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:58.880]   across that which is instinctive and natural. Now here, of course, the apostle is simply
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:05.440]   putting before us our Lord's own teaching on this very matter in the Sermon on the Mount
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:13.160]   about turning the other cheek. If a man smites you, well, you don't smite him, you turn the
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:20.520]   other cheek. It's the same teaching put in this particular way and manner. And I'll come
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:26.560]   back to that later because I want to deal with that teaching in a fuller manner. Now,
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.200]   it's the same also as the teaching which we saw there in the second chapter of Peter's
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:38.040]   first epistle. He again refers to our Lord and to his example. That's the way in which
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:43.520]   we are to live, so we don't hit back. "When he was reviled, reviled not again. When he
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:49.680]   suffered, he threatened not, but committed himself to him that judged it righteously."
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:56.280]   This is of the very essence of Christian teaching, that you don't retaliate, you don't hit back.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:05.840]   You don't avenge yourself. This is, as I say, something which is really at the very center
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:12.240]   of Christian teaching. And it has been the cause of much sarcasm, oftentimes, on the
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.760]   part of men of the world who have not only rejected the Christian message but have ridiculed
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:23.800]   it. A famous example of that was the man who was known as Tom Paine, Thomas Paine, who
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:30.080]   lived towards the end of the 18th century. He was a well-known and famous infidel. And
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:36.520]   Tom Paine, in referring to our Lord's teaching about turning the other cheek and carrying
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:42.040]   out the injunction that we have before us this evening, he said that this is the spirit
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:52.120]   of a Spaniel, as though he described it, the spirit of a Spaniel. No fight, nothing strong.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:58.440]   The kind of spirit that one associates with a Spaniel rather than a masochist or something
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:04.720]   like that, or a terrier. You see, that is the kind of ridicule that he poured upon us.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:10.400]   And others have said the same thing, of course, that the Christian teaching has produced flabby,
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:17.000]   sentimental people, lacking in manliness, lacking in virility. We've had a great deal
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.160]   of that in this present century, the whole cult of self-expression, believe in yourself,
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:28.040]   exert yourself, stand up for yourself. This whole idea has been put forward before us
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:35.480]   prominently and this kind of Christian teaching has often been despised in that way. But is
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:41.920]   this just weakness? Well, the answer is, of course, a thousand times no. And the apostle
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:47.720]   here himself proves that it isn't that by going on to the positive. And here is the
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:54.160]   positive. "Negatively recompense to no man evil for evil. Positively provide things honest
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:59.640]   in the sight of all men." Now here is the positive aspect of the statement. What does
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:05.840]   this mean? Well, unfortunately our translation here in the authorised version is not too
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:11.880]   good. And people taking it as being the true translation have often misunderstood it completely.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:17.120]   And some have interpreted this as being just an injunction to us to provide for those who
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.240]   are dependent upon us. Well, of course, that's a right and a good thing to do and we are
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.520]   told elsewhere to do that. But we're really not told to do that here. It doesn't come
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:31.880]   into the context at all. And is more or less meaningless at this particular point. But
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:38.120]   the apostle here, as I'm suggesting, is giving the positive part of the injunction.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:44.160]   "Negatively, don't give back." Well, then what are you to do? Well, here is the answer.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:50.160]   Now what is it? Well, you're to do the opposite. And what is this opposite? Here we have to
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:56.320]   come to the actual meaning of the words. Take this word translated here as "provide".
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:03.880]   "Provide things honest in the sight of all men." In a sense, and especially as this
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:10.880]   word was used in the beginning of the 17th century and the Elizabethan era, "provide"
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:20.480]   really does carry the right notion. But as the word is by now derived a different connotation,
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:26.680]   we must give an alternative translation. The actual word used by the apostle means this.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:33.880]   "Take thought in advance." Take thought in advance. Or if you prefer it, "take thought
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:45.480]   for." Take thought for, or take thought in advance, concerning things that are good in
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:51.600]   the sight of all men. Now what does this mean? Well, you see, the whole key is in that word
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:57.280]   "take thought in advance." In other words, somebody does you an evil, and the danger
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:05.640]   is to act instinctively, to act automatically. Don't do that. Stop, think. Think ahead.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:11.040]   Think in advance. Before you do anything, think about it. Don't allow yourself to act
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:19.520]   in this instinctive manner. All your action as Christians must be based upon thought.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.480]   Now this is of course absolutely vital and fundamental. And this is our great claim for
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:29.400]   the Christian life, that it is in the last analysis the only reasonable and the only
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:37.560]   life which is based upon reason. The Christian, unlike all others, does not act instinctively.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:42.520]   He always knows what he's doing. He should always be able to give a reason for what he's
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:49.800]   doing. He always takes thought in advance. And I want to expand that and take it further
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:56.840]   and put it like this, that the trouble with us by nature, the men who's not a Christian,
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:04.400]   is that we tend to regard each problem that arises in and of itself. Now that is something
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:10.280]   we must never do. Somebody does me evil, I just think of that and act in kind. I mustn't
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:16.760]   do that. I must take this particular thing and put it into a larger context. I must consider
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:25.000]   it now in the light of the whole position in which I find myself as a Christian. Before
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.760]   I do anything, I must in advance take thought. And I must work this thing out for myself
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:37.960]   in the context of my total position as a Christian and my total outlook as a Christian. Very
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:44.160]   well, there's the meaning of the word 'provide'. Then 'things honest'. Well, alright in a way,
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:51.280]   but it just means good things. Good things as distinct from bad things. In other words,
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:57.600]   he's suggesting at once that to retaliate is bad. So we must provide good things. Now
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:05.040]   here again the word is interesting and important. Provide good things in the sight of all men.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:12.840]   There are two words which are used to convey the idea of goodness. The first word is a
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:20.200]   word that describes inherent or intrinsic goodness. Something which is good in its very
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:28.800]   nature in and of itself. That's one word which is used and is translated as goodness or good.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:34.560]   But here we haven't got that word, we've got another word. And the word we have here is
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:42.840]   a word that is always used to describe exterior goodness, external goodness, goodness which
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:50.720]   is to be seen. Goodness which is expressing itself outwardly. Or if you like, it is the
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:58.760]   outward expression of an inner inherent goodness. Now the apostle deliberately chose that second
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:04.880]   word rather than the first. He's concerned here about a goodness which can be seen. A
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:11.240]   goodness which is visible and is evident. So he says now, instead of retaliating, instead
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:19.920]   of hitting back, take thought and provide, produce, let there be evidence of things which
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:31.520]   are obviously good in the sight of all men, before all men. Now this is the positive aspect
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:38.040]   of the injunction. This is how we are to know how to conduct ourselves when somebody does
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:47.840]   evil to us. Here is Christian teaching which we find of course in many parts of the scriptures.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:54.040]   The authorised version translates 1 Thessalonians 5.22, "Abstain from all appearance of evil."
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:18:00.600]   It's doubtful whether that is the best translation there, but there's truth in it. It may better
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.520]   be translated, "Abstain from all forms of evil." But there's something in this other
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.120]   idea also. All appearance of evil, anything which may even appear to be evil, abstain
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:15.120]   from it, have nothing to do with it. Or as he's told us here in this very chapter, "Abhor
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:21.800]   that which is evil." Abhor it, cleave to that which is good. But a very much better
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:26.920]   illustration and a parallel with what we've got here is to be found in the second epistle
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:33.480]   to the Corinthians in the eighth chapter and the twenty-first verse.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:39.320]   Now the apostle is dealing with a particular problem here. He's dealing, you see, with
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:44.000]   helping the saints up in Jerusalem that were suffering, and they were making collections
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.920]   and sending up the money. And he's dealing with that. He says here that he is sending
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:55.440]   up certain representatives. The heart of Titus, for instance, Titus is being sent up. He says,
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.840]   "And we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:05.160]   churches, and not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:10.360]   this grace which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord and declaration
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:16.440]   of your ready mind." Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:23.240]   is administered by us, but rather providing for honest things, not only in the sight of
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:30.680]   the Lord, but also in the sight of men. Now, providing for honest things, they are exactly
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:36.400]   the same words as we've got here in our verse in the seventeenth verse of the twelfth chapter
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:42.400]   of the epistle to the Romans. Provide things honest. And here it is, providing for honest
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.440]   things. Exactly the same words. But you see the point he is making. He says we are to
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:52.560]   avoid this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:58.040]   He said it's very important that we should administer this fund properly, honestly, and
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:03.880]   do it in such a way that it will be obvious not only in the sight of God, but also in
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:08.960]   the sight of men. That we've not been dishonest, we've not abused our position, we've done
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.560]   nothing wrong in any way. Let's administer this fund, he says, in a way that it will
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:21.040]   be open and plain to everybody. You know, often times we are reminded that it isn't
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:27.120]   enough that justice should be done, but it must be evident that justice is being done.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:35.520]   That's the principle that is involved here. We are to make it evident and obvious to others
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:41.040]   that what we are doing is right and good. Very well then. Now there is the actual meaning
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.560]   of the words. What then is the teaching? What is our exposition of this injunction? Well,
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:55.360]   we can put it like this. When somebody does evil to you, don't think about yourself only.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:01.840]   No man liveth unto himself. That's a great word of Christian teaching. We'll get it later
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.960]   in the fourteenth chapter. No man liveth unto himself, no man dieth unto himself. Here it
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:13.200]   is. Now when this happens to you, don't think only about yourself. Think of the effect of
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:21.120]   what you do in reply to this upon others. Not only upon Christians, but upon all men.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:27.880]   Now here you see is this great principle. We are always to behave in such a manner,
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.800]   whatever may happen to us, that we are acting in a responsible manner. And we are always
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:40.800]   acting in a way which shows that we realize that what really matters is what other people
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:46.760]   will think of Christianity as they see us behaving and living before their eyes. The
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:52.320]   people outside are going to judge the gospel, judge the whole of the Christian message by
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:57.640]   what they see in us. They say it's very easy to talk, talk is very cheap. But you people
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:03.560]   you make great claims. What are you like in practice? They're always watching. Therefore,
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:09.520]   we are to provide things honest always in the sight of all men. In other words, you
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:14.760]   see, when somebody does evil to me, I don't not only not hit back as it were or render
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:21.720]   evil to him. I now take this and put it into the whole context of my life as a Christian.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:27.760]   What is involved here is not my honor, it's the honor of the Christian faith. It's the
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:33.360]   honor of the whole Christian position. It is indeed the honor of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:40.440]   It is the honor of God. So I'm not to be concerned only about myself. I'm to think this thing
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:45.680]   through. I mustn't act on my instincts or on my own feelings. I mustn't be concerned
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:50.880]   about my own reputation. But I must be very concerned about the reputation of the Christian
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:56.440]   faith, the Christian gospel, and of the family of heaven to which by the grace of God I now
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:03.800]   belong. I must never act as an individual, independent, isolated person. As a Christian,
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:10.160]   I am not such. I am a member of the body of Christ. No Christian can act on his own. Now
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:15.320]   many people seem to think that they can do this. And you know there's the type of person
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:20.120]   who rather bursts at this, who says, "You know, I'm the sort of person who always speaks
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:25.240]   my mind." Well, you've no right to speak like that. You can't isolate yourself like that.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.920]   Others are going to suffer if you do that sort of thing, and you'll bring the whole
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:34.960]   of the Christian gospel into disrepute. We must always be thinking this thing through
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.440]   and remembering who we are. And whatever my response to the evil that is done to me may
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:45.840]   be, I must always remember that not only am I involved, but the whole of the Christian
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.280]   faith is involved with me.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:55.760]   Now, let me give you some parallel examples of this same teaching. You remember how our
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:02.120]   Lord puts it in the Sermon on the Mount. Take, for instance, Matthew 5, 16. Here it is. "Let
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:12.640]   your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify you, your
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:18.360]   Father which is in heaven." They're watching you, they're observing you, and they know
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:23.360]   to whom you belong. "You are to live in such a way," he says, "that when they see what
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:28.440]   you are doing, they'll be amazed and astonished, and they'll have to admit, they'll have to
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:33.880]   confess, 'I can't understand this.' There's only one explanation. These are God's people.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.000]   They're the children of God. They couldn't do it if they were not."
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.400]   But then, you remember our Lord later on in that same chapter puts it in greater detail.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:47.720]   Here it is, Matthew 5, 38 and following. "You have heard that it has been said, 'An eye
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:54.960]   for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' But I say unto you that you resist not evil, but
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:00.240]   whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if any man
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:05.800]   will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. And whosoever
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:11.080]   shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. Give to him that asketh thee, and from
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:15.720]   him that would borrow thee, turn thee not away. You have heard that it has been said,
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:20.320]   'Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy, the man who does evil to you.' But
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:27.560]   I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:33.600]   you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you." Why? "Well, that
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:40.000]   you may be children of your Father which is in heaven. For he maketh his sun to rise on
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.320]   the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:51.200]   them which love you, what reward of you? Do not even the publicans the same? And if you
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:57.680]   salute your brethren only, what do you more than others? Do not even the publicans so?
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:04.640]   Be ye therefore," and put full weight into that "therefore." Here's the appeal, "Be ye
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:13.400]   therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." In other words, when
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:18.600]   somebody does you evil, let the world, let all men know that you're different from the
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:23.840]   men of the world. Let them see that there's something about you that differentiates you
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:28.320]   from all who are not Christians. Let it be evident, let it be obvious, let it be seen
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:36.200]   that you're different. Let it also be seen that you are indeed children of your Father
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:41.680]   which is in heaven. Or if you prefer it, take it as Peter puts it in that second chapter
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:48.320]   of his first epistle, "Follow in his steps." Do what he did. And so he behaved when he
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:53.640]   was young. And you belong to him, and his mind and his spirit are in you. Follow them
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:27:02.640]   in his steps. "In whose mouth was no guile, when he suffered he threatened not, but committed
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:07.360]   himself to him that judgeth righteously." My dear friends, there is no better way, there
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:14.000]   is no more direct way of showing that we are the children of God than in this particular
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:22.840]   matter. This is what the world cannot do. And it's by responding to this injunction
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:28.480]   and not recompensing to any man evil for the evil that he does, it's in that way you show
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:33.840]   that you're born again. You've got a different spirit in you. You've got a new life in you.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:41.840]   You are indeed a partaker of the divine nature. You are no longer a natural man. There is
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:47.400]   no better way, I say, of showing this to the world than by obeying this injunction. I don't
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:52.800]   know. People have sometimes speculated. I tend to agree with them. Is it possible that
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:28:01.520]   the apostle himself was first of all convicted by looking at and observing the death of the
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:07.320]   martyr Stephen? He consented to the death. He was in agreement with the verdict and the
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:15.760]   condemnation that was passed on Stephen. But he saw him dying with his face shining. Was
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:20.760]   that the first thing that disturbed him? Is that a part of the meaning of "it is hard
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:25.440]   for thee to kick against the pricks"? Was it that, I wonder, that first shook him out
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:33.160]   of his self-righteousness as a Pharisee, seeing the way that this man dies gladly, readily,
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:38.840]   and can offer that wonderful prayer to his Heavenly Father not to lay this thing to their
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:44.600]   charge? Doing what his Lord had done before him on the cross on Calvary's Hill, was it
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:49.240]   this, I wonder, that first shook the apostle? Well, whether it was or not, this has often
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:53.400]   happened in the long history of the Christian Church. There are many illustrations of this,
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:58.440]   how men were first convinced and convicted of sinfulness and first had a glimpse of this
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:06.800]   new life by seeing the death of some compressor, some martyr, who was being in an evil manner
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:13.160]   put to death simply because of his Christian faith. Very well, there it is. That's the
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:22.800]   great injunction of this 17th verse. "Recompense to no man evil for evil, but rather contrarywise."
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:29.720]   Think thought about these things. "And live in such a good way, show such excellences
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:36.200]   in all your conduct and in your behaviour before all men, that they shall see that you
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:42.440]   are essentially different." Very well, let's go on to the 18th verse. "If it be possible,
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:48.840]   as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men." It's still the theme of peace, you
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:53.600]   know. It all starts there, as I am suggesting, "Be not wise in your own conceits, have this
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:59.120]   other wisdom, which is always peaceable, which always maintains this unity and concord and
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:07.480]   enmity amongst God's people. Live peaceably with all men." That is the fundamental injunction.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:17.480]   You are to be a peace seeker, a peace maker. And we are to do this, again, with all men.
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:21.880]   But you notice there are two qualifications which are introduced, and they are interesting
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:30.800]   and important. The Christian faith, the Christian teaching, never asks us to do the impossible,
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:36.200]   never. So, when you get a general injunction like this, you will often find it accompanied
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:43.000]   by certain qualifications. Here's the first, "If it be possible." If it be possible. Now
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.240]   what does this mean? Well, some have misunderstood this and have said that it means, "If you
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:54.360]   can, if it's possible for you, live peaceably with all men." That isn't what the apostle
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:31:00.800]   says at all. That really is to miss the whole point. That's a subjective view of this, but
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:08.120]   the thing is really quite objective. "If it be possible." If it is possible. What he means
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:16.680]   is this, "Live at peace with all men, unless they make it quite impossible for you to do
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:22.360]   so." The possibility is not in you, it is in them. There are people who behave in such
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:27.360]   a way that peace is impossible. Whatever you may feel, whatever you may desire, whatever
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:33.400]   you may do, they are determined that there shall be no peace. They will quarrel. Well
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:41.320]   then, you are not responsible. "If it be possible." There are conditions in which it is impossible.
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:46.920]   There are people who make this impossible and are determined on some kind of strife
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:51.520]   and quarrelling and warfare. That's the first qualification. Then the second, and here's
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:58.120]   the important one, "As much as lieth in you." And the emphasis is this, "As much as lieth
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:05.880]   in you, if it be possible, live at peace with all men." Which means this, "Don't you ever
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:13.440]   be the cause of the trouble." Let it never be because of you, because of what you are,
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:19.760]   or because of what you do. Now here it is, it's quite plain then, isn't it? "If it be
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:25.200]   possible." If they don't make it impossible, as far as you are concerned, as far as it
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:33.840]   rests in your control and power, "Live peaceably with all men." What does this mean? Is this
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:40.840]   peace at any price? Here's the question that arises. You see, these Mary's injunctions,
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:46.320]   they speak to different members of the congregation like this. There are some people whose great
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:50.960]   trouble in life is the desire to head back and to recompense evil for evil, and that's
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:55.560]   the great fight of their life, very often, not to do that, and to implement that other
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:59.880]   injunction. But you see, there is another kind of person who is almost the exact opposite,
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:08.560]   the peace at any price person. Not the militant, aggressive, warlike person, but the phlegmatic,
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:16.080]   the flabby kind of person, who says anything for a quiet life. Peace at any price. And
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:22.440]   this injunction is addressed particularly to such people. Now this is the most important
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:31.040]   matter. It cannot mean that. It cannot mean that we are to put peace first and say at
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:36.440]   all costs and at any price, "We must maintain this condition of peace." It can't mean that
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:41.800]   for this reason. We go back again to that statement which is made by James at the end
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:47.800]   of the third chapter there, in his description of this wisdom that is from above. And you
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:55.520]   notice that he goes out of his way to say this. This wisdom that is from above is first
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:06.320]   pure, then peaceable. He doesn't put peace first. He puts purity. He puts truth first.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:13.120]   It is first pure, then it is peaceable. And to reverse the order of these things is the
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:19.200]   very snare into which this particular type of person is so liable to fall. Very well,
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:24.520]   there is the first answer which we give to the suggestion that this may be inculcating
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:29.680]   peace at any price. But now let's go on and examine this a bit further, because I believe
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:34.640]   that at the present time particularly this is the most important matter. There is great
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:38.920]   confusion in the Christian Church just at this moment on this very thing. The whole
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:44.200]   climate of opinion today is one which tends to say, "Peace at any price. Let's all come
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:49.080]   together, whatever we may believe or not believe. Let's all be one in a wrong sense. Peace at
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:54.960]   any price." So it's very important for us to examine this in a very practical way.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:35:03.800]   Now, haven't we got an illustration here? In what Paul tells us about the Apostle Peter
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:10.080]   in Galatians 2. You remember that the Apostle deals there with this whole question, that
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:17.120]   teaching of the Judaizers, that unless a man was circumcised he wasn't a true Christian.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:21.360]   And he goes on to deal with this in that second chapter of the epistle to the Galatians, now
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:28.000]   particularly verses 11 to 14. He says, "But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.680]   him to the face, because he was to be blamed. For before that certain came from James, he
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:38.160]   did eat with the Gentiles, that is to say, Peter ate with the Gentiles. But when they
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:44.680]   were come, he, Peter, withdrew and separated himself, fearing them that were of the circumcision.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:49.400]   And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him, insomuch that Barnabas also was carried
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:54.240]   away with their dissimulation. But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:59.200]   to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, etc., he withstood him to
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:05.400]   the face." Now Peter, you see, was carried away here, in a spirit of fear, trying to
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:12.800]   preserve the peace. He was compromising in the truth and in the doctrine. And the Apostle
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:18.280]   deals with it in a very strong and in a very firm manner. He took the risk of having a
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:22.760]   quarrel with the Apostle, because this to him was such an important thing. And he tells
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:27.160]   us that he'd done the same thing over Titus. He says earlier in that chapter, "But neither
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:32.400]   Titus who was with me being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised." The Apostle wouldn't
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:38.600]   submit on that. And here, of course, is teaching which we find running right through the New
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:46.440]   Testament Scriptures, that we are not to compromise on matters of truth, but we are to do what
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:53.000]   the Apostle did there as he describes to us. And there are many similar injunctions. "Have
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.240]   no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness." If a man remains a heretic after
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:06.920]   the first and second admonition, says Paul to Titus, you are to have nothing further
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:12.120]   to do with him. Titus 3.10, "A man that is a heretic after the first and second admonition,
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:18.400]   reject." And you remember how John in his second epistle in the tenth verse tells us
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:24.840]   that we are not to give or to wish God's speed to a man. "If there come unto you any
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:29.720]   men and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God's
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:34.720]   speed." You are to have nothing to do with him. And I could give you many other examples
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:41.720]   of the same thing. But it isn't quite as simple as it appears to be. People often like
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:48.160]   to bring up at this point the action of this same Apostle Paul when he was up in Jerusalem
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:53.000]   on one occasion as it is described in the twenty-first chapter of the book of the Acts
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:00.400]   of the Apostles. Listen to this, verses 20 to 26. Paul has arrived in Jerusalem and he
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:04.720]   has reported what's been happening amongst the Gentiles as a result of his preaching.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.720]   And we are told that when they heard it, they glorified the Lord and said unto him, "Thou
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:13.120]   seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe, and they are all
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:18.160]   zealous of the Lord. And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:23.720]   are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children,
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:28.040]   neither to walk after the customs. What is it therefore? The multitude must needs come
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:33.560]   together, for they will hear that thou art come. Do therefore this that we say unto thee.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:38.920]   We have four men which have a vow on them. Take them, and purify thyself with them, and
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:44.600]   be a charges with them, that they may shave their heads, and all may know that those things
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:49.640]   whereof they were informed concerning thee are nothing, but that thou thyself also walkest
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:54.920]   orderly and keepest the law. As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:59.120]   concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:04.520]   offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication. Then Paul
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:10.200]   took the men, and the next day, purifying himself with them, entered into the temple
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:14.640]   to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:21.160]   be made for every one of them. Now then, has Paul gone back on his own principle? How do
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:27.080]   we reconcile that with what he says in Galatians 2 and in so many other places? Well now, it
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:31.400]   seems to me that this is a very important metaphor, as I say, and I would suggest to
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:37.680]   you that the following principles should govern our action in this respect. First, we must
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:44.680]   always contend for the truth and for the faith. We are exalted to do so, to earnestly contend
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:50.800]   for the faith, to stand in rank, as he puts it, to the Philippians and the Colossians,
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:55.840]   in defence of the faith. We are set for the defence and the proper propagation of the
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:02.840]   gospel. We must always speak the truth, and we must never shrink from doing so. The truth
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:10.000]   is to be declared, whatever the cost. Now, we all know what it is to feel like Jeremiah,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   poor Jeremiah. You remember he came to the decision, he said, "I'll never say another
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.040]   word. Every time I speak, I only get into trouble. All these other prophets are against
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:21.640]   me. I'm not going to say a word." But remember, he couldn't do it, the fire was burning in
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:26.960]   his bones. But we understand it, all for peace. "I'm not going to say certain things. I
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:30.560]   know if I do, they'll offend certain members of my church, or they'll offend somebody
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:35.240]   else, and I'll be in trouble. I may suffer. My wife and children may suffer, and so on.
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:40.280]   So I'll say nothing. I'll preach an inoffensive message." You hold back portions of the truth
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:44.400]   because you know they're going to hurt and cause to offend people. Now, this is always
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:51.400]   wrong. It is always condemned. We are to preach the truth. It's committed to us. We don't
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:56.960]   have to deny it. It's given to us, the truth once and forever delivered to the saints.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:01.920]   We must never compromise this truth. We have no right to it. It isn't ours. We are to
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:09.600]   declare it, whatever the consequences. We are not to modify it. We are not to leave
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:14.880]   portions of it out. We are not to add to it. We are to deliver the truth as it has been
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:24.760]   delivered to us. On all vital matters of doctrine, we are to be uncompromising and to declare
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:32.720]   the truth. Paul did that with Peter. Secondly, we must at the same time be prepared to be
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:39.720]   patient and as helpful as we can in all other matters. We are not to be bigoted. We are
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:45.600]   never to be unyielding. There are matters in connection with this faith that are not
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:52.840]   central and all-important and absolutely vital. I would explain Acts 21 in those terms. Paul
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:58.560]   on the central matter of circumcision would not yield and never did. And even that record
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:03.200]   tells us that the authorities in Jerusalem even held to that. But, you see, this was
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:08.720]   the position. There were a number of Jews who had seen the truth of the Gospel and had
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:13.640]   come to believe it. But they had not seen everything in a moment. It takes a long time
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:17.800]   to work these things out. There are examples of that everywhere in the Scripture. Peter
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:21.880]   himself, you remember, had to be given a vision before he would go and preach the Gospel to
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:26.200]   the Gentiles. Not only was he converted, he had had the experience of Pentecost. But,
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.800]   you see, he had not worked it out. He could not see it. The old prejudices were there.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:35.200]   Well, it was the same with these people in Jerusalem. So the Apostle sees that it is
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:41.880]   a matter of wisdom in a matter that is indifferent and unimportant. And for the sake of avoiding
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:48.440]   offence and making it easier for these people to work out their faith and to avoid a scandal,
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:53.880]   to do this thing which he knows is not essential. But he is not betraying any vital principle
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:59.400]   as he does so. And I think that this is something that we must also bear in mind. There are
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:06.800]   certain absolutes which we simply declare, come what may, whatever the consequences.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:10.960]   But there are other matters which are not vital to salvation, which are not central
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:17.560]   in importance. There we must be prepared not to compromise the truth, but to be accommodating
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:22.720]   in our behaviour. In other words, we must remember the weaker brother. Conscience not
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:28.560]   thine own, but of the other also. It is not merely what you know is right. See where that
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:33.640]   other man is. Try and help him. Be patient with him. Be long-suffering. If you can make
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:38.480]   a slight concession in practice that is not going to compromise the truth, for his sake,
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:43.520]   do so. Now that is a principle which seems to me to be quite clear in the New Testament
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:49.040]   and which we must always remember. But thirdly, and this is the important one in many ways,
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:54.120]   I say we are to assert and declare the truth. But my dear friends, the way in which we do
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:44:02.080]   so is all-important. Speaking the truth in love. That is the thing. And you must never
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:10.600]   leave out any one part of that statement. Speaking the truth in love. Now, we cannot
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:16.080]   help it if the truth offends people. But we must always be very careful that it is the
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:21.320]   truth that is offending people and not us. I as a preacher must be careful that if there
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:26.600]   is offence, well, that people are offended not at me, not at my person, not at my behaviour,
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:32.000]   not even at the way in which I speak and preach. But they are truly being offended by the truth
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.760]   itself. If it is the truth that is offending them, I am innocent. I cannot help it. I am
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:41.240]   anxious to be at peace. I have done my best to be persuasive, to put the truth before
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:46.160]   them in as attractive a manner as I can. If they still resent it and reject it and act
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:53.960]   violently because of it, it is not my responsibility. I must declare the truth always, but I must
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:45:02.640]   always declare the truth in love. Fourthly, I must never make a personal issue of these
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:09.840]   things. I must never contend for myself, nor even for my point of view, still less for
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:17.240]   my own reputation. I must contend for the truth. Nothing has been more regrettable and
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:21.240]   deplorable in the long history of the Church as the way in which men have made of these
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:27.360]   things a personal matter, a personal issue, as if people who disagree with them are against
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:34.040]   them individually. It is true on both sides. The moment personalities come in and people
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:38.480]   are governed by this, they have departed from the truth and the whole spirit of the New
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:44.640]   Testament teaching. It is not a personal matter at all, and we must be very careful to keep
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:53.920]   this personal element right out of it. If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:59.880]   at peace with all men. And finally, and this is the great text that I leave with you to
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:06.120]   go home with and to work out for yourselves, this is the final answer to this great matter.
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:13.600]   Let the peace of God, or the peace of Christ, rule in your hearts, to the which also ye
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:20.760]   are called in one body, and be ye thankful. That's Colossians 3, 15. Let the peace of
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:28.440]   Christ act as umpire in your hearts, or if you like, act as arbitrator, so that when
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:34.280]   a man does you evil, don't you take this decision into your own hands. Let the peace of Christ
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:39.400]   act as umpire. Pause using the illustration of the umpire in the games, or the arbitrator
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:47.160]   in a dispute. You don't decide, he decides. Let the peace of Christ act as the arbitrator.
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:51.560]   It doesn't matter what happens to you. It doesn't matter what you may suffer, what people
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:57.040]   may think or say. You should have only one concern, not only that you enjoy the peace
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:03.720]   of Christ yourself, but that the peace of Christ may be in the Church. Don't do anything
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:10.040]   in a personal manner that in any way is ever going to disturb that blessed peace. And it's
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:16.200]   a wonderful injunction, this. It's a wonderful principle by which to live. Make certain that
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:21.720]   you've always got the peace of Christ in your heart. Let nothing disturb it. It doesn't
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:25.520]   matter what anybody does to you, it doesn't matter what may happen to you around and about
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:32.600]   you. Make certain that you've always got the peace of Christ in your heart. And you say,
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:38.280]   I'll never do anything to disturb that. You can state the truth, you can state it boldly,
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:42.320]   you can withstand the Peter to the face, but always do it in such a way that you've still
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:47.000]   got the peace of Christ in your heart. You're not trying to get the better of Peter, you're
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.480]   not trying to put him down and put yourself up, you're concerned about the whole state
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:55.960]   of the Church, the peace of God's people. You want them all to enjoy the benefits of
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:48:02.960]   salvation to the full. Let the peace of Christ always act as the umpire in all these matters.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:11.120]   And as long as you do that, you will never go astray. May God have mercy upon us all
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:19.320]   and enable us by his Spirit to implement these great and glorious injunctions. Let us pray.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:26.160]   O Lord, our God, we come unto thee again, and we are all unprofitable servants. We have
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:31.960]   all failed, we have all come short. But we thank thee that with thee there is mercy that
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:38.520]   thou mayest be feared. O God, shed thy love abroad in our hearts, so that we shall be
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:47.200]   able to say from the depth of our hearts, let nothing please nor pain me apart, O Lord,
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:54.320]   from thee. Hear us in this our prayer. And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:49:00.160]   and the love of God and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:06.800]   continue with us now this night, throughout the remainder of this hour's short and certain
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:29.200]   earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we shall see him face to face, the Prince of
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:58.000]   the Earth. Amen.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
