[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   The prosperity gospel continues to plague pulpits and churches around the world.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   So what is the prosperity gospel? Why is it popular? Why is it dangerous?
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   And why is John Piper so opposed to it?
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Here's how he explained it back in the fall of 2008.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   So why do I feel so strongly about the so-called prosperity gospel?
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   There's an easy answer, but before I give it, let me define it a little bit.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   It's on a continuum from the most radical to what would be called soft or light.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   And the most radical would basically say, "God wants you rich,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   and you should partner with him by faith to pursue riches."
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   And the justification would be given, "You can't accomplish much in life without money,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   and so go for it."
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Or another rationale might be, "You're kingdom kids,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   and kingdom kids don't wear tattered clothes. They dress like the king," and so on.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   The light would be simply being more cautious not to say those gross things about wealth,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   but to minimize sin and minimize pain and only talk about how well things will go for you
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   if you follow Christ.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   So why do I abominate this so-called gospel? I think it is another gospel.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And the first reason would be simply to go straight to the Bible and see what Paul says
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   about those who want to be rich.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   He says, this is 1 Timothy 6.6, "Now there's great gain in godliness with contentment,"
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   in other words, without craving for stuff, "for we brought nothing into the world,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   and we cannot take anything out of the world.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   If we have food and clothing, with these we'll be content."
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   It's just amazing.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   "But those who desire to be rich," now here's the key text, this is verse 9,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   "those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evils.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   It is through this craving," that is, this craving to be rich,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   "that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs."
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   In other words, the very thing that leads people to suicidal piercings of pangs,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   namely the desire to be rich, is nurtured and cultivated by the prosperity preachers.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   They are encouraging that this suicidal behavior happen.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   That's abominable.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Where Jesus said, "It's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven."
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Why would he say that?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   It's because riches are such dangerous things.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   They're not a blessing usually.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   They're usually a curse.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   People are cursed with riches.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   They're destroyed by riches.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And here again, a little parenthesis of qualification,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I don't mean it's sinful to make a lot of money.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   I just mean it's sinful to want to keep a lot of money.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   And it's suicidal to want to keep a lot of money.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Bigger barns and bigger cars and bigger houses and bigger portfolios
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   and finer clothes and everything is growing with your income
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   so that your conscience is getting harder and harder.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Because if you're a Christian at this point,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   your conscience is having to say, "It's okay. It's okay.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   This is okay. This is the Calvary Road.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   This is what it means to deny yourself.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   This is what it means to follow Jesus.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   This is what it means to die every day.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   This is what it means to have my treasure in heaven."
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And it doesn't. It won't work.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Your conscience has to be lacerated in order to keep from killing yourself.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   And so, Jesus says, "It's hard for a rich man to give you the kingdom of heaven."
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Paul says, "Those who desire to be rich fall into temptation
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   and pierce themselves with many pangs."
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And along comes a prosperity preacher who says,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   "Yes, the Lord really wants you to be rich.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   We should pursue riches."
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Following Jesus is the pathway to riches.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Riches are the sign of God's blessing.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I would just say those are in mutual contradiction for each other,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   and therefore, this is deadly.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Here's another reason I'm really upset about this.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   These prosperity preachers don't just talk to Americans
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   who are already fairly well off
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   and try to help them become a little more rich.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   They get on their jets, their personal jets,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   and they fly to Africa or the Philippines.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And they land, and they gather a stadium full of 100,000 desperately poor people
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   and tell them if they'll believe in Jesus, they'll get rich
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   and all their needs will be met,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   and their wives won't have miscarriages anymore, blah, blah, blah.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Then they get in their jet with their pockets full and go home.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   That's wicked.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Because the Bible is so filled with teachings
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   that in this life, this is a momentary affliction here.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   This light, momentary affliction is working for us
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   What's Paul referring to there?
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   He's referring to a lifetime.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Light and momentary corresponds to the weight of eternal glory in heaven.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   He means when you come to Christ, you come and die,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   and you can count on it through many tribulations
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   we must enter the kingdom of heaven.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Normal Christianity is pain.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Sorrowful yet always rejoicing is the pattern.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Prosperity preachers do not prepare new converts in third world countries
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   to endure the realities of what it will cost them to be a Christian.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Here's another reason.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   There are 1,568 or so, as we talk,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   people groups in the world out of 13,000
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   that don't even have missionaries engaging them,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   and therefore everybody in them is without hope.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Most of those 1,500 people groups are in very dangerous places,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   meaning if you go there, your kids might either get diseased and die,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   or your wife might be captured and raped,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   or your family might be butchered and killed.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Who's going to go?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   We have to go.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Jesus said, "Make disciples of every people group,"
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   not just the easy ones, not just the comfortable ones.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Who's going to go?
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   The product of prosperity preachers?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   I don't think so.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   The people that are going to go are the people that have been taught
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   that to follow Christ is to suffer, and it's brief.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   It's only 80 years.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   And then comes heaven.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   I just read this morning with Noel and Talitha
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   the first paragraphs of Revelation 21.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   and the sea was no more.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   And I saw the new Jerusalem coming down like a bride prepared for her husband,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   and he will dwell with us, and we will be his people,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   and he will be our God, and then every tear will be wiped away,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   and every pain will be gone,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   for the former things, the former things, have passed away."
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   That's common.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   One of the essential biblical problems with the prosperity gospel
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   is an over-realized eschatology,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   meaning the things that are promised gloriously for us,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   we're all going to be rich, we're going to own the world,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   we're going to judge angels.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Paul used that argument in 1 Corinthians 3.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Don't you realize that you are going to inherit the world?
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   The world is yours, Paulus is yours, Cephas is yours,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   life is yours, death is yours.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   And the conclusion he drew was, "Why would you boast in men?"
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   In other words, why wouldn't you take that as a means of enabling you to suffer
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   and be lowly and kind and servant-like and walk on this Calvary road
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   and take the pain of being a Christian?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   That's coming.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   But what they do, instead of saying, "We have to wait for that
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   and pour our lives out through many tribulations here,"
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   they say, "Bring it now, bring it now.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   The kingdom is already here, right?
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Jesus brought the kingdom."
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   And it's the overlap of these two ages they don't understand.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   The New Age is a beautiful age,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   and there are healings that happen in this world.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   I don't deny that.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   I just deny very vehemently everybody is going to be healed.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   You let these prosperity preachers with their healing talk
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   and their word of faith talk
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   go to the fourth floor of Augustana Home
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   or go to the emergency rooms
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   or to the intensive care rooms of hospitals.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Go there, go there and preach your gospel.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   No, they don't.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   They wear their nice clothes, stand up to the lights,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   money strewn all over the thing with people out here
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   who desperately want somebody to tell them how to get rich,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   and there they make a lot of money that way.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   They don't go to the places where it's impossible to deal with reality
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   unless you've got a theology of suffering.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   And so for all those reasons and more,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   it's a tragic thing that one of our greatest exports of America
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   is the prosperity gospel.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   People are being destroyed by it.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Christians are being weakened by it.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   God is being dishonored by it,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   and souls are perishing because of it,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   and a lot of guys are getting rich on it.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   That was Pastor John Piper back in 2008
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   on a concern that is still alive and well today.
