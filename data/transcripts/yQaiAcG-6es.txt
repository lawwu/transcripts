[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   We started this podcast 3,000 days ago.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.200]   3,000 days ago today, and today we reach episode 1600.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.000]   It's a big milestone with a fittingly massive question on the table.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.200]   They don't get any bigger than this one.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.880]   Who is God?
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.800]   We get this question often, most recently from podcast listeners named Gamal, Olyanka,
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.800]   Ezekiel, Bobby, Zandy, Matthew, Giovanni, Jerry, Tom, and Esther.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.040]   Last time on Friday in episode 1599, Pastor John, you answered the background question
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.740]   to this one, namely, who does John Piper think he is to answer this question of who is God?
[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.120]   But that's out of the way now.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.820]   Now we can address the question itself.
[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.640]   Pastor John, who is God?
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:05.840]   When I turn from myself to Jesus and his teachings and to the writings of his followers that
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:15.520]   he himself vouched for, guaranteed, and to the Jewish scriptures that Jesus himself endorsed,
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:23.000]   and to the world of nature, and to the witness of my own conscience, when I turn from myself
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.340]   to these places where God has revealed himself, here's what I see in answer to the question,
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.020]   who is God?
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:41.240]   And I would appeal to everyone who's listening not to take my word for it, but to search
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:49.360]   out those five sources as if your life depended on it, because it does.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:59.480]   First, here's the first thing I believe I see in those revelations from God of who he
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.120]   is first.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.800]   Jesus says that God is spirit.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:14.680]   John 4:24, "God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth."
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.520]   In other words, he's not physical.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.020]   He's not material.
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.300]   He does not have a body.
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.860]   He is invisible.
[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.920]   He's spirit.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.840]   Second, God is personal.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.840]   This is amazing.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.000]   When you think absolute reality could have been anything.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.640]   I mean, there was nothing before absolute reality to make it what it is.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.180]   To think it's personal, that's just mind-blowing.
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:50.460]   He has revealed himself as one who thinks, and reasons, and plans, and loves, and rejoices,
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.800]   and experiences anger and compassion.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.280]   Isaiah 55, 8, "My thoughts are not your thoughts."
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.080]   Jeremiah 29, 11, "I know the plans I have for you."
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.840]   Isaiah 1, 18, "Come, let us reason together."
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.200]   Hosea 11, 8, "My compassion grows warm and tender," declares the Lord.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.280]   Zephaniah 3, 17, "The Lord will rejoice over you with gladness."
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.960]   Numbers 11, 10, "The anger of the Lord blazed hotly."
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.880]   Amazing.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.400]   God is not impersonal.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.600]   He's not a substance.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.680]   He's not a mere force.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.000]   He's not material, like an element or a gas.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.680]   He's not just an influence.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.680]   God is a person, personal.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.480]   From him comes personhood.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.280]   This is why human beings are so unique in the world of God's creatures.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.520]   He made us in his image.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.880]   We are persons.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:12.440]   Third, he revealed himself as absolute, self-existent, independent of all other reality.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:19.440]   I think one of the most important verses in the Bible is Exodus 3, 14.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.800]   God said to Moses, "I am who I am."
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:32.120]   He said, "Say to the people of Israel, 'I am has sent me to you.'"
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:42.880]   The phrase "I am who I am" is a declaration of absolute freedom from being created or
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:49.660]   formed or guided or swayed or determined by anything outside himself.
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:59.400]   Whatever God is or whatever God does, he himself is the ultimate source and cause of that.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:07.400]   Here are some implications of what that revelation means for who God is, that revelation of his
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.680]   "I am who I am."
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.240]   One, it means he never had a beginning.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.640]   Nobody made God.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.120]   God simply is, always was, no beginning.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.800]   Two, God will never end.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.520]   He is absolute being.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.880]   If you are being from forever, there's no place to go outside being.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.320]   You can't not be.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.840]   Three, there is no reality before him.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.160]   There's no reality outside him unless he wills it to be and makes it.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.720]   Four, God is utterly independent.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.880]   He depends on nothing to bring him into being or support him or counsel him or make him
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.520]   what he is.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.840]   Five, everything that is not God depends totally on God.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.960]   All that is not God is secondary, independent.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:14.480]   The entire universe, vast, vast, vast billions of galaxies is utterly secondary to God.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.200]   Six, he is constant.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.240]   He is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.840]   He cannot be improved.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.160]   He is not becoming anything.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.560]   There is no development in God, no progress.
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.200]   Absolute perfection cannot be improved.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:41.200]   Seven, he is the absolute standard of truth and goodness and beauty.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:47.400]   There is no law book to which he looks to know what is right.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:54.000]   There's no almatech to establish facts for God, no guild to determine what is excellent
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   or beautiful.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.200]   He himself is the standard of what is right and true and beautiful.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:12.000]   Eight, all that God does is always right, always just, always beautiful, and always
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.880]   in accord with truth, that is, himself.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.880]   It fits.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:25.760]   In that sense, it is right and good and beautiful, all things considered.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:34.080]   Nine, therefore, God is the most important and most valuable reality in the universe.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:40.880]   He is more worthy of interest and attention and admiration and enjoyment than all other
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.840]   realities, including the entire universe.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:52.040]   Now all of that, all nine of those implications of I am who I am, all of that is implied in
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.840]   God's word to Moses.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.000]   Tell them, "I am sent you."
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.960]   You can see the same implications in many other places in the Bible.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.440]   For example, the letter to the Romans.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.920]   This is one of my favorite passages, Romans 11, 33 to 36.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:14.360]   "Oh, the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God, how unsearchable
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.920]   are his judgments and how inscrutable are his ways.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:25.040]   For who has known the mind of the Lord or who has been his counselor or who has ever
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.720]   given a gift to him that he might be repaid?
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:35.020]   For from him and through him and to him are all things.
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.240]   To him be glory forever and ever.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.240]   Amen."
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:46.260]   In other words, God can't be counseled because his knowledge and wisdom are infinite.
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:53.520]   God can't be negotiated with or bartered with or bribed because he owns everything.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.800]   He can never be put in anybody's debt.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.920]   Everything originates with him.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.320]   He sustains all that is.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:09.480]   And the display of his glory, his beauty, his greatness, his value is the goal of everything.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:16.060]   From him and through him and to him are all things.
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:20.300]   Therefore, to him be glory forever.
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:28.660]   And in his fullness and perfection, the Bible makes plain that from all eternity, God has
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:33.060]   had a perfect image of himself.
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:39.320]   The radiance of his glory, the Bible calls it the exact imprint of his nature.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:49.240]   And this image is so complete with all that God is, the Bible speaks of this image as
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:10:00.620]   the second person in God and uses the language of son of God, not because there's any biological
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.640]   way that he's a son, like he had sex with Mary and had a baby.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.360]   That's not what the Bible teaches.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:16.080]   He's a son, this second person that has always existed in and as the perfect image of God.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.920]   This son is a son to indicate that they have the same nature.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:27.440]   They're both personal and love reigns between them.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:34.320]   The Bible speaks of God, the father, loving God, the son, and God, the son, loving God,
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.320]   the father.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:41.480]   And the Bible points to the reality that this spirit between them, this love between the
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:50.600]   father and son carries, as it were, such a fullness of all that they both are, that a
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:59.860]   third person exists, stands forth, has always stood forth in God.
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:07.360]   So the biblical picture is that there's one God, not three gods, and that this one God
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:15.520]   mysteriously exists as God, the father, God, the son, and God, the Holy Spirit.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:28.680]   This is one reason that it makes sense to say, as 1 John 4, verse 8 says, "God is love."
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:37.400]   Love has been surging from all eternity in the fellowship of the three persons of the
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.400]   one God.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.800]   Now, if that were not amazing enough—
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:46.480]   Lord, we're over our head, I know, I'm just pointing.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:54.080]   Now if that were not amazing enough, here comes the most amazing thing of all about
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.760]   who God is.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:04.440]   In His perfection and independence and fullness, He is not only completely righteous and just
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:08.200]   and holy, but overflowing.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:17.320]   He is overflowing with His own beauty and goodness and joy so that His creatures can
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:23.240]   know Him, love Him, enjoy Him, be with Him forever.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:31.320]   In other words, the love that God has always enjoyed—enjoyed is the right word—in the
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:40.880]   fellowship of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, God aims to share with His creatures.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:52.920]   To do this, God the Father sends God the Son into His creation to be born as the God-man,
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.860]   Jesus Christ.
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:13:00.860]   This is what the Gospel of John means when it says, "In the beginning was the Word,
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:11.200]   and the Word was God, and the Word was with God, and the Word became flesh," that is,
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:17.040]   became a human being, "and dwelt among us, and we have seen His glory, glory as of the
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.040]   only Son."
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.680]   And you see the switch in categories from Word to Son, just to make clear that that's
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:31.020]   who we're talking about, the eternal Son, that other second person in God.
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:37.240]   We have seen the glory of the Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:47.200]   The Son of God has always been God, and now He is also man, the God-man, Jesus Christ.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.200]   Why?
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:54.080]   Why this so-called incarnation of God?
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:14:00.640]   Because all of God's human creatures had failed to worship and love God and obey God as we
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.640]   ought.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.720]   We deserve to be punished.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:09.120]   God would be perfectly just to punish us all in hell because of our failure and our rebellion,
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:18.720]   but in the fullness of His God-like love, planned way before the foundation of the world,
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:27.560]   He is not only just, but He is merciful, and He intrudes Himself into the world to rescue
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:32.960]   His own creatures who deserve punishment from His punishment.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.680]   He rescues us from His own wrath by His own mercy.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:42.560]   The Son of God becomes human and is punished in our place.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:48.280]   Here's how the prophet Jeremiah in the Old Testament scriptures, the Jewish scriptures,
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:54.000]   put it, Isaiah 53.5, "He was pierced for our transgressions.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.920]   He was crushed for our iniquities.
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.960]   All we like sheep have gone astray.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.960]   We have turned everyone to his own way, and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.400]   all."
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:12.400]   The New Testament puts it like this, "God so loved the world that He gave, He gave His
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:20.280]   only Son that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life," John 3,
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.960]   verse 16.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:29.120]   Whoever believes, whoever trusts, whoever receives, whoever treasures Jesus Christ as
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:39.880]   Savior and Lord, Jesus becomes His substitute, bears God's punishment, provides God's
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:46.000]   righteousness, secures eternal joy in fellowship with God.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   So who is God?
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.680]   He is the Creator, Sustainer, Governor, and Judge of the universe.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:16:01.040]   And in His justice and mercy, He devised a way from all eternity for sinners like us
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:07.920]   to be forgiven and to be adopted into His eternal family as the children of God and
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:19.560]   as a kind of bride for His Son, Jesus Christ, so that by sharing the joy God has in Himself,
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:26.640]   our joy in Him would show the fullness of His own glory.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:36.000]   I invite you, I urge you to embrace Jesus and all that God is for you in Him.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.840]   Jesus is who God is.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.960]   Absolutely glorious.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:49.080]   It is not just about knowing about God, it's all about knowing God Himself.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:53.800]   That's the invitation, an invitation to participate in the very life of God Himself through the
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.360]   life and through the works of His precious Son.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.000]   That is so good.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.820]   Thank you for listening.
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.020]   You can ask a question of your own.
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:05.800]   You can search or browse all 1,600 of our past episodes, or you can subscribe to the
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.800]   podcast.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:11.800]   Do all of that online at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:17.240]   Well speaking of who God is, God has a plan for creation, and that plan for creation shapes
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.600]   our lives.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.180]   It shapes what we do.
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.400]   It shapes what we don't do.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.960]   It sets our hopes and structures our aspirations.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:30.520]   Now we're going to return on Wednesday to hear Pastor John explain how all of this works.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.520]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.320]   Thank you for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime author and pastor
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.320]   John Piper.
