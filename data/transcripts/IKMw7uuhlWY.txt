[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   To talk about sleep training, we're generally referring to some system
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.360]   where a child is crying for some period of time during the night
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.160]   and with the intention that they fall asleep on their own.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.200]   So people sometimes call this "cry it out."
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.040]   There's a method called "verberizing,"
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.040]   which is named after a guy named Verber.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.280]   And there are many different variants on this,
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.600]   but the basic core item is that the baby is crying,
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.360]   you are not going in to help the baby,
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.400]   and they eventually learn to fall asleep on their own.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.840]   It's extremely polarizing because people worry
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.280]   that if you sleep train your kid,
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.920]   it will cause them to never be attached to you
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.960]   and to have long-term psychological issues.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.200]   We have a fair amount of evidence on sleep training.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.640]   We can see that it does improve sleep.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.480]   It does actually improve parents' sleep,
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.800]   decreases postpartum depression.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.760]   And then when you look at long-term outcomes,
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.040]   either long-term or short-term outcomes,
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.040]   for kids, you just don't see any differences.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.400]   For kids who are sleep trained and not,
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.280]   there's just not any evidence in the data
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.200]   of this kind of attachment issues.
