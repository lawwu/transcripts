[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   The cross of Jesus Christ is a watershed point for so many issues in theology and ethics.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   So was the cross a tragic event that God turned for good,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   or was it a loving event that God planned for good?
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Which side of the watershed you choose to kayak down
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   will decide the trajectory of your entire theological system that you based your life on.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   It's that important, as John Piper explains in a sermon clip from his 2011 sermon on John chapter 11.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Here's a clip of what he said.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   God did not just turn the national crisis for Israel's good and our good.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   He was in it from the start, planning it.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   See the difference? Does God see a difficult situation and fix it, turn it,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   or is he in it from the start, managing it, planning it?
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   And I'm arguing that's the case because of what this text says.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   So notice carefully what John says about Caiaphas' words, verse 50.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   "It's better for you that one man should die for the people, not that the whole nation should perish."
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   And then John says something amazing in verse 51.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   He did not say this of his own accord, but being high priest that year, he prophesied.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   He prophesied of God's accord, not his own.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   He prophesied of God's accord, not his own.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Now think that through.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   God brought these words out of Caiaphas' mouth.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   God put them there.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   God has a meaning.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   At one level, these are Caiaphas' words, and his meaning is one thing.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   At another level, these are God's words, and his meaning is another thing.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And the point I'm making here is these words sealed Jesus' death.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   These words were the death warrant of Jesus.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   God spoke these words.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Caiaphas wanted Jesus dead and out of the way, so he spoke these words.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And Jesus wanted Jesus, God wanted Jesus dead and risen and reigning and triumphant over the world.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   And he spoke these words.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   He didn't arrive on the scene here late and say, "Oh my, what will I make of these words?"
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   He spoke these words.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   That's amazing.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I mean, my whole life is based on things like that.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   You think you're troubles?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   God says, "Oh no, what will I make of that?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   That horrible mess.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I'll figure it out."
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   That's not my God.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Caiaphas prophesied, that is, he spoke God's words, and God said,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   "It is better for you that one should die for the people,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   and that the whole nation should not perish."
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   God said, "Better that he die."
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   God said, "Better that he die."
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   God said, "Better that he die."
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Better indeed, better than any plan in the universe.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Infinitely better that he die.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I love God.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I love God.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   He did this with you in mind.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Therefore, the death of Jesus was not mainly a tragic set of events
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   which God turned for good.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   It was a loving set of events that God planned for good.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   God himself served the death warrant on his son.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   He didn't just predict it.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   He unleashed it.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   This word of prophecy tracked Jesus down to Gethsemane
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   and put him under arrest.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   There was no escape because God had spoken.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Listen carefully.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Inside the universal offer of salvation, which we know from John 3.16, right?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   For God so loved the world.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Whoever, inside the universal offer of salvation,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   God has a particular design in the death of his son
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   to convert the elect, the scattered children of God,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   and bring them to himself.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Within the glorious open door sent to the world,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   whosoever will may come.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   whoever believes, whoever believes, may not perish, but have eternal life.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Within that glorious proclamation, which we should announce everywhere we go,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   there is a design as well.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Don't limit Christ's purposes in the cross
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   to providing an opportunity for all to be saved.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Don't limit the work of the cross to that.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   That's true, and gloriously so.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   It unleashes us in the neighborhood.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   It unleashes us among the nations to look into every eyeball and say,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   "He loved you and gave his son so that if you will but believe, you will be saved."
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   But he did more than that.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   And that's here.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   The more is here.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And the more is by your blood, you ransomed a people.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   You are gathering a people called the children of God who are out there,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   chosen before the foundation of the world, Ephesians 1, 4, for adoption.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And you have died to bring them.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   And you will do what you died to do in regard to your elect.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   You will get that done.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   And there will be one people infallibly.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Christ died not only to offer the world salvation.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   He died in order to bring his people to himself, to overcome their rebellion
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   and gather them omnipotently to himself.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Beautifully put.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   This is an incredibly important doctrine.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   And, of course, you can find the entire message online at DesiringGod.org.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   This message is titled "Jesus Died to Gather the Children of God,"
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   which was preached on October 29, 2011.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   This clip was found by Donnie from New Mexico who sent it in to us.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Thank you, Donnie, for the clip.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   And John Piper returns tomorrow, and we're going to talk about four reasons
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   why you should consider sharing your personal struggles with your non-Christian friends.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   That should be an interesting discussion.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke, and I'll see you tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
