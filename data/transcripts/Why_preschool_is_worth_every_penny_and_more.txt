[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.240]   talk about preschool and why I think it's worth every single penny and more.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.000]   So the first day of preschool was tough, not so much for our boy but for my wife
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.640]   and me. My immediate thought was hmm so this is where creativity comes to die. My
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.000]   wife and I spent three hours a day with him for the first week to help with the
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.960]   transitioning process. During this time I observed how other kids of varying
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.600]   developmental levels behaved. I saw kids have to wait their turn, listening to
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.760]   instruction and trying to communicate with other two and a half year olds who
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.160]   weren't very good communicators at all. It was kind of chaos, it was kind of free
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.360]   but I was a little bit sad frankly. As I thought about my negative reactions
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.080]   while soaking in the hot tub I came to realize what I disliked most about
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.720]   preschool was exactly what I disliked about work. At work, despite being a
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.560]   strong performer, I had to wait for a colleague in New York City to first make
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.320]   managing director before I could make managing director because he had been
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.480]   promoted to head of the desk. Although he was several years older we had the same
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.000]   experience, same amount of years of experience working at the firm and I was
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.160]   managing a large book of business in San Francisco. So I thought to myself do I
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.080]   really want to wait another five years for him to hopefully get promoted and
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.800]   then maybe I can get promoted? So I said screw that. After already being in firm
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.480]   for 11 years I didn't want to wait so I decided to leave and negotiate my
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.400]   severance. At work I remember having to listen to new hires who didn't know my
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.600]   business tell me how to do my job and I found this tremendously annoying. I
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.040]   remember in New York City, what was it, 1998 and 1999, Goldman Sachs went public
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.240]   in 1999 and suddenly this really private firm where you know we can kind of do
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.400]   what we want and we had this culture of going to breakfast with the partners and
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.640]   just being free was suddenly upended because we were a public company now and
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.160]   our workforce basically doubled in the next three years and it just suddenly
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.920]   felt not as collegial anymore. I didn't like that. At work I also had to attend
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.000]   endless meetings and hear people blabber on and on about what we should do.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.360]   Ironically the time spent in meetings significantly cut into the time I needed
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.960]   to do the very things we were being asked to do. Seriously folks, having
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.840]   meetings about meetings is the biggest waste of time and that's why I like
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.400]   working for myself and writing because I just wake up, brush my teeth,
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.400]   go to the bathroom and if it's 4.50 in the morning because I don't know I
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.560]   couldn't sleep for some reason I'm just gonna go on my computer and do some free
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.480]   writing. It's just so much more efficient. So what was happening was that I was
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.040]   unconsciously associating my initial dissatisfaction for preschool with my
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.020]   tremendous unhappiness at work. I felt terrible subjecting my son to a system
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.400]   that I had so enthusiastically escaped from in 2012. In some ways it felt like I
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.720]   was sending him to prison but after a couple of weeks of preschool I started
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.560]   to have a change of heart and now that I'm three months in I believe preschool
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.600]   is worth every single penny and more and here are the reasons why. One, preschool
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.280]   will save a parent's sanity. It wasn't until we finally dropped off our boy,
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.860]   wiped away our teals and left did we start to appreciate preschool. Initially
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.440]   during the first month of preschool we finally both got three hours of free
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.680]   time. We used this time to catch up on errands, tidy up the house, go on a brunch
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.680]   date or a lunch date and just to soak and relax in the hot tub together. For
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.200]   once in many many many months both my wife and I had been going non-stop for
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.640]   two and a half years in a row to raise our boy. Our days would often go from 5
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.920]   a.m. to 11 p.m. because he wasn't a good sleeper and has the endless energy of
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.400]   the Sun. I swear he must have been born out of the Sun because he just goes on
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.820]   and on and on. I was also on a mission to fulfill my 10-year goal of posting three
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.080]   times a week and the hardest thing you can ever do is try to write and create
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.960]   and come up with new ideas when you've got a toddler banging on your door
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.120]   wanting to play with daddy. I swear to God it is just impossible so that's why
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.800]   my hours just kept on getting longer or I'd wake up earlier or I just start work
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.440]   and writing later and it was pretty tough. Meanwhile my wife was on a mission
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.720]   to make sure he had an enriching a home environment as possible and she was the
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.920]   commander of the Knights and he wasn't a good sleeper. So preschool gave us the
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.200]   vacation from parenthood we so desperately needed. It is absolutely true
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.000]   that once a child is born your love life, your relationship kind of goes way down
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.480]   for the first couple of years. Just look at all the studies and all the research.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.720]   Happiness goes way down, freedom goes way down, everything goes way down and when
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.360]   you have absolute freedom to suddenly having no freedom because you've got to
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.200]   take care of little one, it's pretty rough and I think it's much rougher than
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.000]   if you were going to a day job for 12 hours a day and then had to come back.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.400]   You know you're tired as hell but it's only like a couple hours before your
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.160]   child has to go to bed. When our boy started going to preschool for six to
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.760]   eight hours a day I felt like the heavens had parted. My happiness went
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.360]   from about a six out of ten back up to an eight out of ten on average. So
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:33.160]   preschool can save your relationships and it can save you from misery. Two, your
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.520]   child will learn to be more independent. It must be scary for a child to go from
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.880]   always being around his parents to suddenly being in a room full of
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.640]   strangers but over time your child will adapt, learn the names of everyone and
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.120]   figure out how to stand his or her ground. Our children will also learn how
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.760]   to interact well with others. As a son of US Foreign Service parents I clearly
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.040]   remember the scariness of being the new kid in school every two to four years
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.360]   but I believe the frequent moves forced me to develop social skills and greater
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.960]   confidence. Today I love going to all types of social gatherings and have no
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.840]   fear of talking to anybody. Three, preschool may help develop greater
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.920]   emotional intelligence in your child. The higher your emotional intelligence the
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.040]   farther in life you'll go because people will end up liking and supporting you
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.640]   more. I gotta say there are a lot of socially awkward and emotionally
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.000]   unintelligent people out there. For example there are people out there who
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.480]   have no respect for your time so they come 20 minutes late and don't even give
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.040]   you a heads up. There are people who will ask for something from you without first
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.600]   giving something. They'll just take take take and never give. So these are the
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.240]   folks who I think just didn't develop the proper emotional intelligence. They
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.200]   weren't guided to thinking about other people first before thinking about
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.560]   themselves and as a result they end up being really greedy and I think
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.560]   self-centered and I think it's just not a good way to go and live about life.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.680]   Four, your child will experience and learn conflict resolution. Someone told
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.000]   me an interesting quote and he said the greatest violence you will ever
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.840]   experience is in public school. Now that was just specifically to public school
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.800]   and just grade school but I was thinking about that quote and I think it's really
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.280]   true. I remember as a kid I got in a lot of fights and I got suspended, I almost
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.880]   got expelled. There's just a lot of bad things going on and just for preschool
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.280]   amongst toddlers inevitably bad things will happen. The first time I was told a
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.080]   child had bitten our son I was shocked and angry. I wanted to know who that
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:44.720]   child was and who his parents were so I could talk to them and make sure that
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.560]   they're doing everything possible to make sure their kid is not going to be a
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:54.360]   terror. But you know what I couldn't find out because that just is the way it is
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:59.200]   in preschool and I learned to adapt and I think my son learns to adapt by
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.320]   understanding that bad things happen and the teachers use these situations as
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:09.120]   conflict resolution to talk about apologizing, to talk about conflict
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.760]   resolution, to talk about forgiveness and so forth. Five, your child will learn new
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.640]   habits. One of the biggest reasons why my wife and I were so exhausted as
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.800]   stay-at-home parents was because our boy didn't take regular naps after he turned
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.040]   about 18 months old. Therefore one of our biggest fears was that when he went to
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:31.360]   preschool he wouldn't nap between 12 30 p.m. and 3 p.m. when lights were off. But
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:37.200]   surprisingly during the very first day he napped and he continued to nap every
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.160]   single day for three months except for one day. So during the time your child is
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.960]   in preschool he or she is gonna learn new habits, a new way of doing things in
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.520]   a social setting and I think he or she will surprise you on the upside. Six,
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.080]   you'll learn how soft or hard you really are as parents. You'll gain perspective
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.200]   especially for first-time parents. We had no idea whether we were strong
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:07.000]   disciplinarians, too soft, too hard, so forth. You can learn from the good and
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.160]   bad habits of other parents by observing how their children act in a school
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.600]   setting and from your observations you can better calibrate what you should be
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:20.120]   doing more of and less of. My wife and I are probably on the softer side because
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:25.200]   our personalities are pretty chill. Also we don't have to go anywhere and follow
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.760]   a strict schedule. For example since we don't have to get to work by let's say
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.720]   8 a.m. there was no urgency to wake up our boy at a set time every single
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.040]   morning, prepare breakfast, brush his teeth and so forth. The absence of
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.800]   routine probably hurt all of our ability to sleep more soundly because our son
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.720]   would just kind of sleep whenever. I mean we do try, we try to get him to sleep by
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:52.960]   9 o'clock, 9.30 but you know sometimes things didn't happen and as a result you
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.080]   know we all kind of suffered for like two, two and a half years of sleep
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.280]   deprivation. You may also learn in preschool what you've been doing right
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.120]   as parents. You know they say that speaking to your child as much as
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.880]   possible is good for learning, therefore we talk to him all day long in English,
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.200]   Mandarin, Spanish and Japanese but we really didn't know how useful our
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.440]   efforts were until we went to school after our teachers said they'd be
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.440]   teaching the class how to count to 10 and we found that really interesting and
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.800]   we looked at each other and smiled because we had already been teaching him
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.400]   how to count to a thousand and I don't know if that's great or not but you know
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:32.840]   we just why stop at 10? Okay what's after 10? 11, 12, 100, 200, 500, 1000, million,
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:37.000]   trillion, quadrillion, whatever and we're not tiger parents we just kind of did
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.520]   what we thought was natural. So preschool is a great way to calibrate your
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:48.400]   parenting skills and figure out where you stand as parents. 7. Your kid won't
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.840]   get dumbed down. This was one of my biggest concerns whether my son would
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.280]   regress or get bored if he was being taught something he already knew in
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.240]   preschool. Fortunately that doesn't seem to be how the young brain works. Instead
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:04.960]   of regressing it continues to absorb new information. If parents continue to
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.520]   provide supplemental education at home I think our kids will continue to grow
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:14.280]   just fine. 8. You'll develop a support network of other parents. Spending the
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.600]   vast majority of your time only with your partner and child can get very
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.400]   mundane after a while and if you are a stay-at-home parent or a single parent
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.880]   you're gonna really appreciate the network of other parents who are going
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.800]   through the same thing you're going through. You're gonna be able to get tips,
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.400]   maybe you might make a friend or two, it's nice to go to random you know
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.000]   birthday parties and social functions on the weekend and mix things up. 9. Your
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.800]   child will participate in new activities. You can do plenty of fun things at home
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.400]   but there are certain activities like painting and claymation and science
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:52.160]   water experience that are much easier to do in school. Your child will also be
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.640]   exposed to new books and toys to keep him or her stimulated throughout the day.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:01.600]   10. The other thing is consistency. As stay-at-home parents we get tired, we also
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.720]   get a little bit bored. So with a preschool setting there are multiple
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:10.600]   teachers who rotate often time and continue to stick to new programs and
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.720]   new ways of doing things. So that consistency is really helpful to create
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.800]   an elevated level of excitement and newness every single day. And the final
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.080]   benefit of preschool, I think it's a lifesaver if you are pregnant or have a
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:31.120]   baby. Being pregnant or caring for a baby is already difficult. Concurrently caring
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.320]   for a baby and a toddler who won't stop running around and getting in trouble
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:41.080]   takes Herculean strength. For all the mothers out there who are just tired and
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:47.760]   exhausted, I feel you, I hear you and just know one thing that a doctor told me, it
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:53.560]   takes nine months to create a baby and nine months to recuperate. So give your
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:59.000]   body some time to heal and don't be too hard on yourself. By sending your toddler
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.620]   to preschool not only do you feel great that a highly qualified person is
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.240]   teaching and caring for him or her, but you feel great that you get to spend
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:11.200]   more time taking care of your body or your baby. It is also natural for the
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.840]   older sibling to get jealous of the baby sometimes. Therefore this separation may
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.620]   help lessen the jealousy and increase the harmony at home. And who doesn't want
[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:26.380]   as much harmony at home as possible. So of course not everything is perfect. Here
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.220]   are some downsides to preschool you'll likely experience, or at least your kids
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:35.600]   will likely experience. One, more sickness. Despite a "don't come to school sick"
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:40.280]   policy, I'm sure some kids still do because parents have to work and also
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:44.560]   nobody knows exactly when a sickness stops being contagious. Your child will
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:49.320]   get sick much more often and as a result you will probably get sick much more
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.400]   often as well. But hopefully in the long run this builds the child's immune
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:59.080]   system and he or she will be less sick as he or she gets older. Two, more chance
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:03.920]   of danger. You're basically letting go of your child and having someone else care
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:09.240]   for him or her. And in a school setting it's probably six to ten kids per
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:15.360]   teacher and one person can only see and care so much. It's very unlike at home
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.920]   where it's a one-to-one ratio or maybe a one-to-two ratio. So your little one will
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:26.000]   inevitably get hurt, injured, bonked, bitten, whatever the case may be. Hopefully it'll
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.600]   never be something life-threatening. You know I pray that nothing bad ever
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:37.200]   happens to our son and your children. But expect accidents to happen. Three,
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.640]   activities at home may change. You know one of my favorite activities I used to
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:46.080]   do with my boy was to go for a one-hour walk around the neighborhood. We'd go
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:51.080]   everywhere and it was so fun to get exercise, to eat on a curbside step, to
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:56.920]   see new garage doors, to see the sunset and so forth. Now when he comes home he's
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:01.720]   tired and he hardly ever wants to walk with me and it's a little bit sad. But
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.840]   when we do it's maybe for 15 minutes and then back home he goes because he misses
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:10.600]   mommy as well. So expect activities to change and you've got to adjust
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:15.040]   accordingly. And then finally it's the cost right. Most cities in America don't
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:20.200]   have universal preschool. Therefore expect to pay between $800 to about
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:26.320]   $2,500 for preschool a month depending on location and amount of care. We pay
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:31.240]   $1,950 a month for full-time care plus about a thousand dollars a year for
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.680]   fundraisers which will inevitably happen because we want to support our teachers,
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.960]   we want to support the facilities and so forth. It's not like they're making tons
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.240]   of money even though the cost is so high. You know we could go down to part-time
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:48.240]   care three days a week for $1,650 a month but we prefer the flexibility. So
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.200]   the cost is something you've got to calculate and it's always a cost-benefit
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:57.880]   analysis. Do you pay this cost and then go to work and you better be making
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:02.640]   enough money to afford it and you better like your job enough to want to spend 10
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:07.720]   to 12 hours a day at your job. Otherwise it may be better to stay at home. So in
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:13.240]   conclusion I say preschool is worth it. Preschool is a necessity to help support
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:18.360]   parents careers. If your child can learn while also giving you the ability to
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:22.520]   earn, that's a great combo. For us preschool has allowed us to gain back
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:27.320]   some of our freedom. Not all, some of it six to eight hours a day. During the
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:31.240]   weekdays we've gone back to doing more of the things we love to do like write,
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:36.440]   play tennis, go out to eat, go to the beach, nap and so forth. And I'm
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:41.120]   noticeably happier than I was before you went to preschool. So happiness, how do
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:46.520]   you put a price on happiness? I really can't. I would pay I don't know 25% of my
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:51.000]   net worth if I could increase my happiness by one point out of ten. Sure
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.120]   why not. Happiness is what it's all about. And children are a joy but make no
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:01.040]   mistake about it they also bring about tremendous amount of suffering, sadness,
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:07.040]   fear and frustration too. And so with this happiness alone I think preschool
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:12.800]   is worth all the money in the world. As long as your children enjoy preschool, I
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.040]   think preschool is one of the best things you could do for them. Make sure
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.840]   you consistently ask your kids how their day was and whether they are having fun.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:25.760]   If they're having a great time then keep on having them go. If they're not, ask
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:31.080]   them why, see if you can figure out some ways to improve their experience, talk to
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:36.560]   their teachers or find them a new school or keep them at home. Every child adapts
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:41.680]   to school differently. It's up to us as parents to find the best environment for
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:46.240]   our children to learn. Thanks so much everyone. If you have any thoughts or
