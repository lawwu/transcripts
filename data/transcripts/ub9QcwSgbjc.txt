[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   What are you eating freeberg? Is that buffalo jerky? What is
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.880]   that? It's a red pepper. It is not the bolt on
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.640]   lunch. I got I got pistachios. And I got
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.480]   Oh, wait, wait, look at this.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.600]   branded pistachios. Are these the best pistachios? They're the
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.920]   best salt and vinegar. Yeah.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.720]   Are those unpublished? These guys are so rich. People peel
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.960]   their nuts. People have been peeling my nuts since the
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.840]   Facebook IPL.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.680]   Oh,
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:50.600]   everybody, welcome to Episode 121 of the world's greatest
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   podcast, the all in podcast with me again, of course, the
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.680]   dictator himself, Chamath Palihapitiya, the Sultan of
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.280]   science, David Friedberg, and the rain man himself. Yeah,
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.760]   definitely. David Sachs, gentlemen, how are you doing?
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.600]   The world's greatest genuflector.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.920]   The world's greatest moderator is here. Oh, this you guys, I
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.080]   got to tell you something, the grift is on a lot of corporate
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.000]   gigs for me to moderate. I don't even have to prepare. I just
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.960]   show up and moderate.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.720]   So great. What is an example of such a such a gig?
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.280]   There's a lot of corporations and conferences that pay a
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.400]   pretty penny to have the world's greatest moderator come and
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.200]   interview people. This is like the used car parts Association
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.000]   of America. I think I did one with like 1000 litigators at an
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.640]   attorney conference for like the SAS software they all use and it
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.360]   was a wonderful far side. You know, it's great. This is like
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.800]   the grift is
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.920]   do you have to fly commercial? Where they fly private?
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.240]   It's commercial at this point. Yeah.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.080]   What is your what is your rider say? What kind of you want? Do
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.600]   you ask for spice salted macadamia nuts?
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.600]   I do not have to build my nuts. No. What I do is I blend the
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.680]   travel costs into the speaking fee. And then nobody knows when
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.040]   I'm in or out what hotel I'm staying at or whatever. But
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.760]   basically, I'm back on the road, folks. I'm back.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.040]   Do you get like a trailer? Do you get? You know,
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.040]   no, no, no. What he's saying is, no, what he's saying is he
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.880]   gets a $2,500 travel budget. And instead, he comes the day of and
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.120]   leaves the day of saving and netting himself an extra 2500.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.040]   Well, you know, you can optimize if you're saying optimize I did
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.600]   use I had, you know, during COVID I racked up a million and a
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.520]   half 2 million of these United points. And I have just been
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.040]   grinding those United points down. So shout out to United and
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.520]   the pandemic. All right, there's a lot of news.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.240]   So you're right, your mouth's even worse than that.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.840]   It's even worse than that for travel expenses when he's not
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.640]   even paying anything.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.200]   Maybe Jason's part of the part of the grifters using the cash
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.840]   app to commit fraud and murder.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.800]   I mean, that Hindenburg report is, I mean, it's a work of art,
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.160]   but we got to start with the Fed hiking rates by 25 basis points.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.240]   And the general feeling in the country that maybe the Fed
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.480]   doesn't know what they're doing. And maybe it's time for regime
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.040]   change. The Fed increased rates by 25 basis points yesterday,
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.400]   Wednesday. So the Fed has increased the federal funds rate
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.840]   from nearly zero in March of 2022. To now the range of 4.75
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.760]   to 5% fastest rate hike since the 70s. speculation, the Fed
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.960]   might pause rate hikes, or even cut due to the recent banking
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.400]   failures didn't happen. So if you bet that they were going to
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.560]   pause, you were wrong. If you bet they were going to cut, you
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.080]   were also wrong. But the market has ripped a bit a day after
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.080]   I eat which people are trying to figure out in the group chats
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.000]   doesn't seem like anybody has a theory here. But let's start
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.840]   with sacks. Maybe an explainer a little bit on how the Fed works.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.840]   There's a board there, people serve a 14 year term. I guess
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.560]   they replace somebody every two years. And Jerome Powell was
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:19.240]   placed in 2018 by Trump. And I guess there's a lot of hand
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.400]   ringing now that they were late on inflation, obviously. And
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.520]   then they went too fast. And maybe now they're not slowing
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.920]   down enough. So what's your take on it objectively sex, putting
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.040]   aside partisanship and, you know, for this administration
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.040]   versus that administration, just objectively, do they know what
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.120]   they're doing? And how could they do a better job?
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.440]   No, I don't think they know what they're doing. They clearly
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.920]   reacted way too late to the inflation. We've talked about
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.280]   this before we had that surprise inflation print in the summer of
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.240]   2021 5.1%. They said it was transitory. They didn't react
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.360]   until November, they continued to eat for another six months.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.720]   And they've suddenly got hawkish in November of 2021. And they
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.640]   didn't even start the first rate increase until March of 2022. So
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.760]   they were really asleep at the wheel and late to react to the
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.600]   inflation by about nine months. Now I think they're potentially
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.840]   making the opposite decision, which is they are late to
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.760]   recognize what stress and distress the economy is under
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.600]   right now. And pal had there was three choices they could have
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.000]   made at this meeting, they could have raised rates, which is what
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.640]   they did. They could have cut rates, which they didn't, or
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.560]   they could have done nothing basically held pat. And the
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.800]   argument for raising rates is just that while we have this
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.200]   inflation problem, we need to keep raising interest rates
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.880]   until the rates are above inflation, and that will bring
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.680]   inflation down, then you can start to lower rates. That's
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.120]   sort of the conventional view. I think the problem with that view
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.600]   is it ignores that we've just seen a run of bank failures. And
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.120]   there's tremendous stress building up in the banking
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.600]   system, from unrealized losses on long dated bonds. Also,
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.360]   unrealized losses on commercial real estate loans. And we've
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.720]   barely scratched the surface of seeing that problem. That's I
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.560]   think, the next shoe to drop in this whole thing. So I think
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.920]   that the right decision here was to either cut rates or to stand
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.080]   pat, you may have seen that Elon said, Listen, we should be
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.360]   cutting rates here. There's way too much latency in this
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.320]   inflation data, the economy is seizing up. And we don't need to
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.760]   be raising rates right now, we actually need to be cutting
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.440]   them. I think that probably, if it were me, looking at the
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.360]   upside downside of these decisions, I probably would
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.240]   have just stood pat because, again, we've just seen this
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.920]   banking crisis, why won't you just wait one month to see,
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.320]   maybe there is latency in the inflation data, maybe that
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.600]   banking crisis is not over. Why won't you just stand pat for one
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.280]   month, you can always raise rates in a month. I think that
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.440]   this move here could, in hindsight be seen as the straw
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.600]   that breaks the camel's back.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.520]   Chamath, would you have paused and waited to see another card?
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.320]   And then watch the hand developed? Or do you think
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.520]   they're doing the right thing by raising or should they have cut?
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.600]   I think they did the worst thing possible, which is they took the
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:10.400]   middle path. If you think about what the Fed has the ability to
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.560]   do, they obviously have the ability to raise in lower
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.280]   interest rates. But what we don't talk about is they have a
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.960]   balance sheet that can absorb assets. For the last 10 or 15
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.920]   years, we've had a phenomenon called quantitative easing. And
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.440]   for folks that have don't understand what that means, that
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.760]   is essentially the Federal Reserve, buying assets out of
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.760]   the market and giving people money for it so that that people
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:41.520]   can then go and buy other things with that money. Last June, they
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.960]   started what's called quantitative tightening, which
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.880]   is essentially reversing that policy and restricting the
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:55.160]   liquidity in the system. So if you look at those tools, and you
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:00.120]   sort of play a game tree on what the Fed could have done, I think
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:07.200]   that you have two choices. One is you massively let inflation
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:14.880]   run amok, where you have no tools to fix. Or you have massive
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.000]   illiquidity in the financial system. But you actually do have
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.840]   tools to fix that, which is through some combination of
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.840]   quantitative easing and tightening, depending on how
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.400]   much liquidity you want in the system. So I think actually, I
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.560]   disagree with sacks, I think they should have done the
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.360]   opposite, they should have raised 50 bps, it would have
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:38.880]   created a little bit more chaos in the short term. But it would
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.440]   have set us up to understand what was fundamentally broken,
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.800]   and still give the Federal Reserve the ability to use their
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.120]   balance sheet and use liquidity in the future to solve the
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.440]   problem. They took the worst option, which is neither did
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:57.080]   they cut, nor did they raise enough. And so this problem that
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.480]   sacks represents actually is the fundamental problem now, which
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.320]   is you won't have enough clarity and signal to really know whether
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.320]   this 25 basis point enough, look, I've maintained now for
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.160]   nine months, that rates are going to be long, higher than we
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.680]   like and longer than we want. And so I think it's high time
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.880]   that we acknowledge that we have a sticky inflation problem,
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.800]   whose back we have to break. We've known since Volcker era,
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.320]   what we need to do to do that, which is you need to get interest
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.920]   rates to be greater than terminal inflation, which means
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.160]   that a 5% Fed funds rate is insufficient. So we're going to
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:43.040]   need to see a print of five and a half 5.75%. And that's when
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.200]   you're going to have enough contraction, and then the Fed
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.320]   can come back with liquidity. But if they don't take these
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.440]   steps, we're going to be in this very choppy, neither here,
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.760]   neither there situation. And I think that is what causes the
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.680]   real damage. Because it's the corrosive effects of uncertainty
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.960]   and what that does to lending to risk taking and I think is
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.040]   really bad for the economy.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.400]   Freiburg, where do you land we have sack saying they should
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.160]   have stood Pat, which not saying either go hard, take the
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:11.760]   medicine.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:17.000]   I don't know. I'm not like an economist on judging the balance
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.160]   that they're trying to weigh right now. I think everyone's
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.560]   got a different you can hear a cacophony of opinions on this
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:29.040]   one. What I'm more interested in is you know, we talked a lot
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.400]   about the banking crisis underway. And I know we're going
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.480]   to talk about this question on commercial real estate in a
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.320]   minute. But if you look at the yield on the 10 year Treasury, I
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:44.880]   think coming out of this past two weeks, you know, the yield
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.160]   on the 10 year Treasury dropped from 4.1% down to looks like it
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:55.800]   closed at 3.4% today, nearly a point 7% decline in the past two
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.600]   and a half, three weeks. And that's also off of 3.8% since
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.520]   the start of the year. And remember when we talked about
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:07.480]   the impact on asset values of banks, I think, if you look
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:12.560]   holistically at the roughly $7 trillion of assets held at
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.160]   banks, some, you know, whatever the set of banks that are that
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:22.640]   we looked at, the average kind of equity ratio is about 15%. So,
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:28.120]   you know, a 2%, or sorry, a 3% adjustment over 10 years on the
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.480]   Treasury impacts the value of a chunk of that portfolio down 25%,
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.240]   which starts to put you into dangerous territory. And there's
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.040]   obviously a distribution of what that does to certain banks that
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.520]   are overweight, you know, 10 year bonds, whether their loan
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.480]   obligations on mortgages or treasuries, or corporate bonds,
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.440]   or real estate bonds, a real estate debt. And so the more
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.600]   encouraging point that I think we should pay attention to is,
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.480]   does the market tell us that these short term rate actions
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:04.320]   are driving down the long the medium and longer term rates in
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.400]   a way that will improve the balance sheets of all these
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.560]   institutions that own a lot of this debt, particularly the
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.400]   banks and funds and so on. And, you know, I'll do the math here
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.760]   real quick, but just in the last two weeks, the impact on the 10
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.120]   year Treasury has probably had a pretty sizable impact, you know,
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.800]   we talked about unrealized losses, it's reduced those
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.360]   unrealized losses, it's improved them. So I think that that's
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:32.240]   like the more important metric to be tracking is, you know, if
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.200]   you look at all the assets that we're all worried about right
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.760]   now, are they going up in value or down in value in a way that
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.400]   introduces more stability into these kind of banking systems
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.680]   that we care about? And I think right now, it looks like maybe
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.280]   things are improving. And that might be part of the optimism
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.680]   around, you know, equity markets and folks buying and so on.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.120]   Yeah. And so this is, I guess, where people have started to
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.120]   talk about the next shoe to drop, we obviously had this
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:01.840]   time based liquidity issues with Silicon Valley Bank. Now, the
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.520]   Wall Street Journal is talking about commercial real estate and
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.400]   how much debt there is, since COVID. Obviously, people are
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.280]   doing more remote work, a lot of the skyscrapers, it's not just
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.000]   San Francisco, but in many locations remain empty or
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.680]   underutilized. People are now having their leases come up.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:24.120]   Every year, more and more of these leases will become vacant.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:29.280]   And then we'll see if these buildings are worth what people
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.800]   paid for them. Smaller banks hold around 2.3 trillion in
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.000]   commercial and real estate debt, including rental apartment
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.440]   mortgages. Almost 80% of commercial mortgages are held by
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.960]   banks, according to this Wall Street Journal story, sacks, you
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.200]   are an owner of some commercial real estate. And you play in the
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.520]   space, you have a lot of firsthand knowledge. What what is
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.920]   your putting aside your personal holdings or exposure? What is
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.440]   your take on what you're seeing? What is the game on the field
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.720]   right now in terms of commercial real estate in San Francisco and
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.120]   beyond?
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.000]   Well, if you talk to the commercial real estate guys,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.320]   they'll tell you that the situation is dire. There's two
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.880]   dire, the there's two problems. First, there's a credit crunch
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.640]   going on. So there's just no credit available. If you're a
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.640]   commercial real estate developer, and you have a
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.240]   building and you want to refinance your construction loan,
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.640]   or put long term debt on a building, you just can't do it.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.200]   I mean, the banks are not open for business. They literally
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.200]   don't want the business. And I think that comes back to the
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.600]   fact that banks right now are hunkered down in a defensive
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.760]   posture. They're seeing deposits flee from their banks, unless of
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.040]   course, you're one of the top four.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.320]   Is that does that freeze on the banks predate the Silicon Valley
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.440]   bank crisis, and it was exacerbated? Were people having a
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.160]   hard time getting loans before that?
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.880]   It predates it, but definitely what you're seeing what you saw
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:51.200]   with SVB and these other banks, including Credit Suisse, is
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.800]   that, you know, banks now are getting much more paranoid. And
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:58.360]   that's why you saw that if you look at the discount window,
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:02.560]   which is when the banks go to the Fed as lender of last
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:07.120]   resorts, and basically post collateral to get liquidity, we
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.560]   had the biggest spike in discount window borrowing since
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.640]   the 2008 financial crisis. Yeah, that line on the right side,
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.040]   that is that is a spike in one week's borrowing. This exceeds
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.840]   anything that happened in 2008. The warning sign should be
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.840]   flashing red over something like this. Now, to bring it back to
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.960]   be clear, that's banks who have real estate exposure, going to
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.480]   the Fed going to the government saying, Hey, can we get some
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.840]   money to cover these?
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.400]   It's not specifically about real estate is more about bank
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.040]   liquidity. The banks are saying we don't have enough liquidity
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:43.720]   right now to cover our needs, which are highly volatile right
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.400]   now, because basically depositors are moving out of
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:52.640]   community and regional and small banks into the big four, so
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.960]   called systemically important or SIP banks. So what's happening
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.480]   is that again, banks are hunkering down, they're getting
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.400]   very defensive, they do not want to make new loans, because they
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.160]   can't tie up assets, they are trying to stay liquid
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.120]   themselves. So that's what's happening now in sort of with
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:14.160]   respect to new lending. And then on the other side of it, you
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.760]   have existing loan portfolios, there's something like $20
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.640]   trillion of commercial real estate debt. And most commercial
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.720]   real estate lending is done by small banks by community banks.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.800]   So they are sitting on these huge CRE loan portfolios. And I
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.800]   think something like 300 billion needs to be refinanced or is
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.120]   coming due in the next year. Normally, that's rolled over and
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.000]   refinanced. There was separately there was a study showing that
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.880]   unrealized losses these loan portfolios in the banking system
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.880]   may be around $2 trillion. It was a study that was reported on
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.240]   by the Wall Street Journal. So in the same way that we had huge
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.720]   unrealized losses in these long dated bonds, I think we also
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.080]   have
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.720]   at Silicon Valley Bank specifically, that's where we
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.280]   say the worst offender, but it's a systemic problem. I think
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.320]   similarly, we have huge unrealized losses in commercial
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.080]   real estate loan portfolios. And this is, I think, even a more
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.680]   subtle and pernicious problem, because with securities like T
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.880]   bills or mortgage bonds, it's very easy to know what the
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.920]   unrealized losses are. The reason why they hadn't realized
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.720]   losses was not because they didn't know what they were, it
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.880]   was because of a stupid accounting rule that said they
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.800]   didn't have to realize the losses if they were, quote,
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.400]   unquote, holding them to maturity. With these loan
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.800]   portfolios, we don't know how big the exposure is. And we
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.040]   won't know until you start seeing some defaults and
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.120]   repricings of assets.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.120]   And real estate is a much more dynamic market, right? You have
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.760]   to have a buyer there, you have leases, you have leases coming
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.160]   off at different times, you have sub leases occurring. And you
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.480]   have the owners of them flipping them right and refinancing them
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.760]   constantly to buy new buildings. And so
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.760]   right, and those loans aren't as liquid, right? With a mortgage
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.880]   bond, those are basically a bunch of loans, mortgage home
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.040]   mortgages, typically that have been packaged up and turned
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.680]   into a security and there's liquid marketplace to trade
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.600]   them. And the case of these loan portfolios, there may not be a
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.960]   liquid marketplace. So you don't really know how impaired that
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.960]   loan portfolio is until you actually get to a place where
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.960]   when will we know what because that's the thing I'm wondering
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:24.200]   we I saw a lot of headlines, you know, Pinterest bought themselves
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.920]   out of their new headquarters in the Bay Area, San Francisco, I
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.680]   believe, specifically, I heard Facebook got rid of a couple
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.920]   billion dollars and wrote down some expansion. Amazon is
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.640]   selling buildings, they had gotten a ton of buildings. And
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.800]   we saw last week, they got rid of another 9000. They're
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.240]   planning another 9000. And they can't get people to come back to
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.760]   the office. So how bad is the overbill? I guess is the
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.120]   question, because that will be the driver of the value of these
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.080]   buildings, because if there's too much supply, then what are
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.440]   these buildings actually worth? Are they worth $90 a square foot?
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.520]   What if there's no what if Amazon doesn't want more space,
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.800]   you can see it in the credit default spreads of these banks,
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.680]   it's in the water table already. So you can Nick, you can just
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.720]   throw it up. If you look at any bank that's lending, and that
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.360]   has a portfolio, this is Deutsche Bank's, you know, euro
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:13.240]   denominated CDS. But it's the same for Barclays, it's the same
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.160]   for sock gen, it's the same for a bunch of American banks, there
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.280]   is a risk in the system that sacks articulated that is now
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.680]   getting priced in, there are all kinds of loans whose payments,
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:28.960]   which the banks need cannot necessarily be insured, which
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.840]   means that then there could be illiquidity there, there could
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.320]   be a flow of deposits out from those banks, which would then
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:39.880]   make their ability to pay their debt holders lower. You also
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.720]   have this complicated issue already, where it's really like
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.640]   the first time in a long, long, long time where debt holders
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.080]   actually got wiped out in the credit suisse debacle before the
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.920]   equity holders did. And that's created all kinds of ripple
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:02.520]   effects. So this credit bubble is here, and it's being
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.760]   manifested right now in these very sophisticated parts of the
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:11.400]   market. And eventually, they'll ripple to the broader economy at
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.040]   large. But how a person feels this is, they're not going to be
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.720]   able to get a car loan or a mortgage or the interest rates
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:22.160]   they pay will go up. And then how bondholders will react to
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.080]   all of this stuff is they'll just start to find different
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.840]   assets, probably the front end of the curve money market cash,
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:34.960]   gold, and they'll just abandon all these assets. And then the
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:39.360]   other problem is that it's just really, really bad for risk
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:45.920]   assets. So the things that we invest in startups, technology
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.040]   companies, either in a world of inflation run amok, because the
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.960]   Fed isn't hiking fast enough, which just destroys future cash
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.400]   flows, or in a world where the Fed pivots in a moment like
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.120]   this, and Nick, you can show the second chart, both result in the
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.120]   same outcome, which is that you just see these massive
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:10.400]   drawdowns in the value of risk assets. So we're in a really
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:15.720]   complicated moment. And this is why I think again, the Fed
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:20.040]   needed to take leadership this past week and actually do the
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:26.400]   hard work of either cutting 50 bps or raising 50 bps. And this
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.160]   middle path is the absolute worst path because trying to
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.640]   thread a needle in this complicated economy, I think is
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.680]   just going to be impossible. And then what happens is then the
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.400]   markets move around them, right, the markets have completely said
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:44.800]   we now discredit what you did. And they're basically banking
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.240]   that the Fed will be forced to cut rates massively in short
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:55.200]   course, because the crisis will be so severe that it'll outweigh
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.080]   the risk of inflation. Think about that.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:03.200]   Yeah. So all this real estate comes on the market. There's no
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.800]   buyers for it. The mortgages are due. Does that mean a commercial
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.320]   real estate owner just basically gets foreclosed on and they hand
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.720]   the keys back to the bank or the banks as this Wall Street
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.320]   Journal story was sort of alluding to that the Fed will
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:20.920]   say, you know what, we'll just extend will backstop this real
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.440]   estate, which happened in the last bubble. And we hope that
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:28.160]   over time, it works itself out and demand returns. Now, of
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:31.240]   course, that's different than a post COVID world. So this time
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:36.920]   could be different. What happens in the case of 2024 2025? All
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.240]   of these office spaces are returned and the keys are handed
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:40.520]   back?
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.480]   Yeah, so okay. So Jason, you asked the question, like, how
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.320]   does this problem manifest? Let me describe from the point of
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:49.200]   view of that real estate owner. There's basically two problems.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.480]   One is that you have a tenant who's in a long term lease,
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.440]   five, 710 years, that lease rolls, so that that lease comes
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.320]   to you. Now, they don't need the space anymore. You know, we know
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.360]   that take San Francisco, which has got to be the worst market
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.480]   for Syria in the country right now, that's something like 30 to
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.560]   40% of the space is vacant. So that's either space for rent or
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.160]   space for sublease, because no one's using it. So they put it
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.240]   back on the market. Well, all those subleases, they're still
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.280]   paying rent because they have a contract. So what happens is as
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.520]   those leases roll, and all of a sudden, you don't pay rent
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.960]   anymore. So you're going to stop or if you still need the space,
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.400]   you're going to negotiate a much, much lower rent. So now
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.040]   all of a sudden, the real estate owner can't make their debt
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.920]   service covenant ratios, the income from the building is
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.440]   just substantially less, they can't make their debt.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:42.360]   So on that and explain that ratio to folks, you have a
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.760]   certain amount of debt you own, let's say Salesforce tower. In
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.880]   Salesforce's case, they're subleasing 125,000 square feet.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.680]   Let's say they were into that for 500 million. What is this
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.720]   debt service ratio? Explain that to the audience
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:58.200]   when the bank underwrites the loan, they just figure out the
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.600]   interest that you got to pay on the loan relative to the value
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.120]   of the building or the income that is generating. But all
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.320]   those ratios are upside down now, because the value of the
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.720]   buildings, the rent has gone down so much because there's so
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.480]   much vacancy. I mean, when these loans were underwritten, San
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.480]   Francisco had like a 5% vacancy rate. And now it's like 30 to
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:19.080]   40%. There's just no tenants. And then you know, in parallel
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.680]   with that, Jason, you've got all these cases where you only have
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.480]   tenants or leases rolling, you have loans rolling, you know,
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.360]   again, if the owner of the building has either a
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.120]   construction loan or like a long term debt, and that needs to
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:35.000]   roll, they have to refinance it. And if they can even get credit,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   which they may not be able to because of this crunch, they're
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.800]   gonna be paying a lot more for it. So now all of a sudden, the
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.000]   income statement for that building doesn't make sense.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.320]   Think about it, your borrowing costs are higher, and your
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.560]   revenue is lower. So now all of a sudden, the buildings
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:51.240]   underwater. So where does that end up? Well, they default on
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.960]   the debt, and the bank ends up owning the building. So then
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.720]   what happens is you end up with, you know, all of downtown San
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.680]   Francisco, owned by a bunch of banks, what are they going to do
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.600]   with it, they don't want to be in the real estate business. So
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.280]   they have to fire sale those buildings in a bunch of auctions
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.080]   at rock bottom prices. Because by the way, there's no cash or
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.080]   liquidity out there. So who are the buyers?
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:10.720]   The buyer?
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.720]   That was like, no, buyers, we have a 30% vacancy rate,
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.360]   there's no renter. So
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:19.040]   so what happens Detroit, like, is it just like a dead city?
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.680]   And then the tax base collapses the city because so much of the
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.160]   tax base is dependent on you know, real estate. So listen, I
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.320]   think they're gonna have to work this out. I don't think they can
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.040]   just let the free market tickets course here, because you're
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.560]   gonna end up with a scenario I just painted. So I think what
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:37.400]   hopefully would happen maybe is that the banks do some sort of
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.520]   deal with the real estate owners that you know, they blend and
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.400]   extend or whatever. But in order to do that, they're gonna need
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.760]   to be backstop by somebody. And that's the Fed
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.480]   freebird. What are your thoughts? Just writ large, as it
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.240]   were on the commercial real estate space, because it's $90.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.360]   It was $90 a square foot, right for class A sacks in the city.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.480]   Is that the price? What's that gonna be? 60 7080 90 bucks a
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.800]   foot, depending on what kind of building you're talking about. I
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.200]   mean, you have all these empty office towers. So look, I never
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.640]   invest in office towers. I do small boutique kind of brick
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:11.520]   and timber spaces in Jackson Square, we're doing okay,
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.360]   because people still want to be in those spaces. But these
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:19.000]   office towers on Market Street, or in Soma, I mean, which is
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   where all the investment went during the boom, nobody wants to
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.600]   be in those buildings anymore. And it doesn't help that the
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.520]   city has allowed this giant, you know, open air drug market to
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.480]   metastasize right outside their door.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.880]   freebird. Yeah, I think it's inevitable, we'll have probably
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:40.080]   two to $3 trillion of federal money. You know, spent to
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.400]   backstop and support the asset. I mean, that's the general theme
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.720]   here in case everyone isn't paying attention at home is that
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:53.200]   the Fed, the US government will continue to print money and
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:57.640]   create programs to effectively support asset values such that
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:03.760]   there isn't a crippling economic ripple effect. And this is the
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:07.760]   dangerous depth spiral of debt. And it's why I always talk about
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.440]   how concerned I am about global debt levels and particularly
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.360]   debt levels in the US, but really global debt levels. I'll
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:17.600]   say the statistic again, and over and over again, 360% global
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.760]   debt to global GDP. But, you know, even within some of these
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.680]   asset classes, a significant amount of debt has been used to
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.920]   fuel asset prices and to fuel equity value. And then that
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.360]   equity value gets levered and reinvested. And so the rippling
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.560]   effect in the economy of declining asset value can be
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:40.040]   magnified through leverage. And it unfortunately, debt in general
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:46.040]   forces growth, without growth, debt fails. And so when we've
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:51.040]   used debt to demand growth, on a macro perspective, it causes,
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.920]   you know, significant stress and strain on the system when you're
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.560]   going through periods of like we are right now, which should be
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.160]   natural recessionary effects from COVID and shutting down the
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.080]   economy, or natural asset price declines because of that. And we
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.800]   can't let it happen. Because if it were to happen, the rippling
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.560]   effect would be crippling. So this is a good example, you'll
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.240]   probably I don't know what the facility will look like. Maybe
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.280]   the government passes some congressional bill that says,
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.320]   Hey, guys, here's $3 trillion to support, you know, all this real
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:22.240]   estate is another, you know, 2 trillion to support banks and,
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.920]   you know, giving them liquidity. Because the other problem, as
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:29.560]   you guys know, is most people's most of the population in the US
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.600]   has most of their assets, their asset value or their equity
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.160]   value in their home. And those home prices are supported by
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.960]   residential loan programs. And, you know, if you actually have a
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.800]   massive write down of the value of that asset class, that's when
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.440]   you know, everything kind of falls apart. So you know, we
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.720]   will continue to be buoyed by that, that that kind of
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.680]   inflationary behavior, unfortunately, biology, I think
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:58.000]   has it right, we'll talk about it in a minute, that there has
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.160]   to be money printing to get out of this hole. I don't know if
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.560]   it's necessarily in this moment, hyper inflationary, as he
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.920]   predicts, you know, he uses the Deutsche Mark and the Weimar
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.800]   Republic as this kind of storyline that this is what's
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.560]   about to happen in the US. The truth is, it looks a little bit
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.120]   more like the pound sterling at the end of the British Empire,
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.160]   where you know, there's certainly an inflationary and
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.080]   devaluation effect that arises, but it's not it is the reserve
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.720]   currency of the world today. Let's say it's really hard to
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.000]   kind of just say, hey, it's going to be hyper inflationary,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.520]   and the value is going to go to zero, it's just not going to
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:32.160]   happen. So that seems to be the dollar of the dollar. Yeah. So
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.880]   that seems to be the bet now chum off that some folks are
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:41.360]   predicting catastrophizing, hey, this is the end of US
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.880]   supremacy, the end of the dollar, of course, modern
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.040]   monetary theory seems to state you can just keep printing
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.040]   dollars and make a couple trillion dollar coins and
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:53.320]   backstop it. And by the way, tarp was profitable modestly for
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.000]   the United States and the backstop of real estate totally
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.440]   work. So where do you land on this? Do you think these
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:02.400]   backstops and modern monetary theory stating that you can just
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.880]   print money you own your own fiat currency is going to work?
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:09.400]   Or as we pivot to the billion dollar? I'm sorry, the million
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:13.840]   dollar apology Bitcoin bet that this is the end of days.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.840]   I think it's not the end of days. But I think you're
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.120]   conflating a bunch of things together. So look, mm t. Yes, I
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:24.920]   am. Yes. Was, in hindsight, idiotic. In the moment, it
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.560]   never quite made sense. But in hindsight, it's clearly
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:32.240]   idiotic. And I think that we can properly dispense with that.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:38.000]   But the reason that we print so much money is sort of what
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.520]   freebrook says, which is that we just want a well functioning
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:46.400]   society. And the simplest and shortest way to do that is to
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.640]   make sure that there aren't any winners and losers anymore. And
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.880]   the most effective way to do that in the markets is with
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.560]   money, print a bunch of money, and there are no more winners
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.280]   and losers. And so everybody can kind of win, some people may,
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:03.240]   may win more, but nobody really ever loses. So I think that's
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:09.320]   the that's the mo that we're operating under. The thing is, I
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:09.440]   don't
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.960]   something unhealthy to that, Chamath, you're sort of a loony,
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.280]   but no losers.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:17.240]   That's a more philosophical and a commentary on capitalism and a
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.240]   bunch of other things. And you're right, I don't think it
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.960]   makes sense. I do think you need winners and losers to really
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:27.080]   make society function well. But the other part of it is like,
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:32.480]   does it reinforce? Or does it decay, US dollar hegemony, and I
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:36.440]   think it actually reinforces it. And the reason is just very
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:40.320]   practically speaking, when you look at how dependent other
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.920]   people other countries are on the US dollar in times of stress,
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.200]   they actually become more dependent. And that has a lot to
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.960]   do with their boring patterns, the amount of dollars central
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.440]   banks need outside the United States. And so what did you see
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.880]   in a moment of stress, actually, the Fed opened up swap lines to
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.720]   all the central banks that they work with their most important
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.920]   operating partners, so Europe, Canada, Japan, etc, Switzerland,
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:09.160]   and they move the liquidity window from weekly to daily, and
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.000]   they pounded the swap lines. So I don't know, I think that most
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.840]   people that that kind of like, it's like a boy crying wolf,
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.520]   maybe at some point, somebody will be right, but you're going
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:22.320]   to lose so much money trying to take a point of view around this
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:26.360]   topic that it's more practical to just look at dollar flows, and
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:31.040]   dollar flows go up in moments of stress, not go down. And they go
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:34.600]   up in a distributed manner across the monetary plumbing of
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.080]   the world.
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.240]   Right. So let's explain the biology bat since that trended
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.640]   and he is the boy who, as you're saying, cried wolf this past
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:48.240]   week, cry Bitcoin. Yeah, the boy. So a friend of the pod,
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:53.200]   apology, on March 17, predicted that Bitcoin will reach $1
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:33:00.240]   million in 90 days, due to us hyperinflation. hyperinflation
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:04.400]   is defined as prices going up 50% month over month, just so
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.040]   we're clear on exactly how dramatic that is. He made the
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:12.720]   bet on March 17, against a pseudo anonymous Twitter user,
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.520]   James Medlock, who said they would bet 1 million that the US
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:20.440]   would not experience hyperinflation. So biology sort
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.280]   of inserted Bitcoin into that bet. It wasn't a Bitcoin bet
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.520]   that and I think he's done two of these bets. So he's betting
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:31.000]   2 million in total on Bitcoin hitting 1 million by June 17,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.800]   which there's probably no chance of that happening or a very tiny
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.960]   chance I'll ask the panel in a second. Bitcoin was trading at
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:43.800]   25 26,000 at the time, it's now trading at over 28,000. And
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.360]   Balaji has been on every podcast known to man in the last 72
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.040]   hours talking about this. I've watched one or two of them. And
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:55.200]   it's a pretty out there argument, I think. You can just
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.560]   type in biology on YouTube and watch any of the 20 he's done.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:02.120]   He believes regional banks are insolvent. He thinks the feds
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.800]   needs is going to need to print a massive amount of money. Like
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:09.520]   we've said here, do more QE and then cut rates all seems
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.240]   reasonable, but that that will lead to hyperinflation. It's not
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:16.480]   reasonable. Wow. No, no, it's not that it's reasonable. We
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.200]   just print we just printed that they're going to cut rates we
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.040]   just discussed they're going to eventually cut rates and there'll
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.000]   be more QA. So that part is reasonable. Just that one
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.480]   little piece. But then he believes is the part that is
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.280]   kind of out there, that hyperinflation is going to
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:34.680]   devalue the dollar and this is the time he does not and I made
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:38.240]   a bunch of I asked him this a bunch of times and he would not
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:41.240]   be honest about it, or didn't want to answer my question. I
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:44.800]   said, Hey, what percentage are you in Bitcoin? Somebody says
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.120]   he's 99% of Bitcoin, he will not confirm. And so I was like,
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.600]   well, if you want 1000 bitcoins, if this goes up, you know, a
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.000]   very small amount, four or 5%, you're going to pay for the
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.800]   bets. And are you talking your own book here or not? sacks?
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.080]   What do you think of this overall bet? Is it a stunt?
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:05.040]   Yeah. He's saying like, this is the lifeboats moment. And just
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:09.040]   to add to it, he says, you have to leave the United States and
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.720]   get to Singapore, or a place or if you're going to stay in the
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.960]   United States, you need to get to Wyoming or Texas or somewhere
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.760]   that explicitly allows Bitcoin, because the closer you are to
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.320]   the United States banking system, what happened to Silicon
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.480]   Valley Bank on that fateful weekend where people couldn't
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:26.320]   get their cash and we're going to have to, you know, miss
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:30.080]   payroll. He says that's the dry run for the entire US banking
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.080]   system, sacks.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.080]   So first of all, I don't think you can disparage biology
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:38.000]   because someone who cries wolf says this repeatedly, and it
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.640]   makes a dire prediction repeatedly and is wrong. And we
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:44.560]   can't say yet that biology is wrong. Do I think that we're
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.320]   gonna have a million dollar Bitcoin in 90 days? I
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:50.280]   personally find that very unlikely, but you can't say yet.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:55.080]   He stuck his neck out making a prediction that will be easily
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:59.320]   falsified if he's wrong. Second, the last time that biology made
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:04.040]   a dire prediction was COVID. And he was right about that one. So
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:07.240]   you can't say that this is just like a doomer who throws out
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.800]   crazy predictions and is always wrong. He's actually pretty
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:13.080]   selective about his now that one predictions. Yeah, there was a
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:18.040]   tweet from January 30 of 2020, in which he basically predicted a
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.600]   pandemic based on a Coronavirus and laid out a whole bunch of
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:25.640]   consequences that mostly came true. Which is why we're
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.680]   talking about this. This is not just some like random person
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.800]   like he actually has, yes, pedigree and a track record.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.600]   Here's my view on it.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.920]   Doop and gloop. Yes, him and the same to lab the two of our
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.600]   opening speakers at all in summer 2023. Those are we are
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.520]   bookhead speakers.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:48.280]   Book them now anyway, so so look now, what do I think about it? I
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.440]   I posted my own theory today, which I would call sort of
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:57.880]   biology light. Which is okay, look, if you if you think about
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.000]   the spiking interest rates that we've had, and that's my
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.280]   things, why should continue quite a bit longer, there are
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:06.360]   three main effects that it indisputably has number one,
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.800]   undercuts the value of long dated bonds. Number two, it's
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:13.120]   made lending much more expensive, particularly for big
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.480]   purchases like real estate. Number three is increased
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:18.440]   government lending costs. Okay, now, play that through the
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.400]   financial system. What does that mean? Well, if the value of long
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.440]   dated bonds has sharply decreased, well, that's led to
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:27.920]   this banking crisis with the unrealized losses that's already
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.640]   happened. Number two, it's made lending more expensive, the
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.960]   credit crunch and CRE, where we need to see that. And I believe
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.600]   that's going to play out as the second crisis of this larger
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:40.360]   financial crisis. And then number three is the increase in
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.560]   government borrowing costs that will eventually play out in
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:46.600]   terms of being a government debt crisis of some kind. And I think
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:50.200]   it'll involve, you know, a spike in borrowing costs, the federal
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.240]   level and involve sovereign debt issues internationally, I think
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:58.600]   it will involve budget deficits at states and cities. So I think
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:02.520]   there's three phases to this financial crisis. We're in phase
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:05.480]   one, and I think CRE and government debt are the next two
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.440]   phases. And I think I think a lot of that lines up with what
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.720]   biology thinks, where I disagree with him is I don't think we can
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.200]   know what's going to happen in 90 days, I think that the CRE
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:18.280]   crisis is highly deflationary, it's going to create distress
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:21.360]   everywhere in the economy, that is going to lead to a massive
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.480]   reduction in liquidity. I think that the government debt crisis,
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:28.000]   assuming the government wants to inflate and monetize the debt as
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.720]   a way to solve that problem, that will be highly inflationary.
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:34.920]   But when these things play out, we can't know, I think that's
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:38.960]   what makes this really hard is I think jumping all the way to the
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.440]   sort of finish line and saying we're gonna have a million
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.480]   dollar Bitcoin in 90 days, because the US dollar is
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.240]   worthless. I think that's premature. I think this could
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.640]   play out over the next couple of years,
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:53.400]   we have a real problem if Bitcoin is the exit ramp. Why
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:58.120]   an inflationary crisis because it's not accessible enough. It's
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:01.920]   not easily transactable for for I'm sorry to be negative to the
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:06.080]   Bitcoin maximalists. I'm generally in favor of this kind
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:11.200]   of independent storage system that's outside of government
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.320]   and state control. I think there's just this unfortunate
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.760]   reality. I mean, we saw what the Wells noticed a coinbase today.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.520]   They just arrested that that crypto guy,
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.760]   go Quan was arrested in Quantum, Negro,
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:25.840]   great country, cracking won't let you wire money in or out as
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:30.000]   if I think Monday or Tuesday. And so you know, it's clearly
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.920]   becoming kind of a less accessible system of storage.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.840]   No, what's more accessible? Well, I do think that one of the
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.320]   reasons we're seeing the market move the way it does is because
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:42.000]   folks are shifting their risk assets around quite a bit right
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.400]   now, to figure out where's a good place to put money. I was
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:52.880]   talking with a asset manager, you know, this morning, and you
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.320]   know, they had a very strong point of view, folks are are
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.800]   moving capital away from what they think are going to be most
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:02.360]   impacted by the risk of this kind of massive inflationary
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.840]   event that may arise or this massive banking crisis that may
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.640]   arise, or this massive real estate crisis that may arise.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:11.200]   And there are other places to then put your capital. That's
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.880]   not just Bitcoin. And sure, maybe some of these things are
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.840]   dollar denominated. But for example, there are many
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:19.200]   businesses that sell products in non dollar denominated
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:22.000]   currencies globally. And while they report and trade on US
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.920]   stock exchanges, you're buying a security interest in a business
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:28.680]   that generates most of its income, you're referring to
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.680]   many different companies. And so there are many companies that
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.800]   get the bulk of their revenue, the bulk of their sales.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:37.560]   Internationally, there are also many companies that will benefit
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.240]   in an inflationary environment businesses that are tied to
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.600]   other types of real estate businesses that are tied to
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.560]   certain capital equipment where consumption will not go down,
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.360]   unless there's, you know, significant massive, you know,
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.920]   global socioeconomic shock. And so I think that that's kind of a
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:54.120]   lot of what's going on right now. It's less about, hey,
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.840]   Bitcoin is the only place to go and be safe. And it's more about
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:41:00.240]   let me reallocate my risk assets a little bit, you know, to
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:03.920]   places that may be benefit benefit may benefit from, or
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.040]   maybe better guarded from a massive kind of inflationary
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:10.720]   shock. And let me just say, let me say one more thing. I think
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:14.160]   one of the biggest risks that is not being talked about is the
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:20.280]   debt ceiling vote that's due in June. In June, Congress needs to
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:25.960]   pass an increase in the debt ceiling, because the amount of
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:30.040]   debt that the US that the federal government is going to
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:34.080]   have to take on in order to meet our budget deficit and refinance
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:38.160]   our debt and pay our obligations, historically, means
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.880]   that we're going to have to have more than what we're, you know,
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:44.040]   we've approved to date in terms of the total amount of debt. Now,
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.920]   this has historically been a last minute vote, you know,
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:51.960]   crazy, dramatic thing that drives markets nuts. The Hill
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:57.080]   had a public opinion piece from Peter work and Mary space, but I
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.880]   think they make a good point. You know, I've talked to a lot
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:04.240]   of folks who are calling in the fixed income market, but also
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.080]   folks are in the equities markets publicly who are pretty
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:11.000]   nervous about this debt ceiling vote. And if it does look like
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   the Republican Party takes a very hard line, and says,
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.680]   because this is the current party line, if you don't agree
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:24.120]   to massive deficit cuts or spending cuts, and, and really
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:28.280]   commit to that, in a bill that we can pass, that Ben also
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.800]   approves the increase in the debt limit, we are not going to
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:34.240]   approve increasing the debt limit. And you know, what this
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.600]   opinion piece argues, I think is a very good middle of the line
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:40.800]   solution, which is, you know, come up with points of view, and
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:45.280]   actually document those points of view on making sure that
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.400]   government spending is effectively accountable, that
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.600]   there's no more wasteful spending, and that there are
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.280]   certain programs that both parties can very quickly agree
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:56.000]   to, as being, you know, very wasteful. And if you start
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.160]   there, you maybe get enough across the line, that both
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.880]   parties kind of say this makes sense, let's do this. And then
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.360]   we can kind of increase the debt limit. Because in the absence of
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:07.080]   that, the US will have to default on debt, this is always
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.960]   the big threats never happened. And if that happens, or there is
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.880]   the looming threat of that happening, combined with the
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:16.840]   banking crisis combined with, you know, the liquidity crisis
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.600]   combined with the real estate crisis that may be emerging
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.320]   here. Let me ask you a question that you can have things really
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:26.120]   meltdown. So look, because I think this is the biggest like
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.000]   black swan, it's not a black swan, but this is the biggest
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.920]   kind of elephant in the room right now is and sorry, I think
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:35.040]   if people in DC could get together today, and if you could
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.960]   instead of doing the typical last minute 24 hour vote, a day
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.560]   before the debt ceiling needs to be increased, be thoughtful and
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:44.800]   do it. This could be addressed today, it could start to put in
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:48.120]   some of the layers of backstop and coverage and protection and
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.600]   safety that the markets I think really need to manage some of
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.680]   the trepidation in the in the weeks and months ahead.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:56.160]   I want to jump to the crypto crackdown and get your opinion
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.720]   on that sex first. But I want to do a clarifying point here with
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:02.920]   freeberg you have been in the Ray Dalio end of empires,
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:07.600]   empires collapse, and that hey, maybe the US is winding down its
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:13.120]   supremacy and apology was pretty much saying, Yep, this is the
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:18.400]   moment. Where is there any light between your position of like,
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.040]   Hey, Dahlia was correct. This is the end of the empire and
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:24.600]   apologies like it's the end of the empire right now. Where do
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:25.360]   you stand on that?
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:28.520]   Freeberg? So I mean, I've always I've been concerned. I've told
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.320]   you guys this for like three years, and I've obviously
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:34.080]   promoted this book for two and a half years. When Dahlia's
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.400]   points of view, with lots of kind of empirical wisdom behind
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:41.080]   it, I think, indicate that the US is on a path and the way we
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:44.360]   spend and the way we behave, and the way markets are reacting, I
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.760]   think, indicates that a lot of what has happened historically
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:52.840]   is happening now in the US. Now, it doesn't, I don't know if it's
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.680]   going to happen overnight, that that's where I would have light
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:57.960]   with biology. Okay, the notion of kind of hyper inflation,
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:04.760]   again, I think means that, so think about all the US dollar
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:08.360]   holders around the world, it would be a shock for the
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:11.920]   collective system, it would require the collective system to
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:15.240]   collectively agree to get off the dollar very quickly for that
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:18.120]   to really happen. Yeah. In the meantime, I do think there will
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:21.120]   be inflationary effects. I do think there will be massive kind
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:24.760]   of asset value shocks. But I'm not sure there's going to be
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:27.800]   this kind of like Weimar Republic, Deutschland, hyper
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.240]   inflation thing, because it is the reserve currency and it is
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:34.480]   so widely held by everyone, it would require collective giving
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.520]   up. It also seems like there may be you know, we talked a lot
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.840]   about the petro yuan trade, which I think is critical to see
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:42.400]   that actually happen. I think that's going to be the lynchpin
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:45.640]   got it. Maybe that catalyzes us. And that seems to be a little
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:48.560]   bit tightrope right now, too. It doesn't seem super definitive
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.920]   that Saudis are embracing China, there's obviously this behavior
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:55.960]   with a little saber rattling, but there's, you know, it's not
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.720]   as definitive right now. I think that that needs to happen to
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:45:59.640]   kind of really catalyze that
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:03.920]   let's get our tinfoil hats on here for a second. In relation
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.800]   to the biology bet, there has been a lot of action against
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:10.480]   crypto. Obviously, authoritarian countries took control of
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:15.560]   crypto long ago, China, banning it, etc. North Korea, other
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:19.640]   other authoritarian places kind of tighten their grip on it. Now
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:22.160]   here in the United States, Coinbase got a Wells notice.
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:25.680]   That is a warning basically, and giving you a last chance to kind
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:30.000]   of respond to the SEC. And this was based on their loaning
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.160]   programs. And on top of that, a number of other crypto
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.920]   crackdowns have occurred, we saw celebrities getting smacked down
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:43.360]   and getting fines and doing settlements. This has led sacks
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:48.880]   to a theory that the United States government wants to break
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:51.760]   the back of crypto crypto has done a great job of breaking
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.600]   their own back with plenty of crypto grifts insider trading
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:58.680]   and all kinds of shenanigans with FTX and front running and
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:02.440]   painting the tape any grift or criminal activity possible seems
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:07.080]   to have been exploited. Do you think that these two things are
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.520]   in some way coordinated or there's a coordinated effort by
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:14.040]   the US government to destroy and kill crypto as an off ramp for
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.680]   the US dollar while the US dollar is dealing with these
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:17.160]   crises?
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:20.200]   Well, there's a really interesting article that was
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.640]   just published on substack by Nick Carter, who I guess, a
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:27.160]   guest writer on Mike Solana's substack called pirate wires.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:31.040]   This is a follow up piece to an article he wrote six weeks ago,
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:34.240]   where he laid out the an operation by the Biden
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.400]   administration called Operation choke point, which made the case
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.200]   that the Biden administration was quietly attempting to ban
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:44.240]   crypto. And now, you know, a month later, there's all these
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:47.160]   things that are all these steps that the administration is
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:51.320]   taking to go after crypto and he you know, he lays out a bunch
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:54.960]   in a bullet point list. So the SEC announced a lawsuit against
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:58.560]   crypto infrastructure company Paxos crypto exchange crack and
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:02.600]   settle with the SEC. SEC Chair Gensler openly labeled every
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:06.800]   crypto asset other than Bitcoin security. Senate Committee on
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.320]   Environment and Public Works held a hearing land basing
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:12.240]   Bitcoin. Biden administration proposed a bill that singles out
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:15.480]   crypto miners for owners tax treatment. New York Attorney
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:17.840]   General declared a theory on which the second largest crypto
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:22.080]   asset of security. That's a huge change, by the way. Yeah. SEC
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:26.120]   continues to anti consumer protection efforts by doubling
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:30.680]   down their attempt to block a spot Bitcoin ETF. OCC let
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.840]   Crypto Bank protégé his application for a natural
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:36.760]   National Trust Charter expire. And then the SEC just sent
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:40.560]   Coinbase a well as notice. So I think it's hard to argue that
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:46.280]   there isn't a concerted effort now to crack down on crypto by a
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:50.040]   wide variety of government agencies and authorities,
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.720]   starting with Gensler at the SEC, who seems incredibly hostile
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:58.560]   to crypto. So now the only question is, is this correlated
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:02.480]   with the stress that the banking system is under? Is it just a
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.720]   coincidence? And that I don't know. But I think the argument
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:09.680]   biology would make is that at the same time, they're going to
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.800]   deflate the dollar, they're going to make it harder for you
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:17.280]   to find an off ramp. And he actually brought up a historical
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.520]   example that I wasn't aware of, I think it's called executive
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:24.160]   order 6201, which is FDR, way back in the 1930s, actually had
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:27.440]   an executive order that confiscated all the gold private
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.920]   gold bullion in the country. And they seized the gold bullion,
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:34.880]   making the accusation that private citizens were hoarding
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:39.240]   too much gold. So in any event, this is the theory. I don't know
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:43.000]   whether it's true or not, it could be a coincidence.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.320]   Shemoth, you think that this is correlated in any way with the
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.960]   crisis, or is just the fact that FTX blew up and all these other
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:53.040]   things blew up, and the public is really upset that they lost a
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:57.760]   lot of money on this and the SEC has got to cover and be a little
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:01.240]   bit more active instead of reactive when it comes to
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.680]   dealing with the crypto losses that consumers had.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.080]   That's the latter. I mean, I think that there was a rumor
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:12.000]   going around. I don't know how true it is that FTX was days
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   away from getting a critical approval by the SEC to actually
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.040]   even further legitimize their US exchange before they went out of
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:24.680]   business. So I think Gensler had to pivot very hard from at a
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:28.120]   minimum being very pro FTX. And there's all kinds of stories
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:32.800]   about his interrelatedness with Sam and his family to very anti
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:37.880]   bit or anti crypto in general, that's clearly happened. But
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:40.600]   look, I think that this is like a lot of tin hatting, which I
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:44.680]   don't think is very productive. If you look at the total number
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:49.720]   of non zero Bitcoin wallet addresses in the world, and
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:55.520]   let's be extremely generous, and say it's 100 million, there's
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:59.680]   still 7 billion people in the world. And so I just think
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:04.560]   everybody that tries to speak about the fragility of the US
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:09.840]   and worldwide banking system is right. But and that part, I
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:13.200]   think is quite lucid and unemotional. But every time they
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:16.720]   try to connect it to Bitcoin, they sound like a crazy person
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.120]   because they're just talking their book.
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:21.600]   And that is exactly the case, by the way, with this kid, Nick
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:22.040]   Carter.
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:26.280]   And the best example, to demonstrate this is in all of
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:31.800]   this chaos. If Bitcoin or crypto assets in general were truly a
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:39.160]   legitimate off ramp, and salvation from us dollar
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:43.000]   hegemony and all of this stuff, why isn't Bitcoin at least at
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:47.360]   35,000 a coin right now, it's barely above 28,000. It really
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:50.840]   hasn't moved that much. And I think the real answer is that
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:56.960]   most people in Bitcoin are not trying to hedge their existing
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.480]   fiat currency exposure, they're just picking off people in
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:05.080]   retail. They're just trading this thing. I mean, the high
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:09.120]   bank, explain how else do you explain an asset that is not
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:13.160]   absolutely ripped in the face of all of this terrible news about
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:16.280]   the financial system? And I think the answer is because it's
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:20.960]   still a cul de sac of users. It's not broadly available, not
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:24.800]   broadly adoptable, not broadly used. I still believe that it's
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:29.360]   valuable. I was the earliest proponent of Bitcoin. 2011.
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:33.720]   Yeah, 2012. So I believe that there's a place for it in one's
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:37.160]   portfolio. But I just think connecting these dots misses the
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:41.040]   point. And I think the point is much, much bigger than a crypto
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:45.160]   off ramp. The point is that we have a lot of systemic shocks
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:50.200]   that are building up in the system. We have broken a ton of
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:54.240]   the systems that cause the financial infrastructure in the
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:57.560]   world to work properly. And we are just starting to uncover how
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:00.640]   they're broken. So I think we need to focus our energy on that
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:04.640]   and dial down a little bit of the Bitcoin maxi stuff because it
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:08.520]   distracts from a really important set of topics that are
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:11.000]   more inclusive and actually touch 7 billion people.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.720]   We have to do the cleanup work. And just to be perfectly clear
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:20.760]   here, Nick Carter is a career crypto. He's on his third fund
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:24.240]   is $250 million third fund. According to a quick Google
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:27.720]   search, he's a partner at Castle Island Ventures. And I believe
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:32.440]   biology believes what he's saying. And at the same time, is
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:36.640]   massively in Bitcoin and the $2 million he'll obviously lose in
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:41.240]   this bad or the 99.9% chance and he said that already. I think he
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:44.640]   believes he's doing a service just like he did believe he was
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:48.880]   doing a service with COVID. So I do not doubt his intent. But I
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:52.840]   believe it's his book is based on this and the $2 million will
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:53.880]   be paid off.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   He's a very smart and good guy. My point is put this in the who
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.280]   cares bucket and get back to the facts. Friedberg mentioned it,
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:04.000]   we have a debt ceiling problem that's in the offing. Saks
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.480]   mentioned it, we have a commercial real estate crisis. We
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:09.960]   just talked about the fact that he didn't raise rates enough,
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:13.880]   nor did he cut enough. So we're in this weird middle path that
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:16.680]   J. Powell we're talking about. So those are the facts on the
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:19.160]   ground that I think we should focus on because those will have
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:22.800]   implications to how people can borrow, start businesses,
[00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:27.280]   capitalize risk assets. That's a big problem.
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:31.480]   I guess the moral hazard comes up sacks. And the critique, I
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:36.400]   think that people have had a view, you know, focusing on
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:42.200]   bank bailouts, etc. has been, you have been anti bailout. And
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:47.920]   now hey, maybe backstopping the deposits, not backstopping the
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.120]   bank, the shareholders loss, you're very clear about that.
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:53.560]   But let's talk about moral hazard here for a minute. Are we
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:54.200]   started getting
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:56.600]   enough for bail? When did I say I was either
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:59.920]   you or not, I just clearly say you're not I'm saying this is
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.000]   the critique that people have had a view. So I'm giving you a
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:02.760]   chance to address
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:05.480]   why? Why are you giving him people's critiques of him?
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:08.840]   Wouldn't nobody because I want him to talk about the future
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:09.560]   moral hazard.
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:12.120]   More than seven, six, five, four, two on Twitter.
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:18.640]   Okay, I was also thinking about the Wall Street Journal, the New
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:19.720]   York Times and everything.
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:23.880]   Let me jump in and just clarify, I was really clear that SVB
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:26.720]   shareholder should be wiped out their bondholders should be
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:30.280]   wiped out their management stock options should be wiped out. In
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:33.560]   fact, if it turns out that they should have known the thing was
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:35.840]   about to go under, I think their stock sales should be clawed
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:38.880]   back. So I'm not in favor of bailing out SVB. I don't care
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:39.680]   about SVB.
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:42.320]   Yes, of course. Now let's do that for commercial real estate.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:45.360]   No, the question is what you do with deposits and depositors.
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:50.880]   Correct. I think there is a real debate about how you treat
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:54.880]   depositors in a banking crisis. And I think there are two views
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:57.640]   on that. There's kind of an old fashioned view. And then there's
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:01.840]   kind of a more modern regulatory view. The old fashioned view is
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:06.040]   that if your money is in a bank, and that bank goes under and you
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:09.960]   know, you're over the FDIC amount, you lose your money. And
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:13.200]   we need people in the system to lose their money because that
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:16.600]   creates discipline on the banks. It'll make those depositors do a
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:19.560]   better job shopping for the right bank. That's kind of what
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:23.080]   I would call the old fashioned hardline view. There's a more
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:27.640]   modern regulatory view, which is that, listen, the typical
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:30.480]   depositor, even a fairly sophisticated depositor, like a
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:33.960]   small business, or even a high net worth individual, they're
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:36.600]   not in a position to evaluate the balance sheet of these
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:39.520]   banks. How are they going to figure out if there's like toxic
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:43.120]   assets that are hidden on the balance sheet of these regulators
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:45.440]   didn't see it with Silicon Valley Bank and a lot of these
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:49.440]   banks. And you don't really get that much more moral hazard by
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:52.680]   putting the depositor on the hook for that. Remember, the
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:56.160]   management of the bank already is penalized severely by losing
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:57.000]   all their stock.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.540]   I'm trying to get to before Chamath interrupted me. I'm
[00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:01.800]   trying to get to the bigger moral hazard picture here, which
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:04.920]   is Jason, fuck you before you interrupt me. But the point to
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:07.520]   eat your nuts for a sec. The point I'm trying to get to is
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:11.360]   should commercial real estate? Should that be bailed out? How
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:15.040]   should society look at that next card that you are saying is
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:18.440]   going to tip over? How would you handle that piece? Should they
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:21.080]   Okay, well, let me just finish the on depositors. So the modern
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:23.720]   regulatory view is that when you open a bank account, you shouldn't
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:26.360]   have to think about the bank's balance sheet, you just want it
[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:30.000]   to be safe. You don't want all the brain damage. And, and look,
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.040]   I think there's a lot of merit to that argument. As it turns
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:34.360]   out, I've been trying to look into this, how much would it
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:38.800]   cost the system to just fully ensure depositors, it turns out
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:43.480]   that we have about 17 and a half trillion in deposits in the US
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:47.520]   almost 818 trillion. And one of the misnomers you'll hear as
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:50.360]   well, it would cost us 18 trillion to basically ensure
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:53.600]   all the depositors. That's not true. Because first of all, 10
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:56.320]   trillion people don't even know it's already insured under FDIC.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:59.920]   It's only about seven and a half to 8 trillion that's less than
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:03.360]   half is left. Okay. Yes, right. Exactly. It's about it's around
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:04.360]   8 trillion. So
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:07.640]   isn't it shocking the innumeracy of people that make these
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:09.040]   claims? I know it's crazy.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:13.880]   This is why the podcast is based on any or top 10 in the world
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:16.760]   because we're actually breaking down the numbers. Right. So
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:17.200]   continue
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:19.280]   that the leading proponent of this theory that we should just
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:23.160]   basically not bail out but backstop the deposits is Bill
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:27.240]   Ackman. And he's been making I think a pretty compelling case
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:30.520]   that if you don't protect deposits at small banks, all the
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:33.000]   money is going to flow to the top four banks. That's already
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.320]   in process. Now that's happening. Yeah, we're watching
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:37.320]   it happen, right. So I've been trying to figure out how much it
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:40.560]   would actually cost us to do that. And what I've realized is
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:45.400]   that it's not 18 trillion, it's, it's 8 trillion. But by the way,
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:48.760]   that's the amount of deposits, that's not the risk premium. So
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:51.360]   if you look at FDIC, at the end of last year, there was about
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:57.400]   130 billion that have been paid in to the FDIC fund by premiums
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:00.840]   paid by these banks. So in other words, the insurance premium
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:05.240]   paid by banks was about 1.3%. So if you were to now
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:08.920]   additionally cover the whole thing, all the deposits, it
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:12.360]   would be another roughly 100 billion of premiums paid by
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:15.240]   these banks. That seems very manageable to me, actually, the
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:19.480]   question is, is the FDIC fund adequate? And I think we're
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:23.480]   about to find out it may be the case that a 1.3% insurance
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:28.280]   premium, grossly, you know, understated the true risk of
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.960]   putting your deposit in a bank. And we're about to find out that
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:33.280]   the FDIC is inadequate. I don't know the answer to that
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:37.040]   question. I think this boils down to the profitability that
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:41.360]   an equity shareholder of a bank expects of them. And to your
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:51.320]   point, is it viable for large GSIBs to guarantee 100% of their
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:55.440]   deposits? Absolutely. The implication of that will be an
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:58.320]   enormous hit to their short term profitability and their return
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:01.320]   on invested capital, it would just take a massive hit. And so
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:04.640]   as a result, the stocks of those banks would fall pretty
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:08.400]   precipitously, which would have a real negative impact on the
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:11.960]   executives and the CEOs of those banks and the shareholders that
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:15.520]   own those bank equities. So I think, ultimately, it'll come
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:18.320]   down to that decision, which is that if you do want to protect
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:22.480]   the depositor in the American banking system 100% for every
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:26.560]   dollar, and do it in a simple way, it will come at the sake of
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:29.360]   the equity holders of the banks. And if you're willing to make
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:32.560]   that trade off, then you can guarantee 100% of the deposits.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:35.760]   If you do not want to make that trade off, then the equity
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:39.440]   holders will still retain more value than they would otherwise
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:43.680]   and freeberg we've seen a couple of examples of the market, the
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:46.320]   free market looking at the situation and making new
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.920]   products and services. Wealthfront Mercury Bank both
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:54.560]   talked about load balancing across 12 accounts $3 million.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:58.840]   So that would make some people who had over 250 k just
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:04.160]   instantly be backstopped and insured. And then where you
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.880]   know, there's discussion of we talked about last week, hey, why
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.680]   don't you just have a vault where you pay a bank to hold
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.600]   your money safely. I got a ton of responses from all in fans,
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.960]   pointing out multiple banks and services that have been trying
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:20.480]   to do this and also crypto solution. So is there going to
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:23.440]   be a free market solution you think or when we're starting to
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.240]   see them emerge? That maybe covers this gap a little bit
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.120]   freeberg and then what are your thoughts just generally on
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.480]   should we backstop the banks and the deposit? I'm sorry, the
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.040]   banks, the depositors to be clear.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:37.800]   So if we just quickly analyze the function of a bank, they
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:43.760]   loan money to either residential real estate buyers like
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:48.120]   homeowners, or commercial real estate buyers or businesses that
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.680]   need it. I think the majority of the capital goes to residential
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:55.880]   real estate. And if they can't loan enough money, they typically
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:59.640]   buy bonds, right, they buy other people's loans in the form of
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:03.520]   bond securities, like treasuries or asset backed
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.880]   securities or other things like that. Or mortgage backed
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:11.280]   securities. So they use the cash to make those investments to
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.800]   make those loans, and then they obviously earn a return on that.
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:16.560]   You know, I think we've talked about this in the past, the
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:20.600]   thing that that biology, I think has misstated, and it would be
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:24.680]   good to have a conversation with him about this publicly. Because
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:26.840]   I have listened to some of his interviews in the last couple
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:32.240]   days. He says the banks are they don't have the money that you
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:37.320]   the depositor thinks that you have. And so what he's saying
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.600]   kind of implies that there is no money that there is no asset
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:44.400]   value there at all. He uses Sam bankman freed and FT x as an
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:49.520]   example, that the money that was given to Sam bankman freeds, you
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:52.040]   know, exchange fund was used to buy assets that then very
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:56.320]   quickly declined in value by 99%. But he held them on the
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:59.560]   book at 100%. And then he reinvested the money and all
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:04.080]   sorts of other different stuff. And in the case of the loans
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:09.480]   made by banks, and the assets that they as a result hold, the
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:14.120]   value may have dropped by 25%, in kind of the worst case, which
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:17.440]   is, you know, the Silicon Valley bank tenure, Treasury bond
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.760]   scenario, where they bought, you know, all $20 billion worth of
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:24.600]   Treasury bonds. And you know, they took a big hit on that. But
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:27.320]   it doesn't mean that there's no asset value, it means that the
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.240]   value has declined. And typically, there's a buffer
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:33.520]   between the asset value that the banks are meant to hold, and the
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.880]   deposits that they owe back to their customers. And if that
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:40.200]   buffer gets exceeded, then the bank is technically has negative
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:44.040]   equity. And if all the, you know, depositors said, I want my
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.520]   money back, and they went and sold those bonds into the
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.320]   market, they wouldn't be able to make the depositors whole. But
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:52.200]   it doesn't mean that depositors end up with zero, it means
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:55.000]   instead of getting 100 cents on the dollar, they get 93 cents on
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.440]   the dollar 88 cents on the dollar, and it would require an
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:01.080]   orderly dissolution of the bank's assets selling those
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:03.600]   bonds into the market to generate the cash to pay back
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.840]   the depositors. So the reason we've seen this kind of this Fed
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:10.600]   vertical spike number is because assets are moving so quickly,
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.560]   depositors are moving their value so quickly from one bank
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:16.080]   to another, that in order for the banks to make the cash
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.280]   available to those depositors, they've had to borrow from the
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:20.720]   Fed, and then they're going into the market and doing this kind
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:23.280]   of, they should be doing this orderly asset sale of the bonds
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.920]   to generate the cash to pay back the Fed, which is musical
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:30.120]   chairs, money, money, causing these problems is musical chairs.
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:33.280]   And if the musical chair stop, then we don't have this problem,
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:33.800]   correct.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:38.520]   So if people stopped moving deposits around, then you're
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:41.680]   right, the banks wouldn't need to borrow money to give
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.720]   depositors their money and then go do the work of selling the
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:46.360]   bonds in the market people free moving their money around
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.840]   because of the shirt, because it's not a shirt. So here we go.
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:53.760]   So you just ensure it and this whole thing stops. So nothing to
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.200]   just say that, right? Yeah. So here's the thing, Jake, how you
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:59.120]   mentioned this case that you hear a lot of people saying,
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.280]   Well, why don't you just take your two and a half million
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:04.120]   dollars and break it up into 10 accounts, which is what people
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.640]   are doing? Yeah, yeah. Well, look, it's not feasible when you
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.560]   need to run a big payroll at the end of the month, and you got
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:11.640]   payables. It's administratively too complicated. And by the way,
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:14.440]   what have you accomplished doing that? You haven't solved
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:18.080]   anything. So who hasn't accomplished for the startup? It
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.200]   has accomplished? I'm just giving them prediction system.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.720]   Yeah, why wouldn't you just raise FDIC to two and a half
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:26.520]   million or have FDIC be based on the number of employees in your
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:31.880]   company or allow a higher class a business class of FDIC that
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:35.320]   goes up to say, pro? Yes, exactly. Those 10 million and in
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:39.280]   exchange, the quid pro quo has to be that the bank can't put
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:41.120]   that money in risky assets.
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.160]   Why is this not this is so obvious.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:47.920]   The reason I walked through that whole explanation, because I
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:49.760]   want to answer your question. I'm sorry it took so long. But
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:52.360]   like, I want to highlight that because that is what an
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:56.160]   insurance underwriter put aside the FDIC and put aside banks and
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.880]   put aside the government's role. Yes, that's what an insurance
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:02.400]   underwriters job would be. They would look at the volatility and
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:05.800]   the pricing on the bonds that the bank holds. And they would
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:09.920]   determine ultimately two things, probability of loss and severity
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:12.920]   of loss. And the probability is how likely is it that you end up
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:16.080]   in negative equity, and that you have people requesting money and
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.400]   you have to sell those bonds and lost very quickly. And then the
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:21.920]   severity is how much would you actually lose. So if, if you
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:25.600]   know, the Fed raises rates by 3%, and your entire book is
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:29.520]   tied up in 10 year bonds, you see a 25% decline in the value
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:32.160]   of your bond portfolio. That's as bad as it gets. If you start
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:35.920]   with a 10% buffer. Now, you only have 85% of the money you owe
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:39.760]   the depositors. So your loss is 15 cents on the dollar. So the
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.960]   insurance company would say, what's the probability of that
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:44.320]   event happening? How much should we underwrite it for? What
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.720]   should we charge as a premium to do that. And that's ultimately
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:49.680]   how the rates would get set. Now the problem with most insurance
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:53.720]   models around this sort of a problem set is that these are
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:57.240]   the extreme tail events that have never happened. And so the
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:01.360]   insurance to Saksa's point is super cheap, leading up to the
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:05.040]   extreme tail event. And then everyone's like, Oh my gosh, we
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:08.000]   underpaid for so many years, we didn't realize how severe the
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.480]   losses could have been, we didn't realize how significant
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:13.720]   this was going to be. And as a result, you now see this kind of
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:16.120]   multiplying effect, because people are like, Oh my gosh, if
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.800]   it happened to them, it could happen to me, let's all sell and
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.680]   it gets worse and worse and worse. And so you know, the real
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:24.200]   rate for the insurance going forward, will now have to take
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:27.000]   into account this massive risk. But the game theory problem is
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.720]   as taxes point out, if you just ensure everyone, the cost of the
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:33.320]   insurance actually goes way, way, way, way down, because now
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:36.280]   you don't have this money movement problem. And so you
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:39.360]   know, the point is, the more you ensure at this point, the
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:42.800]   cheaper the insurance will actually be. If you're an
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.240]   actuarial or free market underwriter, you know, free
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:47.720]   market kind of, you know, underwriting process on this
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:50.920]   thing, because now the probability of having this bank
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:54.040]   run goes way, way down. And therefore, the cost of the
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:58.320]   insurance should go way down. And so the irony is, if you
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:01.440]   actually did, and this is getting super technical, but if
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:04.600]   you actually looked at the statistical model and said, how
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:07.760]   much is this going to cost to ensure every deposit, it gets
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:12.240]   much, much cheaper, the higher the the deposits that you're
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.200]   willing to ensure would be, that's my sense of what the free
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.360]   market would do here. And it's certainly what I think the
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:19.400]   federal government should probably think about doing if
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:21.520]   they're going to continue to play a role in backstopping
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:21.800]   banks,
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:28.200]   the net net is people. startups right now, are doing five to 10
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:30.440]   banks, I'm watching it happen. They're doing all these sweep
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:33.640]   accounts, they're doing multiple accounts. So the government, if
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:36.800]   it doesn't raise the FDIC limit is basically just creating extra
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:39.240]   work for everybody, and it's going to be the same outcome. So
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:42.120]   this people are going to the street will find its own use for
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.800]   technology and how to hack this. And that's what's happening
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.160]   with these services. Yeah,
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:49.400]   real time, this is steel man, the the old fashioned view or
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:52.800]   the traditional view of this, they would say that, well, you
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.160]   want those startups being paranoid, you want those
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:58.360]   startups doing the work of disciplining these banks by
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:02.560]   moving their money elsewhere, if they detect a problem. However,
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:05.640]   the problem with that is you get these bank runs. That is what a
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:08.840]   bank run is, in parts, is people moving their money, because
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:12.120]   they're fearing that the bank is not doing a good job with their
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:16.440]   loan portfolio. So this is why in the let's call it the olden
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:20.120]   days before FDIC, we had bank runs and panics all the time.
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:24.840]   And that's why FDIC was invented. So there's a hugely
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:29.960]   destructive problem that comes along with placing the depositor
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:34.320]   in charge of disciplining the banks. And I would argue that
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:36.040]   the depositor is not the best person to do it. It's the
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:38.520]   regulator, just to kind of layer on what what free bird was
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:41.680]   saying. I think there's like a fundamental market failure with
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:45.960]   banking, in the sense that the depositor, or the consumer and
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:48.440]   the bank think they're getting two completely different things.
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:51.920]   When you open a bank account or a checking account, you think
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:57.160]   you're getting a checkbook, an ATM card, a place to do payroll
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.640]   run, you know, and it's a service, it's a service, and
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.840]   maybe you make a little bit of interest, but it's not even your
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:04.080]   main motivation. Okay, that's what you think you're getting
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:07.880]   your money, most of all is safe. Because you're not signing up
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:10.280]   with a service provider to have any chance of losing your money.
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.720]   You're not gambling. Right. But now what does the bank think
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.920]   it's getting? You know what the bank thinks is getting an
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:18.200]   unsecured loan, that they can then turn around and invest in
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:19.800]   whatever they want, or whatever the law
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:21.840]   allows them to. So there's a disconnect between the parties
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:22.760]   and the transaction.
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:25.320]   Exactly. It's a total disconnect. And moreover, the
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:28.280]   way the management of the bank is compensated, is that they
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:32.560]   only have to pay back your loan, your deposit basically is
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:37.000]   their loan at par. And anything they make on a bet that they
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   make with that money, they get to keep they get to keep all the
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.400]   upside, their stockholders and management get to keep that
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.040]   and those incentives are what are driving this. And that's
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.200]   what drove the risk in all likelihood at Silicon Valley
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:50.160]   Bank, they were getting $200 billion, whatever percentage
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:51.240]   point they got some off.
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:54.080]   We somehow the executive team was
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.840]   compensated for their incentive. It's not just them, but the
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.200]   whole banking system creates the incentive. They're highly
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:03.280]   leveraged. The deposits from their standpoint, are leveraged
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:06.440]   their leverage 10 to one. So their incentive is to go to the
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.880]   casino and gamble it because they get to keep all the upside.
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:12.280]   And if they lose it, it's basically someone else on the
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.080]   hook final word.
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:19.080]   In early May, the Fed will release their investigation
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:23.520]   into signature bank and SVB. Okay, Powell said that this
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:26.960]   week. I think it'll be really interesting to see how much
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:32.520]   honesty they both put into the report, and then whether the
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:35.000]   entirety of that report is made available to the rest of us to
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.280]   read. But I think SACS has very elegantly summarized what's
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:45.160]   happening. And it doesn't take a genius to figure out that this
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:49.800]   doesn't make sense. So the question is, what is the
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:54.560]   tolerance that we have for changing something that clearly
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:59.840]   is mischaracterized? What consumers think they're getting
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:02.360]   and what banks are then doing are two totally different
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:08.600]   things. And if the Fed actually is really, really honest, and
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:12.840]   really lays bare everything that happened, it'll be very hard to
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.600]   not legislate changes based on it.
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:19.160]   And this your best swing at a legislative change would be what
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:21.840]   Chama. What is the what is the low hanging fruit? What's the
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:22.480]   layup here?
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.800]   Well, I think we've seen this happening in other markets for a
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:31.080]   while, which is that banks have become in fairness to them, much
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.240]   much better at risk management post Dodd Frank post great
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:37.240]   financial crisis. And the result of that is that there's been a
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:40.960]   lot of emerging private credit markets because most of bank is
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.480]   about lending, right? They're not really buying equities,
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:46.080]   they're lending money, they're a debtor in possession of
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:52.360]   something, right. And there's been a just a massive explosion
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:56.000]   of private credit. And it started in the most obvious
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.240]   areas. It started in things like CLOs, it started in asset backed
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:05.160]   securities, solar car loans, credit cards, mortgages, private
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:11.840]   equity backed deals. So I think the rational answer is that
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:18.160]   banks need to protect 100% of deposits. And that if they want
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:23.480]   to have extracurricular activities, if you will, they
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:28.120]   need to be able to raise money from investors, put that to work
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:33.160]   in a really fair and transparent way, and then share in the
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:35.600]   profits between all of the related parties that are
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:38.920]   involved in that transaction no different than any other risk
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:43.280]   taking organization. And I think that this is now what we've
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:48.760]   probably shined a light on is in really odd loophole that just
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:50.440]   needs to get closed in 2023.
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:54.480]   There's such easy, easy, hygienic changes here.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:59.360]   Like, let's put it a different way. If you raised money for a
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:02.880]   liquid hedge fund that had quarterly redemptions, and then
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:06.440]   violated the LPA and stuffed it into private companies that had
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:11.400]   10 year illiquidity, there would be hell to pay. Yeah. And vice
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:15.000]   versa. If you raise money on 10 year illiquid locked up capital
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.880]   on the presumption you're going to invest in startups, and then
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:20.120]   instead put it in the stock market thinking that you could
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:24.520]   flip it and make some money. You would have violated the LPA and
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:28.080]   there be held to pay. Similarly, I think what Saks is stating is
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:32.160]   that there is a mismatch of what the depositor in this case, the
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:37.520]   investor expects, and what the risk manager is doing. And I
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.680]   think that you have to correct that one way or the other, make
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:43.240]   it abundantly clear that we're never going to ensure 100% and
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:48.400]   deal with that risk. Or make it 100% and deal with the fallout,
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:52.440]   which is largely about wiping out a lot of equity value in
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:52.920]   banks.
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:56.320]   LPA equals limited partnership agreement, right?
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:59.080]   Just to just to clarify one thing, I'm not saying that these
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.040]   bank managers are all going to the casino and gambling the
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:03.680]   money. I think that they are generally more responsible than
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:07.920]   that. What I'm saying is that the incentives created by this
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:12.160]   crazy system we call banking, create a weird incentive for
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:15.080]   them to gamble because they're so highly levered. From their
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:18.360]   standpoint, your deposits are their leverage,
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:21.240]   everybody but the GSIBs because I think the GSIBs there's so
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:25.920]   much scrutiny. If you look at how well run city B of A, Wells
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:30.440]   and JPM are relative and contrast them to the sub GSIBs.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:34.080]   It's like night and day. And so the other thing that I think
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:38.360]   we've realized is who thought it was a good idea to raise the bar
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:42.760]   on eligibility from 50 billion of assets to 200. Clearly, now
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:45.800]   that made no sense. It makes more sense to actually
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:50.720]   categorize every bank as systemically important, maybe
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:54.080]   not globally, but at a minimum to the US economy, because these
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:58.600]   people play a vital function in society. And they were allowed
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:02.480]   to take a much more aggressive risk posture because they were
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.400]   able to lobby the government to change the rules.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:07.680]   The CEO of Tick Tock, which claims to be an American
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:12.040]   company now, or an international company was in front of Congress
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:15.280]   today. His name is show chew. This is the first time he's
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:20.600]   really, I think, spoken publicly in an extended period four and
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:24.440]   a half hours, he was grilled. And it was absolutely brutal.
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:28.400]   It's the first time I've seen a congressional hearing that was
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:34.360]   bipartisan in a long time. And he said that, quote, the bottom
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:37.760]   line is, this is an American day, this is American data on
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.440]   American soil by an American company overseen by American
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:47.640]   personnel, and then was immediately squirrely when asked
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:52.120]   if Chinese employees, including engineers have access to this US
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:55.960]   data. And he said, this is a complex subject over and over
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:17:02.200]   again, he was evasive. And this did not look good for Tick Tock.
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:06.840]   Well, I think now becomes does it become divested and go public
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.160]   or does it get shut down?
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:11.560]   Saks, I think his goose was cooked as soon as they asked him
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:14.680]   the question. In preparation for this hearing, did you consult
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:18.200]   with any member of the CCP? And he could not just outright say
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.680]   no, no. So that's his goose was cooked as soon as he couldn't
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:22.400]   just say no.
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:24.400]   What do you think about the bipartisan nature of this? And
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.600]   what do you think the outcome is sex?
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:28.080]   Well, this is one of the rare things where it is bipartisan. I
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:32.720]   mean, there's there's so much outrage and anger at this. I
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:36.960]   think that they should let the company divest it. I think it is
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:40.320]   divestiture or shut down for Tick Tock. Since we're not
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.480]   communists here, I think they should be given the chance to
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:47.600]   fully divest to an American owned company. But look, I just
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:52.600]   wish that there was as much bipartisan consensus and
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:57.080]   outrage directed not just at Chinese spying of Americans, but
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:00.720]   on the American deep state spying on Americans, because we
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:04.760]   just had hearings showing that the American government conducts
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:08.400]   elaborate spying operations, surveillance of Americans on
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.560]   social media, this was all revealed in the Twitter files.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:15.000]   And we got certainly no bipartisan consensus on that
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.040]   Republicans were outraged, but Democrats tried to portray it as
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:20.840]   some sort of spat between Trump and Chrissy Teigen. I mean,
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:24.320]   that's all they wanted to talk about. So I would like to see
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:28.400]   this problem comprehensively addressed. And that means I
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:31.760]   think, Tick Tock, going into the hands of an American company,
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:34.840]   but I also would like more assurances that American
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:38.200]   companies will not be working with the deep state to spy on us
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:41.560]   in a fringe or a city and Donald Trump, who are two people you'd
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:44.920]   never invite to a dinner party? freeberg? What are your
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:48.120]   thoughts? Is it going to divest? Should it be forced to divest?
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:51.480]   being intellectually honest about it? What are your
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:54.360]   thoughts on Tick Tock in America?
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:58.240]   Yeah, I think I've shared this in the past, I think they're
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:01.200]   probably gonna have to spin this thing out. And if they hold any
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:03.720]   equity, if the Chinese parent company holds any equity
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:07.480]   interest, it'll probably be non voting shares. And there'll be a
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:10.040]   mandate that the majority of the shares and some degree of
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:10.680]   oversight.
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:12.200]   I believe that's the right thing to do.
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:16.880]   From a national security issue for America to force them to do
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:17.120]   that.
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:19.520]   I don't know, from a national security point of view, I really
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:23.160]   don't. I don't have an opinion on national security and Tick
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:27.560]   Tock. I don't know. I've always thought that Tick Tock was a
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:34.480]   really what's the right word? Like it's like a firefly for,
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:38.000]   you know, Chinese invasion. And it feels like, you know, it's a
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.760]   very easy kind of target for I think what is generally a big
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:46.800]   kind of social consciousness right now. So, you know, whether
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:51.480]   or not there's actually like, some national security points,
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:54.520]   if there were, I'm pretty sure that national security person
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:57.080]   would have stood up and said, We need to stop this thing. I'm
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:58.440]   not sure I've heard that publicly.
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:19:59.120]   Chabot.
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:04.160]   But I will say like, my point of view from like, just seeing the
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.440]   political behavior is that they're probably going to mandate
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:09.560]   that these guys spend this thing out to us investors and, and
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:12.240]   that they, you know, don't own any that the Chinese don't have
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.880]   any equity or management oversight or interest in it.
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:20.960]   Chabot in China itself. The Chinese government does not
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.320]   allow kids to play video games during the week and only three
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:28.040]   hours on the weekend. They're using apps like WeChat to
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:31.360]   dictate social score and social behavior, whether it's smoking
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:37.120]   on a train or not paying your bills. And they are saying they
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:41.880]   will not divest. But any buddy who is an investor in a company
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:44.640]   that had a chance to go public for 10s of billions of dollars
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:47.840]   and eventually take on and people believe that this is a
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:51.480]   viable competitor to Facebook and Instagram. This could be a
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:54.080]   company worth ultimately hundreds of billions of dollars.
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:57.720]   If you were an investor in China, you would want to IPO,
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:01.720]   you would want to get liquidity. So if they are refusing to sell,
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:04.840]   what does that tell you as a market participated in
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:07.280]   participant in somebody who's been a capital allocator for
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:07.840]   over a decade,
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:11.200]   there's bigger problems in China than even tick tock us
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:14.280]   represents for them. I think it's probably what it means. So
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:18.520]   it's a pretty bad tell. I don't think divestiture is a real
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:22.280]   option. Because when you think about the details of that, how
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:25.440]   will the government be satisfied that the code base was separated
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:31.480]   elegantly, that there was no malware surreptitiously planted?
[01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:35.960]   How will you actually prove all of this to a degree that
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:40.720]   satisfies a legislator. So I think the pound of flesh that
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:44.880]   they want is more easily and more salaciously satisfied by
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:49.640]   shutting the thing down. So if I had to bet on what happens, I
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:52.640]   bet more on that. I didn't think tick tock did a very good job.
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:56.680]   And I think that there are some, they were terrible today. And I
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:59.920]   think that there are some real issues around how much control
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:05.000]   does actually flow back. I don't think that it was definitive. He
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.640]   needed to be much clearer and adamant that this was an
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:13.920]   independent business that didn't have backdoors to China and the
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:17.600]   CCP to appease Congress. He didn't do that. No, he was like,
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.680]   I have to check in on that. I'm not sure. Yeah, I think it was a
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:22.800]   little bit of the exact opposite, actually, Saks is
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:25.440]   right, like that first question was just the death blow right
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.240]   from the beginning. It's like, Oh, this is not going to go in a
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:30.760]   good place, because they should have been able to see that that
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:34.800]   question was going to get asked. And you need to have that asked
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:39.120]   and answered philosophy where the only answer is no. The only
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:41.440]   answer you could have given is no. And the fact that he wasn't
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:45.040]   able to say that it was a bit of a fetter complete as soon as
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.080]   soon as that was in my mind, I was like, this thing is getting
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:49.840]   shut down. Because I don't think there's a shutdown. Yeah,
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:54.640]   there's no divestiture plan that can be technically audited in a
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:59.600]   short amount of time to appease these folks. They want to pound
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:03.200]   the flesh and then separately. The bigger issue that I think
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:07.920]   you have to deal with is what does that mean for how other
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:13.360]   governments may be pressured to act who want to be on the pro us
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:15.640]   camp? And I think that that's a question because
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:21.720]   ByteDance and Tick Tock have presence beyond just China in
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:27.200]   the US. A third question is, how does the golden vote get used on
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:30.960]   the ByteDance board? And what do they do? And do they even want
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:33.840]   this thing public explain golden vote, essentially, they'll decide
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:36.960]   what happens to that company. And they have that in Alibaba,
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:39.080]   they have that I think a 10 cent, I think they have that at
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:42.960]   ByteDance. So the Chinese government has a very strong
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:45.760]   hand in the direction of these business. And then the final
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:50.800]   point is that there's a secondary app that Tick Tock has
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:54.800]   called CapCut, which also is enormously popular in the United
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:59.320]   States, which is yet another potential backdoor for privacy
[01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:02.960]   or spying violations, whatever the US Congress wants to pin on
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:08.280]   them. So I think it's a very complicated moment for that
[01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:11.000]   business and their US asset
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:16.120]   sacks. It's pretty clear the CCP is making this decision. If they
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:19.400]   decide, let it burn, let it get kicked out of the United States.
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:23.360]   What does that do in terms of game theory between the two
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:26.440]   countries? And going forward, because obviously, they don't
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:28.600]   reciprocate, we're not allowed to have Google, Twitter,
[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:33.680]   Instagram, whatever in China. So is this just, you know, what
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:37.080]   what's what decision you're saying the CCP is making?
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:40.560]   Well, the CCP has the golden vote. It's their decision to
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:43.960]   divest or not divest. Chamath believes they will not divest. I
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:44.600]   believe they will not
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:47.600]   Chamath is saying is they're not going to have the choice. I
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:51.040]   don't, I don't see what decision the CCP has in this. It's gonna
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:51.120]   be
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:54.520]   divest. That's right. There. It's not a divesture. Don't
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:57.040]   divest. I think it'll be shut down. I think they're getting
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.040]   kicked out of the United States.
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:01.160]   Okay, do you but you believe they're going to divest sacks?
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:05.200]   I'm saying that that's what I would support. Just to give them
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:07.360]   the chance. What do you think's gonna happen?
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:10.280]   I try to be right. I'm not sure. But I think they should be
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:14.360]   given the chance. And if you truly can't move the servers to
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:16.840]   the United States and vet the code base, I feel like you
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:21.080]   could, I think you could have an acquire or figure it out, you
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:24.360]   know, vet the code base, move the data centers, make sure
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:27.320]   there's no back doors. I think it's not impossible, hard, but
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:28.040]   not impossible.
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:32.160]   Okay, so let's go with the scenario that it gets kicked out
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:34.720]   of the United States is shut down. Are there any second or
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:35.960]   third order impacts?
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:38.440]   Yeah, it's just ratchets up the tension between the US and
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:42.480]   China. But we're already we're already there. Yeah, we're
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:43.000]   already there.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.240]   No change. All right. Listen, this has been an amazing
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:50.960]   episode. Oh, Chamath. Did your 3d rocket company make it to
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:54.080]   space? I saw they had a nice little lift off there.
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:57.680]   Thank you, Jason. I just wanted to give a shout out this is
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:00.680]   like, while all this chaos is happening in the world, it's
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:05.480]   amazing to see pretty incredible engineering. So last night, we
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:11.360]   did have a successful launch. So relativity has a 85% 3d printed
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:15.200]   rocket, which over time, we want to try to get to 95%. But it's
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:20.640]   the fuselage, it's the engines. It brings the cost of space
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:25.280]   flight down by an order of magnitude. It is a hugely
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:28.640]   disruptive idea. And so what they tried to prove was that
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:32.200]   they could get this thing into space. And they accomplished a
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:35.320]   lot of goals, they got past Max Q, which is sort of the point at
[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:37.720]   which the atmospheric pressure is the strongest on the
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:41.320]   fuselage. So we proved structural integrity, we got to
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:45.960]   main engine cut off, we had stage two separation. So a lot
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:48.760]   of really important technical milestones were achieved, it
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:54.640]   allows them now to unlock a bunch of contracts that allow us
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:57.080]   frankly, just to keep going and building, there's still a lot of
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:59.840]   work to do from here, we're building now the next generation
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:03.400]   rocket, which is called Terran R, and rocket engines, which
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:08.320]   can take instead of 1500 kilograms, about 20,000 kilos.
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:14.480]   So enormously proud to have been around this journey, my partner,
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:17.920]   Jay has been really the key person on it. But I just wanted
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:19.680]   to give a huge shout out to Tim Ellis and the team at
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:22.480]   relativity. It's super, super, super cool. But they pulled off
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:27.560]   just amazing how access to space is being democratized, and the
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:30.200]   prices are being lowered so dramatically, what's the impact
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:32.760]   that's going to have ultimately freeberg, you think, on
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:35.760]   humanity? I mean, obviously, going to Mars is this
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:39.760]   incredible feat, technologically, and just mind
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:44.400]   blowing. But what do you think the, the net result of all this
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:47.480]   space activity is going to be for the human condition and the
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:48.040]   species?
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:52.160]   I mean, I think there's a vibrant community of startups
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:55.240]   and money coming into this space right now, I do think all these
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:58.120]   guys are going to have to in order to gain wider spread
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:02.480]   capital markets attention, like Elon has had to do with SpaceX
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:06.000]   are going to have to find business models that have kind
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.640]   of near term viability that don't depend on government
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:13.240]   contracts, like Starlink, like Starlink. Yeah. And so I think
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:15.440]   that's the key question. It obviously, these are very
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:19.400]   capital intensive businesses, they have very long horizons to
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:24.600]   hit their milestones. So there's certainly capital available in
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:28.600]   the early stages to make bets on whether or not they can get
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:31.160]   these milestones. But but, you know, the broader kind of
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:34.320]   attention and capital markets is going to come from these things
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:36.760]   building real kind of businesses that generate value for
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:40.960]   consumers and markets. You know, one of the things that I think
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:47.120]   can unlock opportunity for this market overall, is low cost
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:52.680]   energy, you know, if we can get below, call it one cent to three
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:55.920]   cents kilowatt hour of power, call it one cent a kilowatt hour
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:58.840]   power, I forgot the exact relationship, you can get very
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:03.280]   cheap, you know, hydrogen and oxygen fuel sources. And so,
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:07.120]   you know, the it's funny, if you actually play out the scale
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:12.160]   factor for space, for the space industry, much of it at scale,
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:15.160]   will get driven by the cost of electricity. So it's another
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:17.160]   reason why there's going to be, I think, a pretty tight coupling
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:21.440]   between the cost of power and ultimately, the vibrancy of the
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:21.880]   market.
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:24.240]   You mentioned something important. The other key thing
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:27.920]   that we proved was that this is a pure methylox engine. So CH
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:32.120]   four and liquid oxygen. And it was not just stage one, but also
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:35.400]   stage two, which is unique. The only other folks that have tried
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:38.080]   to prove that you could have multi stage methylox is China
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:42.040]   and their most recent launch failed, but it highly simplifies
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:46.400]   the engineering problem at hand. Especially the ground
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:49.360]   operations and whatnot, and sort of like filling these rockets
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:52.720]   and making them viable. So that was another really big milestone
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:53.120]   that just
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:57.240]   the producing of that fuel Friedberg requires energy, if
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:00.600]   that energy was cheap, it would be cheaper to make and process
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:01.160]   that fuel.
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:04.760]   That's right. Yeah, there's a pretty, pretty direct tie in
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:08.400]   particularly with scale manufacturing on fuel that would
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:11.240]   be used in these rocket systems and, and power prices here on
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:14.880]   earth. So if and as we get power prices down, either through
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:18.040]   scaled renewables, or ideally fusion or some other kind of new
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:23.880]   technology, or nuclear fission or something, then the cost of,
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:27.000]   you know, fuel and the cost of these space programs goes down.
[01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:30.280]   And that ultimately, I think the real question everyone asks is,
[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:32.160]   how do you get away from it just being government services,
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:36.360]   businesses, which, you know, have a low multiple in markets,
[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:38.600]   and obviously, you know, high dependency on one or two key
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:41.440]   customers? And how do you actually get private markets,
[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:45.800]   private market products moving? So tourism obviously makes a lot
[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:50.760]   of sense. Travel, you know, around the earth in 20 minutes
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:54.120]   or something, or, you know, some people have talked about mining
[01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:57.240]   or colonies, and you know, who would fund that real estate. It's
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:31:00.520]   unclear right now what the earth traveling is a wild one. Yeah,
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:02.600]   I've talked to you on about that. But the idea that you
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:06.520]   could have a rocket ship take off from Texas, and then be in
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:10.880]   Tokyo, you know, like half an hour minutes later is I can only
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:14.840]   I'll speak, I can only speak for myself, but I would really like
[01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:20.240]   to visit Uranus Reaper. All right, everybody. Look at the
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:23.200]   player here. He's got layers are for players. sexy. Look at this.
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:26.040]   He is he is two layers in Can you get an ascot? It's subtle,
[01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:28.880]   isn't it? He's pulling a Steve Bannon. You got to get more
[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:33.640]   disheveled. He needs the six pens in the color pens. No shave.
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:37.720]   Can you tell us? Do you have a stylist, an actual person you
[01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:40.760]   pay to address you? Nick, can you please put the picture of
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:42.440]   Steve Bannon where he wears the multiple?
[01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:45.000]   Do this again.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.680]   Need to stop for next show attacking me. It's really weird.
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:52.120]   Oh, yeah, Bannon. He thinks you're a venture a vulture
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:54.360]   capitalist or something. He's been attacking you.
[01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:58.800]   Bannon was one of the people attacking me on Twitter. I think
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:00.600]   on his podcast. I think Yeah,
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:03.320]   you seem to have made a lot of a lot of new friends on Twitter
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:06.120]   lately. When you pass around half a million followers.
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:09.560]   Basically, what happens is you become a politician, you will
[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:12.880]   know there will always be a fringe element of people who
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:16.600]   need to manage their anxiety by venting. And that's what you're
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:20.320]   feeling. You will live that now at million use, you know,
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:22.560]   followers, 2 million, 10 million, whatever, there's always
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:25.480]   going to be a small percentage. J. Cal doesn't know this, because
[01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:28.000]   he has mostly bots that are his followers. It's true. I have an
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.840]   old account real when you have real people. This is what it is.
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:34.080]   You'll get this 1% or less than 1%. And just the number goes up.
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:37.080]   So I would ignore it. Don't care. Don't worry about what
[01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:41.600]   user 747 feed the brigadoons don't care what seven user 74786
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:43.960]   has to say. Don't worry about it. Yeah, absolutely. I love
[01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:45.840]   you. All right. And I'm looking forward to seeing you on
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:51.000]   Thursday. For the rain man himself, David sacks, the
