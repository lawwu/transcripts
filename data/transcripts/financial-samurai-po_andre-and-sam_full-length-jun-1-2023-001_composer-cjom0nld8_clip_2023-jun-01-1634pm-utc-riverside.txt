[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.400]   It's Sam from the Financial Samurai Podcast.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.440]   In this episode, I have a special guest with me, Andre Nader.
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.760]   He used to work at Facebook Meta for about nine years.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.880]   He's based in the San Francisco Bay Area.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.080]   I'd love to talk to him about his FIRE journey and what he is doing post-Meta.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.080]   Say hello.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.080]   Andre Nader Hey, Sam.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.080]   Thanks for having me.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.360]   I'm really excited to get to chat with you a little bit more about my journey and being
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.480]   at Meta for nine years and then the next steps that I'm still trying to figure out and talk
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.480]   through that with you.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.480]   Sam: Yeah.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.920]   Well, we first, I guess, connected over Twitter or I saw an article about you somewhere and
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.480]   I signed up for your newsletter, which I thought was really fascinating and really in-depth,
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.920]   particularly for those working in big tech and in tech in general in an expensive location.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.600]   I really appreciate the detail you went through.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.400]   During my book tour with Buy This, Not That, you were gracious to host me at Meta to talk
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.200]   to I think 500 to 600 people over the course of an hour.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.920]   And then you've just been really graceful in helping me just spread the word.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.320]   So I really appreciate what you're doing.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.080]   In the beginning, tell me about your newsletter.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.080]   When did you start it?
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.160]   How many subscribers do you have now and where can people sign up?
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.160]   Andre Nader Yeah.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.160]   No, definitely.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.960]   My newsletter, it's called Fang Fire, so F-A-N-G Fire.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.400]   Right now it's hosted on Substack.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.000]   So the link is my name, andrenader.substack.com.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.240]   I also have a shortcut that you can get to if you type in avocadofire.com, it'll take
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.480]   you straight there.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.720]   I'm slowly trying to make Avocado Fire a thing.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.320]   If I keep saying it over and over enough, it will eventually start sticking and I'll
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.880]   get my own definition.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.280]   But I started writing I think about two years back.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.040]   And what I was finding was there's so much good fire content out there.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:08.480]   I think among you and a dozen other people posting and just having such good in-depth
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.480]   information.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:18.160]   But what I felt was kind of missing is this interesting perspective of being in a big
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.920]   tech company, working on the coasts in these expensive areas, and going into fine detail
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.440]   like what exactly should I be doing?
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.680]   Because I think there's a lot of the fire foundation isn't different regardless of whether
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.080]   you're making 50,000 or 250,000 or more.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.920]   But there's a lot of nuance that comes particularly when you're in tech around just understanding
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.040]   compensation.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.360]   If you talk to someone in tech and ask them, "How much do you get paid?"
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.440]   It's really surprising how often they understand how much they were offered when they first
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.800]   signed up or they have some rough idea of their base salary.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.680]   But so much as you advance in your tech career ends up coming from RSUs and stock-based compensation
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.480]   and different employee stock plans.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.040]   And it becomes a little bit confusing.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.880]   And you have these incredibly intelligent people that are very good at specific things.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.720]   And then it's not always like the financial piece just doesn't come for free and you need
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.780]   to understand and learn it a little bit more.
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.240]   So I was just wanting to go through and explain to people.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.760]   One, I was just starting from a place of in my own personal journey of I'm planning myself
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.360]   for fire and I'm a data analyst by trade.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.560]   So naturally that comes with a lot of spreadsheets and doing a lot of planning for myself and
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.080]   creating a lot of dashboards around just me even answering that question.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.600]   How much do I make?
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.600]   What is my total comp?
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.040]   What is my total comp today?
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.800]   Facebook stock just dropped 20%.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.800]   What is it now?
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.240]   And being able to quickly answer those questions.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.080]   And it started with just building out these different tools and then writing about the
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.400]   tools.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.520]   And then people started finding them valuable.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.760]   And within Meta there's the fire community.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.520]   I think when I left we had about 11,000 people that were part of it.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.080]   So having that community of people that were going through similar circumstances I found
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.160]   like really, really valuable.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.960]   So that's why I started writing was contributing both to the internal Meta fire community,
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.320]   but just as well as like the broader FANG community.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.100]   The compensation is similar across a lot of big tech in how it works.
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.520]   So what I found was how my compensation was structured, how I was setting up my dashboards
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.840]   with a little bit of modification.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.840]   It could work for pretty much anyone that is in tech and getting paid in RSUs.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.000]   And just wanting to, again, start from that place of like, here's me and my journey talking
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.440]   from a point of someone who's physically going through it right now.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.520]   Like I always write it into like, my goal is to be able to be fire in five years when
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.800]   I started writing a couple of years ago.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.140]   And being able to talk in detail.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.200]   And I love going into too much detail and going and breaking down all the numbers and
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.160]   going down and going through crazy scenarios around moving and going into a lower cost
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.440]   of living area.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.440]   But just kind of going through.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.760]   And it ended up resonating with a lot of people.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.280]   They found that they could relate because they're going through the same thing.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.020]   And that's where I was coming from and just sharing kind of my story is all I was trying
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.240]   to do with my writing on FANG Fire.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.240]   Great.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.240]   And let's talk about compensation because when I write about expensive coastal living,
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.640]   a lot of people can't believe the cost of housing and some of the budgets that I have
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.880]   on like $300,000 budget and so forth.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:40.200]   So can you give the listeners an idea of what a first year engineer would make at Meta in
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.840]   terms of salary plus RSUs?
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.040]   What does that package look like and how does it vest?
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.480]   I'm going to post on there real quick so I can speak specifically.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.340]   I created a outline actually of following a new grad all the way through from their
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.680]   first year all the way to Fire.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.600]   And let me pull it up real quick.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.240]   Fire, for those who don't know, is financial independence, retire early.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:13.520]   It's a movement that I helped pioneer or started back in 2009 and then a lot of people talked
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.520]   about it.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.720]   And I think it's something that I think will continue to go, although it's interesting
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.360]   because now post pandemic, there's a lot more work flexibility.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.640]   I see a lot of people playing pickleball during the middle of the day and just taking naps.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.440]   I saw a CEO of a public company yesterday play tennis at 2.45 p.m. next to me.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.480]   I always needle him and was like, "Hey, don't you have a company to run?"
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:46.480]   Anyway, so that's interesting that maybe Fire is not as necessary or interesting now given
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.000]   we can just work and play at the same time.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   No, definitely.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.880]   And I think the – and even what you're saying like on the remote work piece.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.440]   One of my first posts, if we can go into the compensation on a new grad, but one of my
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.840]   first posts when I started writing was all around relocating and leaving San Francisco.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:10.160]   Because San Francisco, the cost of living is so high and the budgets that go with it
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.160]   end up needing to be high to compensate.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.840]   And the companies needing to – if they want people in their offices, need to compensate
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:24.200]   people enough to make it worth them leaving their homes in Texas to move to expensive
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:30.400]   coastal living like the headquarters for Meta down in Menlo Park, one of the most expensive
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.400]   areas in the country.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.520]   Other headquarters in New York and Seattle, all very expensive areas.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.400]   So you just need to be paying people enough to make it worth it.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.880]   But with remote work, all of a sudden it opened up.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.840]   But I think now we're seeing an interesting trend of like, is remote work the future?
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.080]   I think we're seeing a little bit of an interesting clawback and wanting to have more and more
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.080]   people in the office.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.600]   I know there was a big revolt at Amazon, maybe even just yesterday, because they were
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.720]   being asked to come into the office three days a week.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.880]   And that led to a worker strike there.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.600]   So there's like an interesting tension going on right now on like the future of full remote
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:11.440]   work and flexibility versus wanting to get back into the office.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.640]   I think that natural – workers had all the power early in the pandemic and then now the
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.280]   pendulum is swinging quickly back into the other side of things.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.960]   So tell me about the compensation.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.720]   So a new grad engineer, like the – you have to remember too, we're talking like meta,
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:36.200]   the compensation philosophy is always around trying to get the very best from the very
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:41.160]   best schools with the best experiences and paying them at top of salary bands, like in
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.240]   like the 99th, 95th percentile.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.700]   So the salaries that we're going to be talking about, like these are not like salaries that
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.520]   everyone can roll out of bed and go and get.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.600]   This is the people that get these have worked their asses off.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:01.760]   They've had the best internships, multiple internships in many cases, coming from top
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.760]   schools.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.800]   But these – there's still like the – like thousands and thousands of new grads that
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.000]   are getting these jobs.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.480]   And there's a tremendous number of them and opportunities there.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:18.000]   So a new grad, the way that it works when you're starting at Facebook and as an engineer,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   there's different levels.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.960]   Each level has specific salary bands of how much they're going to make, both in terms
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:29.360]   of base comp as well as bonuses, as well as RSUs.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:35.960]   On the base for a new grad engineer, the level is called E3, so engineer level three.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:41.480]   And the base salary starts at $125,000 entirely base.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:48.260]   And if you're thinking through like, okay, $125,000 base, then that doesn't include any
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.440]   of the stocks, doesn't include any of the bonus.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:58.000]   And the way that it's structured broadly is the – at that initial level of E3, they're
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.380]   eligible for a 10% bonus per year.
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.280]   And that will happen after performance reviews.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.340]   And it's all based on their salary that they've made times that 10%.
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.520]   And there's also individual multipliers depending on their individual performance.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.080]   So if you do really well, you can actually get more than 10%.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.000]   If the company does really well, there's also an additional multiplier there.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.520]   Or if it does poorly, it can also come down a little bit more, bring it down to earth.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.160]   So you have that base salary, $125,000.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.000]   You have that 10% bonus piece.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.920]   But then you also have equity.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:38.720]   And equity is where, as a tech worker, initially starts as not the largest amount.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.880]   But if you're staying at a company long enough or as you get more and more senior, it becomes
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.280]   a bigger and bigger piece of your overall compensation.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:52.400]   So a new hire engineer can expect a new grant of around $180,000.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:59.680]   So we have – just to recap that, $125,000 base, a 10% bonus, and then $180,000 in new
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.320]   stock grant.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:06.280]   And the way that these stock grant work is they vest over a four-year period.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.760]   Starting immediately, though.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.400]   Back when I first started, there was at least a one-year vest, which meant you had to wait
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.560]   a year before any of your stock vests.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.560]   More and more companies have kind of done away with that and started vesting immediately.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:25.080]   So every single quarter, a portion of that $180,000 will vest.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.560]   And that kind of brings up into the – I don't know.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:37.120]   That puts you in the – already, right off the bat, in the $200,000 range of total comp
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.120]   kind of coming in.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:47.440]   And that's like a crazy amount to me, thinking about a new grad coming in, never worked,
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.640]   potentially ever.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.120]   First time on their own, and then making $200,000.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:59.480]   And this is why I started writing, is just because there's so much opportunity.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:04.360]   If I was starting out in my career making $200,000, I couldn't even think about it.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:11.760]   As a new grad, I was an economics major, graduating into the Great Recession back in 2009, and
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.440]   dreaming of making six figures down the line, working in the New Yorks.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:20.840]   So having now, thinking through, okay, now we're in 2023, these engineers being able
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:27.460]   to come in, go to San Francisco, and make upwards of $200,000 in year one, it's unbelievable.
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.200]   But they don't have the – sorry, go ahead.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.200]   Is it $200,000, though?
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.200]   So it's $125,000.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:37.960]   So $180,000 divided by four is like, I don't know, $45,000.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.220]   So that's $170,000, and then there's a raise.
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.200]   So like almost $200,000, but not $200,000, right?
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.200]   Like maybe $180,000?
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.200]   Here, I can –
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.200]   It's still pretty good.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.200]   Yeah, still pretty damn good.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.280]   It's not too bad.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.640]   And it really increases really quickly, too.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.080]   So the base starting at $125,000, that's at E3 level.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.240]   There's like an expectation within the first two years of you being able to advance to
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.240]   E5.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.520]   So that's two levels more.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.160]   And if you don't get to E5 within those two years for the engineering side, there's
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.640]   the – essentially an up and out kind of thing around, like they're expecting some
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:24.120]   rapid progression, and you being able to level from E3 to E4.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:30.840]   With E4, the base salary is already $150,000, and the bonus increases to around like 15%.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.320]   And your equity grants are higher as well.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.480]   Is it every four years you get topped up another $180,000 plus in equity?
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.760]   How does that work?
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.680]   Every single year at Facebook, you get a refresher.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.760]   And the refresher, this is where it's important when you're going into DECK, understanding
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.240]   the compensation philosophy of the different companies, because they all approach it really
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.240]   differently.
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:55.400]   So you can't – like I'm talking about how Meta approaches it.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.400]   But I can't – and it's important.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:02.440]   Go to websites like levels.fyi and see how these packages kind of look like.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.800]   But broadly speaking, like at Meta, it's very formulaic.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.640]   It's very much based on like what is your level, what is your role, what country are
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:16.160]   you in, and that's how much stock you'll get, and like your performance, the performance
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.760]   rating that you get at during the annual review cycles.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.760]   But it's formulaic.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.480]   It doesn't look back and see how much stock they've given you in the past.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.400]   It doesn't look at what your base salary is.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.760]   It's just – it doesn't look at how the stock has performed over that period.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.320]   It's very much, okay, this is how much stock you'll be getting.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.040]   You're at this level.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:38.840]   And this is – you're in the United States, so you're going to be getting this top up.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:43.920]   And every level has different bands.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.400]   Every position has different bands.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.560]   So you have like engineer – we're talking about software engineer.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:56.880]   It's typically going to be the highest compensated role within a tech company.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:01.520]   The second one being the product managers, and then everyone kind of going through from
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.520]   there on.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:09.200]   So you have like the engineer, top tier, getting – they are the ones that set the bands of
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.200]   everything.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:14.360]   Then you have the product managers, which are probably getting paid on like the – I don't
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:20.720]   know, 70% to 80% of the RSU package of an engineer.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.280]   And then it kind of goes down from there.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.680]   >> In terms – product managers, interesting.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:30.280]   I've seen a lot of jokes about product managers online where they just kind of – they do
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:36.400]   their day in the life of meta and then they go and eat their – drink their kombucha.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.680]   Then they have like a nice buffet spread and then they just sit back in a lounge chair
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.800]   and then they just say, "Hey, what are you guys working?"
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.600]   And the engineer is like, "Hey, this is what we're going to do."
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.080]   And then they go have drinks later.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.040]   Now, how much of that is like real and fake?
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.800]   What does a product manager do?
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:57.240]   Is the product manager the person who stereotypically just doesn't know how to code so they just
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.040]   are just pushing pencils around?
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.040]   What do they do?
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.560]   >> It's definitely a role that's evolved over time.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:08.600]   I think especially within tech, oftentimes in the early days, most of the product managers
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.320]   were former engineers and that's how it started.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:17.120]   And certain companies have very strong engineering-driven product management philosophies.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:22.400]   If Google particularly up until recently, the vast, vast majority of product managers
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:30.560]   at Google were ex-engineers because that was how they valued the role showing up.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.840]   But I'll tell you, you see the day in the life pieces.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.020]   I think the product managers earn every – I'm not a product manager.
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:43.280]   My role is product growth, so it's more on the closer to a product manager meets a data
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:50.140]   scientist and the comp closer to data scientist as opposed to a product manager.
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:57.060]   But the product managers, I think they – in my experience working at Meta, among some
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:01.300]   of the best product managers that I've worked with, they earn every single penny.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:08.380]   It's a tremendous amount of work in order to wrangle, set the vision for an entire team.
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.460]   And then when you're working at a place like Meta, you're not just working in your own
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:16.980]   silo where it's like, "Okay, I'm working on how businesses advertise.
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.700]   I have this control over this one piece."
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:24.860]   And you can't just in isolation focus on building that one item.
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.020]   Everything is so interconnected.
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.540]   It requires a tremendous amount of coordination across teams.
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:33.100]   So you have the product manager setting the vision for the team, but also needing to do
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:37.980]   a tremendous amount of work around building consensus across partner teams.
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:43.300]   Because if you have a team working on advertising that's trying to do something to increase
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:48.300]   the amount of ads that are being shown, that will have a tremendous amount of impact on
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.300]   the user experience.
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:53.380]   And then you have teams working on the user side of how newsfeed works or teams working
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:58.220]   on reels or teams working on all of the latest and greatest different features that are being
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.220]   added.
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.620]   And all of these different features and all of these product changes have foundational
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.420]   implications on the rest of the ecosystem.
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.940]   So a lot of coordination.
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:11.100]   And then we're going into 2023, what is top of...
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.100]   It's like front and center.
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:17.140]   We're in an entirely different world than when I first started at Meta nine years ago,
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:23.740]   where it's a much more privacy conscious, a much more sensitive environment.
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:27.060]   So there's a lot of policy reviews, legal reviews.
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:32.540]   And the product managers play a huge role in making sure all of the roadmaps that the
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:39.020]   teams are working on are fully compliant and meeting all of our obligations that the teams
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.700]   have set.
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.340]   And really just setting the vision.
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:46.100]   And then they're entirely liable on the execution.
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:49.460]   At Meta, it's very much a, what is your impact?
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.460]   What are you having?
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:54.500]   It's not around setting the vision, it's around what did you actually deliver?
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:58.940]   And among roles, I think product managers are the most on the hook for actually delivering
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:18:59.940]   on the vision that they set for.
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.940]   It's not just setting the vision, it's actually being able to deliver and execute on that.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:08.540]   And again, doing that from a point of, they're not the ones actually coding.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:15.340]   So having to motivate the team, set the vision, coordinate with all the cross-functional partners,
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:20.180]   get the engineers bought in, excited, and just being able to execute on that.
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:27.220]   And the world also changes on a dime, especially at a Meta where the pandemic happens, all
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.900]   of a sudden your roadmap changes entirely and needing to quickly at the drop of a hat
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:31.900]   change it.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:38.180]   Or there's a year of efficiency, which Mark announced, and there's a reduction in workforce.
[00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:43.520]   And all of a sudden the roadmap that you had built out that anticipated your team growing
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:49.420]   by 50% is now seeing a reduction in team and needing to at the drop of the hat change the
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.700]   entire roadmap.
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.200]   But people don't like to change goals either.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:58.500]   So how do you make the same level of impact with fewer people, fewer resources on top
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.980]   of being distracted by other changes that are happening around you?
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:07.560]   So it's definitely the day in the life pieces.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.500]   They take care of us at these places like Meta and we are spoiled.
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.220]   And I will not deny that the food is there.
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:18.620]   You're getting chauffeured around in buses, taking you from San Francisco down to Menlo
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.300]   Park every day.
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.580]   But you work for that too.
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:23.580]   It doesn't come for free.
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:31.500]   Speaking of work, the other dilemma I think a lot of people have is big tech or startups.
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.820]   And I've written about in the past how if you join a startup, you'll probably end up
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:39.140]   poorer than richer because the success rate is low.
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:43.020]   And all you hear about are the huge successes in the media.
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:49.380]   But the reality is, think about it as a venture capitalist, nine out of ten of your investments
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.320]   fail or they're zombie companies.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.300]   So how are you going to make that money?
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:21:00.980]   So is there a, I guess, "risk" of being too comfortable at big tech and getting lulled
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:04.260]   into just doing the same thing over and over again?
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:10.780]   Because I have met many people from big tech who have left big tech to try to do something
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:14.300]   a little bit more impactful on a smaller scale at a startup.
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.300]   What are your thoughts on that?
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.100]   Yeah, no, it's really interesting.
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.460]   And it's something that I've been at.
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.940]   I was at Meta for nine years.
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:27.380]   I've over that time continuously talked to other companies, most of them startups, to
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:28.940]   learn more about what they're doing.
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:33.380]   And I'm of the philosophy that you should constantly be thinking about what's next and
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:37.540]   learning what's out there because life is all around opportunity, cost, and understanding.
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:42.220]   What's out there helps you make those decisions around whether you want to make those tradeoffs.
[00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:49.100]   And I do think it is easy to get comfortable once you finally make it in to one of these
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:55.220]   large companies and you're continuously getting these new stock grants every year.
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.500]   They call the stock grants "golden handcuffs" for a reason.
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:01.140]   They're investing over four years and you're getting more of them every four years.
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.860]   I think it's easy to get comfortable.
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:09.980]   And it's, in a certain level, fairly predictable around how much you're going to make.
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.300]   The past couple of years has been a little different because of the volatility of the
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.300]   tech stocks themselves.
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:23.060]   But I think the FOMO that you see, even among people at the largest tech companies of startups
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.540]   that are doing well, is very, very real.
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:33.780]   I think you see you can make a lot of money in big tech within the FANG company.
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:38.580]   The FANG, by the way, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google is where the acronym came
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:39.580]   from.
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:44.300]   And you can make a tremendous amount of money there, but it's like the...
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.000]   And the risk is generally lower if you're at those companies.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.060]   But if you're wanting to...
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:58.300]   The startups has the potential for significantly more, but that risk is super high.
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.320]   Like you said, the vast majority of them will fail.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.940]   The vast majority of them won't be the next Facebook.
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.260]   It won't be the next...
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:07.260]   I don't know.
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.420]   I was almost going to say Twitter.
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.780]   That's probably not the best outcome that you want.
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:14.260]   But there's the higher likelihood of it not working out.
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:18.560]   And it is challenging because when you're joining a startup, your base salary is going
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.860]   to take a hit and the equity is entirely liquid.
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:29.460]   You're going to be getting an imaginary amount of equity that could 10X, 100X.
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:35.080]   And that's kind of what you would be banking on in order to get that upside versus just
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:40.420]   taking a job at a public company and having that there.
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:41.420]   But I think it was...
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:48.440]   I think a few years ago, it was all around all the crypto companies earning tremendous
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:55.320]   amounts of venture capital and seeing valuations increase like year over year at incredible
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.320]   rates.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:01.120]   And then you're seeing the same thing on a lot of the AI startups where the valuations...
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:06.440]   So your paper money all of a sudden seeing ridiculously large increases.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:10.700]   And at the same time, I'm talking about the RSUs being golden handcuffs.
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:15.220]   It's just as easy, I think, at a startup if you're in early and it starts doing medium
[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:21.280]   well to kind of get stuck because you get in this dangerous place where all of a sudden
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.720]   your paper money is worth a lot, but it's not super liquid.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:27.480]   There's some opportunities to sell in the secondary market, but it's still incredibly
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:31.680]   challenging to cash out in a predictable way.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.520]   So that's my high level view.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:42.080]   It's worth doing the math, understanding the potential that could be there, but also going
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.960]   in being like, "Hey, it could probably fail."
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:52.320]   Assume your startup grants are going to be worthless and go in with the opportunities
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.440]   that you have.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.480]   You're going to get a lot of different opportunities at a startup.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.840]   You're going to be able to do so many different roles.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.200]   You're wearing all of the hats.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:05.520]   At big tech, you end up getting very specialized and becoming very good at being a good employee
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.320]   at big tech, working on a very specific type of problem.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.320]   And within a startup, you don't have that luxury of specializing as much.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:17.360]   You need to be a generalist and need to be a jack of all trades to get anything done
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.920]   because you can't lean on another team of engineers to go build something.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.560]   You need to – if you're not going to be working on it and getting your team to work
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.560]   on it, it's just not going to happen.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.120]   So it's an entirely different dynamic.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:35.680]   I know a friend who I started playing softball with back in 2017, 2018.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:40.520]   And in 2020, he joined Figma as the VP of something something.
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.880]   So he probably had like $185,000, $200,000 base salary.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.680]   He was at Uber grinding it out pre-IPO.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.600]   I mean, Uber didn't do that great, right?
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.040]   But then Figma got acquired three years later by Adobe.
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:26:00.240]   I think he went from maybe like $2 million total to like $50 million in just three years.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.240]   I mean, it was unbelievable.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.760]   And I had never heard of – I was like, "What is this Figma?"
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.080]   I was like, "What is this?
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.360]   Design something on the fly, whatever, whatever."
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.360]   And it's like, "What?
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.120]   $20 billion acquisition by Adobe?"
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:17.280]   So I think it's these type of stories that really create a lot of FOMO for people.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:22.600]   Where like, "Wow, I could go from $1 or $2 million net worth to $50 plus million."
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.800]   I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:29.360]   >> And I think that you're seeing all the IPOs a couple years ago, and all the stocks
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.840]   are popping at the IPO.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:36.480]   So there was a big trend of like, "Oh, I want to get into the next pre-IPO company.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:40.400]   I'm going to go join all these different places that are about to go IPO."
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.400]   I think we ran into a harsh reality over the last couple of years.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:48.520]   We had a lot of people going to companies like Instacart, Stripe, all these companies
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:56.240]   that were the golden child, about to IPO, having evaluations increase and double on
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.240]   a regular basis.
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.640]   But then the market soured, and all of a sudden, their plans to IPO were like, "Oh, we're
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:05.680]   going to put it on hold and wait a little bit and bump it out a little bit, bump it
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.200]   out a couple years."
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:13.800]   So it's not always guaranteed, and the upside's not locked in.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.600]   And even those safe, like, "Oh, I'm going to go at a very established company that's
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.520]   almost about to IPO, and I still get some of that upside, and it might not materialize."
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.680]   But like you said, it doesn't always go well.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.360]   We've seen more and more IPOs recently not do well.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.360]   You mentioned Uber.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.360]   So my wife's actually at Uber.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.460]   She's been there five years.
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:34.080]   So we've gone through the full pre-IPO to IPO, and the stock is still not back to the
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.800]   IPO price or within the relative range.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:47.320]   So it's not always a home run, even getting in pre-IPO and working through the IPO and
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.320]   years after.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.320]   It's good salary.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.320]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:59.680]   It's just not the all of a sudden, I'm flying private and going to my condo in Jackson Hole
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.000]   on the weekends kind of thing.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.480]   But the CEO is doing that.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.480]   The CEO's, yeah.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.480]   The CEO's are a different thing.
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:13.080]   Once you get to the executive level and the comp packages become – I mean, it's all
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:17.400]   public information being able to see what the top executives are making.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:21.240]   It's a different world entirely once you make it to that upper echelon.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.240]   It's not bad.
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:28.360]   It's interesting how much they get paid for a lot of times how little they do.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.120]   I don't know how much they can affect the company's share price.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:36.120]   But even if it's flat, they still get paid huge amounts or if it underperforms.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:40.320]   It's just amazing how great it is to be a CEO of a large public company.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.000]   I mean, if they were like the founder and CEO, okay, I can respect that.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.560]   But if you're like just a guy, a hired gun to try to like move some chess pieces, that's
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.560]   pretty impressive.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.400]   I want to move some chess pieces for $100 million a year.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:58.280]   It's such an interesting dynamic going from like the different companies that are like
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:03.640]   under-led still, which Meta being one of them, Mark still being the founder and still being
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:09.800]   CEO and still holding the majority of voting shares and having like full autonomy to decide
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.480]   the course of what's going on.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:17.560]   Not full, like obviously still at the duty of the shareholders, but having much more
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:26.560]   control than say like Dara, who's the CEO at Uber after Travis was forced to step down.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:32.480]   They have a lot of equity, but it's not coming in as the founder with like 50% equity range.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:35.480]   It's an entirely different dynamic.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:41.000]   How do regular people like me and maybe a lot of listeners here get into big tech?
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:48.880]   Because I tried getting into tech in 2012 because I've been in San Francisco since 2001.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:53.320]   After I engineered my layoff in 2012, I was like, "Okay, let me just try to get into big
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.320]   tech or tech."
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.440]   I applied to Airbnb when it was a $3 billion company.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.760]   I was like, "Oh, this is obviously a no-brainer."
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.840]   But I couldn't get in at all.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.880]   I came from finance, so I didn't have a tech background.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.480]   But I felt like I had an MBA.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.840]   I went to undergrad.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.480]   I spoke normally.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.440]   But I guess I didn't have any connections.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:18.960]   How do normal people who didn't go to great schools or have connections get in?
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.960]   What's like a path?
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:26.360]   I would like to say, I perfectly planned my career to get into big tech and it was executed
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.360]   flawlessly.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.880]   I never imagined that I would be at big tech.
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.680]   My plans were never to do it.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.960]   I can tell you my journey and I can tell you how I would think about it and the advice
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.920]   that I would give to people trying to pursue it.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:43.160]   For me personally, like I was saying before, I graduated with an economics degree, University
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:48.920]   of Texas in Austin back in 2009.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.920]   I wanted to do finance.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.480]   I wanted to do banking.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.280]   That was the prestigious job at the time.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.680]   It was like, "Oh, I want to be an investment banker and work 100 hours per week and be
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:59.680]   in New York."
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:04.200]   That's just the dream.
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:14.360]   That was the pinnacle of every econ business grad at the time of what they were wanting.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:20.200]   Going into internship season 2007, people were getting all of their offers started to
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:25.160]   get rescinded from all the investment banks.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:29.440]   Being in Austin already, all the job fairs dried up.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.120]   There was nothing available.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:37.480]   All there was was a handful of anything finance related was like selling insurance.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.880]   For some reason, they're always able to hire.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:43.640]   What I ended up doing was I was like, "I want this econ degree."
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.040]   I don't even know what that means at the time.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.240]   I'm just kind of like, I don't know.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.680]   I wanted to do business.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:52.240]   I found a random role at a startup in Austin.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.680]   The company is called Build the Sign.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.760]   It's an e-commerce company that works and makes custom signage.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.120]   I'm just like completely very random.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:05.080]   What ended up being is a handful of software engineers out of the University of Texas found
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:11.440]   this interesting niche where the online sign industry was run by these mom and pop shops
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.440]   that are just operating in person.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:18.520]   It was super expensive to deal with.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:25.400]   In the classic, let's go in and disrupt this industry, they set up this entirely custom
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:29.320]   online sign design software.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:32.080]   At the time, it was kind of revolutionary for the industry.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:36.240]   They just had a fine detailed understanding of all of their costs were so able to quickly
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.240]   undercut everyone.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:43.880]   I kind of came in over there and was working on what's called SEO, so search engine optimization,
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.280]   which is something I never even heard of.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.720]   It's not something that they taught at schools at the time, but it was all around how do
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:54.120]   you help a website rank highly in Google.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.560]   It involves some analysis.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:02.800]   It involved a lot of just learning the ins and outs of how search engines works and how
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:07.920]   different pages can rank in Google and Yahoo and depending on what you're doing, all these
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.920]   different places.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:12.840]   It was just like this, not what I planned, not what I went to school for.
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:18.040]   I just had to be opportunistic because that was what was available.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:22.120]   It almost had business analyst in the title, I think was one of the reasons why I was initially
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:27.400]   went down that path, but it had nothing to do with getting big tech in the beginning.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:30.680]   It had nothing to do with banking.
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.400]   It was just what was available.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:36.240]   I was going into a tough job market and that was kind of what was there, but what I quickly
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.280]   found is this is a big niche.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:43.460]   There's not a lot of people now after being an intern there for the summer and staying
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:46.760]   on during my junior year working there.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:53.160]   Not very many people have this SEO skill set back in 2008, 2009 and being able to leverage
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:57.640]   that into another internship at a different company that was then paying me $15 an hour
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:03.160]   instead of $10 an hour and that being a big jump up and then learning the ins and outs
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.160]   of the next company.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:10.160]   The next company was offers.com, which was doing basically like RetailMeNot, doing a
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:14.760]   coupon website where they would earn an affiliate commission off of every signup.
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:20.560]   Just very random companies that I wouldn't have thought about or knew about until I was
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.840]   in the job hunt.
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:30.060]   The consistent thing was slowly getting these more and more niche skills and what was required
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:32.780]   to be able to be effective at these jobs was getting more technical.
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:36.700]   At the time, it started with being really proficient in Excel.
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:41.520]   Over time, it became needing to know how to use SQL because the data sets ended up getting
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.520]   bigger.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:46.320]   All it was, if you're coming from finance, you know your Excel, you know doing pivot
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.320]   tables.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:50.400]   It was just translating how to do all of that into SQL.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:54.200]   It's just like reconstructing all of your pivot tables into SQL ends up being the same.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:58.800]   If you're coming from an Excel-heavy background, starting to get more technical in SQL, once
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:04.240]   you understand how the connections are working and how you're trying to manipulate the data
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.840]   in the same way, the connections start happening there.
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:11.720]   There's this overall trend of being more technical over time.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:17.920]   Then I had another break where I joined Indeed.com, which is the job search site.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.640]   Again, just being opportunistic, constantly looking at new opportunities.
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:28.720]   I think these first couple of jobs I was there, a year and a half, two years max, and continuously
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:33.600]   looking for bigger roles, bigger opportunities, and the opportunity to learn more.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:39.640]   Early on, again, I was earning $30,000 out of school, no equity.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:43.960]   I was getting some private company stock, but it was imaginary stock that just went
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.360]   away after I left the company.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:51.280]   It wasn't even the pre-IPO things that we're talking about in Silicon Valley now.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:55.760]   Just starting from very small beginnings, not imagining that I would be working at big
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.400]   tech, but getting more technical.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:02.360]   Indeed, it changed the game for me because the data sets ended up getting much larger.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:05.720]   I had a manager that pushed me to be more technical.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:10.360]   It was like, "Hey, if you're going to do this and be successful, you need to really
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.280]   double down on your technical acumen.
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:16.240]   It's not good enough being a marketer that knows Excel.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.240]   You need to be proficient in SQL.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:21.880]   You need to be proficient in Python because that's what we need you to be.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.880]   If you're going to be successful here, you need to learn these things.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:30.440]   We'll equip you with the training and the classes to get there, but you need to put
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.440]   in the work."
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:38.080]   It was that big unlock and getting even more technical with every single role, getting
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:43.800]   even more niched down where I had this specialty that I could always fall back on, where I
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:47.600]   felt like I could get these niche jobs at any place.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:51.160]   Indeed, I had the benefit of them growing incredibly quickly.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.560]   When I started, I think there was a couple hundred.
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.560]   When I left, there was a couple thousand over three years.
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:02.080]   When you're at a company that's small and growing quickly, you also quickly gain ownership
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.080]   over different things.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:08.280]   I went from being an analyst to a senior analyst to a manager to a director within a span of
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.800]   three years.
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:16.560]   There's a lot of title inflation that goes on in smaller companies, but as an early career
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:21.520]   person, you're getting more responsibility faster than you would get anywhere else.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.440]   Now, we're talking.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:28.760]   We're talking the five years out of school, still in Austin, never thought I was going
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:35.240]   to be leaving Texas, bought a home, got married, had chickens in the backyard, the classic
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.840]   American dream in my head.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:42.480]   It was like the white picket fence, house with the red door kind of thing.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:50.320]   Then get this random message on LinkedIn from a recruiter at Facebook and saying, "Hey,
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:56.280]   we have this opening on this role called growth marketing and we think that you would be a
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.900]   good fit."
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.880]   Little did I know, they reached out to every single person on my team.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.960]   They found a little pot of people with the skill sets that they wanted.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:09.440]   Every single person in my team, probably around ten people, little did I find out afterwards,
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.440]   we had all interviewed.
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.320]   They got in contact with all of us.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:20.480]   Half of us ended up flying out to San Francisco or Menlo Park to do interviews in person.
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:27.240]   And ended up just doing well in that interview and getting that job in there.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.240]   That was kind of my in.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.480]   It was never planned.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.460]   It was just like I was getting more technical.
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:33.600]   I was learning SQL.
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:39.320]   I was learning these skills that it turns out these big companies are really in demand
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.480]   for.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:44.880]   That was kind of my story and how to get there.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:49.860]   If I was trying to master plan my way there now in retrospect, if my goal is to be in
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:55.400]   big tech, you don't have to go through and do exactly what I did and meander through
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.400]   opportunistically.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:00.200]   I do think you should approach your career opportunistically because the roles and jobs
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:05.000]   that I'm in now didn't exist when I was first graduating.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.200]   My title now was product growth manager.
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.200]   That's not a title that existed.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.640]   Or even when I joined Facebook originally, it was like growth marketing.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.280]   That's not a title that existed.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:20.880]   So going in and getting tunnel vision too much on some of these roles isn't what's important.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:26.880]   It's more around the broad general skills that these companies are looking for.
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:30.960]   And so I think LinkedIn is a great resource of looking through and seeing who are these
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.680]   different people in these companies.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.120]   And what you'll find is actually there's more than just product managers and engineers at
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.120]   these companies.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:44.280]   There are hundreds of different roles across the spectrum, again, from doing traditional
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:51.680]   finance, especially at these public companies, the teams and teams of finance, HR, recruiting,
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:57.880]   design, content on the business side, ops, research, customer support.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:02.440]   There's all of these different roles.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.720]   And if you look through the people that have these titles, go through and see, okay, did
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.200]   they start at this company?
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.880]   In many cases, most roles, the person probably didn't start at Meta.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:15.400]   They started somewhere else, but they gained certain skills that Meta found valuable for
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.000]   these roles.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.520]   One example that I can kind of give you for the team that I was on, on product growth,
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:27.200]   some roles hire new grads, other ones don't.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:31.280]   Like engineering oftentimes will hire new grads and kind of like train them up.
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.960]   Ops roles, customer support roles will hire new grads because they can start them from
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.280]   zero and build them up.
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.920]   But other roles, they have the luxury of being like, "Hey, we want other companies to do
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.600]   the hard work and getting people with the skills, and we'll just go and poach them later
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:46.680]   on and offer them 99% salary packages."
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:53.320]   And the team that I was on, you would see pockets of people from these companies.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:57.840]   Like I said, everyone on my team indeed was recruited because we had these certain sets
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.880]   of skills.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:02.480]   You would have dozens of people on the team from Capital One, dozens of people from companies
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:07.120]   like Vistaprint or DraftKings, because these companies are actually really, really good
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:12.700]   at hiring really smart new grads and training them from scratch and getting them the skills
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.640]   that then these big companies really value.
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:19.200]   So you end up having like these unofficial feeder companies.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:24.600]   These companies wouldn't like to hear that, and I'm sure they hate seeing it, but they
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:30.040]   do a really good job of training new grads with the skills that larger companies value.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.880]   So I think if you're being an analyst, like a data scientist or any type of analyst, like
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:38.680]   "Ah, man, Capital One, I think more data scientists and analysts come from Capital
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:44.680]   One than nearly any other company that I was to pick from within Meta especially," just
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:50.440]   because I think they have such a good reputation and program of getting new grads in and learning
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.440]   those experiences.
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:57.040]   So I think it's like, look at the roles that you're excited about.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:00.040]   See what skills the people that have those roles have and what companies they worked
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:02.360]   at before they joined Meta.
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:06.880]   Then there's also the other path around like what roles do these companies like Meta hire
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:07.880]   new grads for?
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:12.880]   And then kind of like once you're in, like sometimes there's a lot more mobility on internal
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:13.880]   transfer.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.080]   If you asked me like five years ago, I would say it was even easier.
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:20.220]   Now I think it becomes a little bit more challenging depending on the...
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:24.640]   Everything is impacted by the macro environment of like how fast teams are growing and the
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.120]   need for people in different roles.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:33.000]   When teams are growing really quickly, it's much easier to be able to get in without like
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.400]   all of the skill requirements.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:37.560]   As things tighten up, it becomes a little bit more competitive because again, you're
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:40.840]   competing with people externally that might already have these skills.
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:44.820]   So needing to really set yourself apart and prove that you can kind of drive value from
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:50.560]   day one because they're not paying top of band 99% salary bands for someone that they
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:51.560]   need to train up.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:55.520]   So there's a reason why they're offering those bands because they're wanting the people that
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:58.560]   already can hit the ground running and execute from day one.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.560]   >> Okay.
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:00.840]   Well, thanks for that.
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:06.560]   So you've been there for nine years and you talked about first year guys starting out
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:11.560]   at $185,000, maybe $200,000 depending on the RSU value.
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:14.880]   You joined sounds like at what, 28, 29?
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:17.320]   >> Yeah, right around there.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:23.640]   So I joined Meta in 2014 and now I'm 36.
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:26.080]   I have to do the math backwards, so around there.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.080]   >> Okay.
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:31.000]   So joining then, obviously the stock price was much lower.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.880]   You had all that base salary growth and you got promoted.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:39.600]   So can you give an idea of how much wealth you were able to build over a nine-year bull
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:40.600]   run?
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.920]   Because I think a lot of listeners including myself will think, "God, he surely must have
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:46.920]   made a heck of a lot of money in those nine years."
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:47.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:53.040]   Early on again, so I joined Meta.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.080]   I was talking about the different levels that I had and I remember that.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:44:01.240]   So I was coming, I was at Indeed before my role was director of something or another.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:08.080]   I think I was making like $80,000 and Meta, I joined and that was in Austin, Texas too.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:13.040]   And then I joined Meta coming in and the offer that I ended up signing was I think in like
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:19.840]   $135,000 plus like $100,000 in stock.
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:25.240]   So already like around how much a new grad software engineer would make.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:31.040]   So that kind of gives you kind of the delta that a engineer has to a lot of these other
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:33.520]   functions kind of coming in.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:39.760]   So having that, what sounds like a big salary increase, but what I actually penciled in
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.600]   was that it was like compared to the cost of living and the increase that I would need
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.600]   to have in relative to Texas.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:51.320]   I was doing it like, okay, it's probably like a little bit higher, but almost a wash.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:56.040]   But I was approaching it very much of the mindset of proving that I could do it at a
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:00.800]   place like Meta would let me go back to Texas in three years and start running things and
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:06.880]   getting all the C-level jobs at all of these tech companies in Austin.
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:10.480]   That was kind of like my vision at the time.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:15.160]   So it was never around like I want to go in Meta to just earn a shitload of money and
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:17.200]   advance really quickly.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:21.160]   But every year I was kind of like, okay, do I stay at Meta or not?
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.960]   And I would always say like, I have three more years in me.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:23.960]   I have three more years in me.
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:27.160]   And the reason was because the salaries continued to increase.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:30.760]   The amount of equity that I was getting continued to increase.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:36.680]   Again, so you have that initial 100,000 rent.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:40.880]   Then a couple of years, the next year, getting another 100,000.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:45.800]   And again, like you were saying before, the stock when I joined was $60.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.880]   So that $100,000 is static.
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:53.760]   That $100,000 was based on Meta stock at, or Facebook stock at $60.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:57.000]   So you benefit tremendously from when the stock is doing really well.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.160]   All of a sudden your salaries can go from like an expectation of getting like under
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:06.080]   $200,000 to $300,000.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:12.200]   And then after a couple of years, the salaries like continue to grow because you're building
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:17.480]   up every single year, additional vests, additional equity amounts that are being granted over
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.480]   different amounts.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:22.960]   So over my span of nine years, like my total comp was anywhere from like $200,000 some
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:26.480]   years all the way to like $600,000 at like the peak.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:32.240]   So in a single year all in, and that's like liquid amount that I could sell every single
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.240]   year.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:37.040]   So we have talked about like nine years in that range, you're able to quickly, very quickly
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.880]   accumulate significant amounts of capital.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.880]   And also my household is double tech.
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:47.000]   My wife's at Uber five years, other companies before that.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:53.040]   And we'd always been able to maintain a stable or like keep our spending in check.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:56.840]   We went eight years without having a car in San Francisco, shared a one bedroom place
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:01.940]   in the middle of the mission and able to take advantage of the economies of scale that come
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:07.120]   from the dual income, no kids lifestyle early on.
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:14.560]   And I think we were saving more than like $300,000 per year in like relatively quickly
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.520]   and able to just like quickly accumulate assets.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:20.800]   And like I was always of the mindset of as soon as I get any stock, I'm selling it immediately
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:26.200]   and buying like a diversified index funds and just maxing out every single retirement
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:31.480]   account, every single mega backdoor Roth account that I could take advantage of.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:36.000]   And it's just like pumping money into these accounts.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.160]   And like in my head, I was like, okay, this is like what started as like, okay, I'm going
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:42.760]   to be able to fire in 10 years.
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:47.920]   I'm like, okay, this is like, it can happen much more quickly than I thought.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.320]   What also happened is like I was there nine years.
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:53.840]   My fire number, when I thought I could live off of also drastically changed.
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:59.360]   And when I first started, I was like, all I need is $60,000 per year to live off of.
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.920]   So I was starting from Austin, like $60,000 was a ton.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:04.320]   I could support two people, no problem.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:07.800]   I was earning $30,000 or around there.
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:12.440]   So then my, what I needed to sustain myself, my, so I kept moving the goalposts as the
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:15.740]   salaries were increasing, but I also kept enjoying the job too.
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.220]   So there's, I was getting a lot of fulfillment from the job.
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:22.640]   So there wasn't this rush of wanting to cut out and disconnect.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:27.920]   But when you're saving like 300,000 plus per year, which again, coming from a kid that
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:33.000]   started graduated making $30,000, like I never imagined that I would earn $300,000, let alone
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.600]   be able to save that amount.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:40.920]   So just, it adds up quickly, like the compound interest on top of just being able to pound
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:45.440]   money away and save it, the assets build up.
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:48.760]   So I'm going to do the simple math for everybody.
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:52.520]   Nine years times 300,000 is 2.7 million.
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:58.240]   You add, I don't know, 5% compound growth, even 8%, we're at $3 million.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:04.240]   And that's before you were saving any money when you joined Metta at 28.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:08.920]   So I'm going to guess y'all's net worth is three plus million.
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:13.960]   Yeah, you're, you're, you're, you're, yes.
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:14.960]   Okay.
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:19.200]   And what is enough for a family of three?
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.200]   What is your fire?
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.200]   How do you calculate it?
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:27.240]   My fire, I feel like I'm conservative, but I'm not as conservative as you.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:32.200]   Where I like to keep it simple around, like I like the 3% rule as opposed to the 4% rule.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:37.760]   So I kind of just take how much I need to spend and multiply that by the nice and easy
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:42.560]   33.33, which I think will get me to that 3% number.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:49.240]   So I think I put in all in my fire number being like a bit more than 4 million.
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:51.020]   I do have, I have a five-year-old right now.
[00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:53.920]   So my fire number includes certain amounts of spending.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:59.780]   So I think I'm wanting to spend like 120 grand a year, not including housing and being able
[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:03.000]   to have my daughter's college.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   Not including housing.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   Why is that?
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:13.240]   Because I think the housing is the biggest, I don't know where I'm going to retire.
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:20.040]   And the, I struggle with being able to put a number down on my enough number without
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:21.200]   knowing where.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:26.040]   So what I did was actually, I deconstructed my enough number into different components.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:30.680]   One was to cover the amount of space spend that I want, excluding housing, because housing
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:31.680]   is so variable.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:34.880]   And right now my rent in San Francisco is $5,000.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:40.280]   If I were to buy a house, it would, my mortgage would be north of $10,000.
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:44.800]   And if I moved somewhere else, it would be maybe half of that or something like that.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.640]   So that variable was always a little bit complicated.
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:55.040]   So what I did was enough to get me $120,000 per year to spend, excluding housing.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:59.040]   And I had this like ballpark number of like, okay, let's like say I'm going to leave and
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:02.320]   go to North Carolina and buy like an $800,000 house.
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:05.680]   So that's kind of where I backed into the 4 million.
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:10.200]   It was like this assumption that I leave San Francisco, but I haven't left San Francisco.
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.400]   I stayed in San Francisco.
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:16.200]   So that's where my enough number for North Carolina, isn't it my enough number for San
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.200]   Francisco.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:21.760]   And that requires kind of like potentially staying, keeping working or figuring out what
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:22.760]   that is.
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:25.360]   And it's kind of been shifting and doing it.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:31.080]   But at the same time, I think like life is too short to not live somewhere that you want.
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:37.680]   And that's where I've continuously kind of reevaluated like is, I feel like it's moving
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:42.800]   the goalposts, but at the same time, like I don't want to make a sacrifice that I like,
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:43.800]   I'm still young.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:44.800]   I'm like in my 30s, 36.
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:45.800]   I live somewhere.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:46.800]   I was like, there you go.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.800]   So the following in your footsteps.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:59.360]   And yeah, I think that like, I like San Francisco still like for all its ups and downs.
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.840]   It's still like a great place to live.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:05.720]   And I think there's like so much opportunity here that but it does, it changes your fire
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:06.720]   number for sure.
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.880]   But I'm going to tell you your fire number right now.
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:12.440]   So you spend 10,000 a month, 120,000 a year.
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:17.040]   And if you rent at 5,000 a month, so that's another 60,000 years, that's 180,000 times
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:18.040]   33.3.
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.520]   So that's 6 million.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:20.520]   There you go.
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.480]   6 million.
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:27.360]   But obviously, if you move to a lower cost area, you're probably good at 4 to 5 million.
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:31.440]   So 4 million was my non-San Francisco number.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.280]   And then San Francisco has the extra wrench.
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:35.280]   Right.
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:42.600]   So it sounds like you're kind of close to it, to your non-San Francisco number.
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:48.040]   I guess my question is do you really feel close to it even though it says you're close
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:52.880]   to it on paper because there's an emotional aspect to it of walking away and then there's
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:55.160]   actually walking away.
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.360]   It's hard to do.
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:53:00.200]   It took me – it didn't take me actually that long to do because I had the severance
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:03.440]   package and I was strategic in planning.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:05.060]   But it is still hard to do.
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:10.440]   So how far away do you emotionally feel from that fire number?
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:11.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:16.440]   I think the – so I think we were dancing around it and I can kind of go more specifically.
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:21.680]   So I was laid off from Meta last week on Wednesday.
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:24.960]   And it wasn't like a huge surprise.
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:29.960]   The mark had announced a year of efficiency back in February.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:33.160]   And then back in November, we had the first round of layoffs.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:37.160]   So we knew that there was layoffs coming for different teams.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:43.320]   And I knew that my team would potentially be impacted in May.
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:46.200]   But it was very interesting to me because in my head when I was thinking about it in
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.920]   January, I was thinking it was like awesome.
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:49.920]   I'm pretty close.
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.080]   I'm a two-income household.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:57.000]   We could get by with just like me retiring like my wife wanted to still work being able
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   to do that.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:03.320]   Or we could fire and leave and go to the North Carolinas of the world and fire immediately
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:06.600]   if we wanted to.
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:11.320]   But what I found interesting was when reality happened and the announcements of the year
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:16.760]   of efficiency and more specifically of your role being at Jeopardy in May, my first reaction
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:19.000]   was immediately start applying for new jobs.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.680]   So I found that interesting where I was like on paper, I'm writing about enough.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:27.440]   I'm writing about like this is what I need to do to be able to do whatever I want and
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:29.600]   not have money be the primary motivator.
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:34.240]   And in my head, it was always like if money was not an option, I don't know if I would
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:37.200]   spend my day working.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.720]   Like in my head, I wouldn't do nothing.
[00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:43.880]   But on paper, when I was thinking about it, I don't think I would be spending 40, 50 hours
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:50.360]   a week in a tech job even if it was paying $500,000 plus per year.
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:51.480]   That was not what I said.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:54.760]   But I think that's different when all of a sudden reality comes and punches you in the
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:58.600]   face and being like, "Hey, your job actually might go away."
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:02.960]   And immediately start applying at every single thing company and like getting out there.
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:11.600]   So like the fight or flight response in me was let me quickly fill this salary gap immediately
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:13.080]   as quickly as I can.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:21.360]   And now I'm on the officially still employed because I'm on severance or during the war
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:25.240]   period and officially will be off in the end of July.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:28.840]   But I also have a severance coming in that they've been fairly generous on.
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:34.880]   So I do have the luxury of not being in a hurry to do something new.
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:47.200]   But I feel less able to unplug even if I'm at my number than I thought I would be.
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:51.120]   And I think that the struggle of like, "Hey, you just got reality.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:52.120]   You got knocked out.
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:56.240]   You got a severance package on your way out."
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:56:02.960]   If you're going into fire, like you said, you're always the king of engineering your
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:05.080]   exit and getting that severance on the way out.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:11.080]   I can't think of a better way to go into fire than getting a severance package as you leave.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:12.080]   Absolutely.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:17.560]   But actually, I'm one week in of having-
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:18.560]   Caught you raw.
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:19.560]   Of the seven series.
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:23.080]   So you're coming in raw and having the like, "I don't know."
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:31.720]   I think the part of me is wanting to taste the freedom that can come with fire.
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:40.240]   But at the same time, the uncertainty is still there.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:45.480]   The reality changes when the big paychecks kind of stop, especially I think when after
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:46.480]   severance ends.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:47.480]   It hasn't stopped yet.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:48.480]   It hasn't stopped.
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:49.480]   I'm still getting paid like normal through July.
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:51.480]   And then the severance check lands in August.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:54.040]   It's like a race against time.
[00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:58.000]   You basically, you're like, "Okay, let me see if I can set something up before those
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.640]   normal paychecks end."
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.400]   But here's one strategic thing that I suggest you do.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:07.840]   Have you started applying for unemployment yet?
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:10.840]   Last week on Monday, I was doing my projections.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:15.040]   And then this week on Monday, I was filling out my unemployment.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:20.360]   And very interesting for California folks, while you're on your warrant period, you're
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:21.360]   eligible for unemployment.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:25.160]   And that's up to $450 per week.
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:29.480]   And you could be sure that I immediately signed up for unemployment and got the ball, started
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:31.800]   to be rolling there.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:38.280]   And if the unemployment office is listening, I'm also actively looking and willing to work
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:41.120]   as one of the many requirements of doing that.
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:42.120]   Exactly.
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:46.880]   So for the folks out there who've gotten laid off and you have your warrant act pay of one
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:52.320]   or two months, maybe longer, you deserve to apply for unemployment.
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:53.320]   You're part of your salary.
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:55.600]   Your company paid for unemployment insurance.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:56.600]   It's yours.
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:59.720]   You get usually up to 26 weeks for most states.
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:04.040]   Go apply for that ASAP because you're not going to get denied because the company laid
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:08.520]   you off and therefore they'll say, "Yes, you are eligible for unemployment."
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:15.280]   The other thing mentally for you, Andre, I think is you have a wife who sounds like similar
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:19.680]   age to you who is making a similar amount of money to you.
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:21.280]   Yeah, correct.
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:26.080]   And what's interesting in the FIRE community is that I've noticed many, many men out there
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:31.120]   who say, "I'm retired or I'm financially independent," but then they have working wives making a lot
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.320]   of money.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:37.680]   And because I think men have more fragile egos, they aren't willing to say they are stay-at-home
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:39.120]   dads.
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:40.640]   They want to say, "I'm retired.
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:43.240]   I conquered the financial mountain."
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:46.240]   And I'm trying to encourage more men out there to just say, "You know what?
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:50.520]   I support my loving wife who is bringing home the bacon and I'm here to take care of my
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:52.080]   child full-time."
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:53.080]   Absolutely.
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:59:00.000]   And so having a wife who works at Uber surely has to be comforting, no?
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.720]   And you can live off that income if you want.
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:05.640]   You can completely live off that and still save.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:06.720]   And it's funny that you say that.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:13.960]   I actually posted on Twitter, I was like, "What is the difference between a stay-at-home
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:16.720]   dad and a dad who's early retired?"
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:19.400]   And I was like, "The hubris."
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:21.600]   I can't think of anything else other than that.
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:24.400]   There's no material difference.
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:31.200]   And just the ego of man to not be able to say, "I'm just a stay-at-home dad."
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:33.240]   I was like, "But I don't know.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:37.160]   What is the difference, practically speaking, if your partner's still working?"
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:40.400]   That's what I think.
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:44.760]   I don't think I've run into many women, even if they're in the ability to not need to work
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:47.600]   because their husbands are paying, that would say that they're retired.
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.520]   I think there would be a backlash if they were to say that.
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:53.480]   But men have no issue of being able to say, "Oh, I'm retired.
[00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:54.480]   I worked and I'm done."
[00:59:54.480 --> 01:00:01.160]   I was like, "Yes, but I have this five-year-old that I also am now having more time to hang
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.160]   out with.
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:05.000]   But I'm retired."
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.700]   It's a funny cultural dynamic that exists that's a real thing of just the gender norms
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:11.700]   of being able to accept that.
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:19.000]   So I'm right there with you on making being a stay-at-home dad an acceptable outcome and
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   to be proud of it.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:27.080]   I don't think any parent will ever regret spending more time with their children.
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:31.880]   The data is like 80%, 90% of the time you spend with your child is over after they leave
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:34.380]   the house at 18 or 19 years old.
[01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:39.400]   So I'm pretty certain that you're not going to regret spending two, three hours at the
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:44.740]   San Francisco Zoo on a weekday when there's no class that day versus going to work to
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:49.360]   try to make six figures a year.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:52.280]   I guess how does your wife feel about the whole situation?
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.640]   Is she nervous, scared?
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:59.120]   Is she more motivated to work and work longer?
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.320]   How does that dynamic work?
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.320]   Yeah.
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.760]   She's been incredibly supportive.
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:08.600]   I also want to be very aware of this new dynamic.
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:14.000]   We've been married, I don't know, we've been together 15 years and had a kid for the last
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.600]   five years but lived together for almost that whole 11, 12 years.
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:24.560]   But it's always been one of equality and both of us earning similar amounts and both of
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:29.040]   us having incomes and never needing to rely on...
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:31.720]   We're a partnership for sure.
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:37.560]   I always said for someone in FIRE, the best decision that they can make is having a supportive
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:41.440]   partner that views finances in a similar way.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:46.920]   It's a double bonus for me because he also is compensated at a high level in tech as
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.200]   well.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.440]   But now I think it does change the dynamic a little bit.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:53.600]   I'm conscious of now I don't want to put stress on her.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:59.360]   I'm like, "Hey, you're the only one earning a living."
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:05.200]   I've always been the one that is passionate about finances and dealing with the spreadsheets
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.600]   and tracking everything.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:12.680]   So what I've been doing more of in the last week as I've been laid off is opening up the
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:16.600]   things a little bit, explaining things a little bit more and being like, "Hey, we're good."
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:23.280]   I know that I don't want her to have this added pressure and stress of being the sole
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:27.520]   income earner of the house and we're all reliant on her.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.160]   And if we don't do that, we won't be able to eat.
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.160]   I'm like, "That's not the case.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.160]   We're good."
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:37.200]   I'm still in this severance for the next six months and we have health insurance paid for
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.200]   by Meta.
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:41.800]   Thank you, Mark, for the next six months.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.960]   And we're in a good spot and I can get another job if needed.
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.640]   We're set.
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:51.640]   The whole reason for FIRE and focusing on these things is so we didn't have to have
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:52.640]   these stresses.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:57.200]   And that's the thing why I'm also coming in a week after being laid off and having generally
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:58.200]   good spirits.
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:01.480]   I'm not like super, it's not super fun, but it's still like, "Hey, I'm good.
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.880]   I was preparing for this.
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:03.880]   I'm ready for it.
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.520]   I have that huge emergency fund buffer.
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:11.760]   I have plenty of equity to live off of and a heavy working spouse that's still earning
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.960]   her side of things."
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.200]   So we're in a good spot.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:22.320]   And I think she's getting more comfortable with it, but I'm being extra conscious of
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:23.920]   making sure that she's not feeling extra pressure on it.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.000]   And also I have more time.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:35.600]   I need to step up and do more in the household side of things and not be a productive member
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.240]   of the household just because I'm not working.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:44.120]   Because I can be in a cave downstairs and play video games all day and not continue
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.120]   to contribute.
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:50.760]   >> I forgot to ask, with your net worth, roughly what is the percentage breakdown in how you
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.160]   invested since you're renting your place?
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.160]   >> Yeah.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:55.160]   That's a good question.
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:04:00.800]   So when I was in Texas, we actually bought a house when we first got married.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:05.160]   And I was like, because my plan was originally to go back to Texas in three years.
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.880]   So we kept the house and we were renting it out.
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.880]   I hated being a landlord.
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.560]   It was like, actually for the first year and a half, two years, it was fine because I didn't
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.560]   have to deal with anything.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:16.800]   But as soon as I had turnover and went back and saw that they destroyed the place, they
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:20.960]   had like four dogs that I didn't know about and the carpet was ruined.
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:27.040]   I was like, "Oh, I'm going to manage it myself and remotely from California and not worry
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.840]   about paying a property manager."
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:32.960]   And just like, I was looking at my tech salary and how much I was saving.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.840]   I was looking at how much I was gaining in rental income.
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:37.760]   I was like, "This is not worth the stress."
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:42.000]   I'm like, "I'm going to dump this and put it all in index funds."
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:49.200]   So all of my net worth is all like super boring index funds split across.
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:56.720]   Most of it now is in taxable, but I'm filling out every single square inch of tax advantage
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.960]   accounts that I can.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:07.240]   Both Facebook and Uber offer the ability to contribute to what's colloquially called the
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.240]   mega backdoor.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:16.640]   So I'm able to contribute like $66,000 for each of us between traditional and Roth money
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:24.000]   and then beyond that, so that already there is like what, 60, 66, like 100, 120 plus thousand
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.720]   tax advantage per year.
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:31.600]   And then the rest is just going into taxable, just buying stuff like VTI, VTSAX, VOO.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.600]   I'm boring.
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.600]   I like being boring.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:37.960]   I viewed it very much as I have a high salary.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.200]   I'm earning a lot of money.
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:43.880]   I don't need to be going and chasing high returns in the market.
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:46.640]   I'm fine with being as good as the market.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:47.800]   I don't need to hit home runs.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:53.240]   I just want the easy singles without having the downside risk or as much as the downside
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.240]   risk.
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.240]   That's smart.
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:58.640]   It's definitely smart, especially if you are at big tech, which is more volatile than the
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:05:59.960]   S&P 500 index.
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:06.400]   What you might find as you gain more wealth is that even investing in the S&P 500 starts
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:11.000]   feeling a little volatile as well.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.240]   Last year, for example, 2022 is down almost 20%.
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:15.240]   That doesn't feel good.
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:20.840]   I'm sure a lot of people are like, "Oh, I should have sold everything in 2021."
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:25.400]   You will see that I think your perspective will change as the absolute net worth figure
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.400]   does increase.
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.400]   I hope it does increase.
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:28.400]   Yeah, that's the hope.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:31.720]   And then the real estate too is also one that they got.
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:35.920]   The reason I've never done real estate both on my personal residence, mostly from my personal
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:41.280]   residence standpoint is I've never been confident that I'd be somewhere for more than five years.
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:44.640]   And to me, penciling it in, the rent was fine.
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:48.080]   If you know that it's going to be the seven years and you're not banking on appreciation
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:50.360]   too much, it starts making sense.
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:57.220]   San Francisco is a tough one where the housing is so expensive.
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:00.560]   I think the housing that we would look at would be in the one and a half to two million
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:01.560]   range.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:05.920]   And it's a lot.
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:12.040]   That changes the math very, very quickly.
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:14.680]   So I think that's the other portion.
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:20.600]   I don't know if it'll wreck forever, but until I'm super confident that we have like seven
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:24.160]   plus years in a place, I think the hanging tight in that.
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:28.440]   I'm going to guess with a 75% probability, you're still going to be in San Francisco
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:29.440]   within the next 10 years.
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:34.640]   I don't think you're wrong as someone who's consistently written about leaving San Francisco,
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.680]   but still stays in San Francisco over and over.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:41.360]   And my daughter just got into a great public kindergarten in the city.
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.560]   And I think this is the first time ever that I've been able to like, "Hey, if we like this
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:48.680]   kindergarten, I could see that's like six years."
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:52.800]   And now I'm no longer having to pay private preschool tuition.
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:55.520]   That's gives me almost $40,000 a year, which is going to be pretty awesome.
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:56.520]   Yeah.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:57.520]   I see your future.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:58.520]   The Oracle in here.
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:01.640]   We can go play pickleball sometime during the week.
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:02.640]   Yeah.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.720]   Well, this has been a great conversation, Andre.
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:11.020]   And I wish you the best of luck in your job hunt or whatever is next.
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:16.040]   Can you remind the listeners again where we can find you, especially your newsletter?
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.200]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:18.200]   You can find my newsletter.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:25.360]   Go to avocadofire.com or search Andre Nader and you'll find my sub stack newsletter.
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:26.360]   Subscribe there.
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:29.480]   I've been writing twice a month, but now I have a little bit more time on my hands.
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:35.480]   Maybe I'll be writing a little bit more often and testing the waters on more frequent posting
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.480]   schedules.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:39.480]   You should because I publish three times a week.
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:42.680]   You should publish more.
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:47.840]   You might discover that it'll be easier and then obviously you might grow further.
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:48.840]   And then you might be like, "You know what?
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.640]   I don't need to go back because my newsletter is growing so much."
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:54.000]   You never know.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   That could be the dream.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000]   I'll follow in your footsteps.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   All right, buddy.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:03.440]   Well, it was great chatting with you and I'll see you around the internet sphere and we'll
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:04.440]   be in touch.
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:05.440]   Absolutely.
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:06.440]   Thanks for having me on, Sam.
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:07.440]   All right.
