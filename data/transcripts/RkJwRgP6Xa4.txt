[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   It flies in the face of this view that, like, there's a limit.
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.180]   Like one of the things that I think is kind of weird about this memory system stuff or
[00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.780]   memory championships or something like that is people are like, "Oh, if you do these things,
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.380]   will you start to forget other, like, normal human stuff?"
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.860]   And what's weird is, like, no.
[00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.580]   I've been doing this memory system stuff for years.
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.340]   I just know more stuff now.
[00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.260]   And this is aligned with the experimental literature, which seems to suggest that there's
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.940]   probably upper bounds, but we're not close to them.
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.420]   And some of these memory champions have memorized, I mean, truly absurd, you know, orders of
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.300]   magnitude, maybe two orders of magnitude more things than I have practiced.
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.940]   Certainly people who are multilingual have really, really absurd numbers of things memorized.
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.940]   So there isn't, like, a resource management argument.
