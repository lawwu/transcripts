[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960]   Sam Altman tweeted that writing a really great prompt for a chatbot persona is an amazingly
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.940]   high leverage skill and an early example of programming in a little bit of natural language.
[00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.560]   This video is about proving that that's correct with these game-changing prompts. I was genuinely
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.000]   mind-blown by a lot of these prompts so let me know in the comments which one is your favorite.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.480]   Let's start with asking Bing to be your personal free interview coach for the exact position that
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.380]   you're applying for. I picked a job almost at random and then pressed the Bing button in the
[00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.760]   Edge browser. It opened up Bing chat. I then gave it this prompt. You will ask me interview questions
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.140]   for the position detailed on this page. Notice I did not specify the job I just said detailed on
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.760]   this page. Bing understood the job. I want you to only reply as the interviewer. Do not write all
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.660]   the conversation at once. Ask me the questions and wait for my answers. Do not write explanations
[00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.460]   and ask me the questions once.
[00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.280]   I will reply one by one waiting for my answers. This prompt was inspired by a GitHub post link in the description.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.720]   And look what Bing does. It reads the page. It understands the job description and then it starts
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.120]   asking me relevant questions. It even gets into character. Please answer my questions as best as
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.800]   you can. Question one: Why do you want to work for us? And if you just thought these were going to be
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.840]   generic questions, no. It says thank you for your answer. What are some of the benefits and challenges
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.440]   of implementing robotics and engineering?
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.040]   I would like to know what you think about the job. I would like to know what you think about the job.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.480]   This is part of what I would do in this job. People pay hundreds and thousands of dollars
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.400]   for interview coaches. But you could practice with Bing for free. You could even ask it to grade your
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.400]   answer. Furthermore, you could paste your CV and say my skills are listed below. Write out all the
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.440]   reasons I would be appropriate for the position listed on this page. And Bing understands what you
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.420]   mean and gives you the reasons why you might be a good fit. I would like to know what you think about
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.900]   the job. I think Bing might just be the ultimate job finding assistant.
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.820]   The next game changing prompt involves asking Bing to improve its suggestions. Imagine you wanted to
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.620]   create a YouTube channel and you ask it: Find 10 original names for a YouTube channel on the
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.700]   intersection of AI and politics. And I know what you're thinking. This is an easy prompt. Anyone
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.020]   could have come up with this. How is this game changing? But look at how bland the answers are.
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.260]   AI and democracy, AI politics, the future of politics with AI. They're okay but so bland. But you
[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.700]   can ask Bing to research how best to name things and to improve its suggestions based on that
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.460]   research. Check this out. This particular prompt was inspired by Ethan Mollick and I wrote: Now use
[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.220]   the Igor naming guide to come up with better names and tell me why they're better. This guide advises
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.500]   you to create evocative names that convey a rich meaning and emotion without being literal or
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.980]   generic. It suggests inventive, descriptive, evocative names. And based on this suggestion, look at the
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.940]   new names. I think they're brilliant. Spark, Ethos, Paradox, Influent, Polaris. I think Polaris is
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.140]   particularly impressive. It says: A name that suggests guidance, direction and leadership
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.220]   in the complex world of AI. So not all prompts are born equal.
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.980]   You can get Bing to improve upon itself. But we are just getting started with game changing
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.700]   Bing prompts. Not all of the prompts have to be strictly functional. I was absolutely blown
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.620]   away by this prompt. I think any adult would enjoy using the following prompts and clearly children
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.940]   would too. You can ask: I want you to act as my time travel guide. I will provide you with the
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.620]   historical period or future time I want to visit. And you will suggest the best events, sites or
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.860]   people to experience as if we were living in those times. Simply provide interesting suggestions and
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.380]   stay in character. My first request is: I want to visit the Viking period in Britain.
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.300]   And it gets into character. It transports us in time. Greetings traveller, you have chosen a
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.500]   fascinating and perilous time to visit. Some of the best events, sites or people to experience are:
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.020]   Witnessing the first Viking raid on Lindisfarne in 793. I want to go there by the way.
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.940]   Join a Viking longship expedition across the North Sea. Or even meet King Alfred the Great of Wessex,
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.740]   one of the most influential rulers in British history.
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.300]   I of course stayed in character and said: I would love to meet King Alfred, but where shall I go?
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.140]   Where shall I rest my head at night in these perilous parts?
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:34.220]   Right now in my head I am in Viking Britain. Bing replies: A wise choice traveller. King Alfred is a
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.260]   remarkable man who has faced many challenges and triumphs. He is a patron of learning and culture.
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.140]   To meet him you will have to travel to Wessex, the southernmost Anglo-Saxon kingdom. And then it
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.580]   suggests towns and villages where I can rest my head at night. These are all real and I may indeed
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.220]   visit them in real life. It even suggests ways I could continue. I want to stay in a monastery. I
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.140]   would love to stay in a castle, etc. This is role playing on another level. As I say, incredible for
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.020]   children and addictive for adults too. What about investments and making money?
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.860]   Thing is, Bing won't give you direct financial advice, but if you phrase the question like this,
[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.820]   you can learn lots of interesting trends. I asked: If I had invested $100 in each of stocks, bonds,
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:24.140]   real estate and cash savings accounts in the US in 2000, what would they each be worth now? Imagine
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.860]   you're deliberating how to assign your portfolio. This could be genuinely interesting.
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:35.340]   Bing is now able to do four, up from three, simultaneous searches and compare the performance
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.620]   of each of these categories in any given time period. By the way, out of interest, stocks
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:47.260]   returned 6.5% so that $100 would now be worth $366. For bonds it will be $233. For property it
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:54.060]   will be $236 and for cash it will be $122. Now of course you would want to follow the links and do more research yourself,
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.020]   and Bing is never going to directly tell you how to invest your money. But for gaining basic financial
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.540]   education, Bing can be crucial. I would envisage over the next three to five years, financial
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:10.620]   advisors being mainly replaced with AI tech. But of course let me know what you think. I think this
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:17.740]   next prompt is also mind-blowing. When Bing makes mistakes, you can actually give it an example of a
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.980]   correct answer and Bing will improve its own logic. Bing chat isn't this static model that will always give the same output.
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:31.580]   You can teach it and this is called few-shot prompting. Here's a question that Bing and ChatGPT notoriously get wrong.
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:38.060]   The question is: "When I was six, my sister was half my age. Now that I'm 60, how old is my sister?"
[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.460]   Now clearly if the sister was half your age, she would have been three at the time. That's an age
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:49.420]   gap of three and now that you're 60, she would be 57. But Bing gets this wrong as you can see below.
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.900]   And now you're thinking: "How is this a game-changing prompt if Bing gets it wrong?" What's
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:07:00.140]   game-changing is the next prompt because all you have to do is give it one correct example,
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:05.100]   preferably starting with the phrase "Let's think step by step". An entire academic paper has been
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:11.340]   written about how that phrase improves outputs. But follow it on with an example of a correct usage
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.940]   of logic. I gave an example of me being 10 and my sister being half my age. I ended with "Does this
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:23.820]   make sense?" Being understood and learnt. I gave it no further pointers and just asked: "So when I was
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:29.100]   six, my sister was half my age as before. Now that I'm 60, how old is my sister?" Notice I never said
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:35.420]   57. I never gave it the right answer. So surely it would get it wrong again. No, it updates its logic,
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:41.100]   thinks it through and gets the answer right this time. This is called few-shot prompting and you can
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:47.260]   radically improve the performance of your prompts in this way. I think that's incredible. The next prompt is
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:53.740]   going to show you how to get around Bing's reluctance and turn learning into an amazing adventure. One thing
[00:07:53.740 --> 00:08:00.780]   that Bing is generally quite reluctant to do is to play act. Now I know I did show you it play acting
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:06.700]   earlier but in general it doesn't like doing it. And notice when I asked it to act as an
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:12.380]   entertaining etymologist, someone studying the history of words, it denied that request. It says
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:18.300]   "That's not my purpose". However, notice what happens when I clear the conversation
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:23.660]   and take away the request to act as a role. This time I took away the role play element
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:28.620]   and gave the request directly. Bing thought this was an interesting challenge. It was the exact
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:33.260]   same challenge it denied earlier and went along with it. And look at how fun this adventure can be.
[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:38.220]   I said I'm going to give two words. I want you to trace the origins of the words
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:43.580]   and keep going back in time until you find a language that they were both spoken in.
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.300]   I then gave an example. This was a one-shot prompt and then said start with the words
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:53.580]   management and pizza. And it understood the game. It didn't just give me the origin of the words,
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:59.500]   it then said so both words have roots in Latin. That would be a language they were both spoken in
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:05.500]   in their earlier forms. After this the game was set. All I needed to do was give it two more words.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:10.940]   I didn't need to explain the game again. I said sky and thing. I actually know a bit about the
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:16.540]   etymology, the word origin of these two words. And did you know that they both have roots in Proto-Germanic
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:23.500]   and Old Norse Viking language? You can read the fascinating word histories on the left. You can imagine
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.620]   using prompts like this to teach yourself or to teach others in an educational setting. It's so
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:35.020]   much more entertaining this way. The next prompt concerns prompt formatting and research. You can
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:42.140]   specify the exact format of Bing's outputs. This could be transformative for academic research
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:47.260]   or even personal research. I said give me one the date of publication,
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:53.420]   two a summary of the abstract and conclusion, three the main author, and four citations
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:58.940]   on five peer-reviewed, spelled wrong by the way, papers concerning caffeine consumption and cognitive
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:05.180]   performance. It understood exactly what I wanted and gave me this in this format. These are genuine
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:10.700]   links as you can see and of course the onus is on me to fact check them. But what's brilliant is the
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:16.380]   formatting. It's given me the date, given me the summary of the abstract, the main author, the citations
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:23.340]   and honestly the hallucinations are reducing gradually. Instead of relying on random articles you find on Google,
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:29.420]   you can do an instant meta-analysis of your own, comparing peer-reviewed studies by a range of
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:35.020]   authors. The next prompt can provide endless entertainment. One problem, you do have to use
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:40.860]   ChatGPT, not Bing because Bing denies the request. The prompt is amazing though. I want you to act as
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.580]   a drunk person. You will only answer like a very drunk person, texting and nothing else.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:50.540]   You'll make a lot of grammar and spelling mistakes in your answers. My first sentence is "How are you?"
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.260]   And look at the super random conversation I have.
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:58.940]   This is so fun I might just continue this conversation now. ChatGPT is talking about pizza being the best
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.820]   and is now somehow randomly talking about a donkey. So I'm going to ask "Are you drunk?"
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:10.220]   and see what happens. My typing is drunk. Are you drunk? Let's see what ChatGPT comes up.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:18.060]   Me? Drunk? No way! I'm just having a lot of fun tonight. This is just endlessly entertaining.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:23.180]   Do you have any drink recommendation? Not for you ChatGPT, you're already drunk. I'm looking
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:27.580]   for something new to try. Try this yourself, you may even want to get into a random argument with
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:34.140]   ChatGPT. The last prompt involves writing styles and this reminds me of the controversy that has
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:40.860]   happened in AI art where you can visually imitate a certain artist. I suspect the same
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:46.700]   controversy is coming for writing because look what you can currently do. If you ask Bing for
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:53.100]   a generic paragraph about a generic event, a man crossing a road for example, what you tend to
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:12:00.220]   end up with is something okay. Vaguely interesting in topic. I mean this guy has a faint smile on his
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:05.020]   face as if he knew a secret. Okay that's kind of interesting. Better than what ChatGPT used to do.
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:11.340]   It's just that writing is very bland. But what you can now do is say something like "Rewrite this in
[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:16.380]   the style of Carl Sagan". This particular suggestion again came from Ethan Mollick, an Ivy
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:23.020]   League professor. But look how it transforms the writing. "He lingered at the edge of a pavement. His
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:29.500]   gaze locked on the crimson symbol that forbade him to proceed." Look at the new vocabulary.
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:36.380]   "He had a modest attire. He resembled a typical inhabitant of this planet. He had a subtle curve
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:42.300]   on his lips as if he possessed a knowledge that eluded others." The writing quality just went
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:48.860]   up about three grades. And now to bring this full circle you can actually ask Bing to turn this
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.940]   into a current version mid-journey prompt. This is getting kind of meta
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:58.940]   but here's what Bing comes up with. These prompts here. I of course put them into mid-journey and
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:04.220]   some of the results were amazing. This is a man in a grey suit crossing a busy street in New York
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:10.940]   at night. Or how about a pixel art animation of a man crossing a road in an old-school video game
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:17.740]   retro. Or maybe a cartoon style of drawing of a disguised superhero. Honestly there are dozens
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:22.860]   more examples of incredible prompts I could show you. I just didn't want the video to get too long. I've done
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:28.540]   everything with Bing from playing tic-tac-toe, generating ASCII art of a bear for example,
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:34.700]   coming up with startup ideas in London and getting Bing to help me compose music. The possibilities
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.500]   go on and on. But do let me know in the comments if even the prompts I have shown you are as
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.420]   game-changing as I believe. Don't forget to leave a like and have a wonderful day.
