[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.860]   Boy, if 2020 has taught us anything, it's that the times are always uncertain and our
[00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.060]   lives in this world are far less stable than we realize.
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.660]   More and more, it seems like the only predictable thing about this life is its unpredictability.
[00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.600]   So in the middle of the current social and medical and economic upheavals that very few
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.020]   of us could have foreseen this spring, what eternal promises root us?
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.360]   We in fact have some amazing promises from our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, who apparently
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.700]   knew that our lives would remain unpredictable until He returned.
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.440]   So He left us with His closing words in Matthew 28 verses 16-20.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.280]   And there we read this, "Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.780]   Jesus had directed them.
[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.120]   And when they saw Him, they worshipped Him, but some doubted.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.820]   And Jesus came and said to them, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.380]   Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.860]   of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded
[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.860]   you.
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.740]   And behold, I am with you always to the end of the age.'"
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.540]   Here's Pastor John expounding on what these promises from Christ mean for us today.
[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.580]   Jesus came up and spoke to them saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.580]   on earth."
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.100]   "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth."
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.880]   Now that's a very lofty claim for anybody to make.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.380]   It has been given to Him by God the Father.
[00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.780]   Because He died, He overcame guilt, He overcame condemnation.
[00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.660]   Because He rose again, He overcame suffering and He overcame death.
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.680]   And since He has triumphed over guilt and condemnation and suffering and death, He has
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.780]   also triumphed over Satan.
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.300]   Because the only way, ultimately, that Satan can damn the people of God is with guilt and
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.820]   condemnation.
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.180]   And the only way he can rough us up is with suffering and with death.
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.540]   And if suffering and death and guilt and condemnation have been conquered by Jesus in His death
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.320]   and in His resurrection, Satan is empty-handed today in his ability to destroy believers.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.940]   This is a tremendous thing.
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.580]   And therefore, therefore, Philippians 2 says, "Therefore God has highly exalted him and
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.900]   given him a name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee shall
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.900]   bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus is Lord
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.940]   to the glory of God the Father."
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.100]   Which is just another way of saying, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.420]   given to Me."
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.020]   So here's our King who's commissioning us.
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:13.660]   This lofty claim, "All authority has been bought by Me, possessed by Me, given to Me,
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.700]   I have all authority in the universe."
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.940]   Let's ponder it for a minute.
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.740]   All authority, really, all authority.
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.980]   All authority over Satan and all demons and all angels, good and evil.
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.980]   Authority over the natural universe, natural objects and laws and forces like stars and
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.640]   galaxies and planets and meteorites.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.200]   Authority over all weather systems, winds and rains and lightning and thunder and hurricanes
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.740]   and tornadoes and monsoons and typhoons and cyclones and all their effects like tidal
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.700]   waves and floods and fires.
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:02.340]   All authority over molecular and atomic reality, atoms, electrons, protons, neutrons, subatomic
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.940]   particles, quantum physics, DNA, chromosomal reality.
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:16.060]   All plants, all animals, doesn't matter what size, whales, redwoods, giant squid and
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.900]   giant oaks.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.820]   All fish, all wild beasts he has authority over.
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.380]   All invisible animals like bacteria and viruses and parasites and germs of every kind he has
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.540]   authority over.
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.540]   He has authority over all the parts and functions of the human body, every beat of your heart,
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:42.140]   every movement of the diaphragm, every little jump across a million synapses in your brain.
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.460]   Jesus has all authority over all those physiological phenomena in your body.
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.180]   He has all authority over nations and governments and congresses and legislatures and kings
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.940]   and premiers and courts.
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.620]   He has all authority over armies and weapons and bombs and terrorists.
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.780]   All authority over industry and business and finance and currency.
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.180]   All authority over entertainment and amusement and leisure and media.
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.300]   All authority over education and research and science and discovery.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.460]   All authority over crime and violence and all families and all neighborhoods.
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:28.660]   And he has authority over his body, the church, and over every soul in the universe and every
[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:38.380]   moment and every second of every life lived now or previously or forever and ever, anywhere
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.500]   in the universe.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.580]   He has all authority.
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:51.380]   Jesus has all authority and that's why he has a right to say, "Go everywhere."
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:06:01.100]   Verse 18 is the search warrant for breaking into other cultures.
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.900]   Almost nobody in America believes we have a warrant to do this today.
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.860]   This is a massively politically incorrect thing for us to do, namely world evangelization.
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.020]   But we have a warrant.
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.820]   We have a warrant.
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.700]   You don't do this kind of thing without a warrant.
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.700]   You don't go into somebody's culture or house and say, "Jesus is Lord of this house.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.900]   Jesus is Lord of this culture," without a warrant.
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.620]   What's the warrant?
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.140]   Verse 18 is the warrant.
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:40.500]   I have died, I have risen, I have triumphed over all my enemies, I have all authority
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.220]   in heaven, I have all authority on earth.
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.620]   Go.
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:51.740]   Jump over verse 19 with me to verse 20 to see not only the lofty claim but the loving
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:52.740]   comfort.
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:07:02.620]   "Lo, I will be with you always, literally all the days, to the end of the age."
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.660]   There are three pieces to this.
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.140]   Call them identification, continuation, and duration.
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.580]   There's three pieces in verse 20 at the end.
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.900]   What do I mean by identification?
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:19.660]   I mean, would you please, for a moment here, ask the Lord to reveal to your heart what
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:26.980]   stands in the page that the one who promises never to leave you and always be with you
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.140]   is the one who has all authority in the universe.
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.180]   Would you please, right now, whisper a prayer in your heart.
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:39.300]   I'm whispering it right now for you, that God would open your eyes to what that means.
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.620]   Lord, just do it.
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.620]   Would you come at this moment and put these two verses together.
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:53.060]   Verse 18, all authority in the universe, all power, all right.
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:58.820]   The right and the power to do as you please in every area of life, every culture, every
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:04.260]   people, every religion, the right and the power to be Lord and King.
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:16.420]   You have spoken to your people, "I will always be with you to the end."
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.420]   Get it?
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:22.820]   The one who said, "I will always be with you," is that one, the identification.
[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.100]   The continuation is found in the word "always" or "all the days," and what I mean by that
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.900]   is not just length of time, but unbroken time.
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.220]   See the point?
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.300]   He doesn't go on vacation on Mondays.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:40.820]   Pastors think he goes on vacation on Mondays, and so they get real depressed and discouraged
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.820]   on Monday morning.
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.820]   "Where's God?"
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:49.220]   Well, the answer is, "As close as your skin," because he doesn't break his word.
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.500]   He does not break his word.
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.100]   I don't care how blue the day is, Jesus doesn't lie.
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.900]   I will always be with you.
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:04.340]   Dark, bright, up, down, bad, good, death, life, I will always be with you.
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:12.660]   Hebrews 13.5, "Be content with what you have, for he has said, 'I will never fail you, and
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.020]   I will never forsake you.'"
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:27.740]   So he giveth or he taketh God his loved ones, ne'er forsaketh.
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:40.500]   His the loving purpose solely to preserve them pure and holy.
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:46.900]   Swedes have good theology.
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:57.620]   Though he giveth or he taketh, God his loved ones never forsaketh.
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.900]   That is a great line, very applicable to the global church during this spring season of
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:06.820]   social and economic and medical upheaval to begin 2020.
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:12.500]   That clip was from Pastor John 21 years ago in a sermon he preached on November 1, 1998,
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.940]   titled, "The Lofty Claim, The Last Command, The Loving Comfort."

[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:49.340]   What sins disqualify a pastor for life?
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.340]   Are there any?
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.340]   That's up next time on Friday.
