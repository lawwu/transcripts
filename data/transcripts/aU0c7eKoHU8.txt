[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.620]   Did God just make me to punish me?
[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.540]   And why did he create me in the first place?
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.120]   To what end?
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.240]   Huge, massive questions like these
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.920]   arrive every day in the inbox from you,
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.120]   our friends who are listening.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.880]   Like this email from a podcast listener in New York City.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.580]   Here's his email, it's a very heavy one,
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.840]   I wanna prepare you for that.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.640]   It's a heavy question, and he writes this.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.560]   Dear Pastor John, why did God create us?
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.960]   I grew up in the Bible Belt.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.800]   In my 20s I moved to New York City.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.000]   I've been here for over a decade
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.480]   and my beliefs have been challenged here.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.320]   The past couple of years, life has been hard,
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.360]   not only for me, but for some of my closest friends.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.200]   Only a few times in my life have I been mad at God.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.680]   This past month, I was.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.400]   I think I know why he created us,
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.800]   to serve and worship him and to love others.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.880]   In New York City, I've met all sorts of people
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.960]   who reject God.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.000]   I've heard things such as, God enjoys seeing others suffer.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.800]   God isn't real because people suffer.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.480]   God doesn't answer prayers.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.040]   God doesn't talk to us.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.720]   Look at the Bible, he allowed suffering,
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.240]   killing, polygamy.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.720]   He is selfish and wants you all to himself.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.800]   On and on it goes.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.200]   In the past, I felt that even though I didn't understand
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.600]   why God allowed things, I still had faith
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.240]   to believe in him and to try to defend him.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.200]   So why did he create us and why should I marvel at him
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.440]   coming to save me?
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.640]   He should have, shouldn't he?
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.340]   He created me.
[00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.960]   Or if he wasn't going to save me,
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.520]   why did he create me at all?
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.480]   I have repented of my thoughts and I do believe in him,
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.920]   but my faith remains shaken by these questions.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.560]   Can you help me, Pastor John?
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.760]   - Well, I hope so.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.160]   Sometimes it helps just to hear God
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.320]   respond to criticisms of God.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.100]   And that's what we're gonna do in just a minute.
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.240]   This of course is one of the biggest questions
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.080]   that can possibly be asked.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.440]   Why are we created?
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.620]   Why did he make the universe?
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.640]   Why did God do this?
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.440]   Why is there humankind?
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.440]   So have mercy on me as I dare, dare in 10 minutes
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.280]   to answer questions that have caused thousands
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.400]   of books to be read.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.600]   Perhaps the clearest answer to why we were created,
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.080]   why this friend in New York was created,
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.320]   is Isaiah 43, seven.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.120]   Bring my sons from afar,
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.680]   my daughters from the ends of the earth,
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.120]   everyone who is called by my name,
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.320]   whom I created for my glory.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.960]   I think that's probably the simplest,
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.040]   straightforward sentence in the Bible
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.400]   in answer to the question, Isaiah 43, seven.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.800]   Then he clarifies a few verses later, verse 20.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.760]   The people whom I formed for myself,
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.280]   that they might declare my praise.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.080]   And here's the way Peter puts it in 1 Peter 2, 9.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.920]   That you may proclaim the excellencies
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.520]   of him who called you out of darkness
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.960]   into his marvelous light.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.960]   We exist to reflect, to proclaim,
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.320]   to display the excellencies
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.640]   of our redeeming creator, God.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.000]   So ultimately, God brought the universe into being
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.240]   and human beings into being
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.240]   so that God's glory, his greatness, beauty, and worth,
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.640]   that's my effort to fill out that term,
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.640]   glory a little bit, his greatness, his beauty, his worth,
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.080]   so that his glory might be on display
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.880]   in the objective realities of his work, like creation,
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.040]   and especially as that glory is magnified
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.160]   in the enjoyment that his people have in knowing him
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.560]   and reflecting him and praising him.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.560]   That's my long answer to the question, why are we made?
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.880]   What seems to stand in the way of our friend,
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.800]   let's call him our New York friend,
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.640]   hard place, hard place.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.320]   There are no easy places to stand for all that God tells us,
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.040]   but he's in a hard place.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.960]   What seems to stand in the way for him affirming this
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.760]   is the sort of things that people have said to him
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.400]   about God and his world and his word.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.440]   He mentions five things.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.080]   So I'm going to give a brief biblical response to each one.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.440]   That's what I meant a minute ago when I said,
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.960]   sometimes it helps just to hear God
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.480]   answer criticisms about God.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.280]   So I'm gonna let God answer these five criticisms.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.280]   Number one, God enjoys seeing others suffer.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.080]   Two responses.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.400]   First, no, he doesn't.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.160]   Not the way the critic means it.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.160]   Ezekiel 33, 11, as I live, declares the Lord,
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.320]   I do not have pleasure in the death of the wicked,
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.280]   but that the wicked turn from his way and live.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.200]   Or Lamentations 3, 32.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.560]   Though he cause grief, he will have compassion
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.880]   according to the abundance of his steadfast love,
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.280]   for he does not afflict from his heart
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.640]   or grieve the children of men.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.920]   Second response to the statement,
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.520]   God enjoys seeing others suffer.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.520]   When God finally judges the world with eternal punishment,
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.800]   when God finally judges the world,
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.960]   his judgment will be perfectly just,
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.080]   and he will not disapprove of his justice.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:21.440]   So whatever joy there is in his final act,
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.420]   it will be owing to not the sadism of a mind
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.220]   or the sadism of a monster,
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:35.220]   but to the perfect justice of one who never wronged anyone
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.220]   and who gave his son to die for sinners.
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.340]   Second thing that they say about God,
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.560]   God isn't real because people suffer.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.620]   Or look at the Bible.
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.780]   He allows suffering, killing, polygamy.
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.180]   Actually, he not only allowed it,
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.980]   he governs it.
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.860]   He's God.
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.860]   He is never cornered into doing or allowing anything
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:11.300]   that his wisdom and justice and mercy do not govern.
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:16.300]   Instead of saying God isn't real
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.860]   because he allowed suffering and sin,
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.860]   we ought to say what Genesis 50, 20 says,
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.780]   as for you sinners, you meant evil against me,
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.460]   but God meant it for good.
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.460]   I believe that is the banner over all sin in this world.
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:40.780]   God is God, not in spite of permitting sin,
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.720]   but because he constantly is turning sin
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.400]   for his wise and just and merciful purposes
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.980]   for those who trust him.
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.380]   Number three, they say, he hears in New York,
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.700]   people say God doesn't answer prayers.
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:02.420]   Well, this is their word against the word of Jesus,
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.500]   and you have to choose.
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.540]   Who are you gonna believe?
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.940]   Because Jesus says in Matthew 7,
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.180]   "Which of you, if his son asks him for bread,
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.280]   "will give him a stone?
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.180]   "Or if he asks for fish, would give him a serpent?
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.500]   "If you then, who are evil,
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.380]   "know how to give good gifts to your children,
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.720]   "how much more will your father, who is in heaven,
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.720]   "give good things to those who ask him?"
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.820]   In other words, a child may not get exactly
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.500]   what he asked for, but he will get good things
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.300]   because he asks, because he prays.
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.520]   That's what Jesus says, and if a New Yorker says otherwise,
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.220]   you gotta decide who to believe.
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.840]   Number four, God doesn't talk to us.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.460]   Answer, yes, he does.
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.820]   He does.
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:59.260]   He communicates himself in nature and in scripture
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.940]   with immeasurable fullness, and I'll say it again,
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.940]   immeasurable fullness, way beyond what we deserve or need.
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:15.600]   Romans 1, 19, "For what can be known about God
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.700]   "is plain to them, because God has shown it to them,
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.860]   "for his invisible attributes, namely his eternal power
[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.900]   "and divine nature, have been clearly perceived
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.900]   "ever since the creation of the world
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.840]   "in the things that have been made,
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.200]   "so they are without excuse."
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.240]   That's his communication through nature.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.280]   Here's 2 Timothy 3, 16.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.540]   "All scripture is breathed out by God
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.560]   "and is profitable for teaching, for reproof,
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.720]   "for correction, and for training in righteousness."
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.040]   If you can read any of the thousand languages
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.380]   where the Bible is translated,
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:01.380]   you can hear the voice of God infallibly.
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:06.380]   Whether you will acknowledge that he is speaking
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:10.760]   is another matter, but he is speaking.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.280]   And number five, they say, these New Yorkers say,
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:20.280]   "He's selfish and wants you all to himself."
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:25.540]   And my answer, God's answer, no, on both counts.
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:31.220]   First, it is not selfish for God to want you for himself
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:36.140]   because he is the greatest being that exists
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.400]   and to welcome you into his fellowship
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.740]   to enjoy him forever is not selfish.
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:42.740]   It is love.
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.360]   It is the apex of love.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.640]   He himself is the greatest gift he can give to us
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.940]   and he does not hold back.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.760]   He paid the price of his son to make it possible
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.100]   for people to be with him.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:04.100]   And secondly, he does not keep us for himself alone.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:09.360]   In the world to come, we will be the most social of beings.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.800]   We will give, he will give, Jesus will give,
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.000]   God will give us to each other
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.240]   for everlasting mutual love and admiration.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:27.240]   The biblical picture of Jesus that the Bible gives us
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:32.800]   is of him holding a great banquet
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.620]   with all his followers seated at a table
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:42.020]   in a great company, enjoying the food
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.100]   and enjoying each other.
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:48.100]   And he comes and he serves us with joy and power forever.
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.360]   You can see that in Luke 12.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:55.360]   So I return to the question with this biblical answer
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.360]   for why we were created.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.960]   Ultimately, God brought the universe into being
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.600]   and brought us humans into being
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.960]   so that God's glory might be on display
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.880]   in the objective realities of his work.
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:18.880]   And especially as that glory is magnified
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.960]   in the enjoyment that his people have
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.960]   in knowing him and reflecting him and praising him,
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.520]   especially for his grace.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.800]   - Amen, yeah, it doesn't get much bigger than that.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.680]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.040]   And thank you for the raw questions.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.600]   So many of you send on us questions like these,
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.280]   and we deeply appreciate it.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.120]   And thank you for listening.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.560]   To search our archives, read transcripts of episodes,
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.800]   or ask us a question of your own,
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:50.480]   go to our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:55.480]   Well, God is loving and God is patient and God is kind,
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.580]   but is God also severe?
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.920]   Can we say that?
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.920]   That question about the severity of God
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.360]   is up next on the other side of the weekend.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.520]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.160]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:22.320]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
