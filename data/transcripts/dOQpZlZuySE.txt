[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.940]   Today I want to do my first core idea video deep dive, I should say my first core idea
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.460]   deep dive and the topic I want to do it on is time management.
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:27.440]   So my goal here is to give a brief summary of my thinking about time management.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.180]   And what that's going to consist of is let me define for you what I mean by time management.
[00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.900]   Let me give you the three principles in my writing.
[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.300]   And on this podcast, we always talk about that any good time management system should
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.560]   probably satisfy.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:50.360]   And then I will briefly talk through my particular system, which we can think of as one example
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.420]   of a time management system that satisfies these principles.
[00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.420]   So you can do something else.
[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.500]   So you see what a real, fully fledged time management system that satisfies these principles
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.500]   look like.
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.780]   And then I'm going to have a bonus fourth principle I want to talk about, that debatably
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.700]   is not really about time management, it lives right outside time management, but it's related.
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.600]   So I'm going to talk about that briefly at the end.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.140]   So that is my agenda for this core idea discussion on time management.
[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.600]   So let's start what do I mean by time management for me, at least in the context of this discussion,
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.040]   I'm thinking about work.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.960]   So time management in work, the way you deal with your time outside of work is a little
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.960]   bit different.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.720]   So I'm going to put that aside.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.020]   And in the context of work, I'm going to define time management to be whatever philosophy
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.760]   process systems or rules that you deploy to make decisions about what you're going to
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.640]   do right now with your time.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.420]   How do you figure out it's 1226 on a Friday?
[00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.040]   What do I do next?
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.120]   In the end, that's what a time management system is a way to help you answer that question
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.280]   in as useful a manner as possible.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.180]   Now everyone who works has some sort of time management system they're using.
[00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.520]   If you don't know what it's called, if you can't tell me the details of it, if you've
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.480]   never thought about that, it's just a really bad one, probably, but you still have one
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.520]   one way or the other, you're making these decisions.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.600]   The question is just how do we want to make these decisions?
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.060]   What is going to work better?
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.780]   So I'm going to give you the three properties I think any good time management system should
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.780]   have.
[00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.500]   I love alliteration.
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.660]   Longtime listeners of the podcast know this.
[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.360]   I love C's in my alliteration, as longtime listeners of this podcast know.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:48.380]   So I named the three key properties here with three C's capture, configure, control.
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.940]   Talk about these each briefly in the abstract and I'll tell you about my system that satisfies
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:52.940]   these.
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.940]   Number one capture.
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:02.260]   I believe a good professional time management system needs to have some place in which you
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.500]   store all the information that's important to making decisions about what you need to
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.820]   be doing and what you should be doing.
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.980]   That is trusted.
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.100]   It's a place that you are going to look at things that go in there will not be forgotten.
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.520]   These ideas get out of your head and into a system so you're not wasting brain cycles
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.260]   on trying to remember or keep fresh stuff that you need to do.
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.880]   Now in the context of tasks, we can give credit to this idea to David Allen.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.020]   So David Allen and his seminal post computer time management book and I mean that very
[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.860]   specifically because as I've written about before, time management goes through big evolution.
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.580]   So post computers, computer networks and email time management went through a big revolution.
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.180]   And David Allen was there at the beginning.
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.340]   He had this idea of full capture, where he said all of your tasks should be in a trusted
[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.820]   system that you review regularly, not in your head.
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:06.020]   He actually adapted that idea from a previous business thinker named Dean Atchison, unrelated
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.540]   to President Truman, Secretary of State, same name, different person, who had first developed,
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.420]   I believe in the 1970s, this notion of full capture and David Allen expanded it.
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.900]   So that's really the core of this.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.300]   David Allen's articulation of full capture said, don't waste mental energy remembering
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.780]   things, have it in a system so your brain can be clear to actually focus on working.
[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.240]   This also reduces a lot of stress because your brain gets stressed when it's worried
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.900]   about forgetting things you need to do.
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.780]   I generalize capture though, beyond what Allen talks about.
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:45.540]   In addition to each of your commitments, being somewhere you trust, I want your plans to
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.620]   also be somewhere you trust.
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.960]   So any thinking you've done about what you're working on, on all sorts of different timescales,
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.260]   that should be written down somewhere you trust and review regularly as well.
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.340]   I think that's often overlooked, but the planning process of what's going on, how do I want
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.340]   to get my work done?
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.340]   What needs to be done this semester?
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.180]   What do I have to get done this week to hit this goal?
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.140]   That's a really important part of time management.
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.220]   I don't want that all in your head.
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.780]   That also gets captured.
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.180]   All right, second property, configure.
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:25.180]   This is a twist that I've become increasingly a loud advocate for, which is care more about
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.820]   how you actually organize this information that you're capturing.
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.820]   I think you really need to think through, once I have this information written down
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.360]   somewhere, where do I put it?
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.900]   How do I organize it?
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.060]   Is it in categories?
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.580]   Is it broken up by role?
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.700]   Equally important, getting the relevant information consolidated.
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.740]   I'm really big on this.
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.780]   So not only do you have a really smart organization for all the stuff on your plate, you're also
[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.420]   gathering in one place all the relevant information.
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.140]   You're not searching through your email inbox to try to remember what does this mean?
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.140]   And where are we?
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.500]   And what do I owe this person?
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.100]   I'm supposed to get back to Derek about the program codes.
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.100]   What does that mean?
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.100]   Let me go through my inbox.
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.620]   Now all that should be in one place.
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.900]   So these are our two goals with with organize a that the information is organized well,
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.380]   where what you want to happen here, what you want to have happen here is that you can very
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.220]   quickly get the gestalt of what's on your plate, what's do what's not who you're waiting
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.740]   to hear back from the information is put aside in such a way that it's not just a list with
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.620]   100 things and to all the relevant information is there.
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.300]   Not scrambling around to figure out what I need to know to do this thing.
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.060]   All the information is there.
[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.740]   All right, control.
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.380]   The third property of a good prime at the time management system.
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:52.980]   Control says instead of being reactive in your decisions about what you want to do with
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:58.340]   your time and by reactive, I mean just saying, okay, it's 1223 on Friday.
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.340]   What do I want to do next?
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.340]   I don't know.
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.340]   Let me see what seems relevant.
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.860]   Let me look at my let me look at my inbox.
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.020]   We look at Slack.
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.780]   Maybe I'll look at a to do list and try to choose something off of it.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.020]   Control says don't be reactive.
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.740]   Don't wait till you get to the moment to say what should I do next?
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.040]   Instead be proactive.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.860]   Make a plan for your time in advance that makes the most of the time that you actually
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:22.860]   have available.
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.400]   So you think ahead, you look at the time you have available and you say, what do I want
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.420]   to do with this?
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.300]   I'm planning the whole picture at once.
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.380]   I'm not waiting till the moment to say what happens next.
[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:43.100]   Now on the podcast, I talk often about doing this control at multiple timescales.
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.300]   You'll hear me talk about multi-scale planning.
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.580]   This is where that actually applies.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.740]   And what I recommend is that you should be doing this type of planning on three timescales,
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.500]   quarterly, weekly, daily.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:59.660]   So quarterly, you have a plan for what you want to try to get done that quarter.
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:00.660]   What's important?
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.920]   What are the big projects you're working on?
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.360]   There could even be daily work that you want to really emphasize like, look, I got to get
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.560]   my cold calls up.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.880]   So every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I spend the first hour doing cold calls, whatever
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.080]   it is, but you're making this plan for the quarter.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.900]   Looking ahead at the quarter, is this a busy quarter, not a big quarter?
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.680]   What are the big deadlines this quarter?
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.660]   Is there a huge trade fair halfway through it?
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.600]   That means the first half of the quarter has to be really focused on preparing for that
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.820]   trade trade fair.
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.940]   You're looking at the whole picture of the quarter and at this pretty big granularity
[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.580]   coming up with a plan.
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:38.080]   Every week, you then look at that quarterly plan and produce a plan for the week ahead
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.080]   of you.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.960]   Now you're doing weekly planning.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:47.000]   And when you're doing weekly planning, what you really want to do is get a sense of what's
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.380]   going to happen which day.
[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:54.440]   And then finally, you get down to the daily scale, where you say, what am I actually doing
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.260]   during the hours of the day?
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.940]   So we're in weekly planning, you're looking at what am I going to do the different days
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.260]   of this week at daily planning, you're saying, here's my day.
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.980]   I have a meeting here, I have a call here, I have two meetings here, here's a time that's
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.060]   free, what do I want to do during that time?
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:14.180]   So multi scale planning, I think is the right way to think about control.
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:19.540]   You're giving your time a job as opposed to asking in the moment, what should I do next?
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:26.260]   So I think any good time management system should do capture, configure, control.
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:32.300]   Let me talk briefly about my specific instantiation of these properties, what my time management
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.380]   system looks like at the moment.
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:42.340]   So for capture, there is where I actually store the things I need to do.
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.980]   And I use Trello, which is a task board software system.
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:52.420]   So it gives you a visual metaphor for cards on a board arranged vertically in columns,
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:10:00.980]   I use Trello, to keep track of tasks and commitments, and I use Google Docs, to keep track of plans,
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.380]   the plans I have about various things.
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.540]   So Trello is where all my tasks are.
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.540]   Google Docs are where my my plans live.
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:14.860]   So that's where in multi scale planning, my quarterly plan lives.
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.140]   That's where other plans live.
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:22.220]   Jesse and I, for example, have a Google Doc where we we have our plans for the podcast,
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.220]   etc.
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:28.660]   Trello for tasks, Google Docs for plans.
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:33.180]   In addition to the storage systems, you have to have the capture tool.
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:37.820]   So the tools you use to capture things during the day on the fly that will then get later
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.540]   moved into those storage systems.
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.100]   Now for me, I use two main ones.
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.500]   I have my time block planner.
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:49.640]   I am in a lucky situation where I was able to design and publish my own planner.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.860]   So you can obviously find out more about that at time block planner.com.
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.820]   But that planner has for every day a page in which you can capture stuff.
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.900]   So I capture stuff right in that planner.
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.820]   On my computer, I also have a text file on my desktop.
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.740]   I call it working memory dot txt.
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:12.980]   Because I think of it as like an expansion of my actual working memory.
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.860]   And I use that when I'm on my computer to capture things, especially when I'm cleaning
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.620]   out my email.
[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:22.620]   I can just type much faster than I can write and I capture all sorts of notes in this document.
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.260]   I work through ideas on the document, it really is like an extension of my working memory.
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.500]   So a lock gets captured in there.
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:32.100]   If I'm in a meeting on zoom, things are popping up I have to do.
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:36.180]   I'm writing it probably right there in that working memory dot txt.
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.580]   At the end of every day, I do a shutdown.
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.580]   My planner even has a box I checked.
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.620]   It says shutdown complete that indicates I've done my shutdown.
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.100]   As part of that shutdown process.
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.900]   I look through everything in that planner, everything in working memory dot txt.
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:55.340]   And I get it into one of those more stable systems goes on the Trello or I update my
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.320]   Google Doc.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:02.060]   So those things get pushed back down to zero, their temporary tools to capture and then
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:06.580]   they get moved into the more stable systems.
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.500]   The one addendum I should add there is the calendar.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.020]   Obviously, some of these things are appointments.
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.020]   So that goes right to the calendar.
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.020]   All right, configure.
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:17.100]   I mentioned I use Trello for my task.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:21.820]   The way I actually use Trello is I have a separate board for each of my different professional
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.820]   roles.
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:30.060]   I keep a separate board as a writer, a separate board, for example, as a teacher, which I
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:34.980]   keep as a separate board as a researcher, etc.
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.540]   Those are then split up into columns.
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.860]   There's a few standard columns that every one of these boards have.
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:44.700]   I typically have a column where I put tasks on there that's called to be processed.
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.580]   It's a pretty complicated thing I need to do.
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.380]   And I don't quite understand all the details of it.
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.980]   But I don't want to keep track of it in my head.
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.300]   But also, you know, it's five o'clock and I'm shutting down, I don't have time to spend
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.900]   20 minutes figuring out what does this mean?
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.260]   Like what are the actual actions here.
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.900]   So I'll just throw that in the to be processed column.
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:07.740]   I usually have a column on each of these boards for waiting to hear back from.
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:12.380]   So if I've sent someone a note, and I need information from them, and that information
[00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:17.820]   is critical for me to keep making progress, I like to put a card on my Trello board under
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.740]   waiting to hear back that says, here's what I'm waiting to hear back from.
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.580]   And here's what I'm going to do once I get that information.
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.080]   I don't want to remember that in my head.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.100]   So I put it on there, I typically have a column for things I'm working on this week.
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:33.540]   And I'll typically have a column for if there's specifically persistent initiatives within
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.340]   that role.
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.340]   I'll give it its own column.
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:40.820]   So I can really quickly see for this thing I'm working on.
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.940]   What are all the different things that need to be done?
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:48.140]   So as a researcher, there might be a column for a paper we're preparing for publication.
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:52.260]   In my administrative role at Georgetown, there might be a column for a search committee that
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.340]   I'm on, here's the relevant tasks.
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.020]   The time that I really get into and clean this up and look at it and move things around
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.300]   and check in on it is when I do my weekly plan.
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:08.600]   So once a week as part of my commitment to configure, I really go through these systems
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:14.480]   and I update it once a week when I'm building my weekly plan is also when I'm reviewing
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.020]   the Google Docs that capture these other types of plans that are going on and update them
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.340]   and remind myself what's on them.
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:24.740]   So the weekly scale is when I'm really getting my hands dirty throughout the week.
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.700]   I'm just throwing stuff into here at the end of each day.
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.060]   But each week I really go in and clean things up.
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.780]   All right, finally, is control.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.620]   I already talked about multi scale planning, I think is the best way to do control, you
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.620]   could do it other ways.
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:43.140]   But I do for me, it's semester instead of quarterly, but semester weekly, daily planning,
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:49.540]   semester plans in a Google Doc, weekly plan, I actually type it up in a text document and
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:50.540]   print it out.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.540]   And I keep it with me in the back of my time block planner.
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:57.620]   So that's how and I'll update it and reprint it as I need to throughout the week.
[00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:02.260]   And then for my daily plan, I'm time blocking, like I talked about, here's my day, let me
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.300]   block off everything on my calendar.
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.060]   Here's the time that remains, what I want to do during that time.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:11.020]   Well, let me look at my weekly plan to remind myself of what my big picture plan is for
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.060]   this day.
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.660]   And then I'm blocking off actual hours of time and saying, here's what I'm doing here,
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:16.660]   here's what I'm doing there.
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.200]   And I fill in all that information, I do that right in my time block planner.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.180]   But you can do this in any type of notebook.
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:27.940]   There's a whole video at my site, timeblockplanner.com that walks through the details of how time
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:28.940]   blocking works.
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.660]   So that is how I do the daily piece, you put those all together, there's my commitment
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.660]   to control.
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:41.380]   Alright, so stepping back, capture, configure, control, you do those three things, you're
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:48.980]   going to be making smart decisions about what you want to be doing with your time professionally.
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:54.060]   Now I know people get concerned, they say, well, I might be injecting too much structure
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.060]   into my life.
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:16:00.300]   And this is going to make my work life more rigid, and I'll be less creative.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.280]   I call nonsense and all of that.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:08.160]   Just because you're in control of everything doesn't mean you need to schedule every seven
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.780]   minutes of your time like a crazy person.
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:14.100]   I mean, you can, when you're in control your time, you can now start to make decisions
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:18.300]   like Thursday afternoon, starting at 12, I want to do no work, I'm going to go to the
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.820]   woods and just think about this problem I'm working on.
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.900]   When you're doing capture, configure control, you could do that with confidence, because
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:29.340]   you know what's on your plate, you've cleared out that time, you know, things aren't being
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.940]   forgotten.
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:34.260]   You made sure that you had time on Wednesday to catch up on things people need to hear
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:39.540]   about Thursday, because you're in control, you can aim that control at more breaks, more
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.960]   free time, more creativity, less stress.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.980]   You can significantly like a lot of my listeners do reduce the amount of time it takes for
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.580]   you to get your normal workload done.
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.860]   Because you're in complete control of things, move it into certain days and keep whole days
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.220]   free to basically do phantom part time jobs.
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:17:01.220]   There's a lot you can do that makes your life more interesting and creative, and less stressful.
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.460]   Once you have an intentional way of making these decisions about what do I want to do
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.460]   next with my time?
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:11.460]   All right, now I promised you a bonus property that arguably has to do with time management,
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.460]   arguably it's something different.
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.660]   So I'll just mention it briefly.
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.260]   And that is constrain.
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:25.540]   So circling this whole idea is how you figure out what gets on your plate to be managed
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:30.980]   in the first place, and how you actually manage that work.
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:35.140]   I'm just going to plant the seed here because this is a bigger conversation.
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:40.180]   But we need to be very careful about how we decide what we say yes to and what we say
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.180]   no to.
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.740]   We would really like to avoid the situation where we have so much work on our plate that
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.260]   yeah, we can control it and be organized about it, but we still don't have enough time to
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.260]   get it done.
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.860]   We want to avoid that situation.
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:56.940]   So having clear rules in place about how do I decide what I let on my plate, that's really
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:57.940]   important.
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:04.460]   Processes is the second thing that I think is really important when it comes to constraining,
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:08.100]   you know, figuring out how do I want to do this work?
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:12.380]   The stuff I let on my plate, can I put a process in place that will reduce the footprint this
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.660]   has on my schedule?
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.260]   There's a lot of different things this can mean.
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:21.260]   And again, because we're just seed planting here, I'm just going to very briefly skim
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.500]   the surface, but there may be automation you're doing here.
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:29.300]   You know what, we have to produce this same client report every week.
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:33.100]   I don't want to just send emails back and forth and kind of figure it out at the last
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.100]   minute.
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.100]   Here is our process for doing it.
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.100]   And you figure out a whole process.
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.100]   That's the same thing.
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.140]   The same things happen at the same times every week.
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.700]   You can rely on it.
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.940]   You've taken that burden off of your planning system to have to figure out from scratch
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.140]   for small questions and back and forth.
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:52.620]   You might push that all towards office hours, three days a week for one hour.
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:53.620]   Well publicized.
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:54.620]   I'm in my office.
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.540]   Zoom is on.
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.540]   Come to that office hours.
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.860]   If you have a small question for me, come to that office hours.
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.700]   If there's a little bit of information you need, come to that office hours.
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.860]   If there's something we can figure out in two minutes of back and forth.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.540]   And when people bother you with an email or slack, like, Hey, what are we doing again
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.540]   about this?
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:12.860]   Or can explain to me again what this thing means?
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.580]   Just say, yeah, come to my office hours.
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:21.340]   These type of processes are all about reducing what it is that you actually do have to manage
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.380]   with your capture configure control system.
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:27.100]   You want to simplify that simplify what's on your plate, simplify how the things around
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.100]   your plate are executed.
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:34.140]   The easier you can make the planning version of yourself job, the better you're going to
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.540]   do at your actual job.
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:36.540]   All right.
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.740]   So let me summarize it there.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:45.140]   That is my thinking on this core idea of time management.
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:52.420]   [Music]
