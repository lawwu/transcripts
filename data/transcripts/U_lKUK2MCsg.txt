[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   The following is a conversation with Grant Sanderson.
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.640]   He's a math educator and creator of 3Blue1Brown,
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.000]   a popular YouTube channel
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.020]   that uses programmatically animated visualizations
[00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.280]   to explain concepts in linear algebra, calculus,
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.000]   and other fields of mathematics.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.840]   This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.100]   If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,
[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.960]   give us five stars on Apple Podcast,
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.360]   follow us on Spotify, support on Patreon,
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.360]   or simply connect with me on Twitter
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.200]   at Lex Friedman, spelled F-R-I-D-M-A-N.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.720]   I recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.520]   I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.040]   and never any ads in the middle.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.160]   They can break the flow of the conversation.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.600]   I hope that works for you
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.260]   and doesn't hurt the listening experience.
[00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.680]   This show is presented by Cash App,
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.040]   the number one finance app in the App Store.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.860]   I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,
[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.560]   but you can also use it to buy, sell,
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.960]   and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.520]   Cash App also has an investing feature.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.560]   You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth,
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.800]   no matter what the stock price is.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.600]   Brokerage services are provided by Cash App Investing,
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.480]   a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.480]   I'm excited to be working with Cash App
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.620]   to support one of my favorite organizations called FIRST,
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.060]   best known for their FIRST Robotics and LEGO competitions.
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.380]   They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students
[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.240]   in over 110 countries
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.720]   and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.680]   which means the donated money is used
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.040]   to maximum effectiveness.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.920]   When you get Cash App from the App Store, Google Play,
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.200]   and use code LEXPODCAST, you'll get $10,
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.880]   and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.960]   which again is an organization
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.680]   that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.440]   to dream of engineering a better world.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.240]   And now, here's my conversation with Grant Sanderson.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.120]   If there's intelligent life out there in the universe,
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.240]   do you think their mathematics is different than ours?
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.280]   (Grant laughs)
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.320]   - Jumping right in.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.340]   I think it's probably very different.
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.220]   There's an obvious sense the notation is different, right?
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.860]   I think notation can guide what the math itself is.
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.080]   I think it has everything to do
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.200]   with the form of their existence, right?
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.840]   - Do you think they have basic arithmetics?
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.680]   Sorry to interrupt.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.200]   - Yeah, so I think they count, right?
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.320]   I think notions like one, two, three, the natural numbers,
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.160]   that's extremely, well, natural.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.400]   That's almost why we put that name to it.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.720]   As soon as you can count,
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.980]   you have a notion of repetition, right?
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.280]   'Cause you can count by two, two times or three times.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.760]   And so you have this notion of repeating
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.640]   the idea of counting,
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.760]   which brings you addition and multiplication.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.480]   I think the way that we extend to the real numbers,
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.240]   there's a little bit of choice in that.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.760]   So there's this funny number system
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.160]   called the surreal numbers
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.640]   that it captures the idea of continuity.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.560]   It's a distinct mathematical object.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.400]   You could very well model the universe
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.980]   and motion of planets with that
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.800]   as the back end of your math, right?
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.480]   And you still have kind of the same interface
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.560]   with the front end of what physical laws you're trying to,
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.080]   or what physical phenomena
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.760]   you're trying to describe with math.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.840]   And I wonder if the little glimpses that we have
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.660]   of what choices you can make along the way
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.280]   based on what different mathematicians
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.400]   have brought to the table
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.260]   is just scratching the surface
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.520]   of what the different possibilities are
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.520]   if you have a completely different mode of thought, right?
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.640]   Or a mode of interacting with the universe.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.500]   - And you think notation is a key part of the journey
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.840]   that we've taken through math.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.080]   - I think that's the most salient part
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.380]   that you'd notice at first.
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.840]   I think the mode of thought is gonna influence things
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.360]   more than like the notation itself.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.680]   But notation actually carries a lot of weight
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.580]   when it comes to how we think about things,
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.060]   more so than we usually give it credit for,
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.880]   I would be comfortable saying.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.000]   - Do you have a favorite or least favorite piece of notation
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.200]   in terms of its effectiveness?
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.800]   - Yeah, yeah, well, so least favorite,
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.120]   one that I've been thinking a lot about
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.880]   that will be a video, I don't know when, but we'll see.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.800]   The number e.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.380]   We write the function e to the x,
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.080]   this general exponential function
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.200]   with the notation e to the x.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.320]   That implies you should think about a particular number,
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.360]   this constant of nature,
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.680]   and you repeatedly multiply it by itself.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.040]   And then you say, oh, what's e to the square root of two?
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.880]   And you're like, oh, well,
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.000]   we've extended the idea of repeated multiplication.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.440]   That's all nice, that's all nice and well.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.600]   But very famously, you have like e to the pi i,
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.440]   and you're like, well,
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.440]   we're extending the idea of repeated multiplication
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.040]   into the complex numbers.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.720]   Yeah, you can think about it that way.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.800]   In reality, I think that it's just the wrong way
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.680]   of notationally representing this function,
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.160]   the exponential function,
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.780]   which itself could be represented
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.720]   a number of different ways.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.260]   You can think about it in terms of the problem it solves,
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.200]   a certain very simple differential equation,
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.560]   which often yields way more insight
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.760]   than trying to twist the idea of repeated multiplication,
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.720]   like take its arm and put it behind its back
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.880]   and throw it on the desk and be like,
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.600]   you will apply to complex numbers, right?
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.400]   That's not, I don't think that's pedagogically helpful.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.760]   - So the repeated multiplication
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.400]   is actually missing the main point,
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.960]   the power of e to the x.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.880]   - I mean, what it addresses is things where the rate
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.120]   at which something changes depends on its own value,
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.460]   but more specifically, it depends on it linearly.
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.060]   So for example, if you have like a population
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.640]   that's growing and the rate at which it grows
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.400]   depends on how many members of the population
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.240]   are already there,
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.240]   it looks like this nice exponential curve.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.260]   It makes sense to talk about repeated multiplication
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.120]   'cause you say how much is there after one year,
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.380]   two years, three years, you're multiplying by something.
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.440]   The relationship can be a little bit different sometimes
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.920]   where let's say you've got a ball on a string,
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.480]   like a game of tetherball going around a rope, right?
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.640]   And you say its velocity
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.180]   is always perpendicular to its position.
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.100]   That's another way of describing its rate of change
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.100]   as being related to where it is,
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.200]   but it's a different operation.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.040]   You're not scaling it.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.880]   It's a rotation.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.400]   It's this 90 degree rotation.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.600]   That's what the whole idea of like complex exponentiation
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.740]   is trying to capture,
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.660]   but it's obfuscated in the notation
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.080]   when what it's actually saying,
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.440]   like if you really parse something like e to the pi i,
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.880]   what it's saying is choose an origin,
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.500]   always move perpendicular to the vector
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.320]   from that origin to you, okay?
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.480]   Then when you walk pi times that radius,
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.180]   you'll be halfway around.
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.860]   Like that's what it's saying.
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.620]   It's kind of the, you turn 90 degrees and you walk,
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.940]   you'll be going in a circle.
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.460]   That's the phenomenon that it's describing,
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.380]   but trying to twist the idea
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.780]   of repeatedly multiplying a constant into that.
[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.740]   Like I can't even think of the number of human hours
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.420]   of like intelligent human hours that have been wasted
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.820]   trying to parse that to their own liking and desire
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.500]   among like scientists or electrical engineers
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.640]   or students everywhere,
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.740]   which if the notation were a little different
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.100]   or the way that this whole function
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.620]   was introduced from the get-go were framed differently,
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.980]   I think could have been avoided, right?
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.040]   - And you're talking about
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.460]   the most beautiful equation in mathematics,
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.080]   but it's still pretty mysterious, isn't it?
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.580]   Like you're making it seem like it's a notation.
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.780]   - It's not mysterious.
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.940]   I think the notation makes it mysterious.
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:02.940]   I don't think it's,
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.140]   I think the fact that it represents, it's pretty.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.660]   It's not like the most beautiful thing in the world,
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.940]   but it's quite pretty.
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.620]   The idea that if you take the linear operation
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.500]   of a 90 degree rotation
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.720]   and then you do this general exponentiation thing to it,
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.420]   that what you get are all the other kinds of rotation,
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.420]   which is basically to say,
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.820]   if your velocity vector is perpendicular
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.300]   to your position vector, you walk in a circle, that's pretty.
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.780]   It's not the most beautiful thing in the world,
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.740]   but it's quite pretty.
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.740]   - The beauty of it, I think,
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.060]   comes from perhaps the awkwardness of the notation
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.460]   somehow still nevertheless coming together nicely.
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.780]   'Cause you have like several disciplines coming together
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.180]   in a single equation.
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.220]   - Well, I think-- - In a sense,
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.540]   historically speaking.
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.380]   - That's true.
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.980]   So like the number E is significant.
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.900]   It shows up in probability all the time.
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.380]   It shows up in calculus all the time.
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.380]   It is significant.
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.300]   You're seeing it sort of mated with pi,
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.580]   this geometric constant,
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.820]   and I, like the imaginary number and such.
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.660]   I think what's really happening there
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.320]   is the way that E shows up
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.200]   is when you have things like exponential growth and decay.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.960]   It's when this relation
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.120]   that something's rate of change has to itself
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.980]   is a simple scaling, right?
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:14.080]   A similar law also describes circular motion.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.360]   Because we have bad notation,
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.120]   we use the residue of how it shows up
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.080]   in the context of self-reinforcing growth,
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.680]   like a population growing or compound interest.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.280]   The constant associated with that
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.640]   is awkwardly placed into the context
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.720]   of how rotation comes about
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.280]   because they both come from pretty similar equations.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.840]   And so what we see is the E and the pi juxtaposed
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.280]   a little bit closer than they would be
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.960]   with a purely natural representation, I would think.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.360]   Here's how I would describe the relation between the two.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.800]   You've got a very important function we might call exp
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.720]   that's like the exponential function.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.300]   When you plug in one,
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.920]   you get this nice constant called E
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.300]   that shows up in like probability and calculus.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.320]   If you try to move in the imaginary direction,
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.380]   it's periodic and the period is tau.
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.580]   So those are these two constants
[00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.140]   associated with the same central function.
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.720]   But for kind of unrelated reasons, right?
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.320]   And not unrelated, but like orthogonal reasons.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.320]   One of them is what happens
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.640]   when you're moving in the real direction.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.520]   One's what happens when you move in the imaginary direction.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.160]   And like, yeah, those are related.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.120]   They're not as related as the famous equation
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.520]   seems to think it is.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.520]   It's sort of putting all of the children in one bed
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.440]   and they'd kind of like to sleep in separate beds
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.280]   if they had the choice.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.840]   But you see them all there and, you know,
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.340]   there is a family resemblance, but it's not that close.
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.740]   - So actually thinking of it as a function
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.720]   is the better idea.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.320]   And that's a notational idea.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.440]   - And yeah, and like, here's the thing.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.240]   The constant E sort of stands
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.760]   as this numerical representative of calculus, right?
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.720]   - Yeah.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.560]   - Calculus is the like study of change.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.400]   So at the very least,
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.880]   there's a little cognitive dissonance
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.240]   using a constant to represent the science of change.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.160]   - Never thought of it that way.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:55.820]   (laughs)
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:56.660]   - Right?
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.640]   - Yeah.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.960]   - It makes sense why the notation came about that way.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.800]   - Yes.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.160]   - It's the first way that we saw it
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.900]   in the context of things like population growth
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:04.820]   or compound interest.
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.100]   It is nicer to think about as repeated multiplication.
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.720]   That's definitely nicer,
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.060]   but it's more that that's the first application
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.940]   of what turned out to be a much more general function
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.260]   that maybe the intelligent life,
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.200]   your initial question asked about,
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.580]   would have come to recognize
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.180]   as being much more significant than the single use case,
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.140]   which lends itself to repeated multiplication notation.
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.560]   - Let me jump back for a second to aliens
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.100]   and the nature of our universe.
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:30.940]   Okay.
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:35.140]   Do you think math is discovered or invented?
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.660]   So we're talking about the different kind of mathematics
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.660]   that could be developed by the alien species.
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.440]   The implied question is,
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:46.260]   yeah, is math discovered or invented?
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.680]   Is, you know, is fundamentally everybody going to discover
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.180]   the same principles of mathematics?
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.180]   - So the way I think about it,
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.420]   and everyone thinks about it differently,
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.460]   but here's my take.
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.960]   I think there's a cycle at play
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.980]   where you discover things about the universe
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.980]   that tell you what math will be useful.
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.060]   And that math itself is invented in a sense,
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.420]   but of all the possible maths that you could have invented,
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.740]   it's discoveries about the world
[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.220]   that tell you which ones are.
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.740]   So like a good example here is the Pythagorean theorem.
[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.580]   When you look at this,
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.760]   do you think of that as a definition
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.960]   or do you think of that as a discovery?
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.540]   - From the historical perspective, right,
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.100]   it's a discovery because they were,
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.640]   but that's probably because they were using physical object
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.180]   to build their intuition.
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.520]   And from that intuition came the mathematics.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.360]   So the mathematics was in some abstract world
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.080]   detached from the physics.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:43.700]   But I think more and more math has become detached from,
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.640]   you know, when you even look at modern physics,
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.560]   from string theory to even general relativity,
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.560]   I mean, all math behind the 20th and 21st century physics
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.200]   kind of takes a brisk walk outside
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.480]   of what our mind can actually even comprehend.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.360]   In multiple dimensions, for example,
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.880]   anything beyond three dimensions, maybe four dimensions.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.260]   - No, no, no, higher dimensions
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.720]   can be highly, highly applicable.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.220]   I think this is a common misinterpretation
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.320]   that if you're asking questions
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.240]   about like a five-dimensional manifold,
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.680]   that the only way that that's connected
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.100]   to the physical world is if the physical world
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.960]   is itself a five-dimensional manifold or includes them.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.240]   - Well, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.200]   You're telling me you can imagine
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.240]   a five-dimensional manifold?
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.360]   - No, no, that's not what I said.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.980]   I would make the claim that it is useful
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.220]   to a three-dimensional physical universe
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.400]   despite itself not being three-dimensional.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.160]   - So it's useful, meaning to even understand
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.240]   a three-dimensional world, it'd be useful
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.880]   to have five-dimensional manifolds.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.160]   - Yes, absolutely, because of state spaces.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.480]   - But you're saying in some deep way for us humans,
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.040]   it does always come back to that three-dimensional world
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.600]   for the usefulness of the three-dimensional world.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.960]   And therefore it starts with a discovery,
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.080]   but then we invent the mathematics
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.280]   that helps us make sense of the discovery in a sense.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.900]   - Yes, I mean, just to jump off
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.840]   of the Pythagorean theorem example,
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.220]   it feels like a discovery.
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.920]   You've got these beautiful geometric proofs
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.640]   where you've got squares and you're modifying the areas.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.760]   It feels like a discovery.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.640]   If you look at how we formalize the idea of 2D space
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.120]   as being R2, all pairs of real numbers,
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.760]   and how we define a metric on it and define distance,
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.040]   you're like, "Hang on a second, we've defined distance
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.040]   "so that the Pythagorean theorem is true,
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.480]   "so that suddenly it doesn't feel that great."
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.420]   But I think what's going on is the thing that informed us
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.040]   what metric to put on R2,
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.400]   to put on our abstract representation of 2D space
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.280]   came from physical observations.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.640]   And the thing is there's other metrics
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.480]   you could have put on it.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.160]   We could have consistent math
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.160]   with other notions of distance.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.840]   It's just that those pieces of math
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.640]   wouldn't be applicable to the physical world that we study
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.560]   'cause they're not the ones
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.160]   where the Pythagorean theorem holds.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.040]   So we have a discovery, a genuine bona fide discovery
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.480]   that informed the invention,
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.720]   the invention of an abstract representation of 2D space
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.240]   that we call R2 and things like that.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.720]   And then from there, you just study R2 as an abstract thing
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.520]   that brings about more ideas and inventions and mysteries,
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.420]   which themselves might yield discoveries.
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.000]   Those discoveries might give you insight
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.360]   as to what else would be useful to invent.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.960]   And it kind of feeds on itself that way.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.160]   That's how I think about it.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.100]   So it's not an either or.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.760]   It's not that math is one of these or it's one of the others.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.160]   At different times, it's playing a different role.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.080]   - So then let me ask the Richard Feynman question
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.200]   then along that thread.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.360]   Is what do you think is the difference
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.320]   between physics and math?
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.800]   There's a giant overlap.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.040]   There's a kind of intuition
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.920]   that physicists have about the world
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.040]   that's perhaps outside of mathematics.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.720]   It's this mysterious art that they seem to possess,
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.240]   we humans generally possess.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.080]   And then there's the beautiful rigor of mathematics
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.840]   that allows you to, I mean, just like as we were saying,
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:07.880]   invent frameworks of understanding our physical world.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.680]   So what do you think is the difference there
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.880]   and how big is it?
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.480]   - Well, I think of math as being the study
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.720]   of like abstractions over patterns
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.360]   and pure patterns in logic.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.280]   And then physics is obviously grounded
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.680]   in a desire to understand the world that we live in.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.040]   I think you're gonna get very different answers
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.560]   when you talk to different mathematicians
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.120]   'cause there's a wide diversity in types of mathematicians.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.480]   There are some who are motivated very much by pure puzzles.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.040]   They might be turned on by things like combinatorics.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.680]   And they just love the idea of building up a set
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:40.880]   of problem solving tools, applying to pure patterns.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.320]   There are some who are very physically motivated,
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:48.320]   who try to invent new math or discover math in veins
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.960]   that they know will have applications to physics
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.280]   or sometimes computer science.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.720]   And that's what drives them.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.560]   Like chaos theory is a good example of something
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.680]   that's pure math, that's purely mathematical,
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.160]   a lot of the statements being made.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.880]   But it's heavily motivated by specific applications
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.360]   to largely physics.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.680]   And then you have a type of mathematician
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.520]   who just loves abstraction.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.520]   They just love pulling into the more and more abstract
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.120]   things, the things that feel powerful.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.200]   These are the ones that initially invented topology
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.520]   and then later on get really into category theory
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.400]   and go on about infinite categories and whatnot.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.440]   These are the ones that love to have a system
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:27.160]   that can describe truths about as many things as possible.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.280]   People from those three different veins of motivation
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.880]   into math are gonna give you very different answers
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.720]   about what the relation at play here is.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.640]   'Cause someone like Vladimir Arnold,
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.520]   who has written a lot of great books,
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.480]   many about like differential equations and such,
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.640]   he would say, "Math is a branch of physics."
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.120]   That's how he would think about it.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.120]   And of course he was studying like differential equations
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.040]   related things, because that is the motivator
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.760]   behind the study of PDEs and things like that.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.480]   But you'll have others who,
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.240]   like especially the category theorists,
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.360]   who aren't really thinking about physics necessarily.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.520]   It's all about abstraction and the power of generality.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.400]   And it's more of a happy coincidence
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.320]   that that ends up being useful
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.880]   for understanding the world we live in.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.840]   And then you can get into like, why is that the case?
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.200]   It's sort of surprising that that which is
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.800]   about pure puzzles and abstraction
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.040]   also happens to describe the very fundamentals
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.120]   of quarks and everything else.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:27.840]   - So why do you think the fundamentals of quarks
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:33.200]   and the nature of reality is so compressible
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.280]   into clean, beautiful equations
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:39.280]   that are for the most part simple, relatively speaking?
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.680]   A lot simpler than they could be.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.360]   So you have, we mentioned somebody like Stephen Wolfram
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:50.360]   who thinks that sort of there's incredibly simple rules
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.880]   underlying our reality,
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.920]   but it can create arbitrary complexity.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.720]   But there is simple equations.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.200]   I'm asking a million questions
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.640]   that nobody knows the answer to.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.040]   - Yeah, I have no idea.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.200]   (laughing)
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.800]   Why is it simple?
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.080]   - It could be the case that
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.480]   there's like a filtration at play.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.600]   The only things that physicists find interesting
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.680]   are the ones that are simple enough
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.280]   they could describe it mathematically.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.120]   But as soon as it's a sufficiently complex system,
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.920]   like, oh, that's outside the realm of physics.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.320]   That's biology or whatever have you.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.600]   And of course-- - That's true.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.680]   - Maybe there's something where it's like,
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.520]   of course there will always be some thing that is simple
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:31.400]   when you wash away the non-important parts
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.400]   of whatever it is that you're studying.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.160]   Just from like an information theory standpoint,
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.640]   there might be some like,
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.440]   you get to the lowest information component of it.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.280]   But I don't know.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.960]   Maybe I'm just having a really hard time conceiving
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.200]   of what it would even mean for the fundamental laws
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.380]   to be intrinsically complicated.
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.600]   Like some set of equations
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.520]   that you can't decouple from each other.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.760]   - Well, no, it could be that sort of we take for granted
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.960]   that the laws of physics, for example,
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.960]   are for the most part the same everywhere.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.320]   Or something like that, right?
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:10.320]   As opposed to the sort of an alternative could be
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:15.400]   that the rules under which the world operates
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.240]   is different everywhere.
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.320]   It's like a deeply distributed system
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.360]   where just everything is just chaos.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.520]   Like not in a strict definition of chaos,
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.200]   but meaning like just it's impossible
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.720]   for equations to capture,
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.000]   to explicitly model the world
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   as cleanly as the physical does.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.040]   I mean, we almost take it for granted
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.080]   that we can describe,
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.220]   we can have an equation for gravity,
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.760]   for action at a distance.
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.480]   We can have equations for some of these basic ways
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:50.480]   the planets move and just the low level
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.000]   at the atomic scale, how the materials operate,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.940]   at the high scale, how black holes operate.
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.800]   But it doesn't, it seems like it could be,
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.680]   there's infinite other possibilities
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.040]   where none of it could be compressible into such equations.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.560]   It just seems beautiful.
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.900]   It's also weird, probably to the point you were making,
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.120]   that it's very pleasant that this is true for our minds.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.120]   So it might be that our minds are biased
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.640]   to just be looking at the parts of the universe
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.720]   that are compressible.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.700]   And then we can publish papers on
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.440]   and have nice E equals mt squared equations.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.280]   - Right.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.720]   I wonder, would such a world with uncompressible laws
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.160]   allow for the kind of beings that can think about
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.760]   the kind of questions that you're asking?
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.600]   - That's true.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.600]   - Right, like an anthropic principle coming into play
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.560]   in some weird way here?
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.760]   I don't know, I don't know what I'm talking about at all.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:48.000]   - Or maybe the universe is actually not so compressible,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.560]   but the way our brain evolved,
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.880]   we're only able to perceive the compressible parts.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.400]   I mean, we are, so this is a sort of Chomsky argument.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.880]   We are just descendants of apes.
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.600]   We're like really limited biological systems.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.360]   So it totally makes sense that we're really limited
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.600]   little computers, calculators,
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.280]   that are able to perceive certain kinds of things.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.160]   And the actual world is much more complicated.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.680]   - Well, but we can do pretty awesome things, right?
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.320]   Like we can fly spaceships.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.600]   And we have to have some connection of reality
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.320]   to be able to take our potentially oversimplified models
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.800]   of the world, but then actually twist the world
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.120]   to our will based on it.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.480]   So we have certain reality checks
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.480]   that physics isn't too far afield,
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.480]   simply based on what we can do.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.320]   - Yeah, the fact that we can fly is pretty good.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.520]   - It's great, yeah.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.600]   It's a pretty good proof of concept
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.960]   that the laws we're working with are working well.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.800]   - So I mentioned to the internet that I'm talking to you,
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.240]   and so the internet gave some questions.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.640]   So I apologize for these.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.560]   But do you think we're living in a simulation,
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.960]   that the universe is a computer,
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.040]   or the universe is a computation running on a computer?
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.720]   - It's conceivable.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.720]   What I don't buy is, you know, you'll have the argument
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.920]   that, well, let's say that it was the case
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.600]   that you can have simulations,
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.400]   then the simulated world would itself eventually
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.400]   get to a point where it's running simulations.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.640]   And then the second layer down would create
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.480]   a third layer down, and on and on and on.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.640]   So probabilistically, you just throw a dart
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.960]   at one of those layers, we're probably
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.000]   in one of the simulated layers.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.120]   I think if there's some sort of limitations
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.640]   on the information processing
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.520]   of whatever the physical world is,
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.920]   it quickly becomes the case that you have a limit
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.680]   to the layers that could exist there,
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.200]   because the resources necessary to simulate a universe
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.760]   like ours clearly is a lot,
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.760]   just in terms of the number of bits at play.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.880]   And so then you can ask, well, what's more plausible?
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.440]   That there's an unbounded capacity of information processing
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.680]   in whatever the highest up level universe is,
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.120]   or that there's some bound to that capacity,
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.920]   which then limits the number of levels available.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.840]   How do you place some kind of probability distribution
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.600]   on what the information capacity is?
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.760]   I have no idea.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.880]   But I don't, like, people almost assume
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.240]   a certain uniform probability over all of those meta layers
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.560]   that could conceivably exist when,
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.200]   it's a little bit like a Pascal's wager,
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.000]   on like, you're not giving a low enough prior
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.880]   to the mere existence of that infinite set of layers.
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.720]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.080]   But it's also very difficult to contextualize the amount.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.240]   So the amount of information processing power
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.400]   required to simulate like our universe
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.280]   seems like amazingly huge.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.000]   - But you can always raise two to the power of that.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.040]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.520]   - Yeah, like numbers get big.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.800]   - And we're easily humbled
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.760]   by basically everything around us.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:48.760]   So it's very difficult to kind of make sense of anything,
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.000]   actually, when you look up at the sky
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.560]   and look at the stars and the immensity of it all,
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.040]   to make sense of the smallness of us,
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.640]   the unlikeliness of everything that's on this earth
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.200]   coming to be.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.000]   Then you could basically, anything could be,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.120]   all laws of probability go out the window to me.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:14.120]   Because I guess, because the amount of information
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.600]   under which we're operating is very low.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:22.160]   We basically know nothing about the world around us,
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.400]   relatively speaking.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.640]   And so when I think about the simulation hypothesis,
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.280]   I think it's just fun to think about it.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.920]   But it's also, I think there is a thought experiment
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.240]   kind of interesting to think of the power of computation,
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.960]   where there are the limits of a Turing machine.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.040]   Sort of the limits of our current computers.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.080]   When you start to think about artificial intelligence,
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.960]   how far can we get with computers?
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:50.800]   And that's kind of where the simulation hypothesis
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.840]   is useful to me as a thought experiment,
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.120]   is the universe just a computer?
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.600]   Is it just a computation?
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.520]   Is all of this just a computation?
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.880]   And sort of the same kind of tools
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.840]   we apply to analyzing algorithms, can that be applied?
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.360]   You know, if we scale further and further and further,
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.600]   will the arbitrary power of those systems
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.040]   start to create some interesting aspects
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.880]   that we see in our universe?
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.960]   Or is something fundamentally different
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.500]   needs to be created?
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.360]   - Well, it's interesting that in our universe,
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.720]   it's not arbitrarily large, the power,
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.340]   that you can place limits on, for example,
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.720]   how many bits of information can be stored per unit area.
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.360]   Right, like all of the physical laws,
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.680]   you've got general relativity and quantum coming together,
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.600]   to give you a certain limit on how many bits you can store
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:40.220]   within a given range before it collapses into a black hole.
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.760]   Like the idea that there even exists such a limit
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.600]   is at the very least thought provoking,
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.960]   when naively you might assume,
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.860]   oh, well, you know,
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.240]   technology could always get better and better,
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.920]   we could get cleverer and cleverer,
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.140]   and you could just cram as much information as you want
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.220]   into like a small unit of space.
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:02.420]   That makes me think it's at least plausible
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:07.280]   that whatever the highest level of existence is,
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.440]   doesn't admit too many simulations,
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.200]   or ones that are at the scale of complexity
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.400]   that we're looking at.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.360]   Obviously, it's just as conceivable that they do,
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.540]   and that there are many,
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:20.800]   but I guess what I'm channeling is the surprise
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.560]   that I felt upon learning that fact,
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.720]   that there are, that information is physical in this way.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.120]   - It's that there's a finiteness to it.
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.420]   Okay, let me just even go off on that,
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.320]   from a mathematics perspective,
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.920]   and a psychology perspective.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.020]   How do you mix,
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.180]   are you psychologically comfortable
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.740]   with the concept of infinity?
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.200]   - I think so. - Are you okay with it?
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.680]   - I'm pretty okay, yeah.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.560]   Are you okay?
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.160]   - No, not really, it doesn't make any sense to me.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.040]   - I don't know, like how many words,
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.620]   how many possible words do you think could exist,
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:55.680]   that are just like strings of letters?
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.920]   - So that's a sort of mathematical statement
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.760]   that's beautiful,
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.360]   and we use infinity in basically everything we do,
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:06.920]   everything we do in science, math, and engineering, yes.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.560]   But you said exist.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.400]   The question is, you said letters or words?
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.700]   - I said words. - Words.
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.200]   To bring words into existence, to me,
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.720]   you have to start saying them,
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.040]   or writing them, or listing them.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.240]   - That's an instantiation.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.800]   Okay, how many abstract words exist?
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.080]   - Well, the idea of abstract.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.000]   The idea of abstract notions and ideas.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.120]   - I think we should be clear on terminology.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.200]   I mean, you think about intelligence a lot,
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.640]   like artificial intelligence.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.120]   Would you not say that what it's doing
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.440]   is a kind of abstraction?
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:45.120]   That like abstraction is key to conceptualizing the universe?
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.320]   You get this raw sensory data.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.580]   I need something that every time
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:50.160]   you move your face a little bit,
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.880]   and they're not pixels, but like analog of pixels
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.200]   on my retina change entirely,
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.400]   that I can still have some coherent notion of,
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.720]   this is Lex, I'm talking to Lex, right?
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.740]   What that requires is you have a disparate set
[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.600]   of possible images hitting me
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.600]   that are unified in a notion of Lex, right?
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.680]   That's a kind of abstraction.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.840]   It's a thing that could apply
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.400]   to a lot of different images that I see,
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.280]   and it represents it in a much more compressed way,
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.440]   and one that's like much more resilient to that.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.360]   I think in the same way,
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.080]   if I'm talking about infinity as an abstraction,
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.820]   I don't mean non-physical, woo-woo,
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.360]   like ineffable or something.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.360]   What I mean is it's something that can apply
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.160]   to a multiplicity of situations
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.660]   that share a certain common attribute,
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.760]   in the same way that the images
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.600]   of like your face on my retina
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.820]   share enough common attributes
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.720]   that I can put this single notion to it.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.780]   Like in that way, infinity is an abstraction,
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:41.620]   and it's very powerful,
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.000]   and it's only through such abstractions
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.720]   that we can actually understand
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.600]   like the world and logic and things.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.400]   And in the case of infinity, the way I think about it,
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.800]   the key entity is the property
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.120]   of always being able to add one more.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.160]   Like no matter how many words you can list,
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.760]   you just throw an A at the end of one,
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.800]   and you have another conceivable word.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.720]   You don't have to think of all the words at once.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.880]   It's that property, the oh, I could always add one more,
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.240]   that gives it this nature of infiniteness,
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.160]   in the same way that there's certain
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.280]   like properties of your face
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.760]   that give it the lexness, right?
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:16.500]   So like infinity should be no more worrying
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.780]   than the I can always add one more sentiment.
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:21.640]   - That's a really elegant,
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.760]   much more elegant way than I could put it,
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.840]   so thank you for doing that
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.880]   as yet another abstraction.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:29.480]   And yes, indeed, that's what our brain does,
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:30.680]   that's what intelligent systems do,
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.880]   that's what programming does,
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:32.880]   that's what science does,
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.800]   is build abstraction on top of each other.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.920]   And yet, there is at a certain point,
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.840]   abstractions that go into the quote, woo, right?
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.360]   (both laughing)
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.920]   Sort of, and because we're now,
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.360]   it's like we built this stack of,
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.520]   you know, the only thing that's true
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.720]   is the stuff that's on the ground,
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.560]   everything else is useful for interpreting this.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.680]   And at a certain point,
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.960]   you might start floating into ideas
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.600]   that are surreal and difficult,
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:08.120]   and take us into areas that are disconnected
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.080]   from reality in a way that we could never get back.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.160]   - What if instead of calling these abstract,
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.640]   how different would it be in your mind
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.960]   if we called them general?
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.400]   And the phenomenon that you're describing
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.080]   is overgeneralization.
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.480]   When you try to-- - Generalization, yeah.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.000]   - Have a concept or an idea that's so general
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.760]   as to apply to nothing in particular in a useful way.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.000]   Does that map to what you're thinking of
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.480]   when you think of-- - First of all,
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.040]   I'm playing a little just for the fun of it.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.400]   - Yeah, I know. - I'm the devil's advocate.
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:36.320]   And I think our cognition, our mind,
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.040]   is unable to visualize.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.560]   So you do some incredible work with visualization and video.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:46.840]   I think infinity is very difficult to visualize
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.300]   for our mind.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:52.920]   We can delude ourselves into thinking we can visualize it.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.560]   But we can't.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.760]   I don't, I mean, I would venture to say it's very difficult.
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.520]   And so there's some concepts in mathematics,
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.560]   like maybe multiple dimensions, we could sort of talk about,
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.800]   that are impossible for us to truly intuit.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:13.160]   And it just feels dangerous to me to use these
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.760]   as part of our toolbox of abstractions.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.720]   - On behalf of your listeners,
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.640]   I almost fear we're getting too philosophical.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.080]   - No, heck no, heck no.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:26.760]   I think to that point, for any particular idea like this,
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.800]   there's multiple angles of attack.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.000]   I think when we do visualize infinity,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.800]   what we're actually doing, you write dot, dot, dot.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.080]   One, two, three, four, dot, dot, dot.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:40.000]   Those are symbols on the page that are insinuating
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.740]   a certain infinity.
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:46.000]   What you're capturing with a little bit of design there
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.520]   is the I can always add one more property.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.600]   I think I'm just as uncomfortable with you are
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:56.120]   if you try to concretize it so much
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.000]   that you have a bag of infinitely many things
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.800]   that I actually think of, no, not one, two, three, four,
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.280]   dot, dot, dot, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.040]   eight, I try to get them all in my head.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.240]   And you realize, oh, your brain would literally collapse
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.240]   into a black hole, all of that.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.520]   And I honestly feel this with a lot of math
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.160]   that I try to read, where I don't think of myself
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.920]   as like particularly good at math.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.440]   In some ways, I get very confused often
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.800]   when I am going through some of these texts.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.760]   And often what I'm feeling in my head is like,
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.920]   this is just so damn abstract.
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.200]   I just can't wrap my head around it.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.860]   I just want to put something concrete to it
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:32.980]   that makes me understand.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.620]   And I think a lot of the motivation for the channel
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.480]   is channeling that sentiment of, yeah,
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.980]   a lot of the things that you're trying to read out there,
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.660]   it's just so hard to connect to anything
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:45.360]   that you spend an hour banging your head
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.260]   against a couple of pages and you come out
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:49.300]   not really knowing anything more
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.840]   other than some definitions maybe
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.560]   and a certain sense of self-defeat.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:58.540]   One of the reasons I focus so much on visualizations
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:01.760]   is that I'm a big believer in,
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.120]   I'm sorry, I'm just really hampering on
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.360]   this idea of abstraction,
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.440]   being clear about your layers of abstraction.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.800]   It's always tempting to start an explanation
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.160]   from the top to the bottom.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.120]   You give the definition of a new theorem.
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.160]   You're like, this is the definition of a vector space,
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.380]   for example, that's how we'll start a course.
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.580]   These are the properties of a vector space.
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:22.100]   First from these properties,
[00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:24.460]   we will derive what we need in order to do the math
[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:27.340]   of linear algebra or whatever it might be.
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:29.580]   I don't think that's how understanding works at all.
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:30.840]   I think how understanding works
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.340]   is you start at the lowest level you can get at
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.460]   where rather than thinking about a vector space,
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.120]   you might think of concrete vectors
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.760]   that are just lists of numbers
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.840]   or picturing it as like an arrow that you draw,
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.340]   which is itself like even less abstract than numbers
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.360]   'cause you're looking at quantities,
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.000]   like the distance of the X coordinate,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   the distance of the Y coordinate.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.080]   It's as concrete as you could possibly get.
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.960]   And it has to be if you're putting it in a visual.
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.320]   - It's an actual arrow.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.880]   - It's an actual vector.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.120]   You're not talking about like a quote unquote vector
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.000]   that could apply to any possible thing.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.480]   You have to choose one if you're illustrating it.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.920]   And I think this is the power of being in a medium
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.120]   like video, or if you're writing a textbook
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.640]   and you force yourself to put a lot of images,
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.440]   is with every image, you're making a choice.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:17.080]   With each choice, you're showing a concrete example.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.460]   With each concrete example,
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.580]   you're aiding someone's path to understanding.
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.260]   - Yeah, I'm sorry to interrupt you,
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:25.500]   but you just made me realize that that's exactly right.
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.860]   So the visualizations you're creating
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.780]   while you're sometimes talking about abstractions,
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:35.340]   the actual visualization is an explicit low-level example.
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.180]   - Yes.
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:38.260]   - So there's an actual, like in the code,
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.740]   you have to say what the vector is.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:43.180]   What's the direction of the arrow?
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:44.020]   What's the magnitude?
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:47.860]   The, yeah, so that's, you're going,
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:51.300]   the visualization itself is actually going to the bottom.
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.560]   - And I think that's very important.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.980]   I also think about this a lot in writing scripts,
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.380]   where even before you get to the visuals,
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:00.220]   the first instinct is to, I don't know why,
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:02.540]   I just always do, I say the abstract thing,
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.020]   I say the general definition, the powerful thing,
[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.240]   and then I fill it in with examples later.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.620]   Always, it will be more compelling and easier to understand
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:10.740]   when you flip that.
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:13.500]   And instead, you let someone's brain
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.260]   do the pattern recognition.
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.200]   You just show them a bunch of examples.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.060]   The brain is going to feel a certain similarity between them.
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.540]   Then by the time you bring in the definition,
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.720]   or by the time you bring in the formula,
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.940]   it's articulating a thing that's already in the brain
[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.900]   that was built off of looking at a bunch of examples
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.860]   with a certain kind of similarity.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.660]   And what the formula does is articulate
[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:36.580]   what that kind of similarity is,
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:41.580]   rather than being a high cognitive load set of symbols
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:45.220]   that needs to be populated with examples later on,
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:46.900]   assuming someone's still with you.
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:51.260]   - What is the most beautiful or awe-inspiring idea
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:53.840]   you've come across in mathematics?
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.180]   - I don't know, man.
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.240]   - Maybe it's an idea you've explored in your videos,
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.360]   maybe not.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:01.340]   What just gave you pause?
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.380]   - What's the most beautiful idea?
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:04.460]   - Small or big.
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:07.380]   - So I think often the things that are most beautiful
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:11.820]   are the ones that you have a little bit of understanding of,
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:14.380]   but certainly not an entire understanding.
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:15.580]   It's a little bit of that mystery
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.340]   that is what makes it beautiful.
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:20.220]   - What was the moment of the discovery for you personally,
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:23.540]   almost just that leap of aha moment?
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:25.260]   - So something that really caught my eye,
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.800]   I remember when I was little, there were these,
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:31.540]   I think the series was called wooden books or something,
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.660]   these tiny little books that would have
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:35.540]   just a very short description of something on the left
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:36.940]   and then a picture on the right.
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:37.900]   I don't know who they're meant for,
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:40.540]   but maybe it's like loosely children or something like that,
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:41.460]   but it can't just be children
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.180]   'cause of some of the things it was describing.
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.280]   On the last page of one of them,
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.620]   somewhere tiny in there was this little formula
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:49.900]   that on the left hand had a sum
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:51.620]   over all of the natural numbers.
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:53.760]   You know, it's like one over one to the S
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.220]   plus one over two to the S plus one over three to the S
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:57.700]   on and on to infinity.
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:01.140]   Then on the other side had a product over all of the primes.
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.820]   And it was a certain thing, had to do with all the primes.
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:06.460]   And like any good young math enthusiast,
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:07.660]   I had properly been indoctrinated
[00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.780]   with how chaotic and confusing the primes are,
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:10.900]   which they are.
[00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:14.260]   And seeing this equation where on one side
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.900]   you have something that's as understandable
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.300]   as you could possibly get, the counting numbers.
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.460]   And on the other side is all the prime numbers.
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.980]   It was like this, whoa, they're related like this?
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:26.460]   There's a simple description that includes
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:28.740]   all the primes getting wrapped together like this.
[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:32.180]   This is like the Euler product for the zeta function.
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:34.860]   As I like later found out, the equation itself
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:37.900]   essentially encodes the fundamental theorem of arithmetic
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.500]   that every number can be expressed
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.100]   as a unique set of primes.
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.700]   To me still, there's, I mean, I certainly don't understand
[00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.260]   this equation or this function all that well.
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:50.260]   The more I learn about it, the prettier it is.
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:53.340]   The idea that you can, this is sort of what gets you
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:57.260]   representations of primes, not in terms of primes themselves
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.140]   but in terms of another set of numbers
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.980]   that are like the non-trivial zeros of the zeta function.
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.260]   And again, I'm very kind of in over my head
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:06.660]   in a lot of ways as I like try to get to understand it.
[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:09.740]   But the more I do, it always leaves enough mystery
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:11.700]   that it remains very beautiful to me.
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.580]   - So whenever there's a little bit of mystery
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:16.820]   just outside of the understanding that,
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:19.700]   and by the way, the process of learning more about it,
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:20.620]   how does that come about?
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.820]   Just your own thought or are you reading?
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:24.660]   - Reading, yeah.
[00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:26.540]   - Or is the process of visualization itself
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:28.140]   revealing more to you?
[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:28.980]   - Visuals help.
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:31.300]   I mean, in one time when I was just trying to understand
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.740]   like analytic continuation and playing around
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:36.260]   with visualizing complex functions,
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:39.500]   this is what led to a video about this function.
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:40.340]   It's titled something like
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.380]   Visualizing the Riemann Zeta Function.
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:45.060]   It's one that came about because I was programming
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.660]   and tried to see what a certain thing looked like.
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:48.500]   And then I looked at it and I'm like,
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.620]   "Whoa, that's elucidating."
[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:53.460]   And then I decided to make a video about it.
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:56.580]   But I mean, you try to get your hands
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:58.140]   on as much reading as you can.
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:01.420]   You, in this case, I think if anyone wants
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.020]   to start to understand it,
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:06.100]   if they have like a math background of some,
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.820]   like they studied some in college or something like that,
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:10.260]   like the Princeton Companion to Math
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:13.060]   has a really good article on analytic number theory.
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.740]   And that itself has a whole bunch of references
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.420]   and anything has more references
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:20.180]   and it gives you this like tree to start pawing through.
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.180]   And like, you try to understand,
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:24.740]   I try to understand things visually as I go.
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:26.300]   That's not always possible,
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.340]   but it's very helpful when it does.
[00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:30.100]   You recognize when there's common themes,
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:34.460]   like in this case, cousins of the Fourier transform
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:35.860]   that come into play and you realize,
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:36.980]   oh, it's probably pretty important
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:39.020]   to have deep intuitions of the Fourier transform,
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:42.340]   even if it's not explicitly mentioned in like these texts.
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.260]   And you try to get a sense of what the common players are.
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:48.820]   But I'll emphasize again, like I feel very in over my head
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:52.140]   when I try to understand the exact relation
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.620]   between like the zeros of the Riemann zeta function
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.940]   and how they relate to the distribution of primes.
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.360]   I definitely understand it better than I did a year ago.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:02.360]   I definitely understand it 1/100 as well as the experts
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.660]   on the matter do, I assume.
[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:08.260]   But the slow path towards getting there is,
[00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:09.580]   it's fun, it's charming.
[00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:12.900]   And like to your question, very beautiful.
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.820]   - And the beauty is in the, what,
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.100]   in the journey versus the destination?
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:19.420]   - Well, it's that each thing doesn't feel arbitrary.
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:20.540]   I think that's a big part,
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:23.380]   is that you have these unpredictable,
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.900]   not, yeah, these very unpredictable patterns
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:30.460]   or these intricate properties of like a certain function.
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:32.220]   But at the same time, it doesn't feel like humans
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:33.780]   ever made an arbitrary choice
[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:35.740]   in studying this particular thing.
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:39.700]   So, it feels like you're speaking to patterns themselves
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:41.260]   or nature itself.
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:43.100]   That's a big part of it.
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.040]   I think things that are too arbitrary,
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.620]   it's just hard for those to feel beautiful
[00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:49.780]   because this is sort of what the word contrived
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.660]   is meant to apply to, right?
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:55.580]   - And when they're not arbitrary,
[00:40:55.580 --> 00:41:00.580]   it means it could be, you can have a clean abstraction
[00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:04.940]   and intuition that allows you to comprehend it.
[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:06.220]   - Well, to one of your first questions,
[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:07.660]   it makes you feel like if you came across
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.700]   another intelligent civilization,
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:12.380]   that they'd be studying the same thing.
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:13.660]   - Maybe with different notation.
[00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:14.540]   - Certainly, yeah.
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:15.540]   But yeah.
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:16.780]   Like, that's what I think,
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.740]   you talked to that other civilization,
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:20.260]   they're probably also studying the zeros
[00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:21.700]   of the Riemann zeta function.
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:25.700]   Or like some variant thereof that is like
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.580]   a clearly equivalent cousin or something like that.
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:31.400]   But that's probably on their docket.
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:35.940]   - Whenever somebody does a lot of something amazing,
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.660]   I'm gonna ask the question
[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:40.180]   that you've already been asked a lot,
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:43.340]   and that you'll get more and more asked in your life.
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:46.180]   But what was your favorite video to create?
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:49.540]   - Oh, favorite to create.
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.300]   One of my favorites is,
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:53.340]   the title is "Who Cares About Topology?"
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.940]   - Do you want me to pull it up or no?
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:57.300]   - If you want, sure, yeah.
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:00.980]   It is about, well, it starts by describing
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.020]   an unsolved problem that's still unsolved in math
[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.020]   called the inscribed square problem.
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:06.700]   You draw any loop, and then you ask,
[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.180]   are there four points on that loop that make a square?
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:10.180]   Totally useless, right?
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:12.460]   This is not answering any physical questions.
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:14.920]   It's mostly interesting that we can't answer that question.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.220]   And it seems like such a natural thing to ask.
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:21.180]   Now, if you weaken it a little bit and you ask,
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.580]   can you always find a rectangle?
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:24.280]   You choose four points on this curve.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:25.620]   Can you find a rectangle?
[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.500]   That's hard, but it's doable.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:32.500]   And the path to it involves things like looking at a torus,
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:35.320]   this surface with a single hole in it, like a donut,
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.300]   or looking at a Mobius strip,
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.740]   in ways that feel so much less contrived
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.660]   to when I first, as like a little kid,
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:43.420]   learned about these surfaces and shapes,
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:45.480]   like a Mobius strip and a torus.
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.880]   Like what you learn is, oh, this Mobius strip,
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.780]   you take a piece of paper, put a twist, glue it together.
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:53.740]   And now you have a shape with one edge and just one side.
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:58.500]   And as a student, you should think, who cares, right?
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.620]   Like, how does that help me solve any problems?
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.760]   I thought math was about problem solving.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.660]   So what I liked about the piece of math
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:08.540]   that this was describing that was in this paper
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:10.100]   by a mathematician named Vaughn
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.980]   was that it arises very naturally.
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:14.380]   It's clear what it represents.
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.480]   It's doing something.
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.840]   It's not just playing with construction paper.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.920]   And the way that it solves the problem is really beautiful.
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:24.300]   So kind of putting all of that down
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.820]   and concretizing it, right?
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:27.680]   Like I was talking about how,
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.420]   when you have to put visuals to it,
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:30.900]   it demands that what's on screen
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:33.620]   is a very specific example of what you're describing.
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.900]   The construction here is very abstract in nature.
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.180]   You described this very abstract kind of surface
[00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.340]   in 3D space.
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:40.900]   So then when I was finding myself,
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:42.020]   in this case, I wasn't programming,
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:44.540]   I was using a grapher that's like built into OSX
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:48.740]   for the 3D stuff to draw that surface,
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:49.700]   you realize, oh man,
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:52.660]   the topology argument is very non-constructive.
[00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:54.100]   I have to make a lot of,
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.660]   you have to do a lot of extra work
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:57.420]   in order to make the surface show up.
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:59.380]   But then once you see it, it's quite pretty.
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.060]   And it's very satisfying to see a specific instance of it.
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:03.500]   And you also feel like, ah,
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:04.820]   I've actually added something
[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.700]   on top of what the original paper was doing,
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.620]   that it shows something that's completely correct.
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:10.860]   That's a very beautiful argument,
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.620]   but you don't see what it looks like.
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.900]   And I found something satisfying
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:16.340]   in seeing what it looked like
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.940]   that could only ever have come about
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:19.180]   from the forcing function
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:21.180]   of getting some kind of image on the screen
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.020]   to describe the thing I was talking about.
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:24.220]   - So you almost weren't able to anticipate
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:25.060]   what it was gonna look like?
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.140]   - I had no idea.
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:26.980]   I had no idea.
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:28.220]   And it was wonderful.
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:29.060]   It was totally,
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:30.340]   it looks like a Sydney Opera House
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:31.980]   or some sort of Frank Gehry design.
[00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.300]   And it was,
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.140]   you knew it was gonna be something.
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.460]   And you can say various things about it,
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:39.300]   like, oh, it touches the curve itself.
[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.060]   It has a boundary that's this curve on the 2D plane.
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:43.820]   It all sits above the plane.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:45.300]   But before you actually draw it,
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:48.140]   it's very unclear what the thing will look like.
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:49.740]   And to see it, it's very,
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:50.740]   it's just pleasing, right?
[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:51.940]   So that was fun to make,
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:53.180]   very fun to share.
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:56.100]   I hope that it has elucidated,
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:58.020]   for some people out there,
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:00.100]   where these constructs of topology come from,
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:03.020]   that it's not arbitrary play with construction paper.
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:04.820]   - So let's,
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:07.220]   I think this is a good sort of example
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:09.500]   to talk a little bit about your process.
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:12.060]   So you have a list of ideas.
[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:17.500]   That's sort of the curse of having an active
[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:18.540]   and brilliant mind,
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:19.580]   is I'm sure you have a list
[00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:22.020]   that's growing faster than you can utilize.
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:23.460]   - Yeah, I love the head.
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:24.620]   Absolutely.
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:26.900]   - But there's some sorting procedure,
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:29.800]   depending on mood and interest and so on.
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:32.660]   But, okay, so you pick an idea,
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:36.140]   then you have to try to write a narrative arc
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:38.820]   that's sort of, how do I elucidate,
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:42.380]   how do I make this idea beautiful and clear and explain it?
[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:44.020]   And then there's a set of visualizations
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:46.140]   that will be attached to it.
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.420]   Sort of, you've talked about some of this before,
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.580]   but sort of writing the story,
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:52.900]   attaching the visualizations.
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:56.420]   Can you talk through interesting, painful,
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.900]   beautiful parts of that process?
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:00.980]   - Well, the most painful is
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:03.420]   if you've chosen a topic that you do want to do,
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:05.660]   but then it's hard to think of,
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:07.500]   I guess, how to structure the script.
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:10.620]   This is sort of where I have been on one
[00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:12.220]   for like the last two or three months.
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:13.740]   And I think that ultimately the right resolution
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:17.340]   is just like set it aside and instead do some other things
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:18.820]   where the script comes more naturally.
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:23.460]   'Cause you sort of don't want to overwork a narrative.
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:24.700]   The more you've thought about it,
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.460]   the less you can empathize with the student
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:28.940]   who doesn't yet understand the thing you're trying to teach.
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:31.860]   - Who is the judger in your head?
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:35.460]   Sort of the person, the creature,
[00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:38.700]   the essence that's saying this sucks or this is good.
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:40.700]   And you mentioned kind of the student
[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:42.020]   you're thinking about.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:44.740]   Can you, who is that?
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:45.900]   What is that thing?
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:48.500]   That's Chris, that says, the perfectionist
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:49.940]   that says this thing sucks,
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:53.500]   you need to work on that for another two, three months.
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:54.340]   - I don't know.
[00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:56.180]   I think it's my past self.
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.300]   I think that's the entity
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:59.420]   that I'm most trying to empathize with.
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:00.900]   Is like you take who I was,
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.500]   because that's kind of the only person I know.
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:03.740]   Like you don't really know anyone
[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:05.500]   other than versions of yourself.
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:07.940]   So I start with the version of myself that I know
[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:10.380]   who doesn't yet understand the thing, right?
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:15.380]   And then I just try to view it with fresh eyes,
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:17.500]   a particular visual or a particular script.
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:18.860]   Like, is this motivating?
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:20.700]   Does this make sense?
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:21.580]   Which has its downsides.
[00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:25.260]   'Cause sometimes I find myself speaking to motivations
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:28.540]   that only myself would be interested in.
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:30.880]   I don't know, like I did this project on quaternions.
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.300]   Where what I really wanted was to understand
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:34.940]   what are they doing in four dimensions?
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:37.580]   Can we see what they're doing in four dimensions, right?
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:40.420]   And I came up with a way of thinking about it
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:42.020]   that really answered the question in my head.
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:43.260]   That made me very satisfied
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.660]   in being able to think about concretely with a 3D visual,
[00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:48.700]   what are they doing to a 4D sphere?
[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:49.540]   And so I'm like, great,
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:51.740]   this is exactly what my past self would have wanted, right?
[00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:52.780]   And I make a thing on it.
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.140]   And I'm sure it's what some other people wanted too.
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:56.020]   But in hindsight,
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:58.580]   I think most people who want to learn about quaternions
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:01.960]   are like robotics engineers or graphics programmers
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:04.360]   who want to understand how they're used
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.160]   to describe 3D rotations.
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.280]   And like their use case was actually a little bit different
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:09.360]   than my past self.
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.600]   And in that way, like,
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.080]   I wouldn't actually recommend that video
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:14.960]   to people who are coming at it from that angle
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:17.480]   of wanting to know, hey, I'm a robotics programmer.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:20.280]   Like how do these quaternion things work
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.560]   to describe position in 3D space?
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:25.680]   I would say other great resources for that.
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.840]   If you ever find yourself wanting to say like,
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:30.860]   but hang on, in what sense are they acting in four dimensions
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:31.860]   then come back.
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:34.460]   But until then, that's a little different.
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:35.300]   - Yeah, it's interesting
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:38.780]   'cause you have incredible videos on neural networks,
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:39.820]   for example.
[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:41.060]   And from my sort of perspective,
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:43.660]   'cause I've probably, I mean,
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:44.700]   I looked at the,
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:46.940]   it's sort of my field
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:49.260]   and I've also looked at the basic introduction
[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.060]   of neural networks like a million times
[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:52.420]   from different perspectives.
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:53.460]   And it made me realize
[00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:55.740]   that there's a lot of ways to present it.
[00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:58.920]   So you are sort of, you did an incredible job.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.080]   I mean, sort of the,
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:04.880]   but you could also do it differently and also incredible.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:09.880]   Like to create a beautiful presentation of a basic concept
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:16.040]   is, requires sort of creativity, requires genius and so on,
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.600]   but you can take it from a bunch of different perspectives.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:21.560]   And that video on neural networks made me realize that.
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:22.920]   And just as you're saying,
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:26.240]   you're kind of have a certain mindset, a certain view,
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.940]   but from a, if you take a different view
[00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:30.640]   from a physics perspective,
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:33.320]   from a neuroscience perspective,
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.400]   talking about neural networks,
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:38.360]   or from a robotics perspective,
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.400]   or from, let's see,
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.120]   from a pure learning theory, - Statistics.
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:43.260]   - statistics perspective.
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:46.320]   So you can create totally different videos.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.200]   And you've done that with a few actually concepts
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.880]   where you've have taken different cuts,
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:54.120]   like at the, at the, at the Euler equation, right?
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:56.920]   The, you've taken different views of that.
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:58.680]   - I think I've made three videos on it
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:00.920]   and I definitely will make at least one more.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:03.080]   - Never enough.
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.080]   - Never enough.
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:06.160]   - So you don't think it's the most beautiful equation
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.200]   in mathematics?
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:10.020]   - Like I said, as we represent it,
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:11.400]   it's one of the most hideous.
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.280]   It involves a lot of the most hideous aspects
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:14.120]   of our notation.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.920]   I talked about E, the fact that we use pi instead of tau,
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:20.640]   the fact that we call imaginary numbers imaginary,
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.080]   and then, hence,
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:24.840]   actually wonder if we use the I because of imaginary.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:26.560]   I don't know if that's historically accurate,
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:27.680]   but at least a lot of people,
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:30.280]   they read the I and they think imaginary.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.400]   Like all three of those facts,
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.680]   it's like, those are things that have added more confusion
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:34.520]   than they needed to,
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.800]   and we're wrapping them up in one equation.
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:39.040]   Like, boy, that's just very hideous, right?
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:40.840]   The ideas that it does tie together
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:42.160]   when you wash away the notation,
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.800]   like it's okay, it's pretty, it's nice,
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.800]   but it's not like, mind-blowing,
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:49.480]   greatest thing in the universe,
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.980]   which is maybe what I was thinking of when I said,
[00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:53.280]   like once you understand something,
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.940]   it doesn't have the same beauty.
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:58.960]   Like I feel like I understand Euler's formula,
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:02.520]   and I feel like I understand it enough to sort of see
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:04.980]   the version that just woke up,
[00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:07.520]   that hasn't really gotten itself dressed in the morning,
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:08.600]   that's a little bit groggy,
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:10.080]   and there's bags under its eyes.
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:11.320]   It's like it's the real-- - So you're past
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:13.880]   the dating stage, and you're now married.
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:15.040]   - I'm no longer dating, right?
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.760]   I'm still dating the zeta function,
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.920]   and like she's beautiful, and right,
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:22.660]   and like we have fun, and it's that high dopamine part,
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:24.400]   but like maybe at some point we'll settle
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.840]   into the more mundane nature of the relationship
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:28.480]   where I like see her for who she truly is,
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.220]   and she'll still be beautiful in her own way,
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:33.760]   but it won't have the same romantic pizzazz, right?
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.520]   - Well, that's the nice thing about mathematics.
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:38.480]   I think as long as you don't live forever,
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.840]   there'll always be enough mystery and fun
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:42.920]   with some of the equations.
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.480]   Even if you do, the rate at which questions comes up
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:48.080]   is much faster than the rate at which answers come up.
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:50.040]   - If you could live forever, would you?
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:52.160]   - I think so, yeah.
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.120]   - So you don't think mortality's the thing
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:55.980]   that makes life meaningful?
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.240]   - Would your life be four times as meaningful
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.440]   if you died at 25?
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.200]   - So this goes to infinity.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.700]   I think you and I, that's really interesting.
[00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:09.360]   So what I said is infinite, not four times longer.
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:10.360]   I said infinite.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:15.240]   So the actual existence of the finiteness,
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:18.060]   the existence of the end, no matter the length,
[00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:20.740]   is the thing that may sort of,
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:22.400]   from my comprehension of psychology,
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.640]   it's such a deeply human,
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:28.600]   it's such a fundamental part of the human condition,
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:31.160]   the fact that there is, that we're mortal,
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:34.500]   that the fact that things end,
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:37.920]   it seems to be a crucial part of what gives them meaning.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:39.700]   - I don't think, at least for me,
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:43.040]   like it's a very small percentage of my time
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.200]   that mortality is salient,
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:47.200]   that I'm like aware of the end of my life.
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.440]   - What do you mean by me?
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:51.280]   I'm trolling.
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:54.080]   Is it the ego, is it the id, or is it the super ego?
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:58.160]   - The reflective self, the Wernicke's area
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.880]   that puts all this stuff into words.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:02.520]   - Yeah, a small percentage of your mind
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:05.780]   that is actually aware of the true motivations
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:06.960]   that drive you.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:08.360]   - But my point is that most of my life,
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:09.600]   I'm not thinking about death.
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.020]   But I still feel very motivated to make things
[00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:13.860]   and to interact with people,
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:15.400]   like experience love or things like that.
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:16.680]   I'm very motivated.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:19.400]   And it's strange that that motivation comes
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:21.600]   while death is not in my mind at all.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:23.600]   And this might just be because I'm young enough
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.680]   that it's not salient.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:25.960]   - Or it's in your subconscious,
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:28.100]   or that you constructed an illusion
[00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:31.180]   that allows you to escape the fact of your mortality
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:32.760]   by enjoying the moment,
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:34.600]   sort of the existential approach to life.
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:36.160]   - Could be.
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:38.080]   Gun to my head, I don't think that's it.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:40.640]   - Yeah, another sort of way to say gun to the head
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:44.160]   is the deep psychological introspection of what drives us.
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:46.960]   I mean, that's in some ways to me,
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.040]   I mean, when I look at math, when I look at science,
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:51.560]   is a kind of an escape from reality
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:54.360]   in a sense that it's so beautiful.
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:58.720]   It's such a beautiful journey of discovery
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:00.800]   that it allows you to actually,
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:04.720]   it sort of allows you to achieve a kind of immortality
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:09.680]   of explore ideas and sort of connect yourself
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:12.360]   to the thing that is seemingly infinite,
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:13.960]   like the universe, right?
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:18.600]   That allows you to escape the limited nature
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:23.600]   of our little, of our bodies, of our existence.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:25.960]   - What else would give this podcast meaning?
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:26.800]   - That's right.
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:28.000]   - If not the fact that it will end.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.920]   - This place closes in 40 minutes.
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:33.040]   - And it's so much more meaningful for it.
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:37.200]   How much more I love this room because we'll be kicked out.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:42.280]   - So I understand just because you're trolling me
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:43.600]   doesn't mean I'm wrong.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:49.000]   But I take your point, I take your point.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   - Boy, that would be a good Twitter bio.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.320]   Just because you're trolling me doesn't mean I'm wrong.
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:58.560]   - Yeah, and sort of difference in backgrounds.
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:01.520]   I'm a bit Russian, so we're a bit melancholic
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:04.360]   and seem to maybe assign a little too much value
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:07.040]   to suffering and mortality and things like that.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.880]   Makes for a better novel, I think.
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:13.400]   - Oh yeah, you need some sort of existential threat
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:15.320]   to drive a plot.
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:18.520]   - So when do you know when the video is done
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:19.800]   when you're working on it?
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.560]   - That's pretty easy, actually,
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:24.400]   because I'll write the script.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:27.140]   I want there to be some kind of aha moment in there,
[00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:28.760]   and then hopefully the script can revolve around
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:30.280]   some kind of aha moment.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:32.400]   And then from there, you're putting visuals
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.040]   to each sentence that exists,
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:36.360]   and then you narrate it, you edit it all together.
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:39.760]   So given that there's a script, the end becomes quite clear.
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:44.320]   And as I animate it, I often change
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.800]   certainly the specific words,
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.320]   but sometimes the structure itself.
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:53.240]   But it's a very deterministic process at that point.
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.440]   It makes it much easier to predict
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:55.860]   when something will be done.
[00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:57.080]   How do you know when a script is done?
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:59.120]   It's like, for problem-solving videos,
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:00.440]   that's quite simple.
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:01.480]   It's once you feel like someone
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:03.580]   who didn't understand the solution now could.
[00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:05.480]   For things like neural networks, that was a lot harder,
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.640]   because like you said, there's so many angles
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:09.580]   at which you could attack it.
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:12.480]   And there, it's just at some point you feel like
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:15.680]   this asks a meaningful question,
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:17.080]   and it answers that question.
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:20.280]   - What is the best way to learn math
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.400]   for people who might be at the beginning of that journey?
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.840]   I think that's a question that a lot of folks
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.200]   kind of ask and think about.
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:28.620]   And it doesn't, even for folks who are not really
[00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:29.900]   at the beginning of their journey,
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:33.920]   like they might be actually deep in their career,
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:35.720]   some type, they've taken college,
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:36.900]   they've taken calculus and so on,
[00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:39.080]   but still wanna sort of explore math.
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:42.860]   What would be your advice in sort of education at all ages?
[00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:45.960]   - Your temptation will be to spend more time
[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:48.160]   watching lectures or reading.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:50.560]   Try to force yourself to do more problems
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:52.160]   than you naturally would.
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.780]   That's a big one.
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:56.040]   Like the focus time that you're spending
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:59.020]   should be on solving specific problems
[00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:02.380]   and seek entities that have well curated lists of problems.
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:04.260]   - So go into like a textbook almost,
[00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:06.020]   and the problems in the back of a text,
[00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:08.100]   kind of thing, back of a chapter.
[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:10.580]   - So if you can, take a little look through those questions
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:12.500]   at the end of the chapter before you read the chapter.
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:13.620]   A lot of them won't make sense.
[00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:15.820]   Some of them might, and those are the best ones
[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:16.660]   to think about.
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:18.940]   A lot of them won't, but just take a quick look
[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:20.140]   and then read a little bit of the chapter
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:22.460]   and then maybe take a look again and things like that.
[00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:25.140]   And don't consider yourself done with the chapter
[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:28.180]   until you've actually worked through a couple exercises.
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:31.220]   And this is so hypocritical, right?
[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.980]   'Cause I like put out videos that pretty much never
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:35.980]   have associated exercises.
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:38.680]   I just view myself as a different part of the ecosystem,
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:40.780]   which means I'm kind of admitting
[00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:42.900]   that you're not really learning,
[00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:44.740]   or at least this is only a partial part
[00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:47.440]   of the learning process if you're watching these videos.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:50.380]   I think if someone's at the very beginning,
[00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:52.220]   like I do think Khan Academy does a good job.
[00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:54.900]   They have a pretty large set of questions
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:55.880]   you can work through.
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:58.820]   - Just the very basics, sort of just picking up,
[00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:01.220]   getting comfortable with the very basic linear algebra
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:04.100]   or calculus or something, Khan Academy.
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:05.940]   - Programming is actually, I think, a great,
[00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:08.820]   like learn to program and let the way that math
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:11.780]   is motivated from that angle push you through.
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:14.340]   I know a lot of people who didn't like math
[00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:15.540]   got into programming in some way,
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:17.260]   and that's what turned them on to math.
[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:19.180]   Maybe I'm biased 'cause I live in the Bay Area,
[00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:21.060]   so I'm more likely to run into someone
[00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:25.780]   who has that phenotype, but I am willing to speculate
[00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:28.140]   that that is a more generalizable path.
[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:30.100]   - So you yourself kind of in creating the videos
[00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:32.980]   are using programming to illuminate a concept,
[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:35.060]   but for yourself as well.
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:37.980]   So would you recommend somebody try to make a,
[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:40.260]   sort of almost like try to make videos?
[00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:41.860]   Like you do as a way to learn?
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:43.140]   - So one thing I've heard before,
[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:44.740]   I don't know if this is based on any actual study.
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:47.240]   This might be like a total fictional anecdote of numbers,
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:49.760]   but it rings in the mind as being true.
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.860]   You remember about 10% of what you read.
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:54.420]   You remember about 20% of what you listen to.
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:57.340]   You remember about 70% of what you actively interact with
[00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:00.500]   in some way, and then about 90% of what you teach.
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:02.100]   This is a thing I heard again,
[00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:03.500]   those numbers might be meaningless,
[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:05.500]   but they ring true, don't they?
[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:07.900]   Right, I'm willing to say I learned nine times better
[00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:09.220]   if I'm teaching something than reading.
[00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:11.660]   That might even be a low ball, right?
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:14.500]   So doing something to teach or to like actively try
[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:17.820]   to explain things is huge for consolidating the knowledge.
[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:19.720]   - Outside of family and friends,
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:22.480]   is there a moment you can remember
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:23.800]   that you would like to relive
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.240]   because it made you truly happy
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:30.240]   or it was transformative in some fundamental way?
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:32.760]   - A moment that was transformative?
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:35.120]   - Or made you truly happy?
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:36.840]   - Yeah, I think there's times,
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:38.780]   like music used to be a much bigger part of my life
[00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:39.620]   than it is now.
[00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:41.680]   Like when I was a, let's say a teenager.
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:45.460]   And I can think of sometimes in like playing music,
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:48.160]   there was one, my brother and a friend of mine,
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:50.160]   so this slightly violates the family and friends,
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.840]   but there was a music that made me happy.
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:54.440]   They were just accompanying.
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:57.480]   We had like played a gig at a ski resort,
[00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:59.320]   such that you like take a gondola to the top
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:00.680]   and like did a thing.
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:01.840]   Then on the gondola ride down,
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.180]   we decided to just jam a little bit.
[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.280]   And it was just like, I don't know,
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:09.040]   the gondola sort of over, came over a mountain
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.740]   and you saw the city lights
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:13.920]   and we're just like jamming, like playing some music.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.320]   I wouldn't describe that as transformative.
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.040]   I don't know why, but that popped into my mind
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:21.180]   as a moment of, in a way that wasn't associated
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:24.180]   with people I love, but more with like a thing I was doing,
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:26.160]   something that was just, it was just happy.
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.000]   And it was just like a great moment.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.800]   I don't think I can give you anything deeper
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.080]   than that though.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:34.840]   - Well, as a musician myself, I'd love to see,
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:38.800]   as you mentioned before, music enter back into your work,
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.080]   back into your creative work.
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.320]   I'd love to see that.
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.880]   I'm certainly allowing it to enter back into mine
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:47.880]   and it's a beautiful thing for a mathematician,
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:51.500]   for a scientist to allow music to enter their work.
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.960]   I think only good things can happen.
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.280]   - All right, I'll try to promise you a music video by 2020.
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.840]   - By 2020? - By the end of 2020.
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:00:59.680]   - Okay, all right, good.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:01.440]   - I'll give myself a longer window.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:04.520]   - All right, maybe we can like collaborate
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:05.720]   on a band type situation.
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:07.080]   What instruments do you play?
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.640]   - The main instrument I play is violin,
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.720]   but I also love to dabble around on like guitar and piano.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:13.620]   - Beautiful, me too, guitar and piano.
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:17.180]   So in "The Mathematician's Lament,"
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:20.100]   Paul Lockhart writes, "The first thing to understand
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:22.060]   "is that mathematics is an art.
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:24.140]   "The difference between math and the other arts,
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:26.740]   "such as music and painting,
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:30.000]   "is that our culture does not recognize it as such."

[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:33.300]   "if you go into it deeply enough."
