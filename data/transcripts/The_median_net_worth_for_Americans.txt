[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode we're going to talk about the median net worth of Americans
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.680]   So this data comes from the Federal Reserve's survey of consumer finances in
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.480]   2016 now they only do this survey every I think three years and then it takes another
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.360]   Couple years for them to come out and say what the results were from the survey
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.040]   So that's why we're now just really suddenly getting this data
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.160]   And I think it's really interesting data because it highlights the median net worth for the middle class
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:41.360]   The mass affluent which I define as the 80th to 99th percentile and then the top 1%
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.920]   So let's get straight to the data. The top 1% has a median net worth of
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.680]   10.7 million
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.320]   the mass affluent has a median net worth of
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.680]   146 thousand nine hundred fifty thousand and the middle class has a median net worth of only eighty seven thousand one hundred forty
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.040]   I think it's really important for us to
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:10.420]   Compare how we're doing on the road to financial independence because if there's no point of comparison
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.720]   You don't really know whether you're getting ahead or you're staying the same or you're falling behind
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.040]   And obviously all of us want to get ahead because we all listen to personal finance podcasts
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.320]   We read personal finance websites and we want to achieve financial freedom sooner rather than later with our one and only lives
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.600]   So let's get into the weeds here and look at the median net worth for each of the three classes
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.120]   And we'll start off with the top 1%
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:44.600]   So back in 1995 the median for the top 1% was three point seven million dollars
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.720]   Therefore the median net worth for the top 1% grew by a hundred eighty seven percent
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.600]   during the 1996 to 2016 time period
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.000]   That's not bad
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   But that's lower than I thought
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.560]   Given the fierce rhetoric surrounding how rich the rich have gotten over the years, you know
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.600]   You can't go a day without hearing about some rich person making boku boku bucks
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.640]   And I think what what what's going on here is that people are confusing the top 1% with the top
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.320]   0.1% so it's the zero one point zero point one percent of the folks, you know
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.540]   Who have tens and tens of millions fifty million hundred million one billion?
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:34.120]   Those are the folks who've gotten crazy rich now the top 1% not bad. Okay, ten point seven million is not bad
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.520]   but
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.680]   If you look at the growth rate from 1996 to 2016, it's not that high
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.520]   the compound growth rate is only five point four percent a year for 20 years and
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:56.480]   That gels quite closely with the compound annual growth rate of the S&P 500 of five point six percent
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.760]   between the years 1999 and 2008
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.060]   So I thought that was quite interesting here to highest volatility
[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:13.440]   So the median net worth of the top 1% was nine point six million about nine point six million in 2007 and by
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.400]   2010 the median net worth had dropped to six point six million. So that's about a 31% decline
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.780]   Can you imagine losing?
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.440]   Three million dollars in just three years
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.800]   I'll be pretty bummed out and that's why I definitely don't want to go through that again
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.420]   I mean I went through like a 35% drop back in
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.280]   2008 to 2010 and that was no fun at all
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.920]   I mean it spurred me into action by starting this website financial samurai
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.040]   But other than that, I was kind of I was like bummed out
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.540]   But you know what? Maybe not so bad because I I did get married in 2008
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.760]   So, I don't know this is kind of like revisionist history here
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.140]   But either way nobody wants to lose 30 to 35 percent of the net worth in three years
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.980]   Because you know, you're gonna have to make like what 70 80 percent just to get back to even and how long is that gonna take?
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.760]   Therefore the lesson learned is if you have a top 1% net worth or if you have a net worth of I would say over
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.440]   five million dollars
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.880]   your number one priority should be capital preservation, especially after a ten-year bull market a
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:28.120]   10.7 million net worth should be able to spit out between two hundred thousand or four hundred thousand a year with little to no risk
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.060]   So if you have no dependents then living off that type of income should be no problem for an individual
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.200]   Or a couple and one can assume that most people who have amassed a top 1% net worth
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.220]   If they have children are older and have independent adult children
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.180]   and then finally
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:55.420]   This net worth figure 10.7 million is pretty much aligned with the estate exemption amount of 11.4 million for
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.100]   2019 you've got to figure that once the
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.700]   2019 numbers come out
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:09.740]   The 10.7 is probably over 11 million and maybe even over 11.4 million now because the markets continue to do better
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:18.620]   Historically now is absolutely the most tax efficient time to be a top 1% er if you want some motivation
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.180]   This is it the estate tax limit
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.920]   11.4 million
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.180]   until dollar after that gets taxed about 40%
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.740]   so you should be able to hoard all that amount of money and
[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.620]   Give it to your offspring and make them really really spoiled and unmotivated life. Sounds good to me
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.680]   Okay, let's talk about the median net worth for the mass affluent
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.760]   I think all of you listening right now should be in the mass affluent class because the middle class
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.740]   They don't give two licks about personal finance or maybe they do but they're definitely not spending time
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.900]   Listening and reading about personal finance
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.600]   Caring about your personal finances
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.560]   Motivates you to save more invest more and figure out new ways to boost wealth
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.920]   So keep on listening and keep on reading as much as possible. Not just my site my podcast
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:14.900]   But many many other podcasts and websites just keep on listening and take action
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.680]   So the median net worth of the mass affluent class
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.840]   746 thousand nine hundred fifty dollars
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.040]   Pretty darn good if you ask me
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.800]   That net worth figure using a 4% withdrawal rate or a 4% rate of return
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.720]   Should be able to generate about thirty thousand a year in gross income
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.320]   not bad and then if you add the average Social Security monthly check of
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.320]   $1,461 and the mass affluent has about
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.320]   $47,500 gross to spend a year in retirement
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.760]   And if you have a loved one who also earns the average Social Security monthly check
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.440]   You can add up another what?
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:03.440]   $12,000 a year so life is pretty good for the mass affluent and also if you look at the volatility of net worth in
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.960]   2007 the median mass affluent net worth was
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.240]   661,000 in
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.080]   2010 the median mass affluent net worth fell to
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.720]   360,400 for only a 15.3% decline
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:25.360]   So in other words the median net worth for the mass affluent fell by half the percentage amount as the median net worth for the
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:32.440]   Top 1% so for those who cannot stomach volatility being in the mass affluent class is the way to go
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:41.280]   So if you're currently in this class, that's probably worth still having a bias towards capital growth rather than capital preservation like the top 1%
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.760]   Losing on average 15% of your net worth and a bear market isn't unbearably painful
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:53.680]   Therefore you should probably continue to dollar cost average in a downturn based on existing risk appropriate investments
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.800]   Finally, it's worth the geo-arbitraging if you're in the mass affluent class
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:04.720]   You've got enough money to make the move, but you're not super super wealthy where you know
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.680]   You can live in the most expensive cities in the world. So think about how much?
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:17.400]   $46,000 nine hundred fifty dollars of net worth can buy you in places like Mexico, Thailand, Vietnam
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:22.880]   Malaysia, Taiwan and many Eastern European countries your purchasing power probably triples
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:28.500]   So in other words, you probably have two million dollars three million four million dollars in purchasing power
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.880]   It's not gonna get you a lot in San Francisco, New York
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.480]   but it sure is heck gonna get you a better lifestyle in
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.240]   Minneapolis or
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.320]   Kansas City or Des Moines that is if you can stand the weather and you know
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.400]   Like the people and get used to the new environment
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.080]   So finally, let's talk about the middle class the best class in the world
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.160]   We all think we're middle class no matter how much we have or how much we make
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.280]   Because we want to feel like part of a greater community
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:04.840]   Unfortunately, the median net worth of the middle class looks like the EKG of a deceased person
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.880]   When I was looking at the data and the chart, I didn't even realize the middle class
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:16.720]   Existed I thought the middle class was really the mass affluent class because the middle class net worth
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:24.760]   Chart over time looked like the x-axis like the horizontal x-axis. No nothing. It wasn't moving at all
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:30.000]   So the middle class has a median net worth of eighty seven thousand one hundred forty dollars
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.980]   And if you are the median age in America of 38, that's okay. You're still got decades
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.600]   Left to grow your wealth
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.380]   But if you've got eighty seven thousand dollars of net worth in your 50s and 60s
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.320]   Life is probably gonna be a little bit more difficult
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:52.720]   It is highly likely you will have to work longer become dependent on government programs in addition to Social Security
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:58.700]   and what's most concerning about the median net worth for the middle class is that it actually peaked in
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.040]   2007 at a hundred eighteen thousand twenty five dollars
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:07.700]   the twenty six point two percent decline in the median middle class net worth by
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:14.000]   2016 should be one of the biggest causes for concern for everybody if this is not addressed
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.800]   There's gonna be a resolution. I think there's gonna be riots on the street everywhere, you know, you're seeing them and you know
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.340]   Certain cities here and there I think a lot's going on in Portland
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:32.740]   wherever but it's just gonna spread and there's gonna be a lot of dissatisfaction in this country and I think
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:37.040]   People have got to be careful and what has happened. I think
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:45.280]   Look, the middle class has not recovered right? And what has happened is that they got spooked out of risk assets like real estate in stocks
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:51.560]   During the financial crisis and then they never got back in so stock ownership has fallen off
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.840]   continuously since
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.520]   2007 2007 stock ownership for the average US adult was about
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.520]   Sixty five point two percent. Now. The ownership rate is about fifty two percent
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:10.020]   That's a pretty big decline. And if you look at home ownership rates
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:15.400]   It looked like it peaked more on 2004 but in 2007
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:21.640]   The number was six to be sixty eight point five percent. And now now we're only at about
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.480]   sixty three point seven percent
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.280]   so declining home ownership rates and
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.760]   declining stock
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.040]   Ownership rates means that you missed out on the biggest
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:39.760]   Rebound the biggest bull market over the past ten years and that's kind of that's kind of sad
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:45.080]   So despite the middle class falling behind we can look at the positive we can say look
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:51.400]   middle class in America is still much more comfortable than being middle class anywhere else in the world and
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.800]   That's a good thing. The problem is we just kind of take what we have for granted and we start comparing ourselves to other people
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.360]   So the worst thing I think you can do is rent for life
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:11.120]   Spend money on stupid things you don't need and never invest in the stock market if you do these three things
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.760]   I am certain that you're gonna probably stay in the middle class
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:20.240]   Which by definition now I feel seems like it's a more lower class
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.200]   Because when you say middle class, I think you think about a good class
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:29.320]   You think about being able to own a home being able to own a car being able to send your kids
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:36.480]   To school to college and to save for your retirement so that you don't have to work past 60 65
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:43.360]   But the way the middle class numbers are showing up right now. It looks pretty dire
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.280]   So I hope I hope everybody listening to this
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:53.760]   Does better than what the numbers show for the middle class winner-take-all is happening the top 1%
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:13:01.760]   Own 28% of all wealth in America while the middle class on the other hand only owns 21% of all wealth
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:08.440]   and what's going on is that the inflection point where the top 1% started making more than the middle class was in
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.840]   2010 and that's exactly
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.640]   when
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.320]   the real estate market and stocks started to rebound
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.040]   so the lesson learned is
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.560]   please invest regularly save aggressively in
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:29.360]   Risk assets like stocks and real estate over time. Yes, it's gonna be volatile
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:35.320]   You're gonna lose money sometimes but if you stick with it over the long time things are gonna probably turn out
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:43.240]   Okay, I do want to leave you with some final interesting data points again. This is from the Federal Reserve Consumer Finance Survey
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:51.520]   So let's look at the 55 to 64 age group. The median net worth there is a hundred eighty seven thousand three hundred
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.180]   Which I think is not too bad at all
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:14:00.800]   You're close to retirement if not retired you can collect Social Security
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.440]   So you're gonna live a pretty good life?
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:10.800]   187,000 is much better than the 87,000 number we talked about because this is by age and that's what is more pertinent
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:17.060]   And then if you look at the average number the average 55 to 64 year old household
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.560]   Has a net worth of one point one
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.400]   six seven million
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:31.200]   Think about that. The average American is a millionaire who would have thought you would think again that you know
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.880]   The average American was just in poverty or something based on what you hear and listen to in the media
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.460]   And of course you can think about it as wow
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.960]   That must mean that a lot. There's a lot of concentration of wealth at the top
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:50.640]   That's bringing the averages up. But you know what? Hey average is average and again, you can look at the median at one hundred eighty seven thousand three hundred
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.400]   For 55 to 64 year olds and think that's okay
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:01.900]   And if you bump it up a little to the 65 to 74 year old age group the median rises to two hundred twenty four thousand
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.560]   So not too bad at all
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:10.000]   Personally, I want you guys to shoot for more. I want every single one of you guys to be
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.420]   multimillionaires by the time you're 55 to 64
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:18.240]   I think the key number to shoot for is 3 million because I think 3 million is the new 1 million
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.600]   Because of inflation we all know that everything has gone up crazy amounts
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.840]   tuition food housing
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:31.600]   That hey, let's be a little bit above average because you're spending the time
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:39.480]   Listening learning reading taking action and it's better to end up with a little bit too much than a little bit too little
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:45.440]   Thanks so much everyone. And I hope you guys continue to save aggressively and invest smartly
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:52.400]   Be careful out there after 10 year bull market and if you like this podcast, please leave a review. I'd love to read it
