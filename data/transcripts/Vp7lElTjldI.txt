[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.000]   So our first session this morning is a fireside chat
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.740]   with Dr. Bill Bernstein and Jason Zweig.
[00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.820]   Dr. Bernstein is a neurologist.
[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.220]   He's also the co-founder of Efficient Frontier Advisors
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.980]   and the author of several books on finance and economic history.
[00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.200]   Those books include The Intelligent Asset Allocator,
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.140]   The Four Pillars of Investing, and several other e-books,
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.960]   plus four volumes of economic history, The Birth of Plenty,
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.740]   A Splendid Exchange, Masters of the Word,
[00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.540]   and The Delusions of Crowds.
[00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.500]   Bill has written for several national publications,
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.580]   including Money Magazine, The Wall Street Journal,
[00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.200]   and has authored and co-authored several peer-reviewed financial
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.560]   journal articles, which led
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:58.660]   to winning the 2017 James R. Verton Award from the CFA Institute.
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.140]   He is speaking with Jason Zweig.
[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.260]   Jason is an investing and personal finance columnist
[00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.480]   for The Wall Street Journal.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.700]   He is the author of several books, including my favorite,
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.900]   Your Money and Your Brain, The Devil's Financial Dictionary,
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.560]   The Little Book of Safe Money.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.580]   He has edited and revised Benjamin Graham's
[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.540]   The Intelligent Investor and co-edited Benjamin Graham's
[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.800]   Building a Profession, an Anthology of Graham's Essays.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.780]   From 1995 to 2008, Jason was the senior writer
[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.020]   for Money Magazine.
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.060]   Before joining Money, he was a mutual funds editor for Forbes.
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.080]   He also serves as the trustee of the Museum of American Finance
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.000]   in New York City and sits on the editorial boards
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.520]   of the Financial History Magazine and the Journal
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.840]   of Behavioral Finance.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.440]   So, please welcome Dr. Bill Bernstein and Jason Zweig.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:02:07.820]   [ Applause ]
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.640]   >> All right, well, it is a distinct pleasure.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.980]   I can't really embellish too much on Rich's introduction
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.820]   of Jason, except to say that it's a distinct honor.
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.480]   I know very few people who know more about neuropsychology,
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.760]   theory, and practice of investing,
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.380]   and especially financial history, than Jason.
[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.480]   But I know of no one who commands all three areas as--
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.000]   >> I do.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.340]   >> -- as I do.
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.840]   Well, you're very kind.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.360]   So, the way it's going to work is I will lead off,
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.540]   and then it's going to be a two-way street.
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.560]   We're going to fire questions
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.220]   at each other, probably interrupt each other.
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.600]   So, my first question to Jason is, many of you may not know
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.620]   that he majored in art history.
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.840]   So, the question is how one segues from art history
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.060]   to the pinnacles of modern finance.
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.560]   >> Well, so, yeah, thanks, Bill,
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.960]   and thanks to the Bogle Head Center for having us here.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.040]   And it's great to see all of you.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.040]   Some of you I've-- I think I've known for 20 years.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.080]   It was great to see Tim Dempsey and Gail Cox, and a bunch
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.000]   of other Bogle Heads from way back.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   So, I always wanted to be a writer
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.280]   from the time I was about 13, and maybe someday I will be one.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.300]   I grew up in the art business.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.300]   My parents were art and antique dealers after they got
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.220]   out of the newspaper business.
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.220]   But I just fell into journalism by accident,
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.000]   and through a series of other accidents,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.860]   I ended up a business journalist.
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:10.020]   And when I became the Forbes Mutual Funds Editor in 1992,
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.380]   I thought it was the worst job in the place.
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.580]   And then on day one, I started doing a little research
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.460]   and found out that back then there was a trillion
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.020]   and a half dollars invested in mutual funds.
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.020]   And I said, if there's a trillion and a half dollars,
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.260]   there's got to be a story in there somewhere.
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.840]   And in fact, there were.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.620]   And I just followed my curiosity where it led me.
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.460]   But I think a much better question is how does a
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.900]   neurologist with a PhD in chemistry end up so interested
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.660]   in investing finance and economic history?
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.980]   >> Well, the ugly answer is that I enjoy money.
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:04.700]   But, you know, the prettier answer is that I live
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.820]   in a country that doesn't have a functioning social
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.060]   welfare system.
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.940]   So I realized as a practicing physician I was going to have
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.740]   to invest on my own.
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.100]   And with, you know, the scientific training
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.740]   that I had acquired, it was obvious to me that the way
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.100]   to do it was the way you would approach any other scientific
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.340]   problem, which was to review the peer-reviewed literature,
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.900]   look at the data, consult the basic texts,
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.540]   collect data, build models.
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.380]   And when I had done all that by the mid-1990s,
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.780]   I realized that I had put together something
[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.740]   that might be useful to small investors.
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.660]   So I logged on to this fancy new technology that was just coming
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.100]   to Coos Bay, Oregon in the mid-'90s called the internet.
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.740]   And I started putting my stuff out there.
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.020]   And soon enough, journalists started calling me
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.900]   and, you know, began writing books.
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.740]   And I discovered that in the process of writing
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.060]   about finance, that, you know, writing about the history
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.460]   of finance is so very important.
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.260]   If you don't know the history of finance,
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.700]   you're dead in the water when you're as an investor.
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.460]   And I segued into writing about history as well,
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.100]   because I found actually I enjoyed writing history more
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.020]   than I enjoyed writing about finance.
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.900]   So that's how I got there.
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.100]   So I'm going to turn the question around again
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.900]   and ask Jason, what are the one or two
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.220]   or three biggest epiphanies you've had in the, you know,
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.060]   30 years, 35 years you've been doing this?
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.460]   >> Yeah, so I guess I'll --
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:52.620]   I think the biggest epiphany I had was probably
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:58.180]   around 2000 -- actually, I think it was --
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.980]   it might have been in the year 2000.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:07.540]   I was sitting at home, and my wife was doing her homework.
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:16.140]   And I was reading the Journal of Financial Economics, I think.
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.380]   Sort of by candlelight.
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:25.020]   And my wife looked up from what she was doing, and she was like,
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.140]   "Is that interesting?"
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:34.100]   And I sort of, you know, put it down and looked up at her,
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:39.420]   and I was like, "Now that you mention it, not really."
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:46.660]   And so I had a business trip the next day, and I --
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.780]   when I got to the airport, and in those days,
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.260]   airport bookstores were still pretty good, I said,
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.060]   "I'm going to buy something to read on the plane
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.900]   that I wouldn't normally read,
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.740]   because I shouldn't be reading all this finance stuff,
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.100]   because I do that all day long.
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.380]   I shouldn't be doing it at night,
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.340]   and I shouldn't be doing it when I'm traveling."
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:11.300]   So I grabbed a copy of Scientific American,
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.620]   which then was a very good magazine.
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.940]   It's maybe deteriorated a little since, but --
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.620]   and I opened it, and of course, being an art history major,
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:27.780]   I turned to the article that had the nicest pictures,
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:34.300]   which just so happened to be an article on split brains.
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.620]   And Bill knows exactly what I'm referring to.
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:43.380]   There are people who suffer from intractable epilepsy,
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:49.020]   and ultimately, the most effective treatment for them
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:53.140]   is to surgically sever the corpus callosum,
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.980]   which is a thin bridge of tissue
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:59.900]   that connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain.
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.060]   And it turns out that when you do that to people,
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.860]   they calculate probability completely differently.
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:14.740]   And to this day, I still remember grabbing my red pen
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.500]   that I always carry with me out of my pocket
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:22.900]   and circling this in huge loops on the page.
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:29.340]   And the article was written by Mike Gazzaniga, who you know of.
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.820]   He was a great neurologist.
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.940]   And when I got back to the office,
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.900]   the first thing I did was call his research partner,
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.260]   who was working on this project.
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:43.620]   And one thing led to another, and ultimately,
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.740]   I became fascinated with neuroscience
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.060]   and the developing field of neuroeconomics.
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:53.380]   But it all really came from that epiphany of saying,
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.860]   why am I spending my free time reading the same stuff
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.060]   that I read when I'm working?
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.580]   Yeah, I mean, the wonderful thing about finance,
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.380]   as Jason discovered all those many years ago,
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.700]   is that to be a good lawyer or a good doctor,
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.380]   you have to read thousands and thousands of case studies
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.940]   and peer-reviewed articles.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:20.140]   But the list of essential finance articles
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:24.700]   that you have to read is extremely short.
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.900]   What would be at the top of your list?
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:32.140]   Oh, of course, the Fama-French study and Fama's early work
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:38.420]   on market efficiency, the work on the limits of arbitrage
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.460]   that explains why you can be the world's best arbitrageur,
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.420]   the world's best hedge fund manager,
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.260]   and you're still going to be screwed
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.620]   in a bad state of the world because all your clients will
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:53.500]   leave you just at the time when the expected returns are
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.900]   the highest, Draymond's work on the value effect,
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.620]   and Barry, I'm trying to remember the name
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.220]   of the other co-author, who basically demonstrated
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:09.780]   that growth stocks, growth peters out far more rapidly
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.020]   than you would imagine.
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.940]   And they wind up being grossly overpriced for that reason.
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.060]   Those would be the top, the ones that come right
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.820]   off the top of my head.
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.140]   So what was your epiphany?
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:28.020]   My epiphany was much more mundane.
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.100]   There's this controversy.
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:36.100]   It's almost a parlor game that academic finance people play,
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.460]   which is do stocks become more risky with time
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.260]   or don't they become more risky with time?
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.740]   And the extremely simple and wrong answer
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.300]   is they become less risky with time
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.180]   because as you look at their annualized returns,
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.260]   they convert 30 and 40 and 50 years.
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.140]   Even the worst one is plus 4%.
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.820]   The best one may be plus 13% or 14%.
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.420]   But of course, compounded over--
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.340]   the fallacy there is compounded over 30 or 50 years
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.780]   is that 8% difference is just absolutely enormous.
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.420]   So that's the first wrong answer.
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:13.140]   The next answer is, yes, they become riskier with time
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:19.140]   for that reason but also because the longer dated an option is,
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.220]   the more expensive it becomes, which certainly would not
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:27.500]   be true if stocks became less risky with time.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.260]   But of course, that answer is wrong, too,
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.700]   because the options are probably mispriced.
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.740]   But I realize that my epiphany was
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.940]   that's completely the wrong question to ask.
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.940]   It's not that there's a right or a wrong answer.
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.060]   But you're asking the question the wrong way,
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.120]   which is you have to add another qualifier, which
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.220]   is how old is the investor?
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.500]   So if you are an accumulator, stocks
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.180]   are really not that risky.
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.540]   And in fact, as awful as the stock market is right now,
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.780]   this is a wonderful market for accumulators.
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.620]   I mean, if I were an accumulator,
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:04.380]   I'd be drooling with all the bargains that are out there
[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.300]   and laying my savings into them.
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:11.900]   On the other hand, if you are a decumulator,
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.620]   stocks are not just risky.
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.500]   They're Three Mile Island, Chernobyl toxic.
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.700]   You get the wrong sequence right off the bat,
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.540]   and you're in a sling.
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.020]   So the question is-- so the answer to that question
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.540]   is you've asked the wrong question.
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.340]   The real question is, how old are you?
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:36.540]   All right, well, I'll turn it around and ask Jason.
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:41.620]   You've written God knows how many pieces.
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.940]   Maybe not as many as Jonathan Clements.
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.140]   I don't know.
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:50.380]   Yeah, but he burned out before he did so,
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.460]   so you still might catch up.
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.380]   So what are the pieces that you're most proud of,
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.420]   and what are the ones that you're the least proud of?
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.060]   Well, yeah, so Jonathan wrote, I think,
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:08.740]   1,004 columns for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.500]   I just wrote my 690th, but who's counting?
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:16.180]   I can assure you that every single week,
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:21.180]   I can tell you exactly how many columns I've written.
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.740]   Well, let's start with the stinkers, right?
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.180]   I've written-- well, actually, I should clarify something,
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:37.620]   which is that I tend to say that between 5% and 10%
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.940]   of everything I write is garbage,
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.380]   and maybe 80% of it is just like nothing,
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:49.340]   and maybe 5% to 10% of it is OK.
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:55.420]   So with that caveat, what I would say
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:15:01.020]   is the columns that I look back on and cringe the most about
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:11.220]   are here's an opportunity for investors now columns,
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:16.700]   because I perceived something in the markets that
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.100]   seemed like a dislocation.
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:30.820]   And with rare exceptions, like 2008 and probably early 2020,
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:37.100]   it's you're usually wrong when you think markets are wrong.
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:42.980]   And every time I've thought markets were wrong,
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.660]   I was right that somebody was wrong,
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.700]   but it wasn't the markets.
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:53.620]   I've made those kinds of calls, which I guess in journalistic
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.940]   terms are kind of like market timing,
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:16:00.420]   and the vast majority of them turned out to be wrong.
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:04.460]   And they were pretty stupid, and somebody
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.220]   should have stopped me.
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:12.780]   But the columns I'm proudest of are often
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:17.060]   the things that don't resonate as much with readers,
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.380]   but it depends.
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:23.740]   I wrote a column back before I came to the journal
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:31.620]   in May of 1999 that was called baloney.com that
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.180]   was about the overvaluation of internet stocks.
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.780]   And in that case, the market was wrong,
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:40.180]   and I turned out to be right.
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.660]   But I think the lead, the beginning of it
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:47.540]   was something like for the next year or two,
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.900]   this may seem like the stupidest thing you've ever
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:55.580]   read in your life, and it might turn out to be,
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.660]   but I don't think so.
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:03.300]   And I once got a letter from a reader
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.940]   saying that he had carried it around
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.940]   in his wallet for two years to keep him
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:13.380]   from jumping into the dot-com frenzy, which
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.820]   was one of the nicest things a reader has ever said to me.
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:19.820]   And in fact, he enclosed the original article
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:23.140]   in his handwritten letter.
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.100]   So that was one.
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:30.260]   And then I did a story about a portfolio manager
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:38.380]   at BlackRock who was doing some very peculiar private investing
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:42.100]   in his personal portfolio that involved companies
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:46.220]   that he also held in his fund.
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.620]   He was obviously an active manager at BlackRock,
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:55.300]   and ultimately, the SEC took action in that case.
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.980]   And I think there was like a $12 million fine involved.
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:04.900]   So I was pretty happy that that worked out the way it did,
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:10.980]   because it's important to have that kind of spotlight
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.700]   shining on the industry.
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:17.460]   Yeah, I mean, as I've watched your evolution
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.060]   over the decades, you started--
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.460]   I started reading you, at least, at Money magazine.
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.180]   And you didn't do a lot of investigative work there.
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:31.740]   And some of your columns, not a huge number of them,
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.260]   are investigative.
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.100]   What do you look for?
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:34.940]   I mean, how do you--
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.340]   not just how do you look for, but I mean,
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.460]   how do you get tipped off?
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:41.340]   Is it readers that say, hey, you need to look at this?
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:46.780]   Well, so yeah, I mean, I wish I could do more investigative
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:51.380]   work than I do, because it's enormously satisfying
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:55.500]   and frustrating, by the way, because it's very difficult.
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.100]   Those ideas come from everywhere,
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:02.140]   the same way my regular column ideas come from everywhere.
[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:07.740]   But the classic investigative instinct
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:12.060]   is oddball detection.
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:19.620]   You know what the normal pattern is in a particular field.
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.580]   The numbers always look like this,
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:29.140]   or the general results should sound like that.
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:34.820]   And you just see something that doesn't make sense,
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:41.980]   a footnote, a particular detail.
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.740]   And that is just like out of sync.
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:48.100]   I mean, one of my big investigative projects
[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:51.420]   literally came out of an asterisk.
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:57.700]   There was an asterisk in a federal filing
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.980]   where everybody else would have a number.
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:04.660]   And I was like, what's that asterisk doing there?
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.940]   And then I went to the bottom of the page
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.700]   where the asterisk was explained,
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.340]   and the explanation said absolutely nothing.
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.420]   And that was the tip off that something
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:19.340]   was potentially amiss, which it turned out it was.
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:24.220]   So I think a lot of people in this room,
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.660]   given what you do for a living, you're
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:31.580]   very familiar with the normal patterns of behavior
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:39.540]   and reporting and how results are framed in your field.
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:45.540]   And expertise is simply pattern recognition.
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:48.940]   And when you detect that something is out of sync,
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:53.380]   that's a pretty good sign that there's something there.
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:59.020]   One pattern in finance that we all observe
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.980]   is that it's a field that is rife with psychopaths
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.180]   and con men.
[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:08.420]   And I mean, people don't go into finance for the same reason
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.940]   they go into elementary education or social work.
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.220]   Let's face it.
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.460]   And so the question I have for you, Jason,
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:20.620]   is you've picked out some pretty impressive rogues
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:24.580]   in your investigative work.
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.980]   And I'm wondering, how do you pick out
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.860]   the really notable psychopaths from simply the everyday ones
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:30.380]   in finance?
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:38.220]   I know what you're trying to do with that question, Bill.
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:44.580]   And yes, there is one particular person
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.820]   I did interview many, many years ago.
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:50.500]   And I am not naming names.
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:56.060]   But that person went on to fame and power
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.940]   and many other things.
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:10.500]   One sign is that finance sociopaths, at least
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.180]   in my experience, tend to be very
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.780]   honest about their dishonesty.
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:20.380]   They're kind of disarming.
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.420]   They're very upfront about what they're
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.700]   doing for the most part.
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.940]   They don't really see why anybody
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.260]   would think there's anything wrong with it.
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:34.060]   And they're kind of amused by what they're doing.
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:42.500]   And people who deny that they're doing something wrong
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:46.340]   are a lot less interesting than the ones who just sort of laugh
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.860]   and say, well, yeah, I guess you got me.
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:52.020]   Yeah, the one from a historical perspective
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.340]   that comes most prominently to mind
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:59.060]   was Charlie Mitchell, who was the chairman of National City
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:07.020]   Bank back in the late 1920s and was just
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:11.260]   one of the most dishonest operators, worst operators
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.580]   in finance even at that time.
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.260]   And the way he was brought to justice
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:22.820]   was by Ferdinand Pecora, who was the counsel for the Senate
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.300]   Banking Committee.
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:28.100]   And Pecora was a very skilled prosecutor.
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.860]   And he understood what Jason just said,
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:33.900]   that the best way to get a criminal to hang himself
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:38.180]   was to just ask him what his normal operations were.
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:42.700]   And Charlie Mitchell, just very forthrightly said, well, yeah,
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.260]   I pay myself a million dollars a year.
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.020]   Why shouldn't I?
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.020]   Yeah, I engage in these duplicitous transactions
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.340]   with my wife to avoid taxes.
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:53.100]   Of course, who wouldn't do that?
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.700]   I do this sort of stuff because I'm smart.
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:02.580]   And that's how we got the panoply of securities laws
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:09.020]   that govern our securities markets to this day.
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.500]   So and it was remarkable.
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.100]   And Pecora, the people who--
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.580]   there were a couple of other counsels that came before him
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.820]   who didn't understand that the easiest
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.460]   way to incriminate a criminal was
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:25.140]   to have the criminal basically indict himself,
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:28.140]   which may become relevant in the not-too-distant future,
[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.900]   I suppose.
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:35.100]   So the next question is, what are the biggest mistakes
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:40.300]   that you see your readers making?
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.140]   I'm sure you see them make lots of mistakes.
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.900]   What are the two or three biggest ones?
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.260]   Well, I think the biggest mistake of all
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:53.740]   is the mistake that is most human,
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:59.260]   that we all commit, every one of us, including you and me,
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.980]   at least including me and probably you, Bill.
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.460]   We'll find out in a minute.
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:11.620]   Which is the inability to admit you made a mistake.
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:15.740]   And I mean, I don't know.
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.380]   How many people in this room own cryptocurrency
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.020]   and are willing to put their hands up?
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:21.700]   We got Jim.
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.620]   But most of them I got by 10.
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:28.060]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:28.620]   That's right.
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:34.780]   And by the way, I'm going to say officially,
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.820]   I'm agnostic on whether that's a good or bad idea.
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.260]   But I do know that a lot of people
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.820]   bought crypto as an inflation hedge.
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:46.580]   A lot of people.
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.780]   And that doesn't seem to be working out too well.
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:56.820]   Crypto was down 4% this morning on the news
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.620]   that inflation went up.
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:07.140]   And that's a kind of hedge, but it's probably not
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:08.340]   a very effective hedge.
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:12.500]   Now, crypto might still work out, and that'd be great.
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.900]   But if you bought it because you thought
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.420]   it was an inflation hedge, then I would submit to you
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.700]   you've got a problem.
[00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.540]   And what percentage of people who
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:28.180]   bought crypto as an inflation hedge
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:31.700]   have admitted their rationale was wrong
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:35.300]   and have reconsidered their position?
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:43.420]   I would say single digits based on anecdotal evidence anyway.
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:47.580]   And that's true, of course, not just for crypto.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.980]   It's true for across the board.
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:54.500]   No matter what you own, we all own something.
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:58.740]   We all invest in something that we shouldn't
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.900]   have bought in the first place.
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.220]   We should get rid of.
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.060]   Rick is nodding.
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:03.580]   Sorry.
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:09.780]   And if we were honest with ourselves,
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:12.420]   we would get it the heck out of our portfolio,
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:13.700]   and we just can't.
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.860]   So I mean, to me, that's the mother of all mistakes
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:19.220]   is the inability to admit mistakes.
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:24.020]   And there are some techniques that can help with that.
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.620]   And if we have more time at the end,
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:27.780]   maybe we can talk about it.
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:28.860]   But what about you, Bill?
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.060]   What do you think?
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.620]   And what's your biggest mistake?
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:33.460]   Oh, golly.
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.820]   Well, that's an easy one, which is I didn't understand
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.180]   what I explained earlier.
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.300]   It took me a while to get to that epiphany, which
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.740]   is that I should have invested more aggressively when I was
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.580]   younger, when I was streaming.
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.740]   I was always trying to look for the market bottom.
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:50.060]   And I found them, but it didn't do me a lot of good
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:55.060]   because I'd have been better off investing for the long term.
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.220]   And that's easily, easily the most expensive mistake
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:58.820]   that I've made.
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.300]   I've made many, many others.
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.140]   I'm in good grief.
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:04.220]   I bought Palladian Futures around 1990
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.140]   on the Ponds and Fleischman Cold Fusion work.
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:10.020]   Talk about stupid.
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:18.020]   So I mean, the biggest mistake that I see investors make
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:23.740]   everywhere I go is they see their portfolio
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.900]   as their net worth.
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.580]   And that's really a fatal mistake
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:31.060]   to make when you're older because you've
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:33.500]   got risky assets, and you've got riskless assets.
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:38.180]   And the risky assets really may not pay off for a decade or two
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.540]   or three.
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:44.260]   And so if you think that this is my net worth,
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:48.300]   and you just saw it go down by 20% this year,
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:53.860]   and you translate that into that is imperiling your retirement,
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.660]   you've made a mistake of not understanding
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.180]   that paying for your retirement is all about your safe assets
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:28:59.980]   and not about your risky ones.
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:03.260]   And Christine likes to talk about all the different buckets
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:05.860]   that she likes, and I think it's a good way to do it.
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:10.300]   I'm happy with two buckets, risky and non-risky.
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:14.060]   But if you want to take the riskless one
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:19.780]   and parse it out for different purposes, that's fine, too.
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:21.660]   That's the biggest mistake I see people make.
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:25.420]   And probably equal to that, everybody
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.340]   talks about overconfidence, if you're
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:29.980]   familiar with even the basics of neuropsychology,
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:33.820]   you understand that human beings are a very, very
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.500]   overconfident species.
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.580]   But the most fatal overconfidence
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.300]   is overconfidence about your risk tolerance.
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:44.100]   It's to be able to look at the Ibbotson graph, which
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.060]   is this horribly deceptive graph that
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:48.380]   is on a semi-log scale, and it makes
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.800]   it look like there's hardly any fluctuation in the market.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.220]   It's just this straight slope that goes up,
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:57.780]   until you realize that 1987 didn't even show up in that.
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:00.940]   The growth financial crisis on a semi-log scale
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:04.780]   is a barely visible blip, and you just
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:10.240]   don't understand how awful you feel when the market really
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:10.820]   does go down.
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:12.280]   There's this wonderful quote, which
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.060]   I can almost do from memory, and maybe Jason
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.020]   can correct the grammar, but there's
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:18.460]   this wonderful book called Where Are the Customer's Yachts
[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:22.340]   by a wonderfully funny man named Fred Schwedt.
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:25.220]   And the quote goes something like,
[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:28.340]   "There are some things that cannot be explained to a virgin
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:31.900]   either by words or pictures."
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.660]   Nor can any words that I could write in this book
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.620]   now describe to you what it feels
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:41.360]   like to lose a real chunk of money that you used to own.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.620]   Yeah, that's correct, and it's illustrated with a cartoon
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:49.940]   by Peter Arno, who was a cartoonist for The New Yorker,
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:53.620]   of Adam and Eve standing naked under the tree of knowledge.
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.700]   All right, well, I think what we'll do now
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:06.420]   is Jason and I wanted to save some time for Jack anecdotes,
[00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:10.980]   and then I think we'll probably open it up for some questions.
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:17.780]   So Jack, I'll ask you, what is your favorite Jack Bogle story?
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:20.340]   Well, so I've got a bunch of favorite Jack Bogle stories,
[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:24.060]   but I guess the one I'll tell is one
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:29.540]   that was about a direct interaction that he and I had.
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:36.500]   So in 1995, I was still--
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.380]   I was the mutual funds editor at Forbes,
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:42.060]   and I got an offer to go work at Money magazine,
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:44.980]   where I was before I came to the journal.
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.140]   And I was torn.
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:51.100]   I didn't know whether I should go.
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:56.300]   Money magazine then was kind of promissory.
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:59.740]   They used to have all these cover stories, 10 hot funds
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:03.180]   to buy now and stuff like that, which I found kind of creepy,
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:03.900]   to be honest.
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:10.820]   But it was a very attractive design your own job kind
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:12.740]   of offer.
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.780]   And so I did something that I'm not
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:18.060]   sure I've ever done before or since,
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:23.300]   which was I called a source to ask for personal advice.
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:27.860]   I mean, it's not the kind of thing journalists generally do.
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.260]   But I called Jack, and I said, can I
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:33.740]   ask you a personal question?
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.500]   And he said, of course.
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:39.420]   So I explained the situation, and then he said to me,
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.900]   and I, well, what are you afraid of?
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:51.180]   Which was, of course, cut to the heart of the matter.
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:55.060]   Because I hadn't been thinking about it in those terms, right?
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:59.180]   And I realized, actually, he's right.
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.780]   I am afraid.
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:03.620]   And what am I afraid of?
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:06.660]   And I said, I just blurted out, I said,
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:10.460]   I'm afraid they'll take my integrity away from me.
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.420]   And he said, if they can take your integrity away from you,
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:17.020]   you never had it in the first place.
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.420]   And I was like, I guess I'll take the job.
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:22.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:24.420]   Yeah, I have two fast ones.
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.580]   I don't have the depth of experience
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.220]   with Jack that you did.
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:34.780]   But 13 years ago, I was cleaning out our house
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:40.260]   for the inevitable downsizing we all have to inevitably do,
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.860]   or at least some of us do.
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:51.020]   And I came across a two-page, single-spaced letter from Jack
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:54.420]   that was in response to a letter that I had written him sometime
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:58.140]   in the 1980s when I had no presence in finance at all.
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.140]   And I was grousing about something stupid,
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:04.500]   about why they didn't have an unhedged international bond
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.460]   fund.
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:11.620]   And he wrote me about 1,000 words explaining
[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:14.020]   why Vanguard didn't have it.
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:17.260]   And I was just one of many hundreds of thousands
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.820]   of Vanguard customers.
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:22.700]   That, to me, epitomized Jack.
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:26.700]   My favorite story, though, is I did go out to dinner with him
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:27.740]   on occasion.
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:32.460]   And this was early 2000.
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:37.780]   And I waited until he had had his second martini.
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:42.940]   And I said, so, Jack, have you altered your asset allocation
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:47.540]   at all in this FACACTA market?
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:51.300]   And he just sort of conspiratorially
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.420]   looked over his shoulders and said, I sold off 5%.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:57.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:01.620]   So that's my Jack anecdote.
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:02.740]   That's really interesting.
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:03.740]   All right.
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:07.060]   So I think what we'll do is we'll have people come up
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:08.140]   and ask questions.
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:11.340]   And I think what we'll do is I will give up my microphone
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:12.900]   to anyone who wants to ask a question.
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.700]   And then you and I will share a microphone.
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:20.460]   Put your hand up.
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:21.700]   Don't be shy.
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:24.700]   We have one in the way back, Jim, on the left.
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:36.000]   Hello.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.860]   Thank you.
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:41.940]   Bill, you mentioned that people are overconfident.
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:46.580]   And I thought, does increasing technology
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:48.900]   increase our overconfidence or decrease?
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:52.020]   Like, we're hunter-gatherers more or less confident--
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.420]   overconfident than we are now.
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:59.540]   Well, I'm a big believer in the immutability of human nature.
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:01.300]   I mean, it's a process which has evolved
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:04.340]   over tens of thousands of years.
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:09.300]   So I don't think that human nature has made us--
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.980]   that part of it has changed.
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:16.220]   But it certainly has given us access to information
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:19.500]   that feeds our overconfidence.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:25.060]   There's always-- it's very easy to find a bubble
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:26.180]   you can slip into.
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.140]   And in fact, that's something that's increasingly
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.220]   happening in this country.
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.300]   We're all selecting where we want to live
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:32.780]   and who we want to live around.
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:38.540]   And so we wind up living around people who are like us.
[00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:40.180]   So there aren't a lot of evangelicals
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:41.380]   who moved to Portland, OK?
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.060]   There aren't a lot of political liberals
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:44.900]   who moved to Lubbock, Texas, all right?
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:46.540]   And that's what's happening here.
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:48.780]   And the same thing happens in finance, OK?
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.580]   You're able to find the bubble, the person
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:51.820]   you want to listen to.
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.940]   So I suspect that feeds your overconfidence.
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.780]   I don't know if that was a very good answer.
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:56.820]   Maybe you can do better.
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:01.580]   Well, I mean, just sort of as a follow-on note,
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:04.020]   I mean, you don't have to look far.
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:07.580]   I mean, just look at Wall Street bets.
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:11.060]   You know, to me, that's--
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:14.380]   I mean, I was a teenage boy once.
[00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:19.420]   At least half the room was teenage boys once.
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:23.740]   Investing should not be a game of chicken.
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:29.020]   But Wall Street bets is like an electronic game of chicken
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:32.140]   where a bunch of teenage boys are trying
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:38.300]   to drive their cars as fast as possible down an unlit highway
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.560]   at 2 in the morning.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:44.820]   So they can get bragging rights and maybe get killed.
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:50.140]   So I think technology, in general,
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:55.980]   has given investors more tools and capabilities
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.580]   than they've ever had.
[00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:00.660]   And it's arguably the best time in human history
[00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:04.140]   to be an investor because the playing field has
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:07.980]   been so radically leveled by technology.
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:10.540]   But technology is a tool.
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:17.180]   And you can use nuclear energy to cure cancer.
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:20.820]   And you can use it to cause cancer.
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:24.180]   You know, you can pick up a hammer and build a house.
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:26.940]   Or you can knock a house down with a hammer.
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:31.260]   And you know, the internet and social media work the same way.
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:34.860]   If you have good instincts and good judgment,
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:36.740]   you can use them to your advantage.
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:39.620]   And if you don't, you can destroy yourself.
[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:41.820]   So maybe that helps.
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:46.900]   Hi, good morning.
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:51.020]   Bill, you had mentioned in terms of retirement
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.960]   to be dependent on your secure assets
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.420]   versus the insecure assets.
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:59.860]   So in essence, you can talk about secure assets
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:03.820]   for those who haven't followed for a while.
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:08.820]   But the real issue here is how do you
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:11.940]   invest in which secure assets in order
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:18.340]   to minimize your taxes and the implication of Irma
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:20.180]   at the end of the day here?
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:23.240]   And so I'd like to really understand
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:25.980]   because I think at the end of the day,
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.960]   no matter what model you're trying to go through,
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:34.040]   you're still being hit with either Irma or taxes.
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:38.080]   And even before retirement, doing Roth conversions
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:41.480]   to be able to minimize the taxes on your social security
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:45.960]   and so forth, it's still an unending
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:52.960]   trying to keep as much money as you can when you retire.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.800]   Thank you.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.000]   I'm philosophical.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.560]   And this may sound like a--
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.960]   I hope this doesn't come across as insensitive.
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:05.000]   But if your biggest problem in retirement is your Irmas,
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.920]   you don't have that big of a problem.
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:11.280]   You're in the upper 2% or 3%.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:15.480]   Every rare now and then, I'll hear
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:19.920]   someone complain that their required minimum distributions
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:23.000]   put them in the top Irma bracket.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.800]   Well, think about that.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:28.560]   That means that you're getting $300,000 or $400,000 a year
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:33.440]   in RMDs, which means you've got close to an eight-figure
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:35.680]   portfolio.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.780]   I mean, I don't mean to be vicious or sound mean,
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:41.780]   but let's get out the world's smallest violin, all right?
[00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:48.520]   I mean, I didn't--
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.720]   and again, this maybe sounds cruel,
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:54.960]   but I didn't serve in the military or serve in combat.
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.760]   I didn't even serve in the Peace Corps.
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:00.000]   So I figure that the most patriotic thing
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.560]   I can do for this marvelous country
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:03.640]   is pay my taxes and not complain about it.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:11.400]   But the question is-- it's a more serious question, which
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.320]   is, how do you invest your risky assets
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.240]   and how do you invest your riskless assets?
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.280]   And I have to--
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.400]   I was going to try not to talk about this
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.240]   and maybe leave this for the next panel.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.240]   But it's hard not to observe that I can--
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:26.600]   that all of us who are retiring right now
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:30.680]   and don't have a lot of income, salary coming in,
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:34.400]   can defease our future living expenses,
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.200]   our real living expenses, 30 years into the future
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:42.560]   by buying a TIPS ladder that will yield close to 2%.
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.600]   And that's the first time that's been true for a long while.
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:49.120]   So we have a stock market which is still very highly priced,
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.400]   even at current levels.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.720]   And you can convert that into a stream
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:58.360]   of real, very safe assets that will let you sleep at night
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.680]   and let you laugh when the rest of your portfolio
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:01.520]   goes down 25%.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:06.680]   Hi.
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.720]   Aaron Harris, very good to meet you both.
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:12.840]   Jason, I really enjoy reading your column every week.
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:15.360]   I look forward to it on Saturday mornings.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:17.160]   And I always wonder, I think, well,
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.760]   this is such a wonderful column.
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:20.680]   It's so balanced.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.960]   It has such a great perspective.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.600]   How can-- and then you turn the page
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:29.640]   and you see ads for mutual funds and for these large hedge
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:30.800]   funds.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:34.680]   And maybe this goes back to the question about the integrity.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.920]   I'm glad you answered that because you
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.480]   write with such integrity.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.600]   Has there ever been a situation where maybe the Wall Street
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:45.280]   Journal has said, maybe don't talk about this topic,
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:49.120]   or can you give a little bit more exposure to this topic?
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:53.000]   And how do you balance what you know
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   is important to write with maybe what
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:01.240]   the editors of the Wall Street Journal want you to convey?
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.080]   Thank you.
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.880]   You need to get out more, but thank you.
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:16.440]   So I can report truthfully that I don't
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.160]   face those kinds of pressures.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:21.920]   I mean, nobody tells me what to write.
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:25.280]   Frankly, I wish they did a little more
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.760]   because coming up with 50 ideas every year
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:30.920]   is no trivial task.
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:38.160]   I just-- I mean, I've been at the journal for 14 years.
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:43.560]   And I've never written anything that they wouldn't publish,
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:47.280]   and I've never written anything that I was like ordered
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.640]   to write against my wishes.
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:51.120]   You know, a few times a year, I do
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.920]   get suggestions from the editors,
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.800]   but they tend to be pretty good.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:44:00.680]   And when they're not, I usually find a diplomatic way
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:04.560]   of saying maybe somebody else could write about that.
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:12.600]   So the ownership may tell our editorial page what to say,
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:17.560]   but nobody tells us in the newsroom what to say.
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:19.720]   We have complete independence.
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:22.120]   I and all my colleagues, actually, so.
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:28.480]   Yesterday afternoon, one of the speakers
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.280]   mentioned that it is extremely difficult to buy stocks
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.680]   during a market that is going down like at present.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.960]   Perhaps my neurons are wired the wrong way,
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:42.400]   but that's a market that attracts me very keenly.
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.960]   So I'm somebody roughly about five years, seven years out
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.360]   from retirement.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:51.960]   And on January 1 this year, I had probably a 60/40 stocks
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.480]   to bonds ratios.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:57.640]   And right now, it has changed to around 68/32.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:01.640]   And my plan is to go down up to 30/70
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:04.480]   by the end of the year if the stock market continues
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:05.640]   to go down.
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:09.280]   Now, is that a reasonable option, bad option,
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.280]   for which I should get a rap on my knuckles?
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:16.960]   Or would I be expelled from this place here?
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.160]   Well, there's a parameter that doesn't
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:23.240]   get talked about enough when that question gets
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:25.160]   asked, which is, what is your burn rate going
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:27.480]   to be in retirement?
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:30.160]   And the answer to that-- so the way
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.320]   you would answer the question is,
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:37.520]   if your burn rate in retirement is 2% or 3%,
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.240]   it really doesn't matter what your portfolio looks like.
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:45.800]   You're fine, short of some sort of cataclysm.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:50.680]   If your burn rate is going to be 4% or 5% or 6%,
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.160]   then how many more years are you working?
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:56.600]   You better work more years if it's going to be that high.
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.640]   And if your burn rate in retirement
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:04.880]   is going to be higher than 6% or 7%,
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.000]   you better hope that a couple of your kids
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.560]   are fairly well-situated.
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:17.240]   And by the way, I mean, people are wired differently.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.920]   There are people who-- I mean, I've
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:25.840]   met men who've flown aircraft in combat who threw up
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:29.920]   when their portfolios lost 5%.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.760]   And on the other hand, I know people
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:38.440]   who can bear the kinds of 2008, 2009 losses with equanimity,
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:39.640]   and they sleep very well.
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:42.000]   So it takes all types.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.920]   I think the median beta tolerance--
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:49.840]   that is the median, the maximum, the typical stock exposure
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.520]   of the median person is somewhere around 50-50.
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:55.880]   I mean, there's a reason why that's roughly what
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:57.360]   the market portfolio looks like.
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:02.840]   Thanks, as always, for sharing your insights.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.720]   Given the vast amount that you've
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:09.840]   studied and written about, what still surprises you?
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.480]   Oh, boy.
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:14.840]   Jason, I'll let you answer that, and then I'll think about it.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:18.920]   I was going to say the same thing to you, Bill.
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:21.240]   Well, what still surprises me?
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:29.920]   I guess what surprises me is the riddle
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.880]   that I've been trying to answer for most of my career, which
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:39.120]   is why are smart people so stupid about money?
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:43.240]   And we see it at every level.
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:46.480]   We see it among individual investors, none of those
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:49.240]   in this room, of course.
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:52.120]   We see it among professional investors.
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:55.360]   We see professional investors do absolutely
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:48:04.040]   idiotic, ridiculous, moronic, cretinous, well,
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:09.120]   very foolish things all the time, constantly.
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:13.680]   And I don't think that'll ever stop surprising me,
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:20.200]   because there seems to be an endless number of ways
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:23.760]   that smart people can be stupid with money.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:26.720]   I used to think there were only a couple dozen ways,
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:32.000]   and I'm up to a few hundred, and there may be thousands.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:39.720]   Yeah, I mean, almost nothing surprises me, because--
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:42.640]   like Jason-- and that's why we both had such a hard time
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:45.400]   answering this, is we both know enough financial history
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:48.640]   to know that the wellspring of human stupidity and gullibility
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:51.240]   is bottomless.
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:56.480]   And so I'm really not surprised by anything.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.960]   If I'm surprised by anything, it's
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.120]   because I haven't learned enough financial history,
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.600]   or at least I forgot the parts I should have remembered.
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.600]   And the one thing that did surprise me,
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:09.880]   and very unpleasantly, was during the '08-'09 crisis.
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:15.800]   I knew that stocks could lose 50%, sometimes even 90%
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.840]   of their value, or occasionally in the course of history,
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:21.080]   100% of their value if you're in the wrong country
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:23.080]   at the wrong time.
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:26.920]   But what surprised me, and shouldn't have surprised me,
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.040]   was--
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:35.120]   and shocked me-- was how badly non-treasury fixed income
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:35.920]   securities did.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:40.440]   Even TIPS got hammered because of liquidity problems.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:43.880]   But corporates, municipals got hammered as well.
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:46.440]   And I was surprised and shocked by that.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:48.680]   And the only reason I was surprised and shocked by that
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:50.960]   is I hadn't internalized enough historical data.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.920]   I should have known better.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.600]   And I may be shocked and surprised by something
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:58.920]   in the future as well.
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:02.160]   There may be a failure mode I hadn't considered.
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:06.080]   But I'll be surprised when that happens too.
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:08.560]   I have a simple question.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:11.800]   What would be your definition of financial wellness
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.760]   beyond the absence of poverty?
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:26.200]   Jason, I'm going to let you [INAUDIBLE]
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:34.760]   Well, I guess I have to invoke a line from Benjamin Graham.
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:38.120]   In his autobiography, he said he thought
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:42.840]   that happiness meant living well within your means.
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:50.960]   And I love that line because the word "well" is ambiguous.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:57.000]   Did he mean living well within your means?
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:03.280]   Or did he mean living well within your means?
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.680]   And unfortunately, we can't ask him.
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:09.040]   He died in 1976.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:14.240]   My hunch, because Graham was an incredibly sophisticated
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:18.840]   writer, I think he meant both.
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:24.600]   And I think that's a pretty good definition, actually.
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:26.800]   And on the fly, that's the best I can do.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.400]   Here, Bill.
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:29.840]   No, you did very well.
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:34.000]   I mean, that phrase reminds you of the famous Wintruss book,
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.720]   Eats, Shoots, and Leaves.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:39.720]   And it, of course, gets to another title
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:43.680]   of one of Jack's more famous books, which
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:52.200]   was named in the story of Joe Heller and Slaughterhouse Five.
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.440]   Who am I thinking of?
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:54.720]   Yeah, Kurt Vonnegut.
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:59.880]   And Vonnegut-- they're at a fancy Long Island party.
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:02.440]   And Vonnegut looks at Heller and says,
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:05.040]   that guy over there who's giving the party,
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:07.200]   he makes more money in one month than we'll
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:09.280]   make in our entire lives.
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:11.200]   And Heller looks at him and says, yeah, Kurt,
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:12.880]   you know, he's got one thing--
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.400]   we've got one thing he will never have.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:18.400]   And that is enough.
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.520]   So with--
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.160]   --enough, yeah, exactly.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:28.760]   So I think-- we might have time for just one more question.
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:31.280]   I don't know how quick it'll be, but you both
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:34.800]   mentioned the importance of identifying your mistakes.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.160]   And you both gave examples of things
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:41.240]   that were obvious mistakes because they turned out poorly.
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:43.080]   How do you identify mistakes that
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.920]   have turned out extremely well and get yourself out of them?
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:47.560]   Or do you have advice on that?
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:49.320]   Because I think all of us also probably
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:53.560]   have an investment or two that has done absurdly well
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:55.880]   and shouldn't have and is incredibly
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:57.280]   painful to get rid of.
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:59.360]   I mean, how do you know when you've
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:01.120]   played Russian roulette without knowing it
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.080]   and you got the empty chamber?
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:06.560]   And I guess you--
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:08.640]   I'm trying to remember who--
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:11.600]   I think it was Bismarck who said that I never
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:13.080]   learn from my mistakes.
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:15.360]   I learn from other people's mistakes.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:17.520]   And that's probably the best way to do it.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:20.200]   Yeah, I mean, I think--
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:23.400]   I mean, the best way to frame a decision like that
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:29.960]   is if I were making the decision whether or not
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:33.680]   to buy this investment today, would I buy it?
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:38.800]   And if the answer is no, then you should probably sell it.
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:46.000]   Wall Street has the famous continuum in recommendations
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.960]   like buy, sell, or buy, hold, or sell, right?
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:52.040]   And they use all kinds of lingo for it,
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:54.280]   like accumulate and all that stuff.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:58.800]   But the thing is, it's bogus.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:05.000]   I mean, because every investment is either a buy or a sell.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.400]   It's not a hold.
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:08.160]   I mean, if you wouldn't want to buy more,
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:10.880]   then you shouldn't be holding it, right?
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:14.140]   So that's the way I would frame the question.
[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:18.280]   And maybe that would help you make an exit.
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:22.400]   So I think that's--
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.080]   we're done.
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:27.200]   And I thank all of you for your questions.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:37.200]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
