[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840]   - Breaking news, Google is reportedly considering
[00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.280]   making an offer to acquire HubSpot.
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.440]   - When a big company makes a big acquisition offer
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.720]   like this, it's usually a negative signal
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.680]   about organic growth.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.920]   Meaning, if I'm a Google shareholder,
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.720]   I should look at this and I should say,
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.680]   why do you need to make this acquisition?
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.700]   Is there an indication in this bid
[00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.600]   that there is some advertising revenue leakage going on?
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.840]   And then I should go spend time trying to understand that.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.480]   I think there's a really important question there.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.880]   - If you're losing share,
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.280]   you're not gonna be losing it to Bing.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.800]   You're losing it to some form of AI,
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.200]   which is why, again, it's a bit of a head-scratcher.
