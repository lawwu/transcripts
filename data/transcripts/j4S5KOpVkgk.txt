[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.080]   - This week, John Piper's new book launched.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.160]   It's titled Living in the Light, Money, Sex, and Power.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.960]   It's a nice little hardcover available now on Amazon
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.620]   and downloadable free of charge at DesiringGod.org.
[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.760]   Pastor John, one thing that stands out in the book
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.240]   and you make it on this podcast all the time
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.560]   is that God's commands against the sinful use
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.700]   of money, sex, and power are not merely
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.080]   just bare prohibitions.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.860]   They are really diagnostic tests of our own hearts.
[00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.480]   In the book, you write this, quote,
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.560]   "Power, money, and sex are all God-given means
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.380]   "of showing what you value," end quote.
[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.940]   These are phenomena that diagnose
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.040]   the vibrancy of our hearts.
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.920]   Explain this, and if you're right,
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.720]   then it has pretty serious implications
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.420]   for Christians who attempt to see how much sin
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.160]   they can get away with in their lives.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.820]   Unpack this reality for us.
[00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.160]   - Right, yes, that is what I say in the book
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.940]   and what I try to unpack.
[00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.840]   Money, sex, and power are God-given ways
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.680]   of displaying God's supreme worth in our lives.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.360]   Or they can display the supreme worth
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.300]   of something other than God
[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.200]   and prove that we are idolaters.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.240]   The way you think and feel and act
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.460]   about money and sex and power
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.460]   puts your heart's treasure on display,
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.740]   either God or something he made.
[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.500]   And one of the reasons for this
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.980]   is simply what money and sex and power are.
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.220]   So this is where definitions work, again, so important.
[00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.020]   Let me give you three definitions,
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.020]   one for each of them, and you'll see immediately
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.300]   why it is, given the definition,
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.540]   that they are God-given means of putting on display
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.260]   the supremacy of what we value.
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.740]   So what is power?
[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.740]   Power is the capacity to pursue what you value.
[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.060]   Money, what is that?
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.580]   Money is a cultural symbol.
[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.020]   This green piece of paper, this metal coin,
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.020]   money is a cultural symbol that can be exchanged
[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.700]   in pursuit of what you value.
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.260]   And what is sex?
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.300]   Sex is one of those values,
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.300]   one of those pleasures that people really value.
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.900]   So power and money and sex are all God-given ways,
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.140]   God-given means of showing what we value.
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.700]   They are, like all other created reality in the universe,
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.660]   given by God as means of worship.
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.660]   Everybody should think that way.
[00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.100]   My money is a means of worship,
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.380]   my power is a means of worship,
[00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.460]   my sex is a means of worship.
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.500]   That is a means of magnifying
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.740]   what is of supreme worth to us.
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.620]   That's what power is for and money is for and sex is for,
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.620]   to demonstrate, magnify what is of supreme worth to us.
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.660]   All your power, all your money, all your sexuality,
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.660]   are God's gifts for putting on display His supreme worth.
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.500]   Now, how do we do that?
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.980]   There are two ways that we do it,
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.540]   at least two ways that we make money, sex, and power
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.700]   become a display of God's truth and beauty and worth.
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.700]   One is by preferring God's truth and beauty and worth
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:48.060]   over sinful uses of money, sex, and power.
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.020]   So we prefer God, and when you prefer something,
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.020]   you show that it's preferable,
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.140]   it's more beautiful, more true, more glorious.
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.740]   And the second way, we pursue God's truth and beauty
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.300]   and worth in the gift of money, sex, and power,
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.980]   in the righteous use of money, sex, and power.
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.460]   In other words, one way of magnifying Christ
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.740]   with money, sex, and power is how we deal with the dangers,
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.020]   that was number one, and the other one is
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.100]   how we deal with their potentials, that's number two.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.660]   Just a word about each of those, the dangers to be avoided.
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.260]   If sexual desires try to drag us
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.820]   into a soul-destroying direction,
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.360]   a soul-destroying misuse of our sexuality,
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.940]   we show the superior worth of Christ
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.540]   by preferring His way to that way.
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.540]   God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.460]   in Him rather than in sexual sin.
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.980]   That's the way we magnify His worth,
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.660]   by preferring Him and His way over the abuses of sex.
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.940]   Or take money, if the love of money
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.480]   and the material things that money can buy,
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.140]   or the privileges it can attain,
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.040]   lure us into sinful covetousness,
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.040]   then we show the superior worth and beauty of God
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.040]   by putting that covetousness to death
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.340]   with the superior pleasures of the promises of God.
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.000]   That's the way Hebrews 13, five and six argue.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.760]   You don't need to love money.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.440]   I have said I'll be with you, I'll never forsake you.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.000]   It's exactly the way the Bible thinks.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.060]   And thirdly, power.
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.480]   If the lure of power makes us feel desirous
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.480]   of exalting ourselves and showing our superiority
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.320]   and putting other people down,
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.920]   the truth and beauty and worth of God are displayed
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.200]   if we prefer the humility of Christ
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.640]   over that self-exaltation and the arrogance
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.640]   that the world is constantly throwing at us is admirable.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.020]   So that's the way we display the superior worth of God
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.640]   above the pleasures of money, sex, and power.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.520]   We prefer God, we prefer God and His fellowship
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.280]   and His way over any of those sinful pleasures
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.240]   that money, sex, and power might offer.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.720]   And the other way, and I hope this would be
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.720]   an unexpected helpful contribution that the book makes,
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.320]   a little different maybe than some other approaches.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.320]   The other way is that we display the worth of God
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.840]   by using money and sex and power
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.520]   the way God first designed for them to be used.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.680]   It's easy to see, for example,
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.680]   how power can be a selfie-facing way
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.020]   of serving the cause of justice
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.380]   and mercy for the sake of others.
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.920]   Great good can be done by people
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.040]   who have much power or influence,
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.800]   if, it's a big if, they don't use the power
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.180]   to exalt themselves, but use the power
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.680]   to meet the needs of others and get out of the way
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.440]   and treat others better than they deserve.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.360]   We wanna see Christ exalted in the gospel
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.280]   and people with power and influence can be a great help
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:43.280]   if they see the glory of God in the expenditure
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.200]   of their energy and their power.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.400]   Or take money, it's easy to see how money can be used
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.320]   to show that we value God and His way and His kingdom
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.900]   more than we value the private pleasures
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.840]   that money can buy.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.200]   We can pour our resources into gospel causes
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:09.040]   and we can choose to live a more simple wartime lifestyle
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.040]   so that we can maximize the advancement
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.800]   of God's saving purposes in the world.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.680]   And that proactive use of money for Christ
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.360]   and His purposes is a wonderful way
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.120]   of putting His value on display.
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.960]   People will see how you use your money
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.840]   and they'll know what you really value.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.880]   Christ and His purposes, not just a bigger house,
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.400]   a bigger car, a bigger boat,
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.800]   and another set of clothes, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.240]   Now, with regard to sexuality,
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.040]   it may be a little more difficult to see how this works,
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:48.640]   how you positively glorify God
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.760]   in the pursuit of your sexuality.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:56.720]   For single Christians, this will involve celebrating
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.560]   the goodness of human sexuality while expressing it
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.560]   only in the ways that God's Word has promised to bless.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.720]   Manhood and womanhood don't go out of existence
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.400]   just because we're not married.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.400]   They're there.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.640]   And there are dynamics in the relationship
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.440]   between men and women, even before marriage,
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:23.200]   which put Christ on display positively.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.080]   And then in marriage, it's even more pointed.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.920]   One simple example would be that in the sexual union,
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.080]   in the actual act of sexual relations,
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.520]   both husband and wife, driven by the beauties of Christ,
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.920]   can seek each other's pleasure above their own
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.120]   and seek their own in the pleasure of the other
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:51.080]   so that both are displaying the beauties of Christ,
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.200]   even in the way they pursue their own sexual pleasures
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.000]   in the pleasures of another.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.120]   And of course, it almost goes without saying,
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.200]   but perhaps not, that celebrating the covenant commitment
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.880]   of sexual faithfulness in marriage
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.400]   is a beautiful testimony to the goodness of God
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.800]   to a watching world.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.080]   And you mentioned, Tony, at the end of your question,
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.120]   if I remember right, this has pretty serious implications
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.720]   for Christians who attempt to see how much sin
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.800]   they can get away with.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.480]   Well, that's true.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.040]   I call this minimalist Christianity,
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.000]   but I think it's not really Christianity.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.520]   And the reason I say that is because Jesus defined
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.800]   his disciples not as those who did the minimum,
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.800]   but those who loved him more than anything.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.040]   He said in Matthew 10, 37,
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.240]   "Whoever loves father or mother more than me
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.240]   is not worthy of me.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.880]   Whoever loves son or daughter more than me
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.520]   is not worthy of me.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.040]   And if it's true for mothers and fathers and sons
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.640]   and daughters, good grief,
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.720]   surely it's true for money and sex and power.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.640]   Whoever loves money, whoever loves sex,
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.520]   whoever loves power more than me isn't worthy of me."
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.800]   You can't even be a Christian.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.680]   It's not like there's this minimalist thing,
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.680]   everybody squeaks by it the last day.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.320]   You can't even be a Christian
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.320]   if Jesus is not your greatest treasure.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.840]   So yes, the stakes are very high.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.520]   Money, sex, and power are God-given ways
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.400]   of showing where our heart is.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.360]   - Absolutely brilliant.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.760]   Absolutely frightening, but absolutely true.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.840]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that survey.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.560]   The new book we are talking about today
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.920]   is titled "Living in the Light, Money, Sex, and Power."
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.520]   It's a nice little hardcover available now
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.360]   on Amazon and downloadable free of charge
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.400]   at DesiringGod.org.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.600]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.480]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.360]   with author and longtime pastor, John Piper.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.520]   We'll be back tomorrow.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:12.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
