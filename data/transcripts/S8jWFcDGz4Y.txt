[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.280]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.240]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.160]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.720]   Today, my guest is Dr. Mary Helen Imordino-Yang.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.280]   Dr. Imordino-Yang is a professor of education,
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.060]   psychology, and neuroscience
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.640]   at the University of Southern California.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.200]   Her laboratory focuses on emotions
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.360]   and the role of emotions in learning,
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.900]   as well as how social interactions impact how we learn.
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.040]   Today's discussion is one
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.460]   that I found absolutely fascinating
[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.440]   because it will reveal to you, in fact, to all of us,
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.600]   how our temperament, that is our emotionality,
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.600]   combined with our home environment
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.320]   and the school environments that we were raised in
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.040]   shape what we know about the world
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.360]   and our concepts of self.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.220]   In thinking about that,
[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.640]   we also discuss the education system
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.060]   and how different aspects of rules
[00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.560]   and how we are told to behave
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.500]   and what actually constitutes good behavior or bad behavior
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.480]   shape how we learn information
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.780]   and develop a sense of meaning in life.
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.400]   If any of that sounds abstract,
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.240]   I promise you that today's discussion
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.860]   is incredibly practical.
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.860]   You will learn, for instance,
[00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.800]   how different styles of learning
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.520]   are going to favor different people
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.760]   from children into adulthood
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.960]   and how we ought to think about learning
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.440]   in terms of our emotional systems being our guide
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.920]   for what we learn and the information that we retain
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.600]   and how we apply that information throughout life.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.040]   For those of you that are parents
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.640]   or who are thinking of becoming parents
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.200]   or who were once children,
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.880]   so I believe that encompasses everybody out there,
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.340]   today's discussion will arm you
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.280]   with an intellectual understanding
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.560]   of psychology and neuroscience as it relates to learning,
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.240]   but also practical tools that you can apply
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.800]   in order to be able to learn more effectively.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.840]   What I like so much about Dr. Imordino-Yang's research
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.840]   and the discussion today is that she frames up beautifully
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.320]   how those who best learn from traditional forms
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.360]   of classroom learning,
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.880]   as well as those who learn from non-traditional forms
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.460]   of learning either in or out of the classroom
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.700]   can best use that understanding of self
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.880]   in order to learn in the way that is best for them.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.400]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.200]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.160]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.040]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.000]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.320]   to the general public.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.380]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.060]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.080]   Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.720]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.480]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.820]   I've talked many times before on this podcast
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.080]   about the fact that sleep is the foundation
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.460]   of mental health, physical health,
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.940]   and performance of all kinds.
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.480]   One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.660]   is the temperature of your sleeping environment,
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.900]   and that's because your core body temperature
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.180]   actually has to drop by about one to three degrees
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.380]   in order for you to get into and stay deeply asleep.
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.660]   And conversely, your core body temperature
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.580]   increases by about one to three degrees
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.240]   in order for you to wake up and feel refreshed.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.220]   With Eight Sleep, you can control the temperature
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.320]   of your sleeping environment very easily
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.140]   because of the way that the mattress cover
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.180]   communicates with an app where you can dial in
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.740]   the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.300]   at the beginning, middle, and end of your night
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.260]   as you arrive toward morning.
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.800]   Sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.080]   has greatly enhanced the quality of my sleep.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.440]   I know that because it also includes a sleep tracker,
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.780]   which will tell you how much slow wave sleep
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.340]   and rapid eye movement sleep you're getting,
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.800]   and it gives you a sleep score.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.060]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.060]   go to eightsleep.com/huberman and get up to $150 off.
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.920]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.200]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.600]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.680]   Today's episode is also brought to us by HVMN Keytone IQ.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.400]   Keytone IQ is a ketone supplement
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.460]   that increases blood ketones.
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.800]   I know most people are familiar with,
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.740]   or at least have heard of the so-called ketogenic diet.
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.040]   It's used for weight loss, it's used to control epilepsy,
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.560]   it's used for mental health reasons.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.640]   However, most people, including myself,
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.380]   do not follow a ketogenic diet.
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.580]   Nonetheless, increasing your blood ketones
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.680]   can improve the function of your brain
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.160]   and the function of your body.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.820]   And that's because ketones are preferred use of fuel
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.360]   for the brain and body.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.240]   So even though I follow an omnivore diet,
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.560]   that is I'm not in the ketogenic state,
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.040]   I use ketone IQ to increase my blood ketones
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.360]   prior to doing preparation for podcasts,
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.360]   or writing grants, or doing research,
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.700]   as well as prior to workouts,
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.060]   especially if I want to work out fasted,
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.160]   I'll take some ketone IQ to increase my blood ketones,
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.080]   which gives me a lot of energy during workouts
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.080]   or during bouts of cognitive work,
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.520]   even if I haven't eaten in the preceding hours.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.360]   It really increases my focus and my energy levels.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.920]   If you'd like to try ketone IQ,
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.320]   you can go to hvmn.com/huberman to save 20% off.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.320]   Again, that's hvmn.com/huberman to save 20%.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.000]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.140]   Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.080]   that are the absolute highest quality.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.160]   The company was founded by two all-American swimmers
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.760]   from Stanford, and everything about Roka eyeglasses
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.720]   and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.540]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology,
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.120]   the visual system, and I can tell you
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.600]   that your visual system has to contend
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.580]   with an enormous number of different challenges
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.600]   in order for you to be able to see clearly.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.240]   Roka understands those challenges
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.000]   and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses accordingly
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.320]   so that you always see with perfect clarity.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.540]   Their eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.640]   for sports performance, and as a consequence,
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.560]   they are very lightweight, which is great.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.100]   They also won't slip off your face if you get sweaty.
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.680]   However, even though they were designed
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.760]   for sports performance, they now also include
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.480]   a lot of styles that are designed to be worn to work,
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.800]   out to dinner, essentially recreationally,
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.220]   so that you could wear anywhere.
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.780]   If you'd like to try Roka eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.180]   go to Roka, that's R-O-K-A, .com,
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.300]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your order.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.940]   Again, that's Roka, R-O-K-A, .com,
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.260]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.620]   And now for my discussion
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.140]   with Dr. Mary Helen Immordino Yang.
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.500]   Dr. Immordino Yang.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.340]   - Good to be here.
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.480]   - Great to have you.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.260]   I'd like to start off talking about something
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.720]   that to me seems a little bit high level,
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.780]   but I think is the perfect jumping off point.
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.620]   I've heard you talk before about inspiration and awe.
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.820]   And as somebody who's interested in the brain,
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.780]   and as somebody who's interested in the role of emotions
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.780]   and learning and life experience,
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.700]   inspiration and awe seem to me
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.500]   rather high level emotional experiences
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.040]   compared to say fear or happiness.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.180]   And yet inspiration and awe just seem so fundamental
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.220]   to how we learn and navigate life.
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.500]   And before we started recording,
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.280]   we were talking about David Goggins of all people,
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.960]   and we'll get back to that.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.980]   But if you could just share with us,
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.980]   what is the role of inspiration and awe and story
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:59.060]   in how we learn and experience life starting at a young age?
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.580]   And then maybe we can transition to older ages.
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.580]   - Yeah, I mean, I think what you've noticed
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.380]   is actually fundamental to the conundrum of being a human
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.600]   is that our most high level complex brain states,
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.600]   mind states are also fundamentally hooking themselves
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.260]   into the most basic biological machinery
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.220]   that literally we share with alligators
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.540]   that keeps us alive.
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.540]   And that is both the power and the potential
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.220]   of being a human and the danger of it.
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.940]   So our beliefs, our experiences,
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.100]   our interpretations of the meaning of things,
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.860]   which that's where the story comes in,
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.880]   the stories that we conjure about,
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.420]   collectively with other people,
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.720]   culturally in spaces inside our own selves also,
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.940]   those stories become kind of the through line
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.700]   that organizes the way in which we construct
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.220]   our own experience, consciousness even, I would say.
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:02.220]   So when we hook into those very basic survival systems
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.300]   by recruiting them into these narratives
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.660]   about the nature of reality,
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.500]   the power of the meaning we make,
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.900]   what happens is we get this amazingly both fundamental
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:19.680]   and high level state simultaneously where we feel expansive,
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.680]   we feel like it's all so incredibly beautiful.
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:30.020]   And we are, I would argue, actually ramping into
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.460]   or catching into the very basic survival mechanisms
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.940]   that make us conscious, that make us alive.
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.060]   And that's, in essence, the power of being a human.
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:41.660]   That's the power of our intelligence
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.240]   at this late stage in our evolution.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.100]   - So when I was a kid, I loved stories of all kinds.
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.620]   I think like most kids.
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.680]   I loved my Curious George books.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.380]   I'm told I liked the Babar books,
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.700]   but then quickly didn't like the Babar books.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.540]   I liked the book, "Where the Red Fern Grows."
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.860]   I liked books and stories about,
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.380]   it generally was boys for me, for whatever reason,
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:12.220]   that had some idea in mind or some ongoing challenge.
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.940]   And that played out over time
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.260]   and the character evolves across the story.
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.660]   And of course, many, many, many excellent stories
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:20.900]   have all those features.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.220]   I can recall specific passages in those books to this day
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.520]   that made me feel something in my body.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.920]   I actually am very familiar with the sensation
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.780]   of having chills go up my spine as opposed to down my spine.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.040]   Early on, I realized, oh, there's sort of a difference.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.000]   Sometimes it travels up my spine, sometimes not.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.120]   I still haven't distinguished what that orients me to
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:49.080]   or away from, but it's a very salient memory
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.060]   and experience for me to this day.
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.400]   So much so that as I'm describing the book,
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.160]   "Where the Red Fern Grows" right now,
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160]   I can kind of feel it starting.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.580]   I've heard you say before, and I love this quote,
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.700]   and I want to make sure that you get attribution for this,
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.940]   not me, that we basically have a brain to control our body.
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:14.100]   What is the role of the brain in controlling the body?
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.320]   And do you think that there are an infinite number of ways
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.460]   in which our brain does that?
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.480]   Or are we really talking about a language
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.880]   between brain and body of, you know,
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.920]   tingles on the back of our neck that go up,
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.700]   tingles on the back of our neck that go down,
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.920]   stomach feeling kind of tight and making us cringe away
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.880]   or kind of warm and wanting to approach?
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.320]   In other words, do you think that the conversation
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.940]   between the brain and body is primitive, sophisticated?
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.960]   How nuanced is it?
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.820]   Because language is very nuanced.
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.120]   We could probably come up with 50 words just in English
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.040]   for the state of being happy.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.680]   But the feeling of being happy,
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.040]   I experience along a continuum
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.140]   of a little bit happy to elated,
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.480]   but it's kind of one thing, really.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.480]   So if you would, could you comment on this notion
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.180]   of the brain being the organ that's responsible
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.000]   for controlling the body and what that dialogue is like,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.440]   what the syllables and consonants of it are like,
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.100]   perhaps not at the level of biology,
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.900]   but at the level of psychology
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.680]   and how we subjectively experience that.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.200]   - Sure, so the first thing I'll say
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.440]   is that I learned that idea
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.780]   from working with Antonio Damasio.
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:28.360]   So he was my postdoctoral mentor and he taught me first
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.560]   that this notion that it's the feeling of the body,
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.100]   it's an organism's ability to represent or map
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.360]   the state of the interior and exterior of the body
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.320]   that becomes the substrate for consciousness
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.440]   and for the mind.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.800]   So I would just wanna give him credit
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.440]   because I didn't think of that first,
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.080]   but the work that I've been doing
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.760]   is an elaboration of that.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.120]   It's basically addressing exactly the question
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.660]   that you're asking, which is how is it
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:03.660]   that we construct a narrative, construct a conscious feeling,
[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.800]   which that word I take from Antonio and Hannah, right,
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.600]   Damasio, how is it that we construct a feeling
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.800]   and sort of narratize that feeling,
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.920]   elaborate that feeling into something
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.260]   that feels like a narrative, that feels like a belief state
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.800]   or an emotion state or an experience,
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.080]   I mean that in a very verb-like way.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.520]   And what is the role of embodiment in that?
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.840]   What is the role of the brain in that?
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.640]   And what also is the role of the culture
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.800]   and the cultural context and other people in that?
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.200]   Because what we're really learning
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.720]   across the sciences right now
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.280]   is just how incredibly social
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.320]   and interdependent our species is.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.520]   I mean, our biology is inherently a social one.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.780]   We are directly dependent on other people
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.560]   for the formulation of our own sense of self.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.200]   And we interact with one another
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.880]   and construct and co-construct a sense of self
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.040]   and a sense of meaning via those cultural spaces
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.720]   and those sort of nuanced ways of accommodating each other
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.440]   mentally and physically that lead to the feeling of us.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.140]   So back to your original question,
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.720]   there's a lot we don't know there,
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.640]   but I think what's very clear
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.400]   is that the kind of background sense of the body,
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.000]   the mapping and the regulation of the body
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   is a basic substrate, a kind of trampoline for the mind.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.400]   And so we are managing our survival.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.080]   We now have lots of evidence
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.960]   from across many kinds of science
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.360]   about the interdependence of our stress
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.240]   and social relationships and our immunity
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.480]   and our ability to digest food.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:51.000]   And it's even now very clear that it's not even just us.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.520]   There's a whole microbiome
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.280]   and all kinds of other organisms
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.500]   that are assisting us in that
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.960]   and that are collaborating with us in that.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.240]   And then the brain is a specialized organ of the body.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.800]   In fact, it's not a separate thing.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.760]   It's an outgrowth or an elaboration of that process.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.140]   It's a specialization of that process,
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.320]   a localization of it
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.400]   in a way that provides enough processing power
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:22.140]   to be able to really construct all kinds of feelings
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.720]   and mental states and beliefs and imaginings
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:32.780]   out of basically just the feeling of being here.
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:36.720]   And then the amazing part is that our brain
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.000]   is also imposing those back down onto our body.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.500]   So the way in which our body reacts
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:46.240]   and is modulated in response to mental states
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.680]   is also very real.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:52.680]   So we have a kind of like a dynamic conversation happening
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:57.340]   that's happening in very raw and direct ways,
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.340]   neurochemically and others,
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:03.160]   and also in broader, longer term, slower fluctuating patterns
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.440]   around other kinds of hormonal changes and things like that.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.680]   So along multiple timescales simultaneously,
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.720]   we have a kind of whole, right?
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.280]   A humanistic whole of brain and body and mind
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.160]   that are kind of co-conjuring one another in real time.
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.000]   And that leads to all kinds of dynamic possibility spaces
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.080]   for how we are and how we feel as we grow through time.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.760]   And I think as humans, the legacy of our intelligence
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.260]   is to tap into those possibility spaces
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:38.880]   and start to construct them into meaningful sort of chains
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.460]   of ideas, chains of experiences over time that we call story.
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.480]   And that I think is what you were tapping into
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.320]   as a little boy.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.680]   You were hungry for fodder for a kind of structure
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:53.400]   for those feelings that you could start to help them evolve
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.080]   from one into the other and chain them together
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.740]   in ways that produce meaning.
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:02.760]   - Yeah, I'm fascinated by the idea that early in life,
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.560]   we experience some interaction with the world.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.760]   It could be with other people,
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.620]   it could be with an object in the world,
[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.040]   and it makes us feel something powerful.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:12.880]   - Yeah.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.480]   - And that lays a template of recognition,
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.840]   meaning that later in life and perhaps throughout life,
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.560]   we're always consciously or subconsciously going back
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:27.560]   to trying to experience that same kind of awe or inspiration.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:33.440]   Because again, the circumstances almost certainly vary
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.140]   from being a five-year-old to being an adolescent
[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.280]   and into adulthood and into the, I guess,
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.280]   the geriatric years, do they still call it that?
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.520]   Probably, I probably used a politically incorrect term,
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.360]   but forgive me.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.360]   - It's okay.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.200]   - 75 to 125.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.400]   And yet the feeling is the same, right?
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.180]   The feeling, and so it's as if a word
[00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:02.720]   can mean the same thing, but be used 50 different ways,
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.760]   maybe 5,000 different ways.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.600]   - To represent.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.520]   - In this analogy, I'm saying that the word
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.560]   is the feeling and it's used so many different ways
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.680]   because occasionally I'll read a scientific manuscript
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.440]   and I'm like, that is so cool.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.640]   It's the same way that I feel when I was nine years old
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.720]   and I spent all my time in the pet store
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.360]   looking at tropical fish and tropical birds and thinking,
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.460]   oh my God, that freshwater discus fish
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.680]   is the coolest thing I've ever seen.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.840]   And again, I think I must have a strong memory
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.120]   for these kinds of things
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.820]   because I feel it right now in my body.
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.360]   So it's as if the same thing maps
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.960]   to so many different circumstances.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.920]   So is what we're learning across the lifespan
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.180]   a recognition of feelings in our body as,
[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.320]   ah, this is something I like
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.860]   because of the way it makes my body feel
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.400]   or is it cognitive or both?
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.920]   From your answer a moment ago,
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.900]   it seems like it's so interconnected and bi-directional
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.240]   and fast that it's impossible to really say
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.520]   that feelings are in the body or in the brain.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.800]   It's really happening simultaneously.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.520]   - Yeah, it's a dynamic emergency.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.920]   Let me give you an example that I use sometimes
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.680]   to help myself understand the notion.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:17.680]   So my little daughter, Nora,
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:21.080]   when she was two, two and some months,
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.640]   two and four months, she's a very verbal kid.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.700]   And I was sitting in the kitchen one day
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:27.800]   drinking a cup of tea.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.040]   I was sad about something that happened in my life,
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.560]   but I wasn't weeping or anything.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.400]   I was just sitting there.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.520]   I must've looked kind of lost in my own thoughts.
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.080]   She's playing around on the floor.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.000]   She came over to me.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.220]   I'll never forget it, this tiny little person.
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.320]   She comes over to me and noticed
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.440]   I wasn't really there with her, you know what I mean?
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.920]   And my arm was hanging down.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.240]   She picked up my arm and she held it against her face
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.080]   like that and she said, I won't say in baby talk
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.080]   'cause you won't understand, but she said,
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.640]   "Don't worry, mama, I'll take care of you."
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.480]   And I said, "Yeah."
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.660]   And I said, "Oh, Nora, that's so sweet, sweetie.
[00:18:58.660 --> 00:18:59.760]   "I'll take care of you too."
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.640]   And she said, "And mama, I really love you.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.080]   "I really love you."
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:08.160]   And then she said, "I mean, I really love your arm.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.900]   "I really love your arm," right?
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.440]   Fast forward two years later, almost exactly two years,
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.640]   she's four in a couple months and she was in bed one night
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.240]   laying in her bed in the dark and I walked by
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.400]   and I listened at the door to see if she was sleeping there
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.440]   and I hear this little whisper comes out and she says,
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:29.080]   "Mama, I love you more than I'm glad that there's daytime."
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:35.920]   What's changed developmentally from her at age two
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.040]   to her at age four, right?
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.320]   I would argue that the physiological substrate
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.220]   of her attachment to her mother is probably quite similar.
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:48.480]   She had this sort of visceral, automatic, biological,
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.480]   you might say, attachment, connection to me emotionally
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.480]   that she was trying to leverage in the service
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.240]   of making sense of being active in that world
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.960]   and adapting herself to the situation,
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.520]   helping me in the first case, right?
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:08.140]   But what's changed remarkably is not the substrate
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.680]   of that attachment, it's her ability to conceptualize it.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.640]   When she's two, her love is experienced
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:19.640]   as this incredibly concrete, embodied, real, physical thing.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.220]   Like, I love you, I mean, I really love the body part
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.480]   I am currently smooshing against my face, right?
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.500]   Whereas two years later, she can conceptualize that love
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:34.900]   in terms of an idea, which is, wouldn't it be awful
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.980]   if there was nighttime all the time
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.860]   and there was no sunshine and daylight
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.060]   and I couldn't go out to play and I couldn't, right?
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.120]   - You're describing my biggest fear.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.420]   Listeners of this podcast will know
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.280]   that I'm gonna go into the grave,
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.700]   hopefully a long time from now,
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.860]   telling people to get morning sunlight in their eyes.
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.920]   - I know, I still do it because of you, yeah.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.500]   - But please continue.
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.460]   - No, but that's right.
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.960]   So she's thinking about how much she is grateful
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.560]   for there to be sunlight and in her little mind,
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.980]   she connected that to the feeling of being attached to me
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.860]   and used one to explain the other, right?
[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.740]   So that both things now have meaning.
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:13.740]   And that is the way I think that we start to elaborate
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:18.060]   these very basic physiological attachment states,
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.320]   aversion states, right?
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:24.320]   Motivational states of various sorts into mental states,
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.860]   beliefs, poems, you know, love songs,
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.620]   all the things that she does, right?
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.060]   Even between age two and age four,
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.660]   that really are mental elaborations,
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:41.660]   meaning-making of that very physiologically basic sensation.
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.360]   Does that answer your question?
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.060]   - It answers it incredibly clearly and so much so
[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.980]   that I'd like to continue to build on that example
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.540]   because I think it's very relatable for people
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.520]   and it's the first time that I've ever heard
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.760]   the embodiment of emotions described
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.320]   in a developmental framework that truly makes sense.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.160]   - Oh, good.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.080]   So thank you.
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:12.560]   So the contact with your arm or your arm or both
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:18.340]   was the life example that she was using it
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:22.000]   as a two-year-old that maps to an internal feeling.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   And we're going to assume she's not here,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.640]   we don't have her in a brain scanner, we can't ask her,
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.540]   but we're going to assume that her experience
[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:34.240]   of being put to bed at night and feeling so much love
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:39.240]   from and for you map to her then growing understanding
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.040]   of the world around her and the fact that there's day
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.280]   and night and sunshine.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.200]   So as her knowledge base grows,
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.560]   she can add examples to the feeling.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.720]   And I'm assuming that, it doesn't matter how old she is now,
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.540]   but I'm assuming that as a 14-year-old,
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.480]   the knowledge base is going to be different
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.460]   and is going to map to that feeling again and again.
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:03.460]   So the question is, is what we are doing across the lifespan
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:08.280]   is recognizing sort of, I don't want to call them primitives,
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:13.280]   but basic emotional states, which are not infinite,
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:17.680]   but can be along each one along a continuum.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:22.320]   So a little bit of love, completely in love,
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.520]   along a continuum and everything in between,
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:29.120]   a little angry and annoyed to completely furious.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:33.880]   Are we talking about maybe 10 to 30 core emotions
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.620]   that then we are just simply binning our experiences
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.480]   into and onto and mapping onto,
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.540]   and then that's our life story?
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.360]   And I'm not trying to oversimplify things,
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:48.360]   but that seems to me like a pretty great way
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.740]   for a nervous system to navigate a world
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:56.320]   that is infinitely complex and has a lot of surprise,
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.840]   both positive and negative,
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.960]   and in which, like every organism,
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.880]   our main goal is to survive as long as possible,
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.040]   and not for everybody, but in many cases,
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.280]   to try and make more of ourselves
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.660]   in those things to be the basic drive,
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.360]   survive and make more of oneself,
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.120]   as seems to be the two basic functions of every species.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.700]   - In some way, it could be more of your ideas
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.120]   or more of your work or more of your art, right?
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:17.960]   - Exactly.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:23.020]   So is that an overly simplistic way to think about it,
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.880]   or does it work, even if there's more
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.800]   that needs to be added, does that work?
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.040]   As a 20-year-old, I learned things in college,
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.860]   and I'm like, this is awesome.
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.720]   The first time I learned about the hypothalamus,
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.960]   this little marble-sized structure,
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.440]   and the fact that different neurons
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.040]   sitting right next to each other can put us into a rage,
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.240]   or will make us want to mate,
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.640]   or will make us thirsty or hungry or tired,
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.680]   I was like, wow.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.120]   I mean, it just, it blew me away.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.920]   It still blows me away.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.840]   But the feeling is the same as looking at the discus fish
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.680]   in Monet's Pet Shop on California Avenue
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.560]   when I'm nine years old.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.400]   So is that the way to think about it?
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.320]   - I think, yes, I think there's an awful lot
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.840]   of basic physiological mechanisms
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.920]   that become motivational mechanisms, right,
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.520]   in all the senses, adaptive mechanisms
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.160]   that we share with all life forms,
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.360]   not even just all animals, but all life forms,
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.480]   but they look different, and different life forms for sure,
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.840]   because the adaptive functions, the time scales,
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.160]   and everything are different.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.720]   If you're a tree, then if you're a fish,
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.560]   then if you're a slime mold, or you're me, right?
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.040]   But I think you're right,
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.720]   that what we basically are doing
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.380]   is taking these very primitive
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.600]   physiological regulatory capacities
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.740]   that are essentially there to keep you alive,
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.800]   and that's a very dynamic thing, to keep you alive.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:39.960]   You have to constantly adjust
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.200]   for the needs of the internal organism,
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.240]   the needs of the external,
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.900]   the demands of the external environment on that organism,
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.900]   and being able to manage in that space over time
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:54.900]   is a very complex, dynamic, kind of iterative process.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.920]   And we take those processes,
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:03.440]   and we conjure out of them a form of consciousness,
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.620]   an awareness of those processes
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:10.620]   that becomes something that feels mentally powerful to us.
[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.920]   And I think one of the ways
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.560]   that we can know that what you're saying is right
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.520]   is that, this was just our first experiment on this,
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.600]   but I think it's really poignant.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.200]   We first started to study
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:28.080]   the ways people would react to social stimuli, right?
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.560]   To have emotions like compassion
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:34.640]   or admiration in the MRI scanner
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.680]   by telling people stories of true people situations
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.880]   that invoked these emotions in all kinds of piloting.
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.800]   And then we asked people, how does it make you feel?
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.120]   And then we can see whether they actually feel that way.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.720]   And then we move them into the MRI scanner
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.480]   and ask them again to watch the story and feel it.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:53.920]   And what we expected, we had some very basic hypotheses
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:58.080]   that things like watching somebody else endure physical pain
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.600]   would activate the same systems in your brain
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.160]   that allow you to feel physical pain.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:07.080]   And the same with pleasure around admiration for skill,
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.360]   watching somebody do flips on their bike on a railroad tie
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.160]   or whatever it is, right?
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.200]   Or virtue, right?
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.720]   Watching a civil rights leader
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.660]   or somebody who does something
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.180]   that's incredibly virtuously powerful,
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:18.880]   but not physically skilled.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:23.320]   And we had a real surprise in those findings,
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.520]   which I think really went against the prevailing notion
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.760]   of how emotion works and which is still something
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.120]   which I wrestle with trying to understand.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.820]   So we hypothesized that feeling emotions
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.760]   about very physical direct things
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.520]   and feeling emotions about,
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.520]   I'm like drawing them in space,
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.040]   but feeling emotions about complex elaborated things
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.520]   like compassion for someone having lost a spouse
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.180]   or something where you don't see any real physical pain,
[00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.360]   but you can imagine how they're feeling
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.960]   based on your shared experience of loss, right?
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.920]   Or admiration for virtue,
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:28:00.020]   that those things would build neurobiologically
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.640]   the way that they build developmentally,
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.680]   the way that they build evolutionarily.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.440]   And we did find that to be the case
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.000]   and many other groups and experiments have found that too.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.500]   But what was a real surprise to us
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.560]   is that emotions based in pain
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.280]   and emotions based in something rewarding or pleasurable
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.120]   like virtue, which is really inspiring as people describe it
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.720]   were actually recruiting the same brain systems
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.360]   including the hypothalamus, right?
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.160]   And other systems like the anterior insula
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.880]   which is basically visceral somatomotor cortex.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.640]   It's cortex that feels the state
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.040]   of how you're digesting your lunch,
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.000]   whether your heart's pounding, all these kinds of things.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.880]   What we found is that these emotions,
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.340]   when they get complex, when they're about stories,
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:48.160]   the valence is no longer the defining feature.
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.160]   The valence doesn't even matter that much.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:55.800]   Instead what matters is does the emotion pertain
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.020]   to a story that is conjured in our minds
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:02.200]   or does it mainly pertain to what you can directly witness
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.280]   by looking at the person?
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.240]   So they step off a curb, they break their ankle
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.040]   and you go, oh, that looks like it really hurt, right?
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.840]   Versus they're eating dinner alone in a restaurant
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.360]   and somebody tells you his spouse died just a month ago,
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:19.140]   right, where you have to tell yourself an entire story
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.200]   about how he must be feeling in that situation
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.300]   as compared to just looking at him and seeing the ankle
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.400]   and going, ooh, you know?
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:31.080]   And it was that leap, which is really uniquely human,
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:34.640]   which is fully developed really
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:38.160]   throughout a very protracted period, right?
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.440]   Little children do not fully appreciate
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.880]   those kinds of mental states yet, right?
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.980]   And in adolescence, kids are all about trying to conjure
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:48.440]   and simulate these things and they do it very,
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.020]   you know, they overdo it and they do it
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.780]   in these very sort of awkward ways that adults recognize
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:57.780]   as not likely to correspond fully to reality many times.
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:01.980]   And then we start to build more and more facility,
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:06.560]   more and more sort of wisdom around conjuring the story
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.300]   that makes the most direct parsimonious sense
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:12.020]   out of the things that you imagine somebody else
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:15.400]   may have experienced given the complexities of the context
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.600]   in which they find themselves.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.680]   It becomes more and more dynamic,
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.740]   more and more sort of inferential.
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:23.680]   And so this also goes back
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.800]   to what you were saying about development.
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.880]   This is actually how I see development across the lifespan.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.640]   My little two-year-old loves the arm.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.500]   Then she loves me as much as something else
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.360]   that she really appreciates like daylight.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.960]   And then she goes on from there.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.120]   And when she's 80, God willing someday, right?
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.460]   She'll be making a different kind of story,
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.640]   picking out things that matter in more subtle ways
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.280]   that other people may not notice
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.980]   because of the historical context,
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.740]   because of her more lived experience
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.220]   that she brings to that story, right?
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:57.960]   So the things that become salient,
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.860]   the things you learn how to notice
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.740]   and build a story out of are developmental.
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:05.760]   And they're learned across time.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:10.160]   But the basic fundamental processes around the emotions
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:14.000]   are always driving the need to make the story.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.680]   And so just to come back answering what you said before,
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.520]   I think we have this incredibly complex dynamic set
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.460]   of basic emotions or whatever you wanna call them,
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:26.300]   physiological states that we share with other organisms
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.500]   that are basically action programs that teach you
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.120]   run away from this, right?
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:35.880]   Move toward that, eat this, don't eat that, right?
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.220]   But those things in humans
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:41.800]   and to a lesser degree in other animals
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:46.480]   become the fodder for not just action programs in the moment,
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.840]   but ideas that transcend time,
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:53.520]   ideas that become the narratives of the stuff of beliefs,
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:57.840]   of values, of identities.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.640]   Those more ethereal, you know,
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:05.400]   essences of us that are conjured entirely by us
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.960]   in cultural spaces are fundamentally grounded
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.960]   into our ability to experience the world in a real
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:16.040]   physical embodied sense, but elaborated far beyond that.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.560]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.460]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.920]   Athletic Greens now called AG1
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.280]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.180]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.860]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012.
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.080]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.680]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.760]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.740]   once or usually twice a day
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.660]   is that it gets to be the probiotics
[00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:42.340]   that I need for gut health.
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:43.440]   Our gut is very important.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:46.000]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.760]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.160]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.800]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.660]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:59.480]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.040]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.960]   a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.840]   that make sure that all of my foundational
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:08.300]   nutritional needs are met and it tastes great.
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.760]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:13.160]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.120]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.440]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.720]   while you're on the road, in the car,
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.000]   on the plane, et cetera.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.420]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.100]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.480]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.320]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.300]   I started off studying the visual system,
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.160]   and I don't want this to turn into a discussion
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.060]   about the visual system,
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:38.880]   but in the visual system,
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.080]   we know that there's a,
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.600]   what's called a hierarchical organization
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:46.680]   where the eye encodes and can respond to edges
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:50.260]   and light versus dark and red, green, blue.
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:54.000]   And from that very basic set of building blocks,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.300]   there's an elaboration or a buildup
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.360]   of what's really called the iceberg model
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.140]   that was developed by my scientific great grandparents,
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.360]   David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel,
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.860]   who won the Nobel Prize for that work,
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:09.060]   where you can look at somebody's face and recognize it,
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:12.600]   or see a profile moving at a particular direction
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.680]   and still recognize that person,
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:19.680]   or see a word written and conceptualize in your mind's eye
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:22.520]   what that word like bird actually looks like,
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.340]   like parakeet, blue parakeet.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.220]   In other words, there's a hierarchical buildup.
[00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:29.280]   And what you're describing sounds somewhat similar
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.000]   that there's a hierarchical organization whereby
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.900]   through development, we first learn,
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.340]   I guess earlier I called them primitives,
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.900]   but basic building blocks of,
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.200]   you know, when someone steps on my foot, it hurts.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:41.500]   It can hurt a lot or a little bit,
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.300]   depending on who stepped on my foot.
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:46.620]   Whether I have a shoe on, so you start learning context,
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:51.340]   but there's a buildup on top of the basic somatic experience
[00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:53.400]   of different examples that map to pain,
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.300]   including emotional pain and physical pain,
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.860]   because we know those are interdigitated somewhat.
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:01.880]   And that over time, this builds up
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.080]   so that we have countless examples,
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.880]   but you said something else that goes beyond
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.880]   the hierarchical organization
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.420]   that we see in the visual system,
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.800]   which is that when there's a narrative or a story
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.480]   that we have to add, it changes something
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.580]   about the representation of emotion.
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:23.560]   I'm so struck by this comparison
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.000]   between seeing somebody step off a curb
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.160]   and break their ankle.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.080]   Like even as I'm describing, just like a folding ankle,
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.880]   like, ouch, God, that really hurts.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.080]   - And just look at what you're doing with your face
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.620]   as you do that in your body, right?
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:38.840]   - Yeah, I mean, I've broken my left foot five times
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.880]   growing up doing the same sport,
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:44.140]   and it just, I can still hear and feel the thing going,
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:47.040]   and that means six months in a cast or whatever it is,
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.240]   versus a story, you know,
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.540]   seeing somebody sitting alone in a cafe,
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.160]   writing in their journal,
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:57.800]   and then you learning that they just lost their spouse
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.160]   of 75 years.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.820]   Two fundamentally different visual images.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.520]   The emotion could perhaps be the same,
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.280]   like, oh, that is rough.
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:14.260]   And yet the need to impose story changes it.
[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:15.220]   Do I understand that correctly?
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:19.720]   That there's something not just more developmentally mature
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:23.280]   about adding in story and adding context,
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.120]   but that when we have to do that,
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.400]   that there's something that's fundamentally different
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.280]   about how the emotions are mapped in the brain.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.040]   I guess perhaps the answer I'm looking for is,
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:37.680]   what did you see in brain scanning experiments
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:42.200]   where somebody views simply a physical break
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.720]   of somebody's limb versus somebody has to add story?
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.680]   Is there something that comes out in the subtraction
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.080]   of one from the other that tells us,
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.880]   oh, there's a whole set of brain networks
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.800]   that are not just about saying ouch,
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.680]   but that have to do with the need to conjure up story?
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.020]   And what are those brain areas?
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:02.520]   And then perhaps we can digest those a little bit.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.680]   - Yes, and actually that is exactly what we found,
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.520]   a whole system of brain areas that did this,
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.880]   which now many people have described.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.400]   And we're still trying to understand the full role
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.280]   of these networks,
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:17.120]   but these regions together are called in the literature,
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.640]   the so-called default mode network, right?
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:25.600]   Because the co-activation of these characteristic regions
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.780]   of the brain, which are in the back middle of the head
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.480]   and some characteristic regions on the lateral parietal,
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:36.480]   and those were first described in neuroimaging experiments
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:40.980]   where people were asked to just rest, right?
[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:43.440]   Rest and relax, don't think about anything,
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.400]   just clear your mind for a few minutes, right?
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:48.160]   This is Marcus Raichel and his colleagues back in 2001.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   And then contrasting that with tasks
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.920]   where people have to do something very attention focus
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.880]   requiring where you really have to work hard and think.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:03.200]   And they found that these highly metabolic
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.520]   characteristic regions of the brain were coming online
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:10.840]   and activating themselves when the person was resting
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.640]   and deactivating and decoupling from one another,
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.600]   not talking back and forth and exchanging signal very much.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.120]   When someone was doing a really effortful mental task,
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:26.280]   and that was a real conundrum for a long time.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.320]   And what we now know is,
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.240]   when you ask somebody to think about nothing or rest,
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.760]   for a few minutes, you're laying in the skin and thinking,
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.000]   I'm thinking about nothing, I'm thinking about nothing.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.360]   And then you start daydreaming about all manner of stories.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.440]   You start to imagine yourself into the future.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.400]   Here I am winning the Olympics, ta-da,
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.400]   or hey, it's my grandma's birthday next week.
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.560]   I wonder if she'd like to go to lunch
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.080]   or if she'd rather have flowers.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.080]   You're imagining other people's mind states.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.560]   You're thinking, is that guy mad at me at work?
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:55.000]   I wonder if I should change jobs.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.480]   You're thinking about all kinds of possible spaces
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.320]   that don't actually physically exist
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.760]   in the real here and now.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.720]   And so what we found is that our findings were,
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:09.160]   I think some of the first, if not the first,
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:14.160]   to actively demonstrate an increase in activation
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:21.280]   in these default mode systems, not a decoupling of them,
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:24.560]   but an activation of them when we ask somebody
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:28.080]   to do an effortful mental task.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.880]   And what was the task?
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:34.880]   Asking people, how do you feel about this story,
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:39.240]   which involves a lot of imposing of cultural
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.080]   and social and contextual knowledge
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.320]   to be able to appreciate.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.880]   So the story of the guy sitting in the cafe
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:48.760]   writing in his journal, who lost his spouse of 75 years,
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:53.120]   you have to know a lot to be able to appreciate
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.400]   how he must be feeling.
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.840]   How does it make you feel?
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:58.440]   Let me pull up a lot of relevant knowledge,
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.120]   personal experiences and memories,
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:05.040]   and then hypothesize, generate some kind of narrative,
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:08.880]   some kind of storyline that would accommodate his situation
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.920]   and allow me to infer.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:14.760]   Those kinds of stories, which are very different
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:17.000]   from here's somebody stepping off the curb,
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.360]   ow, look at that ankle, right?
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.880]   It's very obvious how that makes the person feel
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.280]   and how you should feel about that.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.120]   You don't really need to bring a whole lot
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.160]   of cultural knowledge about their personal history
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.560]   with their spouse to be able to understand
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.680]   that's breaking your ankle hurts, right?
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:35.280]   And what we found is that it was those kinds of stories
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.920]   where people had to bring a lot of contextual knowledge
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.720]   to fully appreciate that activated
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.120]   these default mode systems.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.480]   - The losing of the spouse.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.560]   - The losing of the spouse.
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:49.680]   So what we later showed in a series of experiments,
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:53.760]   contrasting true stories that are meant
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.760]   to induce admiration for skill, right?
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.760]   Like something physically skillful,
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.560]   or cognitively skillful and memorize a Rubik's cube
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.640]   and solve it with your eyes closed, right?
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:08.160]   Or do flips on your bicycle and land on a railroad tie,
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.320]   right, like these incredibly skillful things
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:16.200]   as compared to the same kind of basic emotion
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:20.400]   in the sense of feeling like inspired,
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.480]   like attracted to it, like it's pleasurable,
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.960]   like it's really cool, like you wish you could do that too.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:28.080]   But now it's about a state of that person's mind
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:31.160]   or quality of character or disposition of self.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:36.160]   So talking about the incredibly brave actions
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:41.160]   of Malala in Pakistan, standing up to the Taliban, right?
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:44.720]   Where it's not about how well she walks down the street
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:45.640]   holding her school book.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:49.160]   There's nothing really physically skillful to see there.
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:52.120]   It's about the conditions under which she's doing it
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:55.280]   and what you can infer about her state of mind
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.960]   and her quality of character
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.960]   to be engaging in these actions under those conditions.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:04.120]   And those complex kinds of inferences we found
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:08.480]   activate these default mode systems uniquely.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:12.080]   And in fact, we can in trial by trial experiments,
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.400]   so literally depending on what you say about a story,
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:19.280]   whether it inspires you that particular story out of 50,
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.000]   right, in a two hour interview beforehand,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.480]   if you are inspired by a particular story
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.320]   as compared to another one,
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.760]   which may not resonate with you, right,
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.760]   then when we put you in the MRI scanner,
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:34.320]   we can predict that you will actually activate
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.200]   these neural systems differentially
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.800]   based on your psychological reaction in the interview.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:43.960]   So we can actually show that there are systematic ways
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:47.040]   in which these large scale networks of the brain,
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.560]   so the way in which the brain's kind of balancing
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:52.880]   its activity and its crosstalk around the different parts
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:55.160]   that are contributing different kinds of processing,
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:43:00.040]   those dynamic balances are different
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:01.760]   when someone is what we're doing,
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.640]   what we're calling now transcending the situation
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.440]   of that person, right,
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.760]   and starting to learn something bigger
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:12.240]   about what it all means or what the story is
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:16.240]   or the broader reason why this inspires me
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.720]   and not just is about her, right?
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.520]   So you can look at Malala and you can say,
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:25.560]   you know, oh, I hope she makes it,
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:28.880]   that's really unfair and like, right?
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.320]   Or you can look at her and say, and kids say this to us
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:34.880]   on experiments with teenagers, but wait a minute,
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.760]   and they actually wait, they cover their face,
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.520]   they close their eyes, they look away
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:42.320]   from the Malala video and they look at the plain ceiling
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.000]   and we can actually get coders with the volume off
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.400]   to identify these periods of time
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:50.800]   and say that when they come back from that pause,
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:54.040]   their speech slows, their posture closes, right?
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.480]   They put their hands down, that kind of thing,
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:57.360]   they don't gesture, right?
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:59.160]   And when they come back from that,
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.280]   they are talking about two things,
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:06.240]   they're talking about the broader inferential narrative
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.760]   around what all this means.
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.280]   Wait, I didn't know not everybody in the world
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.560]   doesn't get to go to, you know, gets to go to school.
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:15.120]   You know, that's not right, right?
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:19.240]   And these ethical interpretations, that's not right.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.640]   And the third thing that comes up is a feeling of self
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.880]   and what it means for you,
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:26.440]   because you're using your own self and consciousness
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.280]   as a kind of springboard, like a trampoline,
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.560]   like we said before, to try to appreciate
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.040]   what it must be like to be her.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.520]   So the next thing people say to us,
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.640]   or kids say to us especially,
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.680]   is it makes me realize that I go to school all the time
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:38.920]   and I kind of take it for granted
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.160]   and maybe I should work harder
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.320]   to try to do something about that for other people.
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:45.240]   You know, so we have this incredible confluence
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:47.360]   in the brain and mind,
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:52.360]   this layering of real physical actions
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.160]   and things that happen that you can directly observe
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:58.040]   with the visual system, right, in the world,
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.760]   and then you impose upon those
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:04.000]   a desire to construct a story or meaning
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.640]   and you elaborate that meaning,
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:10.760]   and in doing so, you also ramp up
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:15.640]   the internal sense of self-awareness of me being me,
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.280]   of conscious systems,
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.640]   systems that support consciousness
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:19.800]   in the brain and brainstem,
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:23.120]   very basic things we share with alligators, right,
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.720]   that become that kind of inspired state
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.840]   of, you know, like, wait,
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:30.680]   it makes me want to do more for the world,
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.920]   or it makes me inspired to know there are people like her,
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.320]   she gives me hope for humanity, one kid told me, right?
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:40.200]   So we've got this incredible dynamic layering
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:43.760]   of the feeling of the body, the real physical body,
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.280]   the observation and sensation,
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:48.840]   perception of the world around us
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:51.360]   in a physical real or social real sense,
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:53.160]   and then the elaboration of that
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.760]   into these cultural narratives that become feeling states
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.240]   and where valence kind of disappears, right?
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.600]   It doesn't matter so much anymore,
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.560]   whether it's painful or pleasurable,
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.720]   it's more about, does it mean something?
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:07.400]   I'm suffering because it's helping someone else, right?
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:10.160]   And so it becomes something desirable,
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.680]   even though it hurts me, right?
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.280]   Otherwise none of us would go through childbirth, right?
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.520]   And so it's that meaning process
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.360]   that makes us really uniquely human,
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.880]   and that is the development of these emotions
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.680]   over time, I think.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.600]   - Incredible.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.360]   If I'm understanding correctly,
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:31.080]   there's a feeling state in our body
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:34.560]   when we experience or observe somebody
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:38.840]   in their own feeling state or experience.
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:41.200]   It may be the same as theirs, might be different,
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.960]   and frankly, as a neuroscientist,
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.880]   I'm going to say we'll never know exactly.
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:46.720]   We won't know.
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:47.960]   - That's the angel of philosophical debate.
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:48.800]   - We won't know.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:49.640]   - If I see blue and you see blue,
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.360]   is it the same experience, right?
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.760]   - It's probably not, based on,
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.200]   from my knowledge of color vision
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.080]   and the distribution of cones,
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.280]   to explain why I'm saying that,
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.160]   the distribution of cone photo pigments
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:04.760]   in your eye and my eye are extremely different,
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.160]   to the point where we're not working with the same palette.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:08.100]   - Cool.
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:09.480]   - And I think that makes life interesting.
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.080]   - That makes life interesting, exactly.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.320]   - But assuming that neither of us is colorblind,
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:15.680]   red is similar enough to both of us
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.160]   that we would both look at it and say, "That's red."
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.960]   But one in 80 males is red-green colorblind,
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.360]   would look at it and would see what you and I call red
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.360]   and call it orange.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.180]   In any event,
[00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:32.080]   when we, let's say, listen to or watch
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:35.000]   and listen to Martin Luther King's classic,
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.360]   "I Have a Dream" speech,
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:41.120]   or when I hear certain music
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:43.600]   that I first heard when I was 14,
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:47.360]   it was a particularly interesting, for me, time in my life,
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.880]   in part 'cause I was 14, and we'll get back to that,
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:50.720]   and what I mean by that. - 14's a thing.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.960]   - No, we're talking about adolescence, right.
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:55.240]   I'll just say, I'll go on record by saying
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:58.320]   that I think that the music that we listen to
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:00.880]   in our adolescence and teen years
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:05.600]   is one of the main ways in which we come to recognize
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:08.040]   the extremes of these feeling state templates
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:09.240]   that you're describing.
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:14.800]   One of the ways I prepare for podcasts is to walk,
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.900]   and for my solo podcast is to walk
[00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:18.060]   and go through some of the narrative.
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:21.240]   My neighbors think I'm crazy, but that's okay.
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:22.560]   I think they're crazy too.
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:24.920]   - Maybe they're both right.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:27.380]   - That's right, exactly.
[00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:30.900]   But I always know what music to listen to
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.340]   before I do a solo podcast,
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:34.860]   depending on the state that I happen to be in,
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:37.160]   driving into the studio versus the one I need to be in
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.680]   in order to deliver that particular material.
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.020]   And I know because it's almost like knowing
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:44.520]   what palette of colors, of emotional colors
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:45.640]   I have in me at the moment,
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:47.440]   and which ones are going to be required
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:50.320]   to deliver that material because it's different
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:53.260]   depending on the topic matter for that episode.
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:57.620]   What I'm referring to here is this idea
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:02.620]   that we come to understand emotions
[00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:06.020]   through our own experience and how observing other people
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.600]   and listening to certain music can influence that.
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:11.800]   And I realize that some people probably have more of a buffer
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:14.680]   between their experience of the outside world,
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:17.080]   so-called exteroception, seeing things outside us,
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.440]   and their internal landscape.
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.160]   Some people, I realize,
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:24.560]   have very little narrative distancing.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:26.160]   In fact, I live with someone
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.300]   who has very little narrative distancing.
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:31.400]   When she watches a movie, if the person gets punched-
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:32.640]   - Yeah, she ducks.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:33.720]   - She flinches.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:36.760]   If it's a happy movie, she gets happy.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:39.160]   If somebody in a movie is sad, she really feels it.
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:40.500]   And for a while, I thought, "Oh, goodness,
[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:42.880]   "this really seems a little extreme."
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.440]   But I've talked to professionals about this,
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.720]   and it's something called lack of narrative distancing.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.240]   - Transportation is another way to say it,
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.880]   being transported by story.
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.860]   - Right, and I think that it has its adaptive utility.
[00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:56.740]   I'm not being critical.
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:59.320]   I think that's an incredibly interesting aspect to ourselves.
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.920]   Some of us, I have a lot more narrative distancing,
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.000]   especially with violence.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   And I think that's because I grew up
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.880]   around a lot more violence than she did.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:11.200]   And so I see somebody get beheaded in a film,
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:13.240]   unless it's something where I've really been built
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.880]   into the story of that person,
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:17.920]   and it was a real world thing that I knew actually happened,
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:22.080]   then I just kind of go, "Okay, well, it's a movie."
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:22.920]   You know, this is a movie.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:23.740]   It's not real.
[00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:25.160]   Even if it's a movie about something that was real,
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.320]   that might be a little bit more of an emotional impact.
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:30.120]   And of course, if it's a documentary and it's real footage,
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.560]   it's pretty rough.
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:36.560]   But I'm not horrified in the way that she's horrified.
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:40.180]   I'm horrified, but not to the same extent.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:46.360]   So obviously, some of us have more of a buffer than others.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:47.960]   And you can see this in a movie
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:51.740]   or in a classroom full of kids watching a speech,
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.520]   like the "I Have a Dream" speech,
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.840]   or hearing the Rosa Parks story, for instance,
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:00.840]   or listening to and watching a David Goggins
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:02.620]   social media post, which I met David earlier
[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:05.180]   because your son had a question for me about David Goggins.
[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:08.240]   I happen to have the good fortune of having met
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.240]   and know a little bit.
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:10.080]   I don't know him very well,
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:13.720]   but I know him from some in-person interactions
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:14.980]   and he is every bit as intense
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:18.960]   and every bit as serious about his ongoing progression
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:19.960]   as he appears to be.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:22.000]   There's no falsehood there.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.280]   It is 100% data fact.
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:28.280]   He does what he claims to do and more
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:31.120]   that we don't hear about.
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:32.880]   Super impressive human being.
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:37.060]   So when we see something like a David Goggins post,
[00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:40.540]   or we watch and listen to the "I Have a Dream" speech
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:43.240]   and we start to feel something like,
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:47.200]   "Whoa, we're feeling inspired," to use the basic language.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:52.200]   Are we mapping to some subconscious awareness
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:55.320]   of that in ourselves?
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:57.420]   Meaning, are we mapping to some time
[00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:00.320]   when we felt inspired in another circumstance?
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:03.060]   Or are we really, you know,
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:06.420]   is this merely a kind of a return to a feeling state
[00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:07.720]   that we have to recognize?
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:09.400]   I don't know if experiments have ever been done on this,
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:12.060]   but is there any way to determine whether or not
[00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:17.060]   we can truly have novel emotions past age 15?
[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:18.960]   Or are we really just returning,
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:22.020]   or are we really just doing a sort of template matching
[00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:24.000]   of, "Wow, I'm feeling this again
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.500]   and this makes me feel capable.
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:26.680]   Like I can go out and run today,
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:29.940]   even though I was going to basically not run today."
[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:34.160]   Or, you know, it's possible to have a fantasy view
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:38.280]   about how the world could be in terms of equality
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:41.400]   that an opportunity, and you know what?
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:44.920]   Like that's subconsciously is my brain saying,
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:46.400]   "Yeah, I remember when I was six
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.520]   and I didn't know the difference
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:49.200]   between some people having opportunity
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.600]   and other people not having opportunity."
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:52.600]   Is that what's happening?
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:55.440]   Or do you think that we are more sophisticated than that?
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:59.300]   And we are actually really responding
[00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:01.360]   to what we think we're responding to.
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:04.400]   - Okay, wow, there's a lot in there.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:07.360]   A couple of things to start.
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:09.500]   So the first thing I was thinking before
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:10.760]   when you were talking about the visual system,
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:12.280]   which I think is relevant now,
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:17.000]   is that as humans, the more developed we get,
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.520]   the more experience we have,
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:23.220]   the more we've adapted to the contexts in which we live,
[00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:24.880]   you know, the real physical context,
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:27.460]   in this case, the visual context included,
[00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:29.960]   but also the cultural values of that context,
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:33.320]   the things we've noticed other people notice, right?
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:35.040]   How do you learn when you're living in the jungle
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:37.640]   that when you see eyeballs, you should, you know,
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:40.120]   go stand next to your mommy, right?
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:42.080]   So you learn what to notice,
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:46.120]   you learn what you need to attend to in the world.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:49.240]   So when we are perceiving things,
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.560]   either very basic things like a visual scene
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:54.540]   or hugely complex elaborate things
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:57.480]   like Martin Luther King's speech,
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:01.400]   we are as much imposing onto the world
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:06.000]   our own expectations of what is there
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.480]   as we are perceiving what's actually there, right?
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:11.800]   So as we impose onto the world,
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:14.380]   we bring what you might call
[00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:16.560]   our cultural ways of seeing and knowing,
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:17.820]   our values and beliefs,
[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:22.820]   and we push them onto the experience of what we notice.
[00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:26.700]   So even in very basic ways,
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:30.040]   things like cultural values change the way
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:33.280]   in which people observe and remember scenes, right?
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:36.440]   So, you know, there's classic work by Shinobu Kiriyama
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:41.140]   and other people showing that in Japan versus in the US,
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:44.360]   when you show people a scene of, you know,
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.060]   like an underwater scene with like all the beautiful things
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:48.840]   that are underwater, rocks and plants and things,
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.020]   and a little fish swimming by,
[00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:51.700]   and then one big fish swimming by, right?
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:54.780]   And you ask a Japanese person, what's this a picture of?
[00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:58.200]   They tend to talk about it's a scene of rocks and plants
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:01.260]   and little fish, and then a big fish swims by.
[00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:05.100]   If you ask an American Western educated person,
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:05.940]   what is this a picture of?
[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:09.840]   They say, oh, it's a fish swimming through a scene, right?
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.680]   We tend to notice first, and you can,
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:15.040]   he's shown that this is, you know,
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:16.720]   is very, very automatic.
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:17.720]   It's very low level.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:20.560]   It's perceptual, not just conceptual.
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:22.820]   And it actually changes what people actually notice
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.440]   in the scene and what they remember later
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:26.140]   and all that kind of stuff, right?
[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:30.840]   We learn how to sort of filter input.
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:35.760]   We're not little, you know, robots or little video cameras
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.440]   walking around observing the world.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:41.480]   And so when we see something as complex as a social story,
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:45.960]   we impose onto that all kinds of personal experiences.
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:48.800]   So you said, are we ever able to experience new emotions
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:49.920]   after age 15?
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:52.320]   I think no, but we are very well able
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:54.560]   to experience new feelings, right?
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:56.620]   Which are the complex elaborations
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:58.360]   of these physiological states
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:00.400]   and the stories we tell ourselves
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.440]   about the meaning behind them.
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:04.880]   That is developing all the time.
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:07.980]   And it's developing through all kinds of quote unquote,
[00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:09.200]   cognitive media.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.160]   We do it through our science, right?
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:13.440]   By being inspired and interested in something,
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:14.840]   by being in awe of something.
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:18.300]   We do it through art, through trying to express an emotion
[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:20.520]   or a feeling or a value state
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:23.360]   through the way in which we portray something
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:24.680]   to other people, right?
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:26.640]   As humans, we are driven.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:28.120]   I mean, even as cave people,
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:31.720]   we were driven to say, I was here, here's my handprint.
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:33.280]   I'm gonna spit it onto a rock.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.240]   So forevermore, anybody else who comes in here
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:37.580]   is gonna see that it was me who was here.
[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:39.240]   And I have a me, right?
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:44.240]   And so what we're really doing is moving through the world,
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:48.140]   not in this kind of receptive passive way,
[00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:51.980]   but we are actively imposing ourselves onto the world.
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:56.200]   We're actively bringing our interpretive power
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:58.980]   and adapting what we do next
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:02.920]   relative to the way in which we accommodate, right?
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:05.020]   Piaget talked about this a hundred years ago,
[00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:07.360]   accommodate or assimilate those things into us
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:10.160]   that may disagree with our schema,
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:13.600]   that may align and accord and reinforce them.
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:16.740]   So this matters a lot for the ways
[00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:18.880]   that humans experience the world more broadly,
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:22.280]   because think about, for example,
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:26.320]   a terrible topic like genocide or the Holocaust, right?
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:28.400]   How does something like that happen, right?
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:31.200]   How is it that people who have empathy,
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:34.540]   who love their family, who love their neighbors
[00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:37.000]   can suddenly turn on each other, right?
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.480]   What's happened is they've shifted
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:44.960]   the way in which they narratize the context of those events,
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:47.740]   the way in which they impose interpretation
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:51.500]   on somebody else's pain has been fundamentally shifted
[00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:55.060]   from that's another human suffering to that's not a human,
[00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:59.260]   that's a rat, a pig, a bug, or whatever it is, right?
[00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:01.580]   And that dehumanization process
[00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:04.140]   allows us to shift our story set
[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:07.860]   so that we bring another set of values and beliefs
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:09.580]   into the space.
[00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:11.780]   - Can I just say,
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:14.580]   I'm glad that you brought up that dark example,
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:18.500]   because my understanding from my psychology courses
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:21.960]   in university were that as much as we would all like
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:23.460]   to think that we are incapable
[00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:25.700]   of being the committers of genocide,
[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:29.340]   that there are studies that were done in the '50s,
[00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:31.600]   but then have been repeated over many decades
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:34.360]   showing that in certain contexts,
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:37.880]   essentially everybody and anybody
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:40.740]   would respond to an authoritarian figure
[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:42.100]   and torture somebody else.
[00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:44.120]   And I'm sure as people are listening to us,
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.300]   this they're thinking,
[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:47.240]   "No, I would absolutely not do that."
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:49.060]   But all the data points to the fact
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:52.100]   that if the conditions were set in a particular way,
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:54.860]   you and I and everybody else most certainly would.
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:58.060]   A very eerie idea that goes back to,
[00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:01.060]   I think Jung's idea that we have all things inside of us.
[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:03.060]   And we certainly have all the neural circuitry components
[00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:06.180]   inside of us for rage and contempt
[00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:08.980]   and horrible mistreatment of others,
[00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:10.480]   as well as all the good stuff.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:13.740]   But I'm just glad that you brought up this example
[00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:18.740]   because I think that for a lot of people it's inconceivable,
[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:20.580]   but I've never heard it framed
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:21.580]   the way that you're describing it,
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:23.220]   which is that if the story becomes
[00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:25.560]   not about the other person's suffering,
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:29.220]   but primarily about one's own story of suffering
[00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:32.380]   and that can suppress or literally inhibit
[00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:34.820]   the neural circuits that invoke empathy,
[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:39.940]   then it makes perfectly good neurobiological sense
[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:42.300]   as to why that would at least be possible.
[00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:44.540]   And of course, I don't think it's a good thing.
[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:47.820]   It's just like many aspects of our biology and psychology,
[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:50.340]   it just happens to be the way things are.
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:51.180]   - It is.
[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:53.620]   And I think it really, I think,
[00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:56.300]   I mean, I'm ever the optimist.
[00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:58.780]   I'm also ever the educator, right?
[00:59:58.780 --> 00:59:59.620]   I'm a teacher.
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:01.780]   I'm also very interested in the ways
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:04.880]   that we design educational experiences for young people.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:09.200]   I think the only hope we have to protect ourselves
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:14.200]   against these possibilities is to systematically
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.560]   develop dispositions in ourselves,
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:20.200]   proclivities within ourselves to question our own motives
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:24.280]   and to deconstruct our own assumptions about situations
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:27.960]   and to engage with other people's perspectives
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:29.600]   systematically.
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:32.120]   And when we develop those dispositions,
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:36.680]   the hope is that we are developing within ourselves
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:41.220]   a kind of a veto system, right?
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:44.820]   A system for checking our own motivations
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:49.460]   against other people's experiences of those motivations.
[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:54.460]   And so much of what's leading, I think,
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:56.220]   though now we're going in another direction
[01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:57.480]   and kind of a political direction,
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.540]   but so much what's leading us
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.340]   into these very divisive political types, for example,
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:04.840]   not just, and the rise of authoritarianism,
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:07.320]   not just in the U.S. or the threat of it,
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:10.600]   not just in the U.S., but around many places in the world,
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.800]   all of which by the way are Western educated,
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:17.820]   is that we are taught that to know something
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:19.780]   means you own something in yourself
[01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:21.220]   and then you take that with you
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:22.680]   and you impose it on the world forevermore.
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:24.640]   I know how to do algebra two and I can do it
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.140]   whenever you ask me kind of thing.
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:27.600]   And that's what a good student is.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:31.360]   Where when people learn to engage
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.080]   with their own knowledge states
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:37.600]   in more curious, open-minded, flexible ways,
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.640]   then we dispositionally teach ourselves
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:45.640]   to check our assumptions, to rethink what we think we know,
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.120]   and, and this is key, developmentally,
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.540]   to notice when we need to do that
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.480]   and when we should just plow ahead and it's totally fine.
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:57.920]   And so what we're doing, I think, right now to ourselves,
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.080]   both in the education system
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.400]   and in things like social media,
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.760]   is we're reinforcing our own biases
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.200]   by diving down rabbit holes
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.760]   where you rehear the same thing over and over again
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.880]   that reinforces your own belief systems.
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.880]   And then you come to believe those things
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:15.060]   and those put you on a train toward a particular kind
[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:17.640]   of action or belief system that never becomes deconstructed.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:20.320]   And it's very comfortable and it's easy to do.
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:24.400]   But the responsibility I think we have as individuals
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.400]   and as groups, as humans,
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.560]   given the amazing intelligence we have,
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:31.200]   is to rise above that and actually look back
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.760]   on our own selves reflectively
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.240]   and deconstruct our preferences,
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.480]   deconstruct our values and our beliefs
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:42.000]   and systematically query them specifically
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.760]   around how they impact or influence
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:49.760]   or change the situations of those around us or don't, right?
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:53.400]   The situations and sustainability of the world
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:55.160]   that supports us or don't.
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:59.480]   And so it all comes back to the emotions
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.440]   that drive our thinking.
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:05.200]   So we have these very basic primitive physiological states
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.720]   which vary across individuals,
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.920]   the degree to which they are incredibly powerful,
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.800]   easily evoked versus not.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:12.960]   There's a lot of range in that.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:17.200]   Now, all of that variation makes things interesting, right?
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:21.200]   But it's our ability to learn to experience those
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:24.580]   and to develop wisdom around when we need
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:27.240]   to query our own emotions
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:30.720]   and deconstruct the narratives that we're using
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:34.520]   to validate or substantiate those kinds of emotions
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:40.400]   in order to assess whether we actually are right,
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.480]   whether we should continue
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:48.480]   or whether we should step back and reframe, right?
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:52.800]   And so that kind of mental flexibility
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.360]   really comes out of an emotional disposition.
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.960]   It is our ability.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.460]   So it takes it back to what you were asking
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:03:59.800]   at the very beginning.
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:02.240]   It is our ability to not just drive
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.960]   from what feels like the bottom up,
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:05.740]   which of course is always starting in the top down
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:07.920]   because you've got some interpretation of the world
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:08.840]   that makes you feel fear,
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:11.560]   that makes your body do this, that makes you, right?
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:16.560]   But also to be able to rise above, to transcend
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:21.200]   and think about what are the broader systemic, historical,
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:26.880]   ethical, civic implications of this narrative
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:30.720]   on telling myself which feels default like the truth
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:33.360]   and how might I deconstruct those systematically
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:37.160]   and how might I invite others to give me their version
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.880]   of those events and engage with those systematically
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:42.440]   in order to be able to really appreciate
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:43.920]   the implications of my beliefs.
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:48.840]   And so the bottom line is that the emotions
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.480]   that we're talking about today
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:53.880]   are actually the fundamental drivers
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:57.000]   of all of our thinking, decision-making, relationship
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.480]   building, right?
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:03.040]   Our community lives and our personal wellbeing
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:07.320]   all in one mix, but that doesn't kind of excuse us
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.400]   for acting on their bequest.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:13.880]   It actually imbues us with a responsibility
[01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:17.400]   to then develop dispositions to systematically query those
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:21.140]   and reframe them when they are not serving us
[01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:22.840]   or the world well.
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:27.840]   - Exactly what you said, so much so that I'm a big believer
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:32.000]   in following lots of different types
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.600]   of social media accounts.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.360]   I've taken some heat here and there
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:37.160]   because people automatically assume
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:38.680]   that if you follow an account
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.980]   that you subscribe to that ideology.
[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:43.520]   But I follow many accounts to my disagree
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.320]   with what they say specifically
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:48.220]   so that I can learn different perspectives.
[01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:51.240]   As far as I know, we're the same species,
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.280]   me and these other people.
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.120]   - As far as we are, yes.
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.240]   - And sometimes I wonder,
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.440]   but they probably wonder the same about me.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:58.280]   They wonder too.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:04.260]   And there's enormous range in those accounts that I follow.
[01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:08.440]   And I follow different accounts for different reasons,
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.160]   some for entertainment, some for information,
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.200]   some for challenging myself,
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.840]   some for my desire to be baffled every now and again,
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.200]   but to always return to this idea
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:19.040]   that we are all basically working
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:22.880]   with the same building blocks of neurons and neurochemistry.
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.040]   Some people's dopamine,
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:26.720]   which whether or not you're into Bitcoin
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:29.100]   or traditional currency,
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:32.820]   the one true currency that's universal is dopamine.
[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:34.560]   Everyone's working for dopamine
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:37.800]   and exchanging their own dopamine with world experiences.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:39.880]   But this is one of the reasons why I think it's important
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:44.720]   to not be siloed in one's thinking or exposure
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:47.140]   to different things on social media.
[01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:48.880]   A somewhat controversial statement actually,
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.240]   because I think a lot of people assume
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.040]   that if you follow somebody
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:54.040]   from a particular political party,
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:58.140]   then that means that you vote that political party, et cetera.
[01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:00.300]   But that to me always seemed crazy.
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:02.900]   I'm fortunate to have a good friend who was on this podcast,
[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:06.080]   Rick Rubin, who's an extremely accomplished music producer.
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:07.400]   And he's producing music
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.700]   from essentially every genre of music.
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:10.900]   Punk rock, which is sort of,
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:13.160]   I got my start and still love punk rock music so much,
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.700]   but classical and hip hop and everything in between.
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:18.640]   And Rick is somebody who forages so broadly.
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.040]   And I've really learned to try and forage broadly
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.080]   in terms of ideas and ideologies.
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.880]   And it's, I think a lot of people were just scared
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:26.660]   to be exposed to something that they hate so much
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:27.720]   because they don't like that feeling
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.720]   in their body of disagreement.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:33.040]   - Yeah, dissonance is very,
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.600]   that kind of cognitive dissonance,
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.840]   we call it as very difficult.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:37.480]   It takes work to resolve it.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:39.360]   - Yeah, I guess is there,
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.240]   I like to think there's a way to step back from that
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:43.360]   and observe it, not from a disconnected stance,
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.300]   but from a place of curiosity
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:48.980]   about what's driving those mechanisms in people
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:51.140]   and maybe where we need to adjust our thinking,
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:54.360]   maybe not to adopt their mode of thinking 100%,
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:56.920]   but maybe 10% or 2%.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.740]   I think one of the reasons things are so divisive right now
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:02.500]   is because of social media and the siloing
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:07.740]   or very divergent trajectories of people only following
[01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:09.900]   and listening to and obeying certain kinds of information
[01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:10.900]   and other people the other.
[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:12.840]   And I think the pandemic is the place
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:15.320]   where all that really clashed very heavily
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:18.660]   and continues to clash in other areas too.
[01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:21.640]   Certainly not something that's going to be solved
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:22.920]   inside of this conversation.
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:27.480]   And yet I do have a question that grows
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:29.700]   from this aspect of our discussion,
[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:34.700]   which is what do you think can be done at a concrete level
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:38.520]   in terms of education of younger people,
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:42.000]   as well as education of people who are out of high school
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   and beyond to try and adopt these more encompassing modes
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.120]   of learning and experiencing the world?
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.880]   I mean, it's one thing to say,
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.800]   expose yourself to lots of different ideas.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:59.940]   It's another to understand how to do that
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:02.340]   in a way that is adaptive.
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:05.520]   And any ideas you have, I think would,
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:07.980]   I know I and the audience would really appreciate
[01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:12.980]   and feel free to make this an editorial or map back to data.
[01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:16.100]   I mean, obviously this is your wheelhouse.
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:17.820]   This is your expertise.
[01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:20.640]   So I'm curious, what should we do?
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.500]   Should I send my family members
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:25.260]   who have very divergent political beliefs from me
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:28.980]   information to the contrary of their thinking,
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:30.540]   or what do I do?
[01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:31.860]   And what do I do for me?
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:33.340]   What should we all be doing
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:37.100]   with our 10 year olds and ourselves?
[01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:39.220]   - Well, I won't comment on,
[01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:41.520]   should you send your family members,
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:43.380]   there's other people that do that.
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:45.100]   They do that work and they know how to-
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:47.220]   - We're always frustrating each other over text messages.
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:48.060]   It's okay.
[01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:48.880]   - It's okay.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:49.720]   - It can't get any worse.
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:50.700]   - Yeah, no.
[01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:52.940]   - We all love each other anyway.
[01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:55.740]   - But one thing I really do think a lot about in this
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:58.500]   is the way in which we educate our young people
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:09:59.940]   and what do we do with our 10 year olds, right?
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:02.720]   And like the first thing I'll say about your 10 year old,
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:03.860]   I don't know if you actually have a 10 year old,
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:07.060]   but is query them about their beliefs.
[01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:08.760]   When they follow something,
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:11.540]   when they think something's impressive or bad,
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.540]   or ask them why.
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:16.960]   Teach them to unpack their own beliefs.
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:19.380]   That doesn't mean that you don't
[01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:21.040]   still hold them necessarily.
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.140]   It doesn't mean that you adopt the opposite belief, right?
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:26.360]   If I talk to someone who has a very different value system
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:29.020]   than I do and I disagree with them, that's legitimate.
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:33.620]   But in deciding that I disagree,
[01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:38.080]   I have sort of revisited my own belief and queried it.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.220]   I've externalized it a little bit,
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:41.540]   made that thinking visible.
[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:43.360]   It's why we talk about it in education.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:46.460]   That's David Perkins at Harvard talks about it that way.
[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:47.780]   Making your thinking visible
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:49.700]   and then examining that thinking.
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:54.700]   And so I think one really important step
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:11:00.700]   that a society will have to take or we won't make it.
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:03.400]   And I know that sounds a little dramatic,
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:06.440]   but I actually think it's true, sadly.
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.620]   And I'm starting to think it's more and more true,
[01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:11.500]   is that we need to really get brave
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:14.660]   about how we think about the process
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:16.300]   of educating our young people.
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:20.340]   And what it actually means to expose young people
[01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:25.340]   to developmentally appropriate, age appropriate,
[01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:29.760]   opportunities to grow themselves as thinkers,
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:33.500]   as individuals and as civic agents and community members.
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:38.500]   I think that our Western designed education system
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:45.420]   has in it some very basic beliefs about what counts
[01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:50.340]   as knowing and what is worth thinking about
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:53.760]   and knowing about and how do I know that?
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:56.260]   How do I test you on that?
[01:11:56.260 --> 01:12:01.260]   That I think they are deeply problematic and lead us.
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:03.520]   I mean, I know this is a strong statement,
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:08.520]   but they lead us to a place where we are actively punished,
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.800]   not just not encouraged,
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.680]   but I would say actively discouraged
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:17.840]   from really playing with ideas,
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:20.580]   engaging systematically with our own beliefs,
[01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:22.240]   deconstructing those beliefs
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:25.400]   and engaging with complex perspectives on topics and ideas.
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:29.300]   That is just not what school is about.
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:32.940]   And it needs to be, we need to shift.
[01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:37.700]   So right now, the way in which we think about school
[01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:40.880]   is about, is basically judged by quote unquote,
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.720]   learning outcomes, right?
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:44.840]   What have you learned and how do we know that?
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:48.320]   We make you demonstrated by yourself under time pressure
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:50.180]   in a particular setting, right?
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:51.020]   Or you're gonna come back
[01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:52.700]   and I'm gonna give you a question
[01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:54.820]   and you're gonna give me the answer I had in mind.
[01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:57.080]   And if you do that in time, then I'll say you learned it.
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:58.960]   And now we're done, check, right?
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:03.800]   As compared to a system,
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:05.720]   and there are educational systems like this.
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:08.220]   This is not, there are people,
[01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:10.960]   for example, the performance assessment consortium
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:14.040]   in New York City is a consortium of public schools,
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.920]   some of which do this extraordinarily well.
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:20.860]   They have a dispensation from the New York state government
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:22.980]   not to give the Regents exam
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:24.840]   as their graduation requirements
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:28.160]   and their benchmarks of learning,
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:31.000]   but instead to have alternative ways of assessing kids
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.160]   where kids work for months to years,
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:37.680]   depending on the project on these in depth,
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:40.080]   intellectual multidisciplinary projects
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:42.280]   where they explore a topic
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:44.480]   and they engage with their own process
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:46.040]   of learning about that topic.
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:49.480]   And they bring in teachers and community experts
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.200]   and other people and they present their work
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.520]   and then they query the work
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:55.780]   and they talk about their own learning process
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:58.260]   and what could happen next and what decisions they made
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:13:59.860]   and all these kinds of things. - It's like a graduate thesis.
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:01.020]   - Exactly.
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:05.320]   You have to invent not just the work, but the question.
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.040]   You need to look at the world
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.700]   and notice what it is we're not understanding
[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:11.960]   that we would benefit from understanding
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:16.960]   and find a way to isolate and systematically query that.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:21.160]   Why don't we build education systems
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.240]   from preschool all the way up
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.280]   that engage people systematically
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:31.520]   in that kind of intellectual curiosity?
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:32.600]   We don't do that.
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:36.220]   So we know that little kids education, preschool education,
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:38.820]   if you don't have the water table and the sand table
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:40.220]   and the cool stuff and the choices
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:41.960]   and the ways to engage with each other
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:45.360]   and all the stuff being really age appropriate
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.360]   for three-year-olds to touch and smush
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.480]   and try to taste and whatever else,
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:51.000]   they're gonna be a mess on the floor.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:51.880]   They're just not gonna come.
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:54.280]   They're gonna refuse to come to school, right?
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:56.120]   And they're gonna be laying in the doorway
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:57.760]   throwing temper tantrums, right?
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:00.740]   But as, so we know how to do little kid education well,
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:01.800]   it doesn't mean we always do it,
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:04.240]   but we know that they need to be intrigued.
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:06.960]   They need to be invited to think
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:08.980]   and they bring their natural curiosity
[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:11.920]   and then you expand the range of ways
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:14.040]   they can leverage that curiosity
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:15.760]   to discover new things they hadn't known
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:17.300]   to think about before, right?
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:23.640]   Then we get to the standard quote unquote educational system
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:28.120]   and we somehow think that that natural human proclivity
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:31.080]   to engage curiously and meaningfully
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:35.080]   with deep thinking about ideas and the world
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:39.240]   is like inefficient and inappropriate and frightening
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:43.300]   and we teach kids, no, no, no, no, no, turn that off.
[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:45.500]   It's dangerous.
[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:48.520]   If you do it, it's considered insubordinate, right?
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.160]   And what we want you instead to do
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:52.300]   is just let me give you
[01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:54.580]   what I've already figured out for you.
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:56.240]   I'm going to give it to you
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.240]   and you are going to give it back to me.
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:15:59.880]   - So it seems to me that in the way
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:02.700]   that things actually happen in school,
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:06.600]   what is created is a kind of desire
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.280]   for the kid to be a computer, not a human.
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:12.200]   And they do have a dopamine system, however.
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.480]   And so what becomes the buzz,
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:17.580]   the emotional buzz is performance.
[01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:19.640]   If it becomes a buzz at all.
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:22.420]   So for the kids that don't get that buzz from performance
[01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:25.780]   or they don't intrinsically love the math or the English
[01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:27.340]   or the books that they're being presented with
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:31.060]   or whatever the subject happens to be,
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:33.360]   or maybe they only like one or two things,
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:36.320]   then they emotionally dissociate
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.360]   from the rest of the material.
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.940]   I'm actually describing a bit of myself in high school.
[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:43.800]   I was not, I barely finished high school.
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:46.180]   - I dropped out of sixth grade for a few months.
[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:47.320]   Yeah, it didn't work for me.
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:49.500]   - Yeah, I eventually got back to it.
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:52.320]   And as I imagine you did too,
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:53.960]   'cause we ended up as academics.
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:57.300]   But I think what you're describing is so key.
[01:16:57.300 --> 01:16:59.640]   And I never thought about it from the perspective of,
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:00.720]   oh yeah, as young kids,
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:02.380]   we're given all the things that are going to drive
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:05.040]   our sensory world in the appropriate ways,
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.080]   touch and sound and-
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:08.580]   - And our minds, right?
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:11.000]   We're trying to build meaning in our mind.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.300]   - And that we get to, as students, very young learners,
[01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:18.440]   impose some of our own intrinsic motivation
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:19.780]   to do certain things and not others.
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:22.460]   And that isn't supported as we're adults.
[01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:23.660]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:26.360]   and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.620]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:31.260]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:32.760]   to help you better understand your body
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.620]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:37.380]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:39.540]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:41.540]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:44.180]   can only be assessed with a quality blood test.
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:46.140]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:48.580]   however, is that they'll give you information
[01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:51.740]   about certain lipid markers or hormone markers,
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:54.780]   but no information about what to do with all of that data.
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:56.900]   InsideTracker makes it very easy to look at your levels
[01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:59.820]   of hormones, metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:02.900]   and then to assess what sorts of behavioral, nutritional,
[01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:04.820]   supplementation, or perhaps other interventions
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:07.240]   you might want to use in order to bring those numbers
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:09.520]   into the ranges that are optimal for your health.
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:11.540]   InsideTracker's ultimate plan now includes
[01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:14.100]   three new hormone markers that are critical to measure
[01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:16.620]   during a woman's reproductive and menopausal years.
[01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:18.500]   These are estradiol, progesterone,
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.420]   and thyroid stimulating hormone.
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:21.820]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:24.740]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:27.380]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.

[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:34.760]   What you're describing is so vital.
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:38.540]   What age do you think this cliffs off?
[01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:41.660]   So, okay, so in preschool, kids are allowed to do this.
[01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:42.900]   In kindergarten, they're allowed to do it.
[01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:45.060]   First grade, they're allowed to do it in most schools.
[01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:48.900]   But at what point is the expectation imposed on kids
[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:53.900]   to become little rote learning computer machines
[01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:57.300]   and to get their dopamine from performance
[01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:00.260]   rather from intrinsic pleasure in what they're learning?
[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:01.260]   - In thinking about, yeah.
[01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:03.140]   - And also, how do we address this issue
[01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:05.220]   that there are certain basic skills
[01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:07.100]   that not everyone is going to perform well at?
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:09.460]   And so for the kid that says, "I don't like math."
[01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:10.900]   - Well, you still have to learn it.
[01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:12.020]   You need to appreciate it.
[01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:15.460]   So how do you conjure up a joy
[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:17.700]   or an appreciation in that kid?
[01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:20.020]   I mean, it seems like a hard thing.
[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:21.880]   I mean, I eventually set myself
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:26.320]   along an academic trajectory that worked out,
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:29.660]   but that was initially just out of pure fear
[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:32.040]   because my life was really bad.
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:35.460]   Circumstances in myself made it bad.
[01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:37.780]   And I was rescuing myself
[01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:40.740]   from basically becoming more of a loser.
[01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:42.260]   So I was like, "Okay, school's the thing."
[01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:43.140]   And I did school.
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:47.260]   And that was the turn hard right into academics for me.
[01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:48.720]   But what do you do for the person
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:51.660]   who really doesn't like math
[01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:53.280]   because they're struggling with it
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:55.500]   or doesn't like biology or psychology?
[01:19:55.500 --> 01:20:00.500]   I mean, how do we evoke at least an appreciation for that?
[01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:03.100]   It sounds like the emotion system
[01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:07.380]   is the key system to leverage in order to learn.
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:09.100]   And so could you talk about the relationship
[01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:11.340]   between emotion and learning?
[01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:15.420]   'Cause I realize this is really the center of what you do.
[01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:17.420]   - So, I mean, you could say it this way, right?
[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:20.020]   So whatever you're having emotion about
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:23.020]   is what you're thinking about, right?
[01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:24.500]   And whatever you're thinking about,
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:26.540]   you could hope to learn about.
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:28.020]   Remember something from, right?
[01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:29.700]   Understand differently.
[01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.900]   So the key question for educators
[01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:35.080]   is everybody's always having some kind of emotions
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:38.360]   all the time unless you're dead or unconscious.
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:42.540]   What are people's emotions about in this space?
[01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:44.800]   If the emotions, because whatever those emotions are about,
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:45.860]   that is what you're learning about.
[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:47.600]   So if the emotions are about the outcomes,
[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:48.440]   did I get it right?
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:49.260]   Am I gonna flunk?
[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:50.100]   Did I get an A plus?
[01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:50.940]   I'm so smart, I'm so stupid.
[01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:52.640]   Any one of those, right?
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:55.520]   If those are the main drivers,
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:57.640]   then that is what you're learning about.
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:02.640]   If the emotions are about the actual ideas in play,
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.440]   the math, the physics,
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:06.520]   the why does the ball roll down the ramp?
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:07.800]   Wait a minute, that's the same as why
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:08.640]   the moon goes around.
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:09.460]   You know what I mean?
[01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:11.020]   Like there are, right?
[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:13.640]   When the emotions are about ideas,
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:17.100]   then what you're engaging with is learning about ideas.
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:20.520]   And so what I would argue is that in setting up
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:23.900]   the kind of accountability system we have,
[01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:28.900]   we have taught people that their emotion
[01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:31.860]   should be about these high stakes accountability measures,
[01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:35.360]   which means that's what we're learning how to think about.
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.200]   - Perform.
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:39.900]   - Perform, not how to think about the ideas,
[01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:43.820]   not the intrinsic power of using math
[01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:47.040]   to understand the world in a different way.
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:50.120]   So how do you engage kids, right?
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:55.120]   You engage kids by setting out rich problem spaces
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:22:01.620]   that in problems that invite them to try to engage
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:03.540]   with something that peaks your curiosity,
[01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:06.820]   that's meaningful to them, or have them bring in,
[01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:07.980]   where the kid who really hates it,
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:10.980]   like what is it that you do find interesting kid, right?
[01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:14.540]   Start there, start there and start using
[01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:18.280]   your academic skills in a way that will give you power
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.280]   to do what it is you're interested in doing.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:23.780]   That's the way in, use your writing, use your math,
[01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:26.240]   use your persuasive argument skills,
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:28.740]   use your filmmaking skills, whatever it is,
[01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:32.300]   to tell the story of something that you find
[01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:35.600]   deeply, meaningfully powerful to understand.
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:37.800]   And all of a sudden you need the math.
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:39.700]   Kids actually say things like,
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:44.700]   like there's this lovely long quote
[01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:49.500]   from a Sudanese immigrant kid in one of these New York schools
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:54.060]   with the performance assessments in an article I wrote
[01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:56.060]   with a colleague named Doug Connect.
[01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:58.660]   The article is called Building Meaning Builds Teens' Brains.
[01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:00.740]   You can find it in Educational Leadership.
[01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:02.460]   There's a big long quote from this kid at the end,
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:05.060]   and he's basically explaining what math class meant to him,
[01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:06.900]   which he had never passed a math class before.
[01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:10.980]   And he says he got this problem called walking to the door,
[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:12.580]   which is basically Zeno's paradox, right?
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:14.140]   You get halfway to the door, halfway to the door,
[01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:14.980]   halfway to the door.
[01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:15.800]   Do you ever get to the door?
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:16.740]   Why or why not, right?
[01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:19.980]   And they spent months learning the math
[01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:21.740]   that would help them get at that problem.
[01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:26.140]   And he talks about how I had a problem, he says,
[01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:28.540]   and I had to learn fractions.
[01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:32.860]   I had to in order to be able to solve the problem I had.
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:37.220]   And as I engaged with fractions and that problem,
[01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:41.180]   I got fascinated, he says, by finite and infinite.
[01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:45.520]   And these ideas were driving my need
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:48.160]   to learn to do fractions, right?
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:50.800]   So we've got the cart before the horse.
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:52.600]   I'm not saying you don't have to learn math
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:54.040]   or you don't have to learn to read or write
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:56.360]   or do all these other kinds of skills,
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:01.200]   but we make those, which is in the horse's cart,
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:04.260]   what's in the cart, we call that the metric
[01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:05.960]   of the education system and the aim of it,
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:08.400]   when in fact it's the quality of the horse.
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.720]   Can that horse pull the thing, right?
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:13.240]   That's the development of the person
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:14.800]   and what they put in their cart
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:17.360]   then serves that development.
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:20.320]   It's the toolkit of ways of knowing and understanding
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:23.260]   that come with you as you move into the world.
[01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:26.540]   But this takes real, real developmental skill
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:27.740]   on the part of educators, right?
[01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:32.540]   Who are not supported or resourced or trained
[01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:34.660]   to think about development in these ways.
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:36.520]   I mean, so you asked, when does this fall off?
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:38.460]   It really depends in what school system you are
[01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:41.220]   and in what demographic you are when it falls off.
[01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:44.940]   But for almost everybody, except for the privileged few
[01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:47.600]   who are in very progressive alternative schools,
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:49.760]   it falls off by adolescence,
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:52.500]   which is when school gets serious
[01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:56.160]   and it's also ironically when developmentally,
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:00.140]   kids are developing the neural capacity
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:03.920]   and the psychosocial capacity and the drive
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:07.100]   to infer complex narrative meaning
[01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:09.000]   from the things they are doing.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.820]   You know, these aren't just my shoes.
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:13.200]   These are a statement about, you know,
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:17.100]   what I believe about sustainability and about sports
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:20.000]   and about adults and counterculture, right?
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000]   And as we grow into a space where we're driven
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.700]   to try to, you know, challenge and think about big meanings
[01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:30.560]   and engage with perspectives and emotions and social issues
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:33.600]   and broad, important existential questions,
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.840]   be they in physics or be they in art
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:40.140]   or be they in the social civic domain, right?
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:41.840]   What do we do?
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:46.840]   We double down on controlling the input and the output
[01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:50.340]   transactional mechanisms that count as quote, unquote,
[01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:53.340]   academic rigor and achievement, right?
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:55.020]   We start to ask kids, you know,
[01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:59.040]   what's the name of the servant who shows up in the scene
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:01.380]   and great expectations, right?
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:03.620]   Is it Molly or is it Maria, right?
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:05.540]   And it's, you know, like who the heck knows?
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:08.640]   And that is not the point of leading great expectations,
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:09.480]   right?
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:13.260]   We take away because we're afraid.
[01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:16.300]   As educators, as society, we've got this narrative
[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:19.540]   around young peoples in particular,
[01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:24.220]   but everyone's propensity to build and construct
[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:27.380]   meaning in these spaces and self in these spaces,
[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:30.300]   that agency frightens us because we're worried
[01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:31.220]   they're gonna take risks,
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:32.300]   they're gonna do something stupid,
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.860]   they're gonna, they're going to fall off the track,
[01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:38.620]   they're gonna not make it in the traditional system.
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:42.900]   And in trying to protect them and shield them
[01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:46.460]   from their own curiosities, their own dispositions
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:48.940]   for meaning-making, we, I would argue,
[01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:52.820]   actually stunt their ability to grow themselves
[01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:55.020]   to the point where we have mental health crises,
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:58.860]   literally crises in mental health right now in adolescence
[01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:01.020]   across demographic groups to the point--
[01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:03.620]   - Especially bad in young girls, as I understand.
[01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:04.700]   - Yes, that's right.
[01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:06.660]   - But bad across-- - But it's bad in everybody
[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:08.120]   and it's worse in girls.
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:10.260]   Yes, we don't fully understand why that is.
[01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:13.740]   I'll get some suggestions.
[01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:20.500]   What we're really doing is actually producing people
[01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:25.220]   who are gutted of their own inner drive
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:29.780]   to become someone who thinks powerfully
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:31.420]   in the space of the world.
[01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:35.700]   We are frightened to let our young people have that power,
[01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:39.700]   which is the role of adults is to wrap around young people
[01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:44.700]   and help them learn to be reflective,
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:48.460]   to be systematic, to be rigorous with themselves
[01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:53.160]   as they develop the capacities and dispositions
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:55.020]   to deconstruct their own beliefs,
[01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:57.160]   to deconstruct their own aims and goals
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:58.660]   and the ways they understand the world
[01:27:58.660 --> 01:28:01.660]   and to rebuild them iteratively over and over
[01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:06.420]   in this sort of intellectually humble, curious way
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:08.820]   where we're constantly querying ourselves,
[01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:10.620]   constantly querying other people,
[01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:12.840]   where we're willing to sit with uncertainty
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:16.300]   in complex problem spaces and think through
[01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:18.460]   the possibilities rather than settle quickly
[01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:19.600]   onto one solution.
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.580]   What does school expect you to do?
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:23.380]   Settle immediately onto one solution,
[01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:25.620]   which by the way is the solution I already had in mind
[01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:27.700]   when I gave you the question, right?
[01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:30.700]   As compared to sitting with young people
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:34.660]   and allowing them in safe and appropriate ways
[01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:37.260]   the space in which to actually grapple
[01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:39.620]   with complex, powerful questions.
[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:42.900]   When kids develop the proclivities to do that,
[01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:47.740]   they learn how to manage those very human capacities
[01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:49.460]   that we've been talking about the whole time
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:52.100]   that can lead to terrible evil
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:54.620]   as well as amazing virtuousness.
[01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:58.840]   They learn to appreciate and manage those capacities
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:00.380]   within their own selves.
[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:02.740]   - I think so much of what we see in terms of these
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:06.260]   quote unquote failure to launch examples are,
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:09.380]   'cause I know some of these, the children of friends,
[01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:14.120]   really, really smart kids that didn't map well to the system
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:18.100]   and therefore are not doing well, really struggling
[01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:21.140]   and clearly have the intellectual power.
[01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:23.100]   It just wasn't served up to them
[01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:25.620]   and school wasn't served up to them in a way that were-
[01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:27.540]   - Yeah, that just says as much about the system
[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:28.980]   as it does about the kid, right?
[01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:32.060]   - Yeah, I teach a course at Stanford
[01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:34.020]   to the medical students that every first year
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:36.120]   medical student takes about neuroscience.
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:36.960]   It's team taught.
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:41.960]   It's a phenomenal course because of the range of expertise
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:44.120]   in the teaching that comes through.
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:46.700]   And one thing I've noticed is that
[01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:50.260]   they're all phenomenal teachers,
[01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:54.580]   but the best instructors do two things simultaneously
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:55.960]   when they teach.
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:57.500]   First of all, they come to the table
[01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.940]   with incredible expertise, obviously.
[01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:01.780]   - Yes, you have to deeply understand
[01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:02.700]   what you're trying to get at
[01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:04.380]   if you want people to engage with ideas.
[01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:06.980]   - Yeah, they are true luminaries in their respective fields,
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:09.540]   addiction, pain, memory.
[01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:12.680]   Every system of the body and brain
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:14.700]   that relates to the nervous system
[01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:16.180]   is taught in this course.
[01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:18.460]   But that I've noticed every once in a while
[01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:20.680]   that there's a subset of them
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:23.520]   that as they teach from that position of expertise,
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:26.000]   not only are they clear, not only are they engaging,
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.660]   not only are their slides sparse enough to understand,
[01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:33.440]   but rich enough to include all the relevant detail,
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:36.220]   but they also flip back and forth
[01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:39.120]   from the position of expert
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:42.140]   to the position of novice learning it for the first time.
[01:30:42.140 --> 01:30:44.160]   - That's that intellectual curiosity
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:45.360]   that they're keeping alive.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:48.340]   They have this disposition we're talking about cultivating.
[01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:49.180]   Sorry to cut you off, but that's right.
[01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:51.180]   - No, please do.
[01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:53.600]   As academics, we're familiar with that, right?
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:56.740]   Interrupting in the landscape of academics,
[01:30:56.740 --> 01:30:58.800]   interrupting is a sign of interest.
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:01.280]   I think Carol Dweck was the one who told me that.
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:02.120]   - Did she?
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:02.940]   Okay, she's right.
[01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:03.780]   - She's right.
[01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:04.940]   - Carol says she's right.
[01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:06.040]   The great Carol Dweck.
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:08.860]   And so, but I've seen this, especially,
[01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:13.580]   so there are some topics that I like to think
[01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:16.060]   that I might do this reflexively for,
[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:18.400]   because for instance, I started off in neural development
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:20.600]   and I adore the topic.
[01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:22.240]   So I can't teach neural development
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:27.240]   without being completely blown away in the positive sense
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:29.000]   of how a brain develops.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.740]   I've still never taught this or done a podcast on it
[01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:34.560]   because it tends to require visuals.
[01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:36.960]   And we don't use those because the podcast,
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:39.000]   most people listen to the podcast,
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.120]   but maybe I'll do something just for YouTube at some point.
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:45.600]   But I think it's the same experience occurs
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:49.480]   when I see somebody like Dr. Sean Mackey,
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:51.960]   who runs our pain clinic at Stanford,
[01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:54.000]   teach about pain and the systems of the body
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.380]   that relate to pain and emotion
[01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:58.860]   and how to cure certain forms of pain, et cetera,
[01:31:58.860 --> 01:31:59.860]   treat pain.
[01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:03.360]   It's like he's clearly the world expert,
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:05.280]   but the way he describes the system,
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:08.400]   you can tell he's learning it again for the first time
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:09.720]   in parallel to all of that.
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:13.620]   And I feel like that ignites the emotional systems
[01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:17.480]   of the learner's brain in such a powerful way
[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:19.400]   that is distinct from just hearing an expert
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:20.440]   talk about something.
[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:22.920]   - He's not relaying, he's not a squirrel with nuts
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:24.320]   and giving all the nuts to the kids.
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:27.320]   He's inventing the knowledge in front of them, right?
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:28.920]   - That's a great way to put it.
[01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:33.200]   As usual, others are more succinct in collecting my ideas
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:34.660]   and expressing them than I am.
[01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:37.920]   So I think that's a powerful thing.
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:41.460]   I went to a high school that has a kind of
[01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:42.680]   a split reputation.
[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:44.620]   It's known as being one of the best public high schools
[01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:45.460]   in the country.
[01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:47.820]   It's also the high school that at least for a while
[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:50.060]   had one of the highest suicide rates in the country.
[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:55.060]   It's written up in various newspapers and so on.
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:58.960]   And so much so that nowadays they forbid the kids there
[01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:02.580]   from meeting more than an hour before school
[01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:04.480]   to practice for the standardized tests.
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:05.480]   By the way, when I was at school,
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:07.680]   the only thing that school represented for me in high school
[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:10.440]   was something that came between breakfast and skateboarding.
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:12.120]   And frankly, I wasn't in school a lot.
[01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:13.960]   And I don't recommend that kids go to school,
[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:14.800]   stay in school.
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:16.220]   I missed a lot of school.
[01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:17.560]   - I traveled all over the place
[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:19.360]   and did all kinds of weird things.
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:23.200]   - I had a lot of making up to do in college as a consequence.
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:25.120]   So stay in school, get the basics.
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:27.600]   But this is actually where I'd like to go.
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:30.560]   You have a very interesting trajectory.
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:32.280]   Here you are, you're a university professor,
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:35.280]   you study emotion and learning and many other things
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:37.960]   across cultures and adolescence
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:40.760]   and so many other important topics.
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:45.760]   But you are not a story of like growing up
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:48.480]   in an academic family, you grew up on a farm.
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:50.920]   - Sort of gentleman's farm.
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:54.120]   My dad was a surgeon, but we had animals in a farm
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:58.040]   and my parents tried to have us growing the things we ate.
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:00.160]   - You've had a number of different experiences
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:02.160]   that we were talking about before we started recording.
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:04.480]   But one of the things that you mentioned
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:08.000]   was getting involved in education
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.120]   where you were exposed to students
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:14.680]   who had very different backgrounds than you.
[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:16.720]   Maybe you could just talk a little bit about
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:18.040]   sort of the nodes of your experience.
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.680]   So you grew up on this farm
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:21.680]   and then maybe just hit some of the other nodes.
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:24.200]   And then let's take a foray into
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:28.320]   when you first got exposed to educating others.
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:30.400]   And because I think that's an important backdrop
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:32.680]   for what we've been talking about here
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:34.000]   and serves as a jumping off point
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.880]   for where I'd like to go next.
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:36.720]   - I'll just jump in.
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:37.840]   I mean, it's always hard to talk about yourself.
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:39.440]   I don't know what's interesting and what's not.
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:41.200]   You don't mean it to me, it's just me.
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:43.720]   - I think what's interesting is knowing
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:47.440]   where you've been and the things that marked,
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:51.560]   that mapped back to your emotional networks
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:54.560]   in a way that for you feel like that mattered
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:56.440]   in terms of what you're doing now.
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:58.360]   - As a little kid, I remember,
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:03.520]   even as a little kid, not liking school.
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:04.360]   I was a very good kid.
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:05.880]   I was a very well-behaved kid.
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:08.840]   I went to a decent public school.
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:11.160]   But just the whole idea of it,
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:13.360]   I just always felt like I had two left feet.
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:15.320]   It never felt like it was really me there.
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:18.160]   I was always trying to escape a little bit.
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:20.280]   Thinking about when I first started educating others,
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:24.000]   and my first memory of educating others specifically
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.440]   that comes to mind is I was six
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:28.920]   and I went on a little vacation in the summer
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:32.280]   to stay with my cousins in Petoskey, Michigan,
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:33.800]   which is a place on Lake Michigan
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:37.240]   where there are these stones where there's,
[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:38.680]   my understanding from when I was six
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:40.880]   is that there are these 200 million year old
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:43.080]   fossilized worms in these stones.
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:44.120]   And you can see 'em when you look at this.
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:46.400]   There's like little worms and you can see 'em, yeah.
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:50.480]   So I just was fascinated by these stones,
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:54.000]   that these are actual fossilized 200 million year old worms.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.120]   And I don't know if that number's correct.
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:56.240]   That's what I remember from age six.
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:59.160]   So some paleontologists out there can correct me.
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:00.640]   But I collected these stones
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:03.440]   and I went to the little local exhibit they had
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:04.560]   at the library or whatever,
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:05.600]   and I learned about these stones,
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:07.560]   and I brought some back and somehow,
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:11.000]   somebody thought to ask me to teach my second grade class
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.240]   when I started school about these stones.
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:14.800]   And I just remember,
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:15.760]   I don't know how I got asked to do this,
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:18.600]   but I remember standing in front of my class
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:20.880]   and talking about these stones
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:23.000]   and just looking around the room and suddenly noticing,
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.400]   you know that feeling when you're lecturing
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:25.720]   and you think, oh my God,
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:27.000]   they're fascinated by what I'm saying.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.440]   Like every kid is looking at me and like, holy crap.
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:33.200]   You know, like, and I was, so I'm like, all right,
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:34.040]   I'll keep going.
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:35.240]   I'll tell you some more about these stones.
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:36.680]   And I passed them around and whatever.
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:37.960]   And it must have been okay
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:39.840]   because I was then asked to give that talk
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:41.120]   all the way up to the fifth graders
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:42.080]   who were way older than me.
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:43.560]   - You were a professor, you were a professor.
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:46.840]   - So I was already fascinated by the natural world
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:49.880]   and able to like make meaning out of something
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:51.520]   in a way that inspired other people,
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:53.440]   if I can be so blunt as to say that.
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:56.160]   And yet I was constantly in trouble at school
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:57.600]   for not having my homework.
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:59.520]   Like I was just, you know,
[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:02.120]   the feeling of release on the Friday afternoon
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:04.960]   and the feeling of dread on Sunday evening
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:07.720]   is hard to like describe, you know?
[01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:11.400]   And I went to a reasonably well-resourced school, you know?
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:16.280]   Anyway, fast forward up to when I was older.
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:19.800]   I mean, I was just always fascinated by,
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:22.120]   and I think some of this comes from my mom too,
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:24.520]   trying to, you know, speak different languages,
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:26.120]   engage with people who are different than myself,
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:27.120]   just have conversations.
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:29.120]   So from the time I was old enough
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:31.280]   to barely qualify to do these programs,
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:34.240]   my parents had the resources luckily
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:35.760]   to be able to let me to do these things.
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:38.320]   But I, you know, I went off to France
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:40.280]   and stayed on a farm there for a summer
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:42.680]   and went to, you know, Ireland.
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:44.120]   I went to Russia.
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:44.960]   By the time I was 18,
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:46.800]   I was working with these little kids off the street
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:49.600]   and camping with them in Southern Siberia
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:51.400]   and all these kinds of things.
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:52.240]   When I went-
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:53.080]   - Was it as cold as they say in Siberia?
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:57.360]   - It was gloomy and rainy and muddy and cold.
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:58.800]   Yes, yeah.
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:00.400]   - Siberia always sounds so bleak.
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:03.280]   My parents threatened many times to send me there.
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:05.560]   - Yeah, no, that's a real threat.
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:07.160]   I mean, it's beautiful in many ways,
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:10.280]   but yeah, it was sad, it was a sad, sad story.
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:15.720]   Anyway, you know, I think what I was trying to do
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:19.840]   was actually learn by doing, by being,
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:22.200]   by engaging with other people who knew things I didn't,
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:25.000]   learning how to, you know, build things.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.320]   I was always really interested in woodworking
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:28.160]   and boat building.
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:30.280]   I went to Kenya and spent eight months there
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:31.520]   as an undergraduate, right?
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:34.240]   Documenting this traditional Dow construction
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:35.960]   in a Northern coast of Kenya.
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:40.920]   The Dow, which are sailboats, sailboat construction,
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:42.840]   where they have no electricity and everything.
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:43.680]   - Cabinetry?
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:44.760]   - Yeah, cabinetry.
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:45.600]   You know what I mean?
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:46.920]   - You can actually build furniture.
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:48.640]   So when people say they built furniture,
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:50.520]   but they basically assembled a key of furniture,
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:51.360]   we're not talking about that.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:55.760]   - I have built cabinets and built-in bookshelves
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:56.600]   and furniture.
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:58.320]   Some of my friends have pieces I've made for them.
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:01.360]   I never made anything for myself, so I don't have anything.
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:04.680]   But yeah, I mean, I think I was really torn
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:06.600]   between trying to build things
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.680]   and learn by engaging with other people
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:10.320]   and in these different cultural spaces.
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:14.920]   You know, being a woman in a cabinet shop in Connecticut
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:17.920]   is really not a cultural space that I had grown up in
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:19.000]   and then gone, you know what I mean?
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.560]   And yet, right, moving myself and changing myself
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:25.200]   to adapt to these different situations
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:28.840]   somehow felt like learning to me, I think.
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:31.160]   And I ended up in a strange situation
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:34.840]   where I cut my hand opening a window at a job site
[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:37.280]   and I needed to, I was on workers' comp,
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:39.480]   and I had to take some time to let it heal
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:41.240]   and I couldn't run machinery.
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:42.920]   So I had to figure out what to do with myself.
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:45.320]   I was 23 years old and I was not gonna go back to my parents
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:46.840]   for more money, right?
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:48.080]   So I thought I have to support myself.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:52.320]   So I thought, okay, I went to college
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.440]   at a high-level Ivy League school
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:59.200]   and I majored in French because I could.
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:00.040]   That's basically why.
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:01.280]   I was like, I don't know, I better finish.
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:02.120]   I better not flunk.
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:02.960]   I can do French.
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:04.520]   I know, I speak French fluently.
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:06.880]   I'll do a French literature major and done with it quickly.
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:08.680]   Then I'm like, what am I gonna do with myself?
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:12.080]   I never thought I could be a scientist, but I loved science.
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:15.320]   So I just went around taking like a year of every science.
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:17.720]   I took a year of astronomy and a year of biology
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:21.960]   and a year of physics and a year of human anthropology,
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:25.120]   paleoanthropology, like all these things, psychology,
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:28.760]   and realized, holy crap, this is super interesting.
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:33.160]   You can study how babies think and the natural world
[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:39.520]   and then also be bringing sort of a scientific lens to bear
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:42.040]   that helps you understand things in a new way.
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:46.920]   So here I was as a 23-year-old with a cut hand
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:48.720]   and I thought, what am I gonna do with myself?
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:51.440]   I convinced the Massachusetts Board of Education
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:55.120]   that I had the background knowledge
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:41:00.120]   to be able to teach some sections of AP biology and physics
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:02.560]   that they had in their high school.
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:07.080]   So when I got to, I finally got an interview
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:09.920]   with this public school district in South Boston
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:11.480]   where they were desperate for a teacher.
[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:12.840]   Like I'm noticing in the Boston Globe,
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:13.920]   we're two weeks into the school year
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:16.320]   and you still don't have a teacher, you know what I mean?
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:17.720]   Why don't you take me?
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:21.520]   And managed to convince the Massachusetts Board of Education
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:23.280]   to give me provisional teacher certification
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:25.160]   based on the coursework I'd done
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:26.560]   and how well I did in that coursework
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:28.440]   'cause I was really super motivated.
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:30.440]   I did extremely well in all of it.
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:33.400]   And when I got there, they basically said
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:34.880]   when I showed up for the interview,
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:39.100]   the high school teacher wants to take those AP classes.
[01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:41.320]   Can you just teach full-time seventh grade?
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:43.000]   So I was like, okay.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:48.000]   So I had my full contingent of 130 kids, right?
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.640]   Seventh graders coming through my classroom
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:53.420]   and the middle school had just been shut down
[01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:55.500]   because there wasn't sufficient funding in the town for it.
[01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:56.700]   So they had taken the middle school kids
[01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:59.520]   and pushed them into the high school space.
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:01.860]   What that basically meant is I suddenly found myself
[01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:05.080]   in a fully equipped high school classroom
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:08.440]   with microscopes and all kinds of scientific equipment
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:11.000]   that would be used to teach later courses
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.720]   with my seventh graders.
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:15.920]   And it also happened that the Massachusetts Board
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:20.920]   of Education had changed the requirements
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:24.080]   for the way they organize science instruction
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:26.600]   and curriculum from seventh grade life science,
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:28.420]   eighth grade physical science, whatever it was,
[01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:29.680]   different sciences each year.
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:32.500]   They wanted an integrated interdisciplinary science
[01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:33.480]   all the way across.
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:35.040]   And of course that was very difficult
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:36.560]   for the traditional science teachers to do
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:38.120]   because they'd been teaching only biology
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:41.040]   or only earth science or only physical science
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:41.980]   for their whole career.
[01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:43.920]   And they didn't know how to teach the other subjects.
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:48.920]   And here comes me with like one intensive year of study
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:51.120]   in each of these domains,
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:54.280]   I was perfectly situated to like try to pull it together.
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:56.040]   So some of the high school teachers helped me,
[01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:57.520]   thank you to them.
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:00.920]   And I built out a new curriculum for seventh grade
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:03.760]   for that district around this interdisciplinary approach
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:06.880]   to science together with other teachers.
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:08.140]   - It was very hands-on.
[01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:12.560]   - Very, and it was very much like a web of concepts.
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:15.640]   We'd study nuclear fission and atoms and reactions
[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:17.780]   and then the sun and astronomy and the solar system.
[01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:22.160]   And then how the energy is being shined
[01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:24.880]   over onto the planets and then the earth.
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:26.600]   And then these organisms called plants
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:29.640]   are actually using those photons to do something chemical.
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:31.200]   Let's talk about photosynthesis.
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:33.720]   And then we can talk about chemical reactions
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:35.800]   and breaking down sugars and molecules.
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:38.420]   So we built this whole web like curriculum
[01:43:38.420 --> 01:43:40.480]   that I was trying to help the kids appreciate
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:44.000]   the sort of dynamic complexity of the natural world.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.960]   And some of my professors from Cornell also sent me
[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:49.640]   materials and all kinds of cool stuff
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:52.560]   from the Cornell Museum that they didn't really need.
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:54.000]   And then I gave it back when I was done
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:54.960]   with all these instructions,
[01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:57.040]   what all this stuff is on hominid evolution
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:59.840]   and Ashley and hand axes and all kinds of stuff.
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:02.360]   So I built out a curriculum around all this stuff.
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:04.900]   And I realized for the first time
[01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:07.960]   that I was in this amazingly fascinating space
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:11.120]   because it just so happened that the school I was working in
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:13.640]   was one of the most diverse culturally
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:15.160]   in the nation at that time.
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:17.440]   I think we had something like 81 languages
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:19.400]   spoken out of 1100 kids.
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:21.280]   That's a lot of first languages.
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:25.000]   And kids were arriving from all over the world.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.600]   This was right after the Rwandan genocide.
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:29.480]   So kids were coming in from East Africa.
[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:32.600]   There were refugees from Kosovo and Eastern Europe.
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:34.720]   There were kids coming in from Jamaica.
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:36.980]   There were kids coming in from Haiti.
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:40.400]   There were kids from Malaysia and Myanmar.
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:45.400]   Like there were kids landing in that class
[01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:50.320]   like deer in headlights from very, very broad ranges
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:51.660]   of cultural backgrounds.
[01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:53.880]   And they're landing in my science class.
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:57.720]   And what I quickly realized is they were using
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:00.060]   these scientific ways of exploring the world
[01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:04.520]   and thinking about questions and trying to make sense
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:08.600]   of what they had witnessed to try to understand
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:12.220]   their own sort of selves, their own origin story,
[01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:14.400]   their own place in the world.
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:15.880]   Why different people in this class
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:17.880]   look and eat differently than me,
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:19.040]   dress differently than me.
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:20.980]   Like, how is it that you look like that
[01:45:20.980 --> 01:45:21.860]   and I look like this?
[01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:25.780]   And there was all this crazy, you know,
[01:45:25.780 --> 01:45:30.700]   adolescent turmoil layered into this space
[01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:35.060]   where kids were grabbing onto the scientific ways of knowing
[01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:37.700]   as a handle to try to make sense of who they are.
[01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:40.920]   And those kids started asking questions of me.
[01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:44.980]   I'll never forget this one girl, black girl,
[01:45:44.980 --> 01:45:47.220]   raised her hand and all the other kids were looking at her
[01:45:47.220 --> 01:45:49.980]   like, yeah, yeah, yeah, ask it, ask it, right?
[01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:51.460]   And like, you know, she was being brave.
[01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:52.580]   Like she talked about it before school.
[01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:53.420]   Like, I can't say that.
[01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:54.420]   No, I can't say it, say it.
[01:45:54.420 --> 01:45:57.780]   And she said, Ms. Imordino, why is it
[01:45:57.780 --> 01:46:00.420]   that when we're studying hominid evolution
[01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:04.540]   and you show us this NOVA episode with early hominids
[01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:09.580]   in Africa, why do they always show those creatures looking
[01:46:09.580 --> 01:46:10.820]   like they have dark skin?
[01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:13.720]   Why do they always look like black people?
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:16.860]   And I was like, well, because they're on the equator
[01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:18.860]   and you need that level of melanin in your skin
[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:21.420]   to be able to adapt and live without getting
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:23.860]   skin cancer in that space, right?
[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:27.120]   And it opened up this amazing class discussion
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:28.580]   that actually went on for months.
[01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:32.660]   Like it evolved into a whole curriculum that was biology,
[01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:34.300]   it was culture, it was sociality,
[01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:38.460]   where we started to really unpack the ways
[01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:42.420]   that we as humans are natural beings in the world
[01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:44.540]   and the ways in which our cultural experiences
[01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:48.540]   are extensions of our natural ways of adapting.
[01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:50.880]   And that had me hooked.
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:55.380]   I realized then that I could bring science, right?
[01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:58.100]   The science of adolescent development and of learning
[01:46:58.100 --> 01:47:03.380]   and of emotion and of culture to this very pressing real world
[01:47:03.380 --> 01:47:08.420]   problem of how do we help our kids actually figure out
[01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:12.980]   who they are, invent themselves in this crazy multicultural
[01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:16.340]   space, and become scholars and intellectuals
[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:20.340]   who engage systematically with the ideas along the way.
[01:47:20.340 --> 01:47:23.340]   And so I took those ideas and I started
[01:47:23.340 --> 01:47:25.380]   going to night school at Harvard Extension School
[01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:28.900]   to study cognitive neuroscience and to study
[01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:32.740]   language and cognition and all these kinds of topics
[01:47:32.740 --> 01:47:35.980]   and quickly realized like I really
[01:47:35.980 --> 01:47:38.900]   needed this developmental perspective infused, right?
[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:41.260]   I wanted to understand not just how these things work,
[01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:43.180]   but how they got that way.
[01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:45.820]   And so I took that back to grad school at Harvard
[01:47:45.820 --> 01:47:51.380]   and began to study social and cultural and emotional
[01:47:51.380 --> 01:47:54.220]   and cognitive development in kids.
[01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:57.580]   And quickly there also kind of hit a wall
[01:47:57.580 --> 01:48:00.060]   where I went back to the school district in which I worked.
[01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:02.300]   And I went back to the teachers who were my colleagues.
[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:05.460]   And I worked with them and I observed their classes
[01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:07.220]   and I interviewed their students and we
[01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:10.060]   did all kinds of work around how kids were building
[01:48:10.060 --> 01:48:12.660]   scientific concepts in ways that reflected
[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:16.180]   their cultural concepts and ways of approaching the world.
[01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:19.300]   And I quickly realized it seems to me
[01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:21.580]   that kids are doing all this meaning making
[01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:27.100]   and we as adults are doing all this supportive meaning making.
[01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:30.140]   We're also engaging and growing and learning
[01:48:30.140 --> 01:48:32.780]   in ways that reflect not just knowledge
[01:48:32.780 --> 01:48:34.380]   bits like little computers, but also
[01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:37.860]   that reflect the biological substrate on which
[01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:39.940]   the learning and the thinking are happening.
[01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:42.620]   And I wanted very much to understand
[01:48:42.620 --> 01:48:46.900]   how we could use and leverage developmental biology
[01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:52.860]   as a kind of constraint from which to appreciate
[01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:56.300]   the kinds of theoretical frames we were inventing
[01:48:56.300 --> 01:49:00.300]   in the real world sort of anthropological educational
[01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:03.140]   space, the developmental psychological space.
[01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:07.340]   How could these two systems act as a Venn diagram
[01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:10.420]   and how could the inner section between them,
[01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:13.660]   the places where the theorizing about the natural behaviors
[01:49:13.660 --> 01:49:16.140]   and the way kids were making meaning and learning
[01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:18.300]   and describing their knowledge and engaging
[01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:21.980]   with each other on the one hand and the ways in which
[01:49:21.980 --> 01:49:26.020]   the brain and the biology are engaging in or supporting
[01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:27.820]   those processes on the other hand,
[01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:30.700]   the places where those two circles would overlap,
[01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:35.100]   it seemed to me that was where we could most directly target
[01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:37.580]   to start to deeply understand the nature
[01:49:37.580 --> 01:49:41.940]   of our developmental psycho biological growth and selves.
[01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:45.820]   And so I set out to try to study about the ways in which
[01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:50.020]   culture and sociality shape the brain and physiology
[01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:52.420]   and survival mechanisms and development.
[01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:55.260]   And at that time, which wasn't even that long ago,
[01:49:55.260 --> 01:49:59.140]   it's like two decades ago, quickly realized very, very
[01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:03.820]   little was known about the way in which emotions
[01:50:03.820 --> 01:50:05.380]   beyond things like fear--
[01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:09.780]   you flash a snake in your face and your amygdala lights up.
[01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:11.900]   I was thinking of something a little more nuanced.
[01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:12.780]   You know what I mean?
[01:50:12.780 --> 01:50:15.460]   Like what I'm seeing happening in science class among a kid
[01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:16.940]   from Kosovo and a kid from Rwanda
[01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:19.020]   as they're trying to figure out why they understand
[01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:21.020]   how they look different.
[01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:24.700]   Those deeply emotional conversations they're having,
[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:27.420]   but they're not so cut and dry as the things
[01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:28.300]   we had been studying.
[01:50:28.300 --> 01:50:30.300]   And so that's what really drove me
[01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:34.140]   to try to start to understand in an integrated way
[01:50:34.140 --> 01:50:38.180]   the way in which our biological development
[01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:39.900]   and our psychological development
[01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:43.780]   are actually sort of two sides of who we are
[01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:46.300]   and of how we're organizing ourselves
[01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:49.220]   to build capacity, mental capacity,
[01:50:49.220 --> 01:50:52.060]   as well as sort of physical health and capacity
[01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:56.660]   over the course of our lives as we're engaging with living.
[01:50:56.660 --> 01:51:00.660]   Incredible story and foray into what
[01:51:00.660 --> 01:51:04.300]   sounds to me like really your ability
[01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:09.300]   to identify how the universals among us,
[01:51:09.300 --> 01:51:11.420]   like the universal biological features,
[01:51:11.420 --> 01:51:14.900]   the universal psychological features
[01:51:14.900 --> 01:51:18.660]   can really strongly inform specifically
[01:51:18.660 --> 01:51:21.660]   what's happening now in a classroom interaction
[01:51:21.660 --> 01:51:26.020]   in the mind of you or somebody else or of any of us,
[01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:29.140]   but to approach it from the other direction.
[01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:32.060]   In other words, to take what's happening now and say,
[01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:34.340]   why is what's happening now happening?
[01:51:34.340 --> 01:51:35.740]   - Yeah, and how is it happening?
[01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:36.820]   What is actually happening
[01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:39.060]   underneath the surface of the behavior?
[01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:40.100]   - Right, as opposed to saying,
[01:51:40.100 --> 01:51:43.540]   okay, this is the psychology of character structure,
[01:51:43.540 --> 01:51:45.420]   this is the biology of the hypothalamus,
[01:51:45.420 --> 01:51:49.740]   but rather say, is anyone else really shocked
[01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:52.900]   about the school shooting in Nashville
[01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:56.140]   and go through the feeling of shock
[01:51:56.140 --> 01:52:00.980]   and go from there to the biology as a route of learning?
[01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:02.140]   And of course, I don't want to take away
[01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:06.780]   anything from the real world seriousness of that,
[01:52:06.780 --> 01:52:10.740]   but it sounds to me like you saw
[01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:12.100]   that there's a different portal
[01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:14.620]   through which to teach and understand experience
[01:52:14.620 --> 01:52:18.580]   in that we are all, but especially young people
[01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:20.500]   are really tied to our emotional states
[01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:25.500]   as the main filters for which we like that, just like that,
[01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:28.380]   and therefore make decisions and move through life.
[01:52:28.380 --> 01:52:30.180]   I mean, I think it's so key that early on,
[01:52:30.180 --> 01:52:31.580]   I mean, if we like a teacher,
[01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:34.020]   oftentimes we like the subject.
[01:52:34.020 --> 01:52:39.020]   If we happen to fall in love with figure four B in a paper,
[01:52:39.020 --> 01:52:42.740]   great, but that's not how I went through graduate school.
[01:52:42.740 --> 01:52:47.040]   I just was blown away by the fact that sperm meets egg,
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:48.580]   you get a bunch of cell duplications,
[01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:50.540]   and then you get a brain. - You get a brain.
[01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:51.660]   - And then you get a brain. - You're like, crud,
[01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:53.660]   how does that happen, right, that's crazy.
[01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:56.080]   - Amazing, and I was blessed with a graduate advisor
[01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:58.800]   who literally told me, this is how it works in my lab,
[01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:00.460]   is what she said.
[01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:04.540]   She said, "We have everything you need here,
[01:53:04.540 --> 01:53:06.360]   I'll help you if you need help,
[01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:08.140]   but basically you're gonna mess around with stuff,
[01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:09.460]   you're not gonna burn down the lab,
[01:53:09.460 --> 01:53:10.720]   you're not gonna kill yourself
[01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:12.740]   with any of the poisonous stuff,
[01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:15.100]   but then you're gonna like mess some stuff up
[01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:18.060]   and do some stuff and you're gonna figure some stuff out."
[01:53:18.060 --> 01:53:19.580]   This was literally the description,
[01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:22.660]   and I liked her lab because they had green countertops
[01:53:22.660 --> 01:53:24.980]   and she had pictures of interesting animals on the wall,
[01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:26.580]   and then she said, "And I'm gonna have two kids
[01:53:26.580 --> 01:53:28.400]   while you're in graduate school,
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:29.460]   so I'm not gonna be around very much,
[01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:31.140]   you're gonna have to figure it out on your own."
[01:53:31.140 --> 01:53:33.120]   And I said, "Well, can I play the music I want?"
[01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:34.420]   She said, "Sure."
[01:53:34.420 --> 01:53:36.280]   And I said, "Can I put tinfoil on the windows
[01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:37.580]   'cause I don't wanna be bothered?"
[01:53:37.580 --> 01:53:38.720]   And she said, "Sure," and I was like,
[01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:40.820]   "Okay, this is the place for me."
[01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:44.540]   In other words, she gave me a room to explore,
[01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:46.300]   and of course she gave me a lot of guidance along the way,
[01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:48.820]   she was an amazing, amazing graduate advisor,
[01:53:48.820 --> 01:53:51.180]   I'm extremely blessed.
[01:53:51.180 --> 01:53:55.640]   But it sounds to me like that identifying
[01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:58.860]   what's really going on now is key,
[01:53:58.860 --> 01:54:01.420]   and that the other thing that's key is an openness to ideas.
[01:54:01.420 --> 01:54:03.020]   I mean, earlier you talked about,
[01:54:03.020 --> 01:54:07.100]   let's just admit where we're at right now,
[01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:09.980]   we're in a culture war right now.
[01:54:09.980 --> 01:54:11.340]   - We're in a weird space right now.
[01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:14.460]   - It's very divisive, and one of the major problems
[01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:17.140]   is that we can't really talk about things.
[01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:20.340]   I mean, I think fear of getting canceled,
[01:54:20.340 --> 01:54:24.660]   fear of exploring ideas is real.
[01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:27.420]   It's very real, not just for academics, it's just real.
[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:30.220]   People are so, it's important to be sensitive
[01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:32.620]   to the experiences of others, absolutely,
[01:54:32.620 --> 01:54:34.600]   but if we can't actually explore ideas
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:37.660]   and feel like we can walk out of the room safely,
[01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:40.180]   then we can't really explore ideas.
[01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:43.780]   And so I think right now it's not just social media,
[01:54:43.780 --> 01:54:46.700]   I think it's the fear of offending anybody,
[01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:52.540]   and probably the fear of voicing how upset certain people are
[01:54:52.540 --> 01:54:54.800]   about their experiences or the experiences of others,
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:57.980]   whatever it is, I don't see a landscape right now
[01:54:57.980 --> 01:55:02.320]   where there is true open exploration of ideas anywhere,
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:06.660]   anywhere, at least in this country.
[01:55:06.660 --> 01:55:11.660]   So what do we do if at least two of the requirements
[01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:17.680]   are an emotional gripping of something around the learning,
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:22.000]   plus an openness to thinking about things
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.940]   that maybe don't feel right to us as a way to learn
[01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:27.540]   how to think something, and I think we both agree,
[01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:29.660]   if I may, that is really critical,
[01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:32.300]   and that the world will be a far better place
[01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:33.560]   if people could do that.
[01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:38.220]   And how do we navigate this landscape?
[01:55:38.220 --> 01:55:41.420]   I mean, is what has to come first a demonstration
[01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:44.020]   of the value of openness of ideas?
[01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:46.780]   And here, I'll just state my stance,
[01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:51.780]   I feel like any idea should be open to at least discussion.
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:56.440]   Any idea, but then it needs to be systematically dissected
[01:55:56.440 --> 01:55:59.520]   with some rigor so that people can't just assume
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:03.240]   any idea is true, just because it's true for them,
[01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:05.360]   just 'cause it's true for them.
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:07.800]   And this I actually learned from my graduate advisor,
[01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:10.920]   she used to say, "Tolerance has to go both ways."
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:13.320]   Like when it comes to thinking about ideas and criticizing,
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:15.020]   it can't just be I'm right, they're wrong,
[01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:17.880]   or I don't tolerate that, it has to be tolerance
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:22.340]   for all ideas, and then you arrive at hopefully,
[01:56:22.340 --> 01:56:26.380]   eventually core truths, or at least core trajectories.
[01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:30.300]   What do you think could support this?
[01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:31.660]   How early should this start?
[01:56:31.660 --> 01:56:34.460]   I mean, should kids in elementary school be discussing
[01:56:34.460 --> 01:56:38.980]   the current landscape of politics and what they see
[01:56:38.980 --> 01:56:41.940]   from a place of, like we talk about safe spaces,
[01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:44.940]   but is a safe space one in which no one gets offended,
[01:56:44.940 --> 01:56:48.320]   whereas a safe space one in which any idea can be discussed?
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:50.160]   I think that's never really been defined for me.
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:53.720]   - Yeah, ooh, that's a really fraught issue.
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:55.880]   I mean, first, let me go back to something you said,
[01:56:55.880 --> 01:56:57.560]   which I would have said it differently.
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:02.400]   So you said our emotions are a filter, right?
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:04.840]   And they do act like a filter,
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:09.060]   but I actually don't think emotions are really filter-like
[01:57:09.060 --> 01:57:12.020]   so much as they are the drives
[01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:15.580]   that are undergirding the impetus to think, right?
[01:57:15.580 --> 01:57:19.140]   They're pushing us to think about particular things.
[01:57:19.140 --> 01:57:22.380]   And I think, I mean, as a scientist,
[01:57:22.380 --> 01:57:27.380]   my disposition is always that to understand something
[01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:32.500]   is good, and the more complexly, the more thoroughly
[01:57:32.500 --> 01:57:40.320]   you can interrogate and understand something, the better.
[01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:46.400]   So there's nothing I'm afraid of knowing, right?
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:48.560]   And what you're really talking about there
[01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:50.080]   is the fear of knowing.
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:56.080]   Why are people so afraid to engage with each other,
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:58:01.160]   basically, because it's deeply threatening
[01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:09.440]   to reveal things about your own experience
[01:58:10.380 --> 01:58:14.120]   that are not gonna land in a space
[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:17.840]   where we can kind of collectively engage with them
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:20.120]   as legitimate experience.
[01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:22.540]   That's sort of the opposite of canceling people, right?
[01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:24.240]   It's the opposite of dismissing people.
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:28.980]   It's actually developing spaces of trust
[01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:32.820]   where we can engage with ideas
[01:58:32.820 --> 01:58:36.620]   and take them from ourselves, right?
[01:58:36.620 --> 01:58:41.160]   So that they're no longer personal value judgments.
[01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:46.160]   They become cultural memes or models or schemas
[01:58:46.160 --> 01:58:50.400]   that we can dissect together,
[01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:53.280]   that we can engage with together
[01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:56.800]   and construct understanding around, right?
[01:58:56.800 --> 01:59:00.320]   And I don't really understand my own position
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:04.960]   unless I also understand your opposition to my position,
[01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:06.880]   even if I still disagree with you.
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:10.500]   I think there are really important conversations
[01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:11.340]   going on right now.
[01:59:11.340 --> 01:59:12.640]   I'll take it back to the education system
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:15.200]   because that's what I know most about.
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:18.680]   There are really important conversations going on right now
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:23.680]   around reframing the experience and outcomes
[01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:28.640]   and aims of schooling around civic discourse and reasoning.
[01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:31.980]   So there was just a major report that was produced
[01:59:31.980 --> 01:59:33.740]   by the National Academy of Education
[01:59:33.740 --> 01:59:37.300]   and another academies collaborating with it,
[01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:39.680]   for example, around this topic.
[01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:44.300]   And helping us to move as a society toward a space
[01:59:44.300 --> 01:59:49.300]   where we learn to kind of lay ideas out
[01:59:49.300 --> 01:59:55.380]   and develop skills for reasoning around those ideas,
[01:59:55.380 --> 01:59:59.560]   including bringing ethical, experiential, emotional,
[01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:02.240]   cultural values to bear,
[02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:05.200]   but then being willing to deconstruct
[02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:06.760]   and engage with those ideas,
[02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:08.340]   whether they're the ones that are commensurate
[02:00:08.340 --> 02:00:09.960]   and fluid with our experience,
[02:00:09.960 --> 02:00:13.480]   or that appear to be conflicting
[02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:16.140]   or disfluent with our experience.
[02:00:16.140 --> 02:00:20.540]   We need to develop spaces for young people,
[02:00:20.540 --> 02:00:22.100]   especially, but for everyone,
[02:00:22.100 --> 02:00:27.620]   to engage with the deconstruction of our own assumptions,
[02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:28.460]   like I said before,
[02:00:28.460 --> 02:00:33.460]   and to engage with the deconstruction of others' assumptions
[02:00:33.460 --> 02:00:35.640]   and to try to reconcile the building blocks.
[02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:37.420]   And that's where we can build some common ground,
[02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:39.140]   but we can also disagree.
[02:00:39.140 --> 02:00:41.220]   But we don't really understand our own position
[02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:44.060]   unless we appreciate someone else's disagreement
[02:00:44.060 --> 02:00:44.900]   with our position.
[02:00:44.900 --> 02:00:48.320]   Unless we can actually articulate and appreciate
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:52.820]   how it is that person's opinion is opposed to mine,
[02:00:52.820 --> 02:00:54.820]   I don't really understand mine.
[02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:56.060]   - It's such a key point.
[02:00:56.060 --> 02:00:59.460]   One of the reasons why I do read all the comments
[02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:00.980]   on podcasts, on YouTube,
[02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:02.940]   it takes me some time, but I do it,
[02:01:02.940 --> 02:01:07.000]   or on social media is that oftentimes I'll get a comment
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.220]   or a criticism that makes it very clear
[02:01:09.220 --> 02:01:11.460]   that I wasn't clear about something.
[02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:13.100]   Other times I'll get a comment or a criticism
[02:01:13.100 --> 02:01:16.260]   that makes it clear that I and the other person
[02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:18.380]   fundamentally disagree about something,
[02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:20.100]   both of which are great.
[02:01:20.100 --> 02:01:23.120]   And for a scientist is a delight, so keep it coming.
[02:01:23.980 --> 02:01:28.160]   And of course, when people agree and they agree
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:30.580]   and make it clear that they agree
[02:01:30.580 --> 02:01:32.160]   from a stance of understanding,
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:33.860]   that of course is also gratifying.
[02:01:33.860 --> 02:01:37.100]   So it's exactly what you're saying.
[02:01:37.100 --> 02:01:40.380]   And it's one of the upsides, I think, of social media,
[02:01:40.380 --> 02:01:43.960]   which is that unless people block their comment section,
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:45.220]   and I do occasionally block people
[02:01:45.220 --> 02:01:46.980]   if they're being offensive to other people.
[02:01:46.980 --> 02:01:49.860]   - Yeah, yeah, that's alienating people.
[02:01:49.860 --> 02:01:51.740]   That's not inviting people into a conversation.
[02:01:51.740 --> 02:01:52.820]   That's not constructive.
[02:01:52.820 --> 02:01:54.020]   - I actually have a rule,
[02:01:54.020 --> 02:01:55.940]   which is I call it classroom rules.
[02:01:55.940 --> 02:01:59.660]   I've never announced it, but I allow for classroom rules.
[02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:02.220]   You can swear, but you can't swear at people.
[02:02:02.220 --> 02:02:03.980]   That's what I was taught in graduate school.
[02:02:03.980 --> 02:02:04.820]   [laughs]
[02:02:04.820 --> 02:02:05.640]   - That's nice, I like that.
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:06.860]   - Swear, but you can't swear at people.
[02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:10.020]   It's also a rule at home, although we try not to swear.
[02:02:10.020 --> 02:02:12.460]   You can swear, but swearing at people is not okay.
[02:02:12.460 --> 02:02:18.580]   And that a certain decorum is required
[02:02:18.580 --> 02:02:21.380]   in order to have open discourse.
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:24.960]   So that works for me.
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:27.720]   I think that it's been a while since I've been in school,
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:28.780]   but I work at a school.
[02:02:28.780 --> 02:02:33.660]   And I think that the ability to not just reinforce,
[02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:35.800]   but challenge one's own stances,
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:38.020]   which sometimes leads to reinforcing our own stances.
[02:02:38.020 --> 02:02:40.460]   - It may, it very well may, and that's legitimate.
[02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:42.020]   - I mean, I have to assume that in high schools,
[02:02:42.020 --> 02:02:44.600]   they still do debates and things of that sort.
[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:46.300]   I mean, do they allow that?
[02:02:46.300 --> 02:02:48.840]   I mean, could you throw kids in a class and say,
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:52.380]   "Let's debate something really controversial."
[02:02:52.380 --> 02:02:54.880]   And then, but you have to debate it from the other side.
[02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:58.420]   I mean, just as a experiment of forcing the brain
[02:02:58.420 --> 02:03:03.160]   to try to be effective for sake of winning,
[02:03:03.160 --> 02:03:06.580]   but from the other perspective or stance,
[02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:08.540]   it seems like a great exercise.
[02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:09.740]   If I were a high school teacher,
[02:03:09.740 --> 02:03:10.760]   that's the first thing I'd do.
[02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:13.140]   We pick the most controversial topic,
[02:03:13.140 --> 02:03:16.220]   and then I'd ask people to divide along that topic,
[02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:17.800]   and then I'd swap them into the other one
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:19.580]   and have them argue from the other one's stance.
[02:03:19.580 --> 02:03:21.160]   - Yep, learning to appreciate perspectives
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:22.820]   is very, is very-
[02:03:22.820 --> 02:03:24.320]   - And we'd use 14 ounce gloves.
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:25.160]   No, I'm kidding.
[02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:25.980]   It wouldn't be physical.
[02:03:25.980 --> 02:03:27.280]   It would be purely intellectual.
[02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:28.740]   - Yeah, I mean, let's take it.
[02:03:28.740 --> 02:03:30.700]   Can we take it back to the brain for a moment?
[02:03:30.700 --> 02:03:33.020]   To the conversation that we were having earlier, right?
[02:03:33.020 --> 02:03:37.400]   So we were talking about that in our experiments
[02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:39.140]   and now in whole, you know,
[02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:42.020]   whole bodies of neuroscientific knowledge,
[02:03:42.020 --> 02:03:45.500]   we know that there is this very interesting neurobiological
[02:03:45.500 --> 02:03:50.020]   sort of processing difference between emotions
[02:03:50.020 --> 02:03:52.360]   and the thoughts that are part of those emotions
[02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:54.280]   that are, you know, the result of those emotions
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:56.580]   that are also insipidating those emotions, right?
[02:03:56.580 --> 02:03:58.820]   Like that whole process,
[02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:03.060]   when it pertains to the direct actions,
[02:04:03.060 --> 02:04:07.260]   observable characteristics, behaviors, you know,
[02:04:07.260 --> 02:04:09.020]   of another person or situation
[02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:10.320]   that you can actually directly,
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:12.420]   pretty much directly learn or infer,
[02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:17.260]   as compared to when you have to bring a whole lot
[02:04:17.260 --> 02:04:20.300]   of conceptual content knowledge to bear,
[02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:25.260]   experiential knowledge, simulation capacity to bear,
[02:04:25.260 --> 02:04:28.020]   to be able to fully appreciate the nature of a situation.
[02:04:28.020 --> 02:04:31.500]   And we talked about how that second kind of processing
[02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:34.140]   that I called transcendent is in essence
[02:04:34.140 --> 02:04:36.500]   about distancing yourself
[02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:40.060]   from the immediate physical, you know, situation,
[02:04:40.060 --> 02:04:43.220]   the observable perceivable situation in a direct sense,
[02:04:43.220 --> 02:04:46.220]   and instead constructing a narrative in your mind
[02:04:46.220 --> 02:04:47.580]   that's built from that,
[02:04:47.580 --> 02:04:49.620]   but that then brings to bear all these other kinds
[02:04:49.620 --> 02:04:53.660]   of information that allow you to elaborate this
[02:04:53.660 --> 02:04:55.700]   into a narrative that takes on emotional meaning
[02:04:55.700 --> 02:04:58.460]   and psychological power as a narrative
[02:04:58.460 --> 02:05:00.060]   that becomes part of identity, beliefs,
[02:05:00.060 --> 02:05:00.900]   all that kind of stuff.
[02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:03.660]   And we talked about that kind of thinking being associated
[02:05:03.660 --> 02:05:05.580]   with the so-called default mode,
[02:05:05.580 --> 02:05:10.580]   which is deactivated systematically
[02:05:10.580 --> 02:05:12.340]   and decoupled from itself, right?
[02:05:12.340 --> 02:05:14.740]   The different regions aren't talking to each other.
[02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:18.260]   When you are in the world acting, doing a task,
[02:05:18.260 --> 02:05:21.020]   paying attention, inferring the direct things
[02:05:21.020 --> 02:05:22.540]   that you need to notice around you,
[02:05:22.540 --> 02:05:24.020]   you know, you're in the middle of playing a soccer game,
[02:05:24.020 --> 02:05:24.940]   the ball's coming at your head.
[02:05:24.940 --> 02:05:27.460]   That's not a time to stop and muse about, you know,
[02:05:27.460 --> 02:05:29.540]   Title IX and girls' access to sports, right?
[02:05:29.540 --> 02:05:31.060]   You're gonna trip and fall,
[02:05:31.060 --> 02:05:32.500]   or you're gonna miss your shot at the goal,
[02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:34.580]   or you're gonna get hit with the ball, right?
[02:05:34.580 --> 02:05:37.820]   So we need to sort of manage that space
[02:05:37.820 --> 02:05:39.260]   in order to have these conversations.
[02:05:39.260 --> 02:05:42.500]   And I think what's important here is to remember
[02:05:42.500 --> 02:05:46.020]   that the default mode network, that is the substrate
[02:05:46.020 --> 02:05:49.780]   that is playing out your own sense of self
[02:05:49.780 --> 02:05:52.420]   and inner consciousness and self-awareness,
[02:05:52.420 --> 02:05:54.660]   and is also the basis on which we construct
[02:05:54.660 --> 02:05:56.980]   these broader inferential narratives
[02:05:56.980 --> 02:06:00.180]   that are the elaborative stuff of stories and beliefs,
[02:06:00.180 --> 02:06:02.780]   are fundamentally incompatible.
[02:06:02.780 --> 02:06:04.660]   The activation of those systems
[02:06:04.660 --> 02:06:09.660]   is fundamentally incompatible with needing to be vigilant
[02:06:09.780 --> 02:06:12.860]   into the immediate physical or social situation around you.
[02:06:12.860 --> 02:06:16.620]   So if you feel physically, emotionally, culturally,
[02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:21.620]   socially unsafe, and you feel that you need to watch
[02:06:21.620 --> 02:06:25.580]   your back, either literally or metaphorically,
[02:06:25.580 --> 02:06:29.260]   as you're thinking about things, neurobiologically,
[02:06:29.260 --> 02:06:32.380]   that situation is inconducive.
[02:06:32.380 --> 02:06:37.340]   It is not conducive to being able to actually conjure
[02:06:37.340 --> 02:06:41.580]   an alternative perspective in which you construct
[02:06:41.580 --> 02:06:46.580]   a meaningful narrative with alternate ethical implications,
[02:06:46.580 --> 02:06:50.860]   with alternate prospective possible future outcomes,
[02:06:50.860 --> 02:06:54.820]   with alternate views of historical precedent or context.
[02:06:54.820 --> 02:06:57.420]   Being able to sort of mentally time travel
[02:06:57.420 --> 02:07:02.420]   into the space of those ideas is only really possible
[02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:06.020]   when people feel safe to think together.
[02:07:06.020 --> 02:07:09.380]   - So it sounds like it's anti-creative.
[02:07:09.380 --> 02:07:12.700]   - Yes, creativity is also associated
[02:07:12.700 --> 02:07:15.180]   with the activations of these networks, yeah.
[02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:17.500]   Causally so in some recent work.
[02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:21.220]   - I had the good fortune of having dinner last year
[02:07:21.220 --> 02:07:23.300]   with somebody, I won't reveal who it is,
[02:07:23.300 --> 02:07:28.180]   but he runs a major social media platform.
[02:07:28.180 --> 02:07:33.660]   And he told me that in Japan, it's common for people
[02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:36.460]   to have two or three or even as many
[02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:38.840]   as seven different social media handles.
[02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:42.940]   And that they do this in order to embody
[02:07:42.940 --> 02:07:45.780]   different versions of themselves safely.
[02:07:45.780 --> 02:07:48.100]   So these are not troll accounts.
[02:07:48.100 --> 02:07:49.620]   These are not the accounts, and by the way,
[02:07:49.620 --> 02:07:52.740]   I see you troll accounts, that say whatever
[02:07:52.740 --> 02:07:53.820]   and then you go to their accounts
[02:07:53.820 --> 02:07:55.460]   at some private account where they hide.
[02:07:55.460 --> 02:08:00.220]   Rather, these are individuals who have multiple accounts.
[02:08:00.220 --> 02:08:03.340]   In one account, they might be a bit aggressive,
[02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:05.500]   maybe even a bully online, dare I say.
[02:08:05.500 --> 02:08:07.980]   In another account, they might be very fawning
[02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:10.760]   and show up as the person that everyone knows them
[02:08:10.760 --> 02:08:11.660]   to be in the real world.
[02:08:11.660 --> 02:08:14.420]   In another account, they might be a university professor.
[02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:15.620]   In another, they're an athlete.
[02:08:15.620 --> 02:08:19.700]   And it's fabricated in the sense that the posts
[02:08:19.700 --> 02:08:22.540]   that they put up often don't accurately represent
[02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:24.220]   who they are in the real world.
[02:08:24.220 --> 02:08:27.100]   But it's accurate in the sense that it represents
[02:08:27.100 --> 02:08:29.660]   the different dimensions of their persona
[02:08:29.660 --> 02:08:32.020]   that are driving their real world decision-making
[02:08:32.020 --> 02:08:32.860]   at some level.
[02:08:32.860 --> 02:08:34.700]   - It's kind of like pretend play for little kids.
[02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:37.340]   - It's pretend play, but it's not pretend
[02:08:37.340 --> 02:08:39.000]   because it's in cyberspace.
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.780]   I'll just go back to Rick Rubin, who,
[02:08:42.780 --> 02:08:46.340]   in addition to being this incredible music producer,
[02:08:46.340 --> 02:08:49.900]   is an enormous fan of professional wrestling for many years.
[02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:52.540]   And I asked him, you know, from a perplexity,
[02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:54.340]   I was like, "Why professional wrestling?
[02:08:54.340 --> 02:08:55.420]   "Is it the athleticism?"
[02:08:55.420 --> 02:08:58.660]   And he says, "It's the only thing that's real
[02:08:58.660 --> 02:09:01.300]   "because everyone agrees it's not real."
[02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:03.140]   And so these are characters, right?
[02:09:03.140 --> 02:09:06.020]   So you're agreeing for it to not be real,
[02:09:06.020 --> 02:09:08.780]   and yet it allows these characters to fully embody
[02:09:08.780 --> 02:09:10.100]   these different personas.
[02:09:10.100 --> 02:09:13.740]   And I had the experience years ago,
[02:09:13.740 --> 02:09:15.560]   I was at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory summer camp
[02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:18.620]   for scientists, where I attended and taught.
[02:09:18.620 --> 02:09:21.540]   And I was in a cab driving out to Cold Spring Harbor
[02:09:21.540 --> 02:09:23.840]   from the train station, Syosset.
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:25.940]   And I got into a discussion with the cab driver,
[02:09:25.940 --> 02:09:28.260]   and he said, "Okay, you're from California."
[02:09:28.260 --> 02:09:29.420]   He said with a New York accent,
[02:09:29.420 --> 02:09:30.260]   "I sure won't try and imitate you."
[02:09:30.260 --> 02:09:31.860]   He said, "You're from California."
[02:09:31.860 --> 02:09:33.620]   And he said, "You know, your governor,"
[02:09:33.620 --> 02:09:35.180]   who at the time was Schwarzenegger,
[02:09:35.180 --> 02:09:36.480]   he said, "He's great."
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:38.100]   And I said, "Tell me more."
[02:09:38.100 --> 02:09:41.460]   I happened to like Schwarzenegger for a number of reasons.
[02:09:41.460 --> 02:09:43.860]   He actually signed my PhD 'cause he was governor,
[02:09:43.860 --> 02:09:46.220]   and I went to a UC, so. - Oh, yes, good, yes.
[02:09:46.220 --> 02:09:50.480]   - And he said, "Well, because if terrorists show up
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:53.940]   "in California, he's gonna go out there
[02:09:53.940 --> 02:09:56.540]   "with a machine gun and take them down."
[02:09:56.540 --> 02:09:58.380]   So in his adult mind- - He's thinking
[02:09:58.380 --> 02:09:59.220]   of the Terminator.
[02:09:59.220 --> 02:10:00.860]   - He's the Terminator.
[02:10:00.860 --> 02:10:02.260]   He's the Terminator.
[02:10:02.260 --> 02:10:05.100]   And I realized in that moment, this was a smart guy,
[02:10:05.100 --> 02:10:06.520]   this cab driver was a smart guy,
[02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:09.220]   that it wasn't a lack of narrative distancing.
[02:10:09.220 --> 02:10:13.140]   He had conflated the actor with the roles he played.
[02:10:13.140 --> 02:10:16.580]   And I realized in that moment that this was not a reflection
[02:10:16.580 --> 02:10:19.000]   of him being unintelligent.
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.100]   It was a reflection of the fact
[02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:24.700]   that the brain often collapses identities of others
[02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:27.660]   and makes these, I think it's just an efficient way-
[02:10:27.660 --> 02:10:29.660]   - The testimony is sufficient. - It's an efficient way
[02:10:29.660 --> 02:10:31.180]   to parse the world.
[02:10:31.180 --> 02:10:33.220]   - Yeah, we decide, and then that's that kind of this person,
[02:10:33.220 --> 02:10:35.340]   and we put them over there on a shelf, yeah.
[02:10:35.340 --> 02:10:37.780]   - So to return to the discussion that we're having,
[02:10:37.780 --> 02:10:42.780]   I think that the ability to embody different aspects of self
[02:10:42.780 --> 02:10:47.520]   but also the ability to transiently embody the personas
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:49.680]   of other people, and to do that in a way that allows
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:53.460]   for really thorough exploration of idea space,
[02:10:53.460 --> 02:10:56.220]   I feel like can only be a good thing,
[02:10:56.220 --> 02:10:59.160]   provided it doesn't get physically violent or something.
[02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:03.060]   But that to me seems like the exact opposite
[02:11:03.060 --> 02:11:04.100]   of what's happening now,
[02:11:04.100 --> 02:11:08.740]   which is that people are siloing off into their camps
[02:11:08.740 --> 02:11:12.340]   where specific language and specific ideas are accepted
[02:11:12.340 --> 02:11:13.540]   and others are not.
[02:11:13.540 --> 02:11:18.500]   I mean, it's so interesting and perplexing
[02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:22.340]   and disturbing to me that the way that certain things
[02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:25.060]   that have nothing to do with politics get lumped
[02:11:25.060 --> 02:11:26.620]   with one group or the other.
[02:11:26.620 --> 02:11:30.780]   It's so crazy to me on the one hand,
[02:11:30.780 --> 02:11:34.300]   and yet I think what you're describing seems to me
[02:11:34.300 --> 02:11:35.740]   the route out of all of this.
[02:11:35.740 --> 02:11:36.580]   I really mean that.
[02:11:36.580 --> 02:11:40.840]   I feel like the education system, starting young,
[02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:43.100]   and getting people emotionally engaged,
[02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:45.300]   learning what they like, what they don't like,
[02:11:45.300 --> 02:11:48.220]   but then also teaching them about their emotional systems
[02:11:48.220 --> 02:11:51.720]   and how it helps them parse the world is really the solution
[02:11:51.720 --> 02:11:55.380]   so that when we're upset, we can realize like,
[02:11:55.380 --> 02:11:58.340]   yeah, I'm upset, it makes sense why I'm upset,
[02:11:58.340 --> 02:12:00.020]   but let me explore it from the other side.
[02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:02.920]   It also makes sense why they're upset.
[02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:05.820]   And that seems to be what humans have done somewhat
[02:12:05.820 --> 02:12:08.520]   throughout history, never perfectly well,
[02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:10.440]   but it seems like it ought to be possible.
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:13.080]   I mean, the forebrain is there for a reason.
[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:17.100]   So could you, in wanting to go back
[02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:19.260]   to a little bit of the biology and the research,
[02:12:19.260 --> 02:12:22.920]   what have you seen in terms of cross-cultural consistency
[02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:28.840]   about the role of emotions in our ability to parse and learn?
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:32.800]   And because obviously we're not gonna solve
[02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:35.480]   these problems today, but although I think you shine light
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:39.480]   on some potential solutions, what do we know for sure
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:41.220]   about human beings and their capacity
[02:12:41.220 --> 02:12:46.220]   to do what you're describing, to really learn differently?
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.540]   It worked in the classroom where you were teaching,
[02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:53.200]   but how could each and every one of us do this?
[02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:54.540]   I mean, how would we approach this?
[02:12:54.540 --> 02:12:57.580]   I guess I want to take this to the practical.
[02:12:57.580 --> 02:13:00.260]   What can we do when we read a newspaper article?
[02:13:00.260 --> 02:13:02.200]   What can we do when we were on social media?
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:06.680]   What can we do when our kid is like refusing
[02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:10.100]   to do something because they simply don't like it
[02:13:10.100 --> 02:13:12.920]   or the teacher, they don't like the teacher?
[02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:17.300]   Are there paths through that that you've identified
[02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:19.580]   or that you can sense work?
[02:13:19.580 --> 02:13:21.340]   - I can give funny examples of my own kids
[02:13:21.340 --> 02:13:23.180]   when they didn't like things at school, right?
[02:13:23.180 --> 02:13:26.100]   This isn't licensed- - What tools do you use?
[02:13:26.100 --> 02:13:29.420]   - License to not, yeah, so my son,
[02:13:29.420 --> 02:13:31.800]   when he was in third grade, he was very upset
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:36.080]   about the behavior chart that his teacher had at school.
[02:13:36.080 --> 02:13:38.380]   So he had a behavior chart, they had a behavior chart
[02:13:38.380 --> 02:13:39.920]   at the back of the room, but the principal didn't agree
[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:42.260]   with this, but that teacher was there for a year.
[02:13:42.260 --> 02:13:45.380]   Okay, so there was this behavior chart and you have green,
[02:13:45.380 --> 02:13:47.040]   you start on green with your little clip
[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:48.700]   and then there's yellow and then there's red,
[02:13:48.700 --> 02:13:49.860]   which is like call your parents,
[02:13:49.860 --> 02:13:51.340]   which I never understood why they don't put
[02:13:51.340 --> 02:13:53.820]   call your parents on the green, but anyway, right?
[02:13:53.820 --> 02:13:56.940]   So you start on the green and then you get down
[02:13:56.940 --> 02:13:58.420]   to the yellow and then you get down to red
[02:13:58.420 --> 02:14:01.980]   and Ted's little friend is always getting on the red
[02:14:01.980 --> 02:14:04.340]   by 9 a.m., it's like, can we just get it over with?
[02:14:04.340 --> 02:14:06.620]   And he tried to talk with his teacher
[02:14:06.620 --> 02:14:09.180]   about why this behavior chart made him so uncomfortable
[02:14:09.180 --> 02:14:12.160]   because, and she could not understand his perspective
[02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:15.120]   because she kept saying, but you're always on green.
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:17.220]   You're always doing what you're supposed to be doing
[02:14:17.220 --> 02:14:18.820]   and you're respectful and you're well behaved,
[02:14:18.820 --> 02:14:20.180]   so why is it a problem?
[02:14:20.180 --> 02:14:24.180]   And what he was trying to say was that somehow
[02:14:24.180 --> 02:14:29.740]   it just made him uncomfortable to have that there.
[02:14:29.740 --> 02:14:32.540]   So he was constantly bothering me with this.
[02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:34.420]   I finally told him I was trying to work one day
[02:14:34.420 --> 02:14:36.740]   and he was home from school 'cause I would let him work
[02:14:36.740 --> 02:14:38.780]   from home some days because we needed to
[02:14:38.780 --> 02:14:40.340]   to kind of buffer a little bit.
[02:14:40.340 --> 02:14:42.560]   And he'd bring all his work home and he'd do it himself.
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:43.860]   I'd be working, he'd be working, right?
[02:14:43.860 --> 02:14:46.380]   It's fine, he had all kinds of projects going on.
[02:14:46.380 --> 02:14:49.560]   And this is a kid who, this is a little side story.
[02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:50.960]   He's a kid who went to first grade
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:52.540]   and about two weeks into first grade,
[02:14:52.540 --> 02:14:55.740]   good first grade class, he was crying on a Sunday night
[02:14:55.740 --> 02:14:57.820]   to me like, "I gotta go to school, I don't wanna go to school."
[02:14:57.820 --> 02:14:59.540]   I'm like, "Well, what's wrong at school?"
[02:14:59.540 --> 02:15:00.980]   I'm thinking he's getting bullied, something's wrong.
[02:15:00.980 --> 02:15:02.100]   He's like, "I know."
[02:15:02.100 --> 02:15:03.680]   He finally looks at me and he goes,
[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:06.180]   "I have so much work to do.
[02:15:06.180 --> 02:15:07.820]   "How do you expect me to get my work done
[02:15:07.820 --> 02:15:09.660]   "if I'm sitting in school all day?"
[02:15:09.660 --> 02:15:11.500]   (laughing)
[02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:13.180]   - I can relate, I can relate.
[02:15:13.180 --> 02:15:14.020]   - Can you relate?
[02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:16.180]   Because you're actually a motivated, right?
[02:15:16.180 --> 02:15:19.340]   We take kids' motivations and the things they're interested
[02:15:19.340 --> 02:15:21.660]   in and we sideline them and try to structure them
[02:15:21.660 --> 02:15:22.500]   into something.
[02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:23.320]   So back to this-
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:24.620]   - There are Legos to be built.
[02:15:24.620 --> 02:15:27.380]   - Yeah, oh, he was way into building armor at that time.
[02:15:27.380 --> 02:15:29.660]   He would, yeah, I know, we're probably terrible parents,
[02:15:29.660 --> 02:15:31.340]   but we gave him some safety glasses
[02:15:31.340 --> 02:15:32.780]   and we taught him how to use it
[02:15:32.780 --> 02:15:34.140]   and we explained how metal's sharp
[02:15:34.140 --> 02:15:34.980]   and we gave him some sheet metal.
[02:15:34.980 --> 02:15:35.820]   - Yeah, that is super cool.
[02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:38.680]   - And some tin snips and he made a whole suit of armor
[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:40.820]   in the backyard, you know, in second grade.
[02:15:40.820 --> 02:15:42.600]   Anyway, it took him months and months.
[02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:45.460]   I mean, chain mail, the whole bit, he was super into it.
[02:15:45.460 --> 02:15:46.300]   - Amazing.
[02:15:46.300 --> 02:15:47.140]   - I know.
[02:15:47.140 --> 02:15:50.100]   Anyway, and he made airplanes, he did all kinds of things.
[02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:53.240]   But, so here's this kid and he's bugging me
[02:15:53.240 --> 02:15:54.660]   about his teacher and this behavior chart.
[02:15:54.660 --> 02:15:56.940]   I said, "Ted, go write a letter to your teacher.
[02:15:56.940 --> 02:15:58.500]   "If it bothers you that much, you go write a letter
[02:15:58.500 --> 02:16:00.220]   "about why it bothers you," right?
[02:16:00.220 --> 02:16:02.860]   Because in doing so, he's, first of all,
[02:16:02.860 --> 02:16:03.900]   helping to solve the problem.
[02:16:03.900 --> 02:16:07.640]   Secondly, he was formulating his understanding
[02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:09.340]   of what this behavior chart is
[02:16:09.340 --> 02:16:11.760]   and why specifically it bothers him
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:14.780]   and in so doing, it helps him not be so bothered by it,
[02:16:14.780 --> 02:16:17.540]   right, so that's an example of something you could do, right?
[02:16:17.540 --> 02:16:19.620]   So he wrote this letter to his teacher,
[02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:21.780]   which ended up being published
[02:16:21.780 --> 02:16:23.980]   in the National Academy of Science, Engineering,
[02:16:23.980 --> 02:16:27.220]   and Maths book, How People Learn, Volume Two,
[02:16:27.220 --> 02:16:29.160]   because I was on the committee of people that wrote it
[02:16:29.160 --> 02:16:31.800]   and we needed an example of kids making sense
[02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:34.140]   out of motivational things and actually took his name
[02:16:34.140 --> 02:16:36.700]   and the teacher's name off and put the letter in the book.
[02:16:36.700 --> 02:16:38.560]   It basically is a little kid saying,
[02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:42.500]   "Listen, teacher, when you put up this behavior chart,"
[02:16:42.500 --> 02:16:44.980]   he called it a bad behavior chart, which it wasn't,
[02:16:44.980 --> 02:16:45.940]   it was just a behavior chart,
[02:16:45.940 --> 02:16:47.880]   but he interprets it as a bad behavior chart.
[02:16:47.880 --> 02:16:51.200]   When you put that up, it's as if you're daring me
[02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:52.320]   to do something bad.
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:54.340]   You're basically, he doesn't say it like this,
[02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:56.680]   he says, "You're basically making me uncomfortable
[02:16:56.680 --> 02:17:00.940]   "because you are laying out a perspective on me,
[02:17:00.940 --> 02:17:05.600]   "a possibility space for me that you're now bringing
[02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:09.040]   "into the conversation that I could be like that.
[02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:11.300]   "And let's see if you're going to be, oh, not today,
[02:17:11.300 --> 02:17:13.000]   "oh, we're still on green," right?
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:14.700]   And so where does this go?
[02:17:14.700 --> 02:17:19.300]   It goes back to the idea that kids are, and all of us are,
[02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:22.480]   interpreting the interactions and the structures around us,
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:26.040]   not only for what they are, but for what they represent
[02:17:26.040 --> 02:17:30.840]   as somebody else's interpretation of what we are
[02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:32.800]   or are not capable of.
[02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:37.240]   And he saw that behavior chart as a marker
[02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:41.080]   that his teacher assumed that all kids in that class
[02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:44.000]   are capable of being badly behaved,
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.420]   and that their main aim of being in school
[02:17:46.420 --> 02:17:48.260]   is to be well-behaved, right?
[02:17:48.260 --> 02:17:50.200]   And so he writes all about saying,
[02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:52.600]   "Dear teacher, every day I come to school,
[02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:55.240]   "every single day, and every single day is new,"
[02:17:55.240 --> 02:17:58.140]   that's what he says, "and I could learn something new,
[02:17:58.140 --> 02:18:00.700]   "except then I see dot, dot, dot,
[02:18:00.700 --> 02:18:02.660]   "the bad behavior chart," right?
[02:18:02.660 --> 02:18:05.920]   He's saying school is supposed to be about learning
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:09.040]   and us engaging, and you're making it about
[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:12.200]   something so low-level and basic
[02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:14.720]   as are you going to behave yourself today?
[02:18:14.720 --> 02:18:19.720]   We are insulting him by the way we frame the context.
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:23.080]   So take it back to the bigger issues of civic discourse
[02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:25.020]   and all these things, I think so much of the way
[02:18:25.020 --> 02:18:29.120]   that we're organizing our lives, our social relationships,
[02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:32.440]   our community, our civic structures right now,
[02:18:32.440 --> 02:18:37.260]   is mirroring that teacher's behavior chart, right?
[02:18:37.260 --> 02:18:38.860]   - Did she take the chart down?
[02:18:38.860 --> 02:18:41.060]   - I don't, no, I don't think so.
[02:18:41.060 --> 02:18:43.920]   - And I ask because I'm not sure that it matters.
[02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:46.100]   I think what probably matters is that he had the chance
[02:18:46.100 --> 02:18:48.600]   to voice his understanding of it.
[02:18:48.600 --> 02:18:50.080]   - Yeah, his understanding of the chart.
[02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:50.920]   Yeah, that's right.
[02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:53.320]   And now anybody can read his understanding of the chart
[02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:57.300]   'cause it's published in the most widely read textbook
[02:18:57.300 --> 02:18:59.820]   I'm learning, right, and motivation.
[02:18:59.820 --> 02:19:01.840]   I mean, there's a couple points.
[02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:03.240]   First is that we're structuring,
[02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:08.240]   the way we structure our environment can unwittingly impose
[02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:12.440]   our mental models of other people's possibility spaces
[02:19:12.440 --> 02:19:16.200]   onto them and people find that inherently abhorrent, right?
[02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:19.360]   So think about how we're doing that in many contexts,
[02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:21.600]   not simply in schools.
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:26.600]   And then the second thing is from the kid's perspective,
[02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:31.120]   deconstructing exactly why something bothers you
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:33.960]   by understanding how it is
[02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:36.860]   that you are interpreting that thing,
[02:19:36.860 --> 02:19:41.440]   then opens you up to be able to manage those spaces
[02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:43.540]   in a new way and to engage in them in a new way.
[02:19:43.540 --> 02:19:46.520]   So if we take the conversation back to the idea
[02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:48.340]   of civic discourse, of civic reasoning,
[02:19:48.340 --> 02:19:51.480]   of engaging with any idea, right?
[02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:54.280]   There are ideas that are deeply problematic.
[02:19:54.280 --> 02:19:56.320]   There are ideas that are deeply hurtful,
[02:19:56.320 --> 02:20:00.420]   that have long histories of trauma associated with them,
[02:20:00.420 --> 02:20:03.960]   of long histories of power dynamics
[02:20:03.960 --> 02:20:06.620]   and oppression associated with them.
[02:20:06.620 --> 02:20:11.620]   The way in which I think we deconstruct those ideas
[02:20:11.620 --> 02:20:14.640]   is going to be critical to how those ideas live on
[02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:18.180]   implicitly in our social relationships and our society.
[02:20:18.180 --> 02:20:21.280]   If we cancel them, if we negate them
[02:20:21.280 --> 02:20:23.480]   and pretend they don't exist,
[02:20:23.480 --> 02:20:26.200]   all we're doing is burying them
[02:20:26.200 --> 02:20:29.000]   in a place where they can't be deconstructed.
[02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:33.440]   And only by actually taking them apart
[02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:38.240]   and appreciating the pain, the relationship structures,
[02:20:38.240 --> 02:20:40.840]   the limitations, the resource allocations,
[02:20:40.840 --> 02:20:45.020]   the inequities that are implicit in those concepts,
[02:20:45.020 --> 02:20:49.220]   only by deconstructing and deeply understanding those,
[02:20:49.220 --> 02:20:52.660]   can we rebuild them in a different way.
[02:20:52.660 --> 02:20:57.140]   So it's very difficult because on the one hand,
[02:20:57.140 --> 02:21:01.480]   we have a space created for ourselves right now in society
[02:21:01.480 --> 02:21:04.960]   that is deeply unsafe for many people.
[02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:06.840]   And when you're in an unsafe space,
[02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:09.840]   you are not in a space that is conducive
[02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:11.800]   to constructing and deconstructing,
[02:21:11.800 --> 02:21:14.200]   meaning using those default mode systems
[02:21:14.200 --> 02:21:16.360]   and other systems just to be crass about the brain, right?
[02:21:16.360 --> 02:21:17.960]   And kind of oversimplify it,
[02:21:17.960 --> 02:21:21.340]   that are the substrate of autobiographical self,
[02:21:21.340 --> 02:21:23.360]   of possibility spaces, of ethics,
[02:21:23.360 --> 02:21:26.440]   of deep moral and ethical emotions.
[02:21:26.440 --> 02:21:30.180]   So on the one hand, we have a space that is deeply unsafe
[02:21:30.180 --> 02:21:31.740]   for individuals to think together.
[02:21:31.740 --> 02:21:35.460]   And genuinely so, there are real implications for people
[02:21:35.460 --> 02:21:37.560]   to reveal certain kinds of identities,
[02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:39.960]   to engage with certain kinds of ideas
[02:21:39.960 --> 02:21:43.960]   in culturally formulated spaces, right?
[02:21:43.960 --> 02:21:48.360]   That we've constructed together.
[02:21:48.360 --> 02:21:51.500]   And the irony is that we can only fix that
[02:21:51.500 --> 02:21:54.460]   and create a different way of interacting with one another
[02:21:54.460 --> 02:21:57.920]   by actually boldly going in there together.
[02:21:57.920 --> 02:22:02.760]   So it's a very nuanced line where we need to develop skills.
[02:22:02.760 --> 02:22:05.340]   And this is where I think, and many people think now,
[02:22:05.340 --> 02:22:08.780]   that schools should be focused across disciplinary domains,
[02:22:08.780 --> 02:22:10.380]   whether it's math, science, social studies,
[02:22:10.380 --> 02:22:12.300]   history, art, the arts, right?
[02:22:12.300 --> 02:22:16.220]   Sports should be focused on helping young people
[02:22:16.220 --> 02:22:20.740]   and teachers develop capacities and dispositions
[02:22:20.740 --> 02:22:23.620]   for deconstructing and constructing again,
[02:22:23.620 --> 02:22:28.620]   safe cultural spaces to think together
[02:22:28.620 --> 02:22:33.580]   about interpretations, about narratives,
[02:22:33.580 --> 02:22:36.180]   about stories, about assumptions, about ideas.
[02:22:36.180 --> 02:22:39.700]   Because as we engage in those thoughts together,
[02:22:39.700 --> 02:22:41.660]   we call that civic discourse, right?
[02:22:41.660 --> 02:22:46.660]   We learn kind of rules for not triggering
[02:22:46.660 --> 02:22:51.060]   and sensibilities for not endangering another person's
[02:22:51.060 --> 02:22:53.340]   ability to engage on equal footing with us.
[02:22:53.340 --> 02:22:57.180]   Because if we trigger those unsafe, right,
[02:22:57.180 --> 02:22:58.980]   dangerous places for people,
[02:22:58.980 --> 02:23:02.360]   they can't neurobiologically then engage with us deeply
[02:23:02.360 --> 02:23:04.220]   around sharing their perspective
[02:23:04.220 --> 02:23:07.940]   and deconstructing ours together to build something
[02:23:07.940 --> 02:23:09.980]   where we have a shared understanding in the middle.
[02:23:09.980 --> 02:23:11.800]   We have to trust one another.
[02:23:11.800 --> 02:23:14.960]   And trusting one another really means
[02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:18.580]   we have to have a space established
[02:23:18.580 --> 02:23:23.580]   in which we can feel safe to deconstruct our own beliefs
[02:23:23.580 --> 02:23:27.720]   and to allow others to do the same
[02:23:27.720 --> 02:23:32.140]   and to assure them that we can engage with those beliefs
[02:23:32.140 --> 02:23:33.780]   no matter what they are,
[02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:38.780]   and then actually exteriorize them
[02:23:38.780 --> 02:23:41.780]   and evaluate them together
[02:23:41.780 --> 02:23:43.900]   and think about them around core values
[02:23:43.900 --> 02:23:46.380]   we probably both hold like wellbeing,
[02:23:46.380 --> 02:23:49.460]   like sustainability of society and of cultures
[02:23:49.460 --> 02:23:51.040]   and of groups, right?
[02:23:51.040 --> 02:23:52.060]   These things are core.
[02:23:52.060 --> 02:23:53.360]   Everyone wants to be well.
[02:23:53.360 --> 02:23:56.220]   Everyone wants to have a sustainable life
[02:23:56.220 --> 02:23:58.340]   and a life future and a cultural set of values.
[02:23:58.340 --> 02:24:01.220]   And so when we all appreciate that we're bringing
[02:24:01.220 --> 02:24:02.200]   those things to the table,
[02:24:02.200 --> 02:24:06.460]   but then are systematic about constructing a space
[02:24:06.460 --> 02:24:11.380]   for civic discourse in which we are supporting one another
[02:24:11.380 --> 02:24:13.720]   in deconstructing our own beliefs
[02:24:13.720 --> 02:24:15.980]   rather than each other's beliefs, right?
[02:24:15.980 --> 02:24:19.400]   Then we are at a space where we can start to construct
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:23.020]   some kind of understanding, some kind of nuanced,
[02:24:23.020 --> 02:24:27.500]   more adaptive, more pro-social
[02:24:27.500 --> 02:24:31.460]   and the true sense way of engaging with one another
[02:24:31.460 --> 02:24:33.960]   with not necessarily a way of agreeing with one another,
[02:24:33.960 --> 02:24:36.020]   but way of engaging and constructing
[02:24:36.020 --> 02:24:37.280]   and deconstructing meaning together
[02:24:37.280 --> 02:24:38.700]   so that we can be adaptive,
[02:24:38.700 --> 02:24:41.420]   so that we can build a society where everyone can flourish,
[02:24:41.420 --> 02:24:44.300]   so that we can build a society where everyone can belong
[02:24:44.300 --> 02:24:48.420]   and can actually have the resources they need.
[02:24:48.420 --> 02:24:50.340]   - I would argue as long as free speech
[02:24:50.340 --> 02:24:52.660]   is not possible for everybody,
[02:24:52.660 --> 02:24:54.180]   that nobody is safe. - Yes, that's right.
[02:24:54.180 --> 02:24:55.620]   - That nobody is safe. - Nobody is safe.
[02:24:55.620 --> 02:24:58.420]   - And that there's an illusion of safety around the idea
[02:24:58.420 --> 02:25:03.420]   that people who have voice are gonna get what they want
[02:25:03.420 --> 02:25:08.540]   simply because they are the ones who are allowed to talk
[02:25:08.540 --> 02:25:09.500]   and other people aren't.
[02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:10.780]   I mean, I think you said it perfectly
[02:25:10.780 --> 02:25:12.940]   when you said that anytime ideas get buried,
[02:25:12.940 --> 02:25:14.460]   there's no way they can be solved.
[02:25:14.460 --> 02:25:16.220]   We know this from the scientific literature,
[02:25:16.220 --> 02:25:18.620]   for instance, there are results within social science
[02:25:18.620 --> 02:25:21.600]   and biological science that are deeply troubling.
[02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:25.980]   I can think of experiments that were done
[02:25:25.980 --> 02:25:29.820]   in the realm of neurosurgery on humans in the 1960s,
[02:25:29.820 --> 02:25:31.580]   people stimulating different brain areas
[02:25:31.580 --> 02:25:35.420]   and seeing rage or seeing very politically controversial
[02:25:35.420 --> 02:25:38.640]   ideas emerge from the person's mouth in real time
[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:40.620]   as a function of stimulating that brain area.
[02:25:40.620 --> 02:25:42.860]   And then you say, well, did they really believe that
[02:25:42.860 --> 02:25:44.200]   and they just never were saying it?
[02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:45.980]   And the person doesn't even recall that happening
[02:25:45.980 --> 02:25:47.300]   during the surgery.
[02:25:47.300 --> 02:25:50.140]   I mean, this idea that Jung had that we have all things
[02:25:50.140 --> 02:25:54.420]   inside of us, I think can be seen as a very dangerous notion
[02:25:54.420 --> 02:25:56.500]   and territory that we have all these shadows.
[02:25:56.500 --> 02:26:01.060]   But I'm also an optimist and I feel that the optimistic view
[02:26:01.060 --> 02:26:04.060]   of it is that by knowing that we have all things
[02:26:04.060 --> 02:26:09.020]   inside of us potentially and by embracing that fact
[02:26:09.020 --> 02:26:12.500]   that we can manage that to steal what you just said,
[02:26:12.500 --> 02:26:15.680]   we can manage that and that we can function so much better
[02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:17.900]   when we see something in the world that we think,
[02:26:17.900 --> 02:26:21.280]   that's not me, I'm not that and I hate that.
[02:26:21.280 --> 02:26:24.620]   When if we understand that that also lives inside of us,
[02:26:24.620 --> 02:26:27.860]   but that we just don't realize it.
[02:26:27.860 --> 02:26:29.380]   And I realize some people will hear this and they'll go,
[02:26:29.380 --> 02:26:30.660]   that's not true.
[02:26:30.660 --> 02:26:33.260]   I have my stances and I disagree with other things.
[02:26:33.260 --> 02:26:34.760]   I would say absolutely yes.
[02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:38.480]   But the difference between one person's stance
[02:26:38.480 --> 02:26:39.940]   and another person's stance
[02:26:39.940 --> 02:26:43.340]   is could be purely developmental wiring.
[02:26:43.340 --> 02:26:48.140]   It could be difference of having read different childhood
[02:26:48.140 --> 02:26:50.760]   books and oriented towards one book versus another.
[02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:54.500]   I mean, I think that we are very similar at the level
[02:26:54.500 --> 02:26:57.540]   of core wiring and core algorithms that we run,
[02:26:57.540 --> 02:27:00.500]   but somehow these days we have the perception
[02:27:00.500 --> 02:27:02.420]   that we've diverged so much.
[02:27:02.420 --> 02:27:04.100]   I think the only thing that's really missing
[02:27:04.100 --> 02:27:07.220]   is what you're describing is a place where any and all ideas
[02:27:07.220 --> 02:27:12.220]   can be explored freely, not to establish consensus.
[02:27:12.220 --> 02:27:14.460]   - Or validity of certain kinds of ideas,
[02:27:14.460 --> 02:27:18.340]   but to actually exteriorize them and deconstruct them
[02:27:18.340 --> 02:27:20.860]   for what they actually are.
[02:27:20.860 --> 02:27:21.740]   - Absolutely.
[02:27:21.740 --> 02:27:25.140]   Thank you for working through that space
[02:27:25.140 --> 02:27:27.020]   'cause it's a tricky one I realized.
[02:27:27.020 --> 02:27:28.260]   - It's very fraught.
[02:27:28.260 --> 02:27:32.220]   - It's very fraught, but so very important.
[02:27:32.220 --> 02:27:33.980]   I have a question that's very basic,
[02:27:35.340 --> 02:27:38.400]   but I've never gotten a good answer on.
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:42.060]   I was raised thinking that mirror neurons were a real thing,
[02:27:42.060 --> 02:27:45.260]   that there are these neurons that exist in the brains of us
[02:27:45.260 --> 02:27:50.120]   and other old world primates like macaque monkeys,
[02:27:50.120 --> 02:27:54.140]   but especially in humans, the so-called mirror neurons
[02:27:54.140 --> 02:27:56.660]   that are activated when we see somebody
[02:27:56.660 --> 02:28:00.540]   experience something and it evokes a sort of empathic
[02:28:00.540 --> 02:28:02.780]   understanding in us.
[02:28:02.780 --> 02:28:05.660]   I've also seen some reviews written recently
[02:28:05.660 --> 02:28:08.760]   in some popular press saying that mirror neurons
[02:28:08.760 --> 02:28:10.820]   are perhaps not playing the critical role
[02:28:10.820 --> 02:28:12.320]   that we thought they were.
[02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:15.140]   What's the story on mirror neurons?
[02:28:15.140 --> 02:28:18.860]   And we're not going after anybody's work in particular.
[02:28:18.860 --> 02:28:21.500]   I just want to know whether or not there's real validity
[02:28:21.500 --> 02:28:24.600]   to this notion of mirror neurons.
[02:28:24.600 --> 02:28:26.620]   - I'm not an expert on it, but I can tell you
[02:28:26.620 --> 02:28:31.000]   what I know about it and the way that I think about it.
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.760]   So, I mean, I think it's pretty clear now
[02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:37.420]   that there are no such things as mirror neurons,
[02:28:37.420 --> 02:28:41.000]   like some special kind of cell type that's in the brain,
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:42.320]   that they have not been found.
[02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:44.560]   They were predicted, but they were not found.
[02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:47.360]   But something else was also predicted
[02:28:47.360 --> 02:28:52.360]   back in the late 1980s by Antonio Damasio,
[02:28:52.360 --> 02:29:00.480]   where he talked about the brain in terms of,
[02:29:00.880 --> 02:29:02.920]   being organized in terms of what he called
[02:29:02.920 --> 02:29:05.360]   convergent and divergent zones.
[02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:09.780]   So he talked about the brain being organized
[02:29:09.780 --> 02:29:13.920]   as networks converging and then diverging again back out.
[02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:17.140]   So you have places where processing is kind of
[02:29:17.140 --> 02:29:20.620]   coming together and then what happens in there
[02:29:20.620 --> 02:29:23.160]   then determines how things get spread back out.
[02:29:23.160 --> 02:29:26.800]   And you've got these sort of loops happening in the brain.
[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:31.800]   And his thinking on that was very much commensurate
[02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:36.040]   with others thinking about the notion
[02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:40.440]   of goal-directed action and perception.
[02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:42.740]   So if you think back to developmental scholars
[02:29:42.740 --> 02:29:44.800]   who had knew nothing about the brain very much,
[02:29:44.800 --> 02:29:49.800]   like Jean Piaget, right, back in the early 20th century,
[02:29:49.800 --> 02:29:53.600]   where he was observing young children
[02:29:53.600 --> 02:29:57.960]   and noticing that they were interacting with the world
[02:29:57.960 --> 02:29:59.920]   and they expected certain things.
[02:29:59.920 --> 02:30:02.480]   And they were, he thought, imposing theories
[02:30:02.480 --> 02:30:07.200]   or schemas onto the world and then accommodating,
[02:30:07.200 --> 02:30:11.240]   was the word he used, the world with their actions
[02:30:11.240 --> 02:30:13.480]   when it didn't act the way they expected
[02:30:13.480 --> 02:30:16.720]   and then assimilating that back, right,
[02:30:16.720 --> 02:30:18.720]   to change what they expected next time.
[02:30:18.720 --> 02:30:21.160]   So that he had this model that he built
[02:30:21.160 --> 02:30:25.440]   from systematically observing children,
[02:30:25.440 --> 02:30:28.100]   three in particular, right, where he,
[02:30:28.100 --> 02:30:31.340]   what he realized is that kids are not just flailing around
[02:30:31.340 --> 02:30:33.800]   sort of discovering things haphazardly,
[02:30:33.800 --> 02:30:36.760]   they're imposing a certain logic onto the world
[02:30:36.760 --> 02:30:38.760]   and then they're systematically testing that logic.
[02:30:38.760 --> 02:30:40.240]   - So they're hypothesis testing.
[02:30:40.240 --> 02:30:43.360]   - Basically, yes, right, they're expecting things
[02:30:43.360 --> 02:30:44.880]   and then when the world does what they want,
[02:30:44.880 --> 02:30:47.760]   that reinforces and when it does something different,
[02:30:47.760 --> 02:30:50.120]   that's surprising and then they have to accommodate
[02:30:50.120 --> 02:30:52.000]   and make sense and then they have to expect differently
[02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:53.320]   in the future.
[02:30:53.320 --> 02:30:55.720]   So what does this have to do with mirror neurons?
[02:30:55.720 --> 02:30:58.480]   I think when you bring these different ideas together,
[02:30:58.480 --> 02:31:00.540]   the psychological observational ideas
[02:31:00.540 --> 02:31:03.140]   and then the neurobiological ideas,
[02:31:03.140 --> 02:31:06.560]   what we basically have, and I wrote about this a little bit
[02:31:06.560 --> 02:31:09.040]   in like, I think 2008, I have a paper called something like
[02:31:09.040 --> 02:31:11.000]   The Smoke Around Mirror Neurons,
[02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:12.260]   and I forget the second half of the title,
[02:31:12.260 --> 02:31:17.200]   but it has the word goals and directed actions and things,
[02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:21.440]   right, the idea I think is it's not that there are
[02:31:21.440 --> 02:31:24.820]   special neurons that are firing when we see another person
[02:31:24.820 --> 02:31:28.200]   do the thing right, but that we are,
[02:31:28.200 --> 02:31:30.960]   it goes back to the notion of us imposing our expectations
[02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:34.200]   onto the world, you have to share and understand intuitively
[02:31:34.200 --> 02:31:35.960]   the goal of the other one's action
[02:31:35.960 --> 02:31:39.060]   in order to activate these mirror regions, right,
[02:31:39.060 --> 02:31:43.160]   where, and what are those mirror regions?
[02:31:43.160 --> 02:31:46.720]   They are basically regions that are deeply interconnected
[02:31:46.720 --> 02:31:48.880]   with each other, right, they're thoroughly interconnected
[02:31:48.880 --> 02:31:50.720]   with each other in terms of white matter fiber tracks,
[02:31:50.720 --> 02:31:55.720]   and they are regions involved in action planning,
[02:31:55.720 --> 02:31:58.320]   you know, goal-oriented actions,
[02:31:58.320 --> 02:32:01.960]   and perceiving the outcomes of those actions.
[02:32:01.960 --> 02:32:06.480]   So it's a kind of a loop between acting and perceiving
[02:32:06.480 --> 02:32:10.360]   and acting and perceiving, and I argued at the time, right,
[02:32:10.360 --> 02:32:14.440]   that goals are emergent, like high-level goals,
[02:32:14.440 --> 02:32:19.040]   are emergent from the dynamic feedback loops
[02:32:19.040 --> 02:32:20.880]   of acting and perceiving, right,
[02:32:20.880 --> 02:32:22.980]   so I was really taking a very Piagetian view,
[02:32:22.980 --> 02:32:24.960]   but imposing that on the neuroscience.
[02:32:24.960 --> 02:32:28.040]   So I think you take what I'm saying together
[02:32:28.040 --> 02:32:30.440]   with like a Piagetian constructivist view,
[02:32:30.440 --> 02:32:32.520]   there are many other constructivist neuroscientists,
[02:32:32.520 --> 02:32:33.960]   constructivist psychologists also,
[02:32:33.960 --> 02:32:37.640]   and then also the neural data, what we see is that
[02:32:37.640 --> 02:32:40.500]   we don't have these special neurons built into our head,
[02:32:40.500 --> 02:32:43.040]   what we have is a natural proclivity,
[02:32:43.040 --> 02:32:44.680]   and I don't know where that comes from, right,
[02:32:44.680 --> 02:32:48.680]   but we have a natural proclivity to try to appreciate
[02:32:48.680 --> 02:32:53.680]   another person's actions, feelings, experiences,
[02:32:53.680 --> 02:32:59.780]   by leveraging our own similar actions, feelings, experiences,
[02:32:59.780 --> 02:33:05.000]   and so when we can share goals or experiences,
[02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.360]   that becomes more facile, right,
[02:33:07.360 --> 02:33:08.420]   and that's been shown over and over
[02:33:08.420 --> 02:33:10.820]   in these mirror-type papers, right,
[02:33:10.820 --> 02:33:15.820]   and when you distance yourself from those goals and actions
[02:33:15.820 --> 02:33:17.740]   or don't have an intuitive sense of them,
[02:33:17.740 --> 02:33:20.060]   then you don't get these mirroring activations,
[02:33:20.060 --> 02:33:25.060]   you don't get these kind of ramped up sharing of goals,
[02:33:25.060 --> 02:33:32.020]   or of experience, so I think it really comes back to
[02:33:32.020 --> 02:33:36.820]   the way the nervous system is wired to be inherently social.
[02:33:36.820 --> 02:33:39.820]   We are cultural learners, we are situated
[02:33:39.820 --> 02:33:43.540]   in social spaces from the moment we're conceived,
[02:33:43.540 --> 02:33:46.780]   and certainly from the moment we're born,
[02:33:46.780 --> 02:33:49.960]   and that social space, observing others,
[02:33:49.960 --> 02:33:52.180]   interacting with others, co-regulating
[02:33:52.180 --> 02:33:54.660]   each other's physiology, each other's attention,
[02:33:54.660 --> 02:33:59.180]   each other's emotion, right, as we do those things,
[02:33:59.180 --> 02:34:02.960]   we accommodate to each other and we wire ourselves
[02:34:02.960 --> 02:34:05.660]   to expect certain kinds of feelings,
[02:34:05.660 --> 02:34:09.260]   and then to recognize those same things in other people,
[02:34:09.260 --> 02:34:13.620]   and so as we share constructed experience together,
[02:34:13.620 --> 02:34:16.660]   we start to appreciate the sameness, right,
[02:34:16.660 --> 02:34:20.380]   the parallels between other people's and our own emotions,
[02:34:20.380 --> 02:34:25.380]   thoughts, goals, and we can also dehumanize them,
[02:34:25.380 --> 02:34:31.360]   make the other person not share our thoughts, emotions,
[02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:33.560]   goals, and then we are capable of all kinds
[02:34:33.560 --> 02:34:36.460]   of horrible things we've talked about before, right,
[02:34:36.460 --> 02:34:41.020]   where you've actually distanced yourself.
[02:34:41.020 --> 02:34:42.860]   So what's the scope on mirror neurons?
[02:34:42.860 --> 02:34:44.500]   I don't think mirror neurons exist,
[02:34:44.500 --> 02:34:45.660]   I think that's the consensus,
[02:34:45.660 --> 02:34:49.180]   but our propensity to engage with other people
[02:34:49.180 --> 02:34:51.660]   by simulating on the substrate of our own self,
[02:34:51.660 --> 02:34:55.020]   and then inferring the goals and the feelings
[02:34:55.020 --> 02:34:56.720]   and the outcomes and the experiences
[02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:00.240]   of those experiences that we've simulated,
[02:35:00.240 --> 02:35:03.580]   that's what is very essential to being a human,
[02:35:03.580 --> 02:35:06.500]   but keeping in mind that there's also this layer
[02:35:06.500 --> 02:35:11.500]   of learned, lived, cultural, developed expectations
[02:35:11.500 --> 02:35:15.640]   we impose onto the world, and we, not filter,
[02:35:15.640 --> 02:35:20.180]   but we steer our attention, we steer our perception
[02:35:20.180 --> 02:35:24.220]   to accommodate, to align with our expectations.
[02:35:24.220 --> 02:35:26.320]   So it's never just the reality
[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:28.340]   of what the person experienced or what happened,
[02:35:28.340 --> 02:35:30.960]   it's always our perception of that reality
[02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:33.080]   as we expected it to happen.
[02:35:33.080 --> 02:35:36.340]   So there's this very dynamic cultural co-construction
[02:35:36.340 --> 02:35:40.320]   happening that is messy, that is iterative,
[02:35:40.320 --> 02:35:43.500]   that you can learn to do in different ways,
[02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:47.500]   in different contexts, and that's kind of how I understand
[02:35:47.500 --> 02:35:48.740]   this notion of mirroring.
[02:35:48.740 --> 02:35:51.460]   - Before we conclude,
[02:35:51.460 --> 02:35:53.800]   I do want to answer your son's question.
[02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:55.420]   - Oh, I hope you don't.
[02:35:55.420 --> 02:35:59.480]   - So prior to recording, there was a text message
[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:01.700]   that came, we don't have to read it verbatim,
[02:36:01.700 --> 02:36:06.700]   but the text message, Mary Ellen's son
[02:36:06.700 --> 02:36:09.840]   is late teenage years and he's been doing
[02:36:09.840 --> 02:36:13.140]   deliberate cold exposure, cold showers on a daily basis
[02:36:13.140 --> 02:36:16.440]   and reported that he hasn't had any colds
[02:36:16.440 --> 02:36:17.380]   since starting this.
[02:36:17.380 --> 02:36:20.060]   This is actually a pretty common experience
[02:36:20.060 --> 02:36:23.900]   because the pulse and adrenaline that is inevitable
[02:36:23.900 --> 02:36:26.420]   with a uncomfortably cold but safe shower.
[02:36:26.420 --> 02:36:28.060]   - Yeah, no, he jumps out of bed in the morning,
[02:36:28.060 --> 02:36:30.540]   does a whole bunch of exercises to get warm
[02:36:30.540 --> 02:36:32.460]   and then jumps in a freezing cold shower.
[02:36:32.460 --> 02:36:33.300]   - Amazing.
[02:36:33.300 --> 02:36:35.620]   That spike of adrenaline we know is neuroprotective.
[02:36:35.620 --> 02:36:37.860]   If it's a short-lived spike in adrenaline,
[02:36:37.860 --> 02:36:38.700]   you don't want chronically-
[02:36:38.700 --> 02:36:39.660]   - No, you don't want chronic stress.
[02:36:39.660 --> 02:36:40.500]   That's not good for you.
[02:36:40.500 --> 02:36:41.320]   - That's not good.
[02:36:41.320 --> 02:36:42.740]   We know that from the beautiful work of Bruce McEwen
[02:36:42.740 --> 02:36:43.980]   and Bob Sapolsky and others.
[02:36:43.980 --> 02:36:44.820]   - Yes, gorgeous work, yeah.
[02:36:44.820 --> 02:36:49.820]   - Yeah, so, but then he asked, should he get sick?
[02:36:49.820 --> 02:36:52.540]   Should he continue the cold showers?
[02:36:52.540 --> 02:36:54.460]   And the answer is no.
[02:36:54.460 --> 02:36:57.760]   I think that then it would be hot showers and hot baths
[02:36:57.760 --> 02:37:00.040]   and sauna type stuff is probably better,
[02:37:00.040 --> 02:37:02.220]   but not so hot that it's stressful.
[02:37:02.220 --> 02:37:05.860]   You really want to reduce stress on an ill system.
[02:37:05.860 --> 02:37:10.260]   So he sounds for many reasons like a remarkable young man,
[02:37:10.260 --> 02:37:12.840]   as is your daughter, it sounds like a remarkable.
[02:37:12.840 --> 02:37:16.200]   And listen, and you're remarkable.
[02:37:16.200 --> 02:37:17.900]   And I really mean that.
[02:37:17.900 --> 02:37:20.680]   I feel like we could go on forever exploring these ideas.
[02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:23.580]   I absolutely would love to have you back
[02:37:23.580 --> 02:37:27.840]   for another discussion or many about your research.
[02:37:28.860 --> 02:37:30.960]   I want to thank you for taking the time
[02:37:30.960 --> 02:37:33.380]   of your research schedule, your teaching schedule
[02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:35.160]   to come educate us today.
[02:37:35.160 --> 02:37:38.060]   These ideas are so vitally important
[02:37:38.060 --> 02:37:40.440]   and you provide so many real world examples.
[02:37:40.440 --> 02:37:42.020]   In fact, it's one of the things that I love so much
[02:37:42.020 --> 02:37:43.740]   about your work is that it's really nested
[02:37:43.740 --> 02:37:45.300]   in real world applications.
[02:37:45.300 --> 02:37:46.140]   - Thank you.
[02:37:46.140 --> 02:37:49.320]   - And your thoughts and perspectives on the education
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:52.600]   and how it could be better at the level of educating kids
[02:37:52.600 --> 02:37:56.580]   at home, teaching ourselves, teachers,
[02:37:56.580 --> 02:38:00.840]   and the education system, I hope will ring far and wide
[02:38:00.840 --> 02:38:05.100]   because they really can be implemented.
[02:38:05.100 --> 02:38:06.180]   We're not talking about the need
[02:38:06.180 --> 02:38:07.660]   to purchase a bunch of stuff.
[02:38:07.660 --> 02:38:09.740]   - No, we need to start with a different disposition.
[02:38:09.740 --> 02:38:11.340]   We need to start with a different goal.
[02:38:11.340 --> 02:38:14.280]   Yeah, the goal of education needs to not,
[02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:16.180]   learning's not the goal, it's not the outcome.
[02:38:16.180 --> 02:38:18.100]   It needs to be the development of the person, right?
[02:38:18.100 --> 02:38:22.360]   How is a person changing themselves having learned this?
[02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:24.780]   And then you design the learning opportunities
[02:38:24.780 --> 02:38:28.140]   to change who people are capable of becoming, right?
[02:38:28.140 --> 02:38:30.860]   So the learning is there, but it's not the end point.
[02:38:30.860 --> 02:38:33.220]   It's just the means to something else,
[02:38:33.220 --> 02:38:35.300]   which we haven't been attending to enough.
[02:38:35.300 --> 02:38:36.860]   And that's the development of the person,
[02:38:36.860 --> 02:38:39.940]   who they become having learned that.
[02:38:39.940 --> 02:38:40.860]   - Beautifully put.
[02:38:40.860 --> 02:38:44.180]   Well, thank you so much for your time.
[02:38:44.180 --> 02:38:45.660]   Thank you so much for the work you do.
[02:38:45.660 --> 02:38:47.900]   And I can't wait to have another discussion with you
[02:38:47.900 --> 02:38:49.660]   about the emerging research.
[02:38:49.660 --> 02:38:51.220]   - Okay, I'll be back.
[02:38:51.220 --> 02:38:52.060]   - Thank you.
[02:38:52.060 --> 02:38:53.140]   Thank you for joining me today
[02:38:53.140 --> 02:38:54.960]   for my discussion about emotions,
[02:38:54.960 --> 02:38:57.080]   social interactions and learning
[02:38:57.080 --> 02:38:59.260]   with Dr. Mary Helen Imordino-Yang.
[02:38:59.260 --> 02:39:01.780]   I hope you found the conversation to be as informative
[02:39:01.780 --> 02:39:03.500]   and enriching as I did.
[02:39:03.500 --> 02:39:04.460]   If you'd like to learn more

[02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:13.720]   In addition, Dr. Imordino-Yang authored an incredible book
[02:39:13.720 --> 02:39:15.700]   called "Emotions, Learning and the Brain."
[02:39:15.700 --> 02:39:17.640]   It's a book designed for the general public.
[02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:18.900]   It's incredibly informative
[02:39:18.900 --> 02:39:21.040]   and has a lot of practical tools as well.
[02:39:21.040 --> 02:39:24.720]   We've provided a link to that book in the show note captions.

[02:39:58.060 --> 02:40:00.660]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.
[02:40:00.660 --> 02:40:02.840]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:40:02.840 --> 02:40:04.880]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:06.440]   for things like enhancing sleep,
[02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:08.700]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[02:40:08.700 --> 02:40:10.820]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to have partnered
[02:40:10.820 --> 02:40:12.060]   with Momentous Supplements.
[02:40:12.060 --> 02:40:13.160]   To see the supplements discussed
[02:40:13.160 --> 02:40:15.560]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast, go to Live Momentous,
[02:40:15.560 --> 02:40:18.880]   spelled O-U-S, so that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:22.120]   Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:24.400]   If you're not already following us on social media,
[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:27.400]   I am @hubermanlab on Instagram, Twitter,
[02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:28.720]   Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:30.960]   And at all those places, I discuss science
[02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:33.000]   and science-related tools, some of which overlaps
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.060]   with the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:40:35.060 --> 02:40:37.320]   but much of which often does not overlap
[02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:39.040]   with the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:40:39.040 --> 02:40:42.740]   So again, it's @hubermanlab on all social media platforms.
[02:40:42.740 --> 02:40:44.280]   In addition, if you haven't subscribed
[02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:46.080]   to our neural network newsletter,
[02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:48.340]   it's a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[02:40:48.340 --> 02:40:50.360]   that provides summaries of podcast episodes,
[02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:51.800]   as well as toolkits.
[02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:53.920]   For instance, toolkits for optimizing sleep,
[02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:56.160]   or toolkits for learning in neuroplasticity,
[02:40:56.160 --> 02:40:57.560]   or for deliberate cold exposure,
[02:40:57.560 --> 02:40:59.480]   or for dopamine, and on and on.
[02:40:59.480 --> 02:41:01.120]   To sign up for the neural network newsletter,
[02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:03.600]   simply go to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu,
[02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:05.640]   scroll down to newsletter, and provide your email.
[02:41:05.640 --> 02:41:08.200]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[02:41:08.200 --> 02:41:10.840]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[02:41:10.840 --> 02:41:13.240]   with Dr. Mary Helen Imordino-Yang.
[02:41:13.240 --> 02:41:15.460]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:41:15.460 --> 02:41:17.260]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:41:17.260 --> 02:41:19.840]   (upbeat music)
[02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:22.760]   (guitar strumming)
