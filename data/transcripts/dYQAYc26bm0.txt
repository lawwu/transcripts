[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:13.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.640]   - Welcome back to Future Proof.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.480]   What?
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.520]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.480]   Duncan, I don't know what I'm talking about here.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.900]   - You're jumping into the ad.
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.080]   - Yeah, good segue.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.660]   We're this week responsible by Future Proof.
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.400]   I'm just so excited about it still.
[00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.660]   Biggest wealth festival there is,
[00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.780]   September 10th through 13th,
[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.780]   Huntington Beach, California.
[00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.760]   We're gonna have thousands of people there.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.060]   It's gonna be fun.
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.180]   Last year we did a,
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.880]   Duncan and John filmed us doing a,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.260]   recreating a rocky scene on the beach.
[00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.940]   That's how nice the beach is.
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:45.780]   That was fun.
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.300]   Can't believe I actually ever did that.
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.140]   - I'm glad you mentioned that.
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.580]   I was gonna ask what we're gonna do
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.500]   to one up that this year.
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.340]   - I don't know.
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.460]   I don't think it's possible to top it.
[00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.300]   If you want to check it out,
[00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.120]   if you want to register,
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.100]   I think if you register early now,
[00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.340]   you can get a decent deal.
[00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.820]   Futureproof.advisorcircle.com.
[00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.060]   All right, so we're back into the good part
[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.900]   of the stock market.
[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.840]   John, throw up my chart here.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.740]   I looked at the monthly returns for the S&P
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.820]   and I realized I did January 2022 twice on here,
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.980]   but the last one's supposed to be January 2023.
[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.260]   So this year to date,
[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.100]   as of this morning,
[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.820]   we're up like five something percent in the S&P.
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.620]   And if you look at the monthly returns over the last,
[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.340]   this is 13 months or so.
[00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.300]   Call it a year and change.
[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.700]   We have down five, down three, up four,
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.740]   down nine, down eight, up nine, down four,
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.700]   down nine, up eight, up six, down six, up five,
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.320]   and who knows where we're gonna finish.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.460]   It's all over the place.
[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.500]   And I just thinking about all of this back and forth
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.940]   and volatility and it's,
[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.700]   even though there's been a downtrend in the market,
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.820]   there's been a lot of snapback rallies
[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.260]   and it's very confusing to people.
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.340]   And it just reminds me of the John Bogle quote
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.940]   that the stock market is a giant distraction
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.300]   to the business of investing.
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.300]   In the last year, really last three years or so,
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.180]   we've had so much volatility and booms and busts
[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.460]   and things going in different directions.
[00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.740]   I think it's easy to lose sight of the fact that
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.500]   like over the longterm,
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.500]   these huge moves on a daily, weekly, monthly basis
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.380]   kind of get smoothed out.
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.740]   And I think even when it's going really well,
[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.460]   is it going a little bit better lately?
[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.020]   You still have to kind of zoom out and realize like,
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.700]   this is not the way things are gonna be over the longterm.
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.780]   So I do think it makes sense for most people
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.020]   to just kind of ignore the stuff that's happening
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.620]   on a daily, weekly, monthly basis
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.420]   in terms of performance, especially.
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.540]   - Yeah, no, I mean, I think that the takeaway for me
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.820]   is that I've learned now why people are obsessed
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.100]   with year-to-date,
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.660]   because year-to-date is feeling great right now, you know?
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.500]   So--
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.940]   - All we need to do is turn over the calendar
[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.020]   and look what happens.
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.940]   - Right, right.
[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.620]   Also, there is a firearm test going on in the background,
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.580]   so hopefully it's not too loud.
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.020]   - Okay, good timing.
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.860]   Thanks, guys. - Great, yeah.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.220]   - All right, let's do the first question.
[00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.620]   - Okay, up first we have a question from Mike.
[00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.740]   I've been considering shifting 20 to 30%
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.260]   of my all-stock ETF portfolio to bonds,
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.460]   but I haven't yet because the market
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.820]   is still well below the highs of 2022.
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.020]   My thought is that I have a long enough time horizon
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.820]   to wait until the stock market reaches new highs
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.340]   before making this shift.
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.420]   I recognize that this is a type of market timing,
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.740]   which generally doesn't work and should be avoided,
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.100]   but I don't see any gaps in this rationale,
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.140]   so I'd like to hear your thoughts.
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.180]   I find it interesting they admit
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.940]   that it usually doesn't work,
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.380]   but they think that this might work for them.
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.660]   - I guess any sort of market timing,
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.700]   there has to be some sort of gap in rationale.
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.540]   Now, I'm not sure the exact reason here,
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.260]   but since Mike is a viewer of the show,
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.620]   I'm guessing he analyzed his risk profile
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.020]   and time horizon and his plan,
[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.020]   and he said, "You know, I need a more balanced portfolio.
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.480]   "I'm going from all-stock to bonds.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.420]   "I realize I need more balance," for whatever reason.
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.980]   So he wants to go from 100% in stocks
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.780]   to more of an 80/20, 70/30 portfolio.
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.340]   Now, some people prefer the glide path,
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.220]   which is just slowly moving from all-equity
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.420]   to something more balanced.
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.260]   So that could mean, I don't know,
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.180]   5% or 10% per year you move.
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.340]   So you go 100% to 95% to 90%, whatever, in a slow...
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.100]   That's how the target date funds do it, right?
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.720]   They do it in a slow manner.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.620]   They slowly...
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.320]   Other people would rather just rip off the Band-Aid
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.180]   and, like, "If this is the allocation I want,
[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.020]   "I'm just gonna go to it now."
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.080]   It sounds like Mike wants to rip off the Band-Aid,
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.360]   but he's not quite there yet
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.140]   because he thinks stocks can snap back.
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.140]   Now, the rationale here
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.540]   that stocks are more attractive than bonds,
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.580]   it makes more sense,
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.460]   'cause even if stocks just go back to all-time highs,
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.520]   they'd probably have more upside.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.100]   The problem here, as always,
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.960]   that even if you're right directionally,
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.100]   that stocks do have more upside,
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.140]   you might not nail the timing.
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.980]   So, John, throw up the table I made here.
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.100]   So these are the drawdowns as of yesterday.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.940]   It might be a little better
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.020]   after a little bit of rally today,
[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.340]   but the S&P from all-time highs is down 16%.
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.060]   The Russell 2000 index of small caps was down 22.
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.320]   NASDAQ 100 is still down 28%.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.420]   Just to break even,
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.380]   we gotta see gains of 19, 28, and 38, respectively, right?
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.160]   Now, if that happens in less than a year,
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.780]   you're talking great annualized returns.
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.620]   It's gonna be awesome.
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.520]   Of course that's gonna beat the bond market.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.420]   But I'd say it takes a little longer.
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.340]   I looked at what the annualized returns would be here
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.800]   over two, three, four, or five years.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.980]   If we're talking four years,
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.500]   it could be more of a 4% return
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.760]   for the S&P to get back to that break even.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.300]   And now we're looking pretty similar to bond yields.
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.940]   Now, I'm not saying it's going to take that long,
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.800]   but if you look at the history of bear markets,
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.220]   some of them have taken that long to break even.
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.060]   I hope it doesn't take that long, but you never know.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.600]   So I think the whole point of setting an asset allocation
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.960]   in the first place is not necessarily to optimize
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.400]   for the highest returns possible.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.700]   If you're gonna optimize for the highest returns possible,
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.880]   you invest in the stock market
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.320]   and maybe add some leverage on there, right?
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.560]   That's like a textbook.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.920]   That's how you'd wanna optimize.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.280]   But I think the asset allocation really is about trying
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.720]   to earn the highest return for a given level of risk.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.120]   And if you've figured out that a given level of risk for me
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.780]   is 80/20 or 70/30,
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.960]   the longer you stay in an all-stock portfolio,
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.480]   the longer there's a risk mismatch.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.720]   So I think you might be fine
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.600]   since you've already dealt with an all-stock portfolio
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.120]   for this long, but I think that there's a few options.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.400]   So you could wait it out
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.120]   and sell some of your stocks after a big rebound.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.500]   The only caveat here is that you might just need
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.340]   to be a little more patient.
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.840]   If the market is doing great now,
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.680]   it could fall again next month, who knows?
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.720]   We could be back here next month and say,
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.060]   "Hey, we're back to a down 6% month."
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.220]   Wouldn't surprise me.
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.120]   You could rip the bandaid off
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.000]   and just move to that stated asset allocation.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.240]   The bad news is you're selling some stocks at a loss,
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.280]   probably in the midst of a drawdown.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.480]   The good news is you're buying bonds
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.560]   at a much higher yield here.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.560]   So maybe bonds provide a little bit of a boost
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.880]   'cause you have higher yields.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.760]   The third option, if you want to split the difference,
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.120]   is just my glide path, dollar cost average, right?
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.440]   Do 5% every three months, every six months,
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.080]   every nine, 12 months, whatever it is.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.500]   Pick a time, do it at a predetermined intervals,
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.240]   and then just ease into it.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.720]   And because if the stock market falls,
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.360]   then you're gonna think, "Well, what am I waiting for?"
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.760]   And then you could just have to double down
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.580]   and do it at a different time.
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.680]   So it's possible we could slingshot back
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.520]   to new all-time highs.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.340]   It wouldn't surprise me.
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.340]   It's also possible that we could just kind of drift sideways
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.960]   for a while and who knows what happens.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.480]   So I would just have a contingency plan
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.680]   if you're gonna stick in all stocks
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.640]   that you want to get to this other allocation,
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.920]   just in case stocks roll over again
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.960]   or they go sideways for a while
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.280]   and then you're kind of stuck and go, "Now what do I do?"
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.280]   - But to be clear, what's your market prediction
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.440]   for the year overall?
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.760]   - I give my S&P 500 levels in December.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.100]   - Okay, okay. - I wait.
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.200]   - I'm trying to get you on CNBC, you know?
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.640]   - I put all my predictions through Michael.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.420]   He's like my puppet.
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.820]   Let's do another one.
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.860]   - Okay, up next we have a question from Joe.
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.920]   "If I have a pension and an annuity,
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.160]   "is that a substitute for bonds?"
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.000]   - Good question.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.140]   I've received some variation of this question for years.
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.140]   This was actually another follow-up
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.300]   to our discussion last week on the pros and cons
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.740]   of having 100% all-stock portfolio.
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.100]   And what did you say?
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.660]   70% of the people in the chat last week
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.700]   said that they actually have all their money in stocks?
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.540]   Something like that?
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.140]   - Something like that, yeah.
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.260]   - Okay, pretty good.
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.640]   Another one people ask is if Social Security
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.480]   should count as a bond.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.280]   'Cause Social Security really is a form of annuity.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.440]   I've seen estimates in the range of,
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.720]   'cause you take those payments
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.080]   and the present value of any investment
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.000]   is take the future cash flows,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.600]   discount them back at some reasonable discount rate.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.060]   If you did that for Social Security,
[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.480]   depending on how much you made
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.080]   and how long you live and all these things
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.160]   that they change from person to person,
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.600]   the present value of even Social Security as an annuity
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.680]   could be something like 300 to $500,000.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.140]   Like that would be the present value
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.540]   of trying to buy an annuity stream like that.
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.180]   Obviously, it's impossible to come up with a precise value
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.780]   for these things 'cause rates are always changing
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.660]   and no one knows how long they're gonna live.
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.780]   But let's say you made some reasonable assumptions
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.100]   and you discount your periodic payments from your annuity
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.820]   or your pension back to give yourself a range
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.180]   of the current value of those payments.
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.300]   Let's say you have like a $600,000 portfolio
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.060]   and you realize that these annuity payments
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.100]   and this pension payment is worth
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.660]   something like 400 to 600,000.
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:44.520]   So does that mean that you now have a 60/40 portfolio
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.520]   or a 50/50 portfolio and then you can go all in on stocks
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.520]   'cause that other piece is your bonds?
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.260]   I don't necessarily like to look at it that way.
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.480]   I prefer to approach this
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.360]   from more of a financial planning perspective
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.600]   than a portfolio management perspective
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.600]   because think about it, if you had no,
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.920]   let's pretend you have no pension income and no annuity
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.320]   and you retire, would you rely strictly,
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.180]   and you're relying strictly on your portfolio
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.200]   for your spending purposes.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.080]   You decide, all right, I can spend maybe 4% to 5% per year
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.780]   from this portfolio for withdrawals
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.920]   and that's gonna get me through things.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.560]   Now, let's say you run the numbers
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.720]   and you realize you do have this pension,
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.560]   you do have the annuity,
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.240]   and it takes your spending from your portfolio down
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.600]   from 4% to 5% to 2% to 3%.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.560]   So that gives you the ability to potentially
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.520]   take more risk in your portfolio,
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.880]   but the question then becomes,
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.360]   do you want to take more risk?
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.080]   Like you can take more risk, but do you really need to?
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.400]   And you might not need to anymore, but you could want to.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.360]   So I think that's what it really comes down to.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.400]   Like a lower spending rate
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.840]   gives you the ability to take more risk.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.600]   It doesn't necessarily force you to take more risk.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.600]   It doesn't require you to.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.320]   So I think you still,
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.600]   if you have a hard time dealing with volatility,
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.000]   having an all stock portfolio,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.020]   even if you have that other income coming in,
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:48.860]   it's probably not gonna help much.
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.320]   'Cause think about it, if you're still working
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.720]   and you're getting a paycheck and income coming in,
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.600]   does that make it easier to sit through the volatility
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.520]   in the stock market?
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.440]   For some people it might,
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.560]   'cause they know they have future savings.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.440]   Other people say, no, I can't do this.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.280]   I need an emotional hedge.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.160]   I need cash or bonds.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.800]   So I just think you have to decide
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.080]   whether you're comfortable taking more risk.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.300]   If you have that annuity and the pension coming in,
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.000]   obviously you're in a much better spot.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.840]   It makes your life more predictable and easier
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.500]   in terms of spending needs.
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.440]   But I think it really depends on how you handle volatility.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.200]   - Well now, maybe I'm wrong here,
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.540]   but I feel like I've read before about pensions
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.320]   not actually coming to fruition, right?
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.960]   Isn't that a thing that happens?
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.800]   So are they 100% given?
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.600]   - You mean if a company goes under?
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.480]   I feel like I've heard of them getting cut in half
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.720]   or being like, yeah.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.180]   - Well, there's some insurance there
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.240]   and it'd be hard to cut it in half immediately
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.080]   for some people.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.320]   But your future benefits could be taken down
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.380]   if you're a young person right now.
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.360]   Say you might not get the same benefits as if you're a teacher
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.560]   and your benefits are a little,
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.400]   you have to put more money in
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.720]   or you don't get as much as the other teachers.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.280]   But yeah, for some people, I guess it would be,
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.080]   can I really bank on this?
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.880]   But yeah, if you're in the position
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.920]   of getting a pension income,
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.080]   you're in a better spot than a lot of people
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.920]   'cause a lot of people don't have those anymore.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.000]   - Right.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.440]   - By the way, I heard the fire alarm.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.280]   Nicely done.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.080]   It's getting louder and louder, it feels like.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.320]   - All right, let's do another one.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.280]   - Okay, up next we have a question from Casey.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.840]   I've heard you guys say quite a few times
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.500]   that trees don't grow to the sky
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.640]   and you're usually talking about a particular company
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.240]   or Bitcoin or maybe ARK, et cetera.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.840]   But could the same be true for the stock market in general?
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.540]   Does it hit a point where it simply can't grow anymore?
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.520]   After all, money is scarce and limited.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.640]   If everyone invests in the stock market,
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.640]   we can't all become millionaires, right?
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.640]   - So I've only read one Jonathan Franzen book in my life.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.840]   Are you a Franzen fan at all?
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.680]   - I actually have a book or two, but I haven't read them.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.560]   - Okay, I think the one was called "Freedom," I think.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.720]   I read it, I don't know, probably eight or nine years ago.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.760]   The only thing I remember about the book,
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.640]   it was a really long book,
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.080]   was that the whole basic premise was
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.480]   why do we need to have so much economic and personal growth?
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.440]   Why can't we just chill
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.340]   and be happy where we are for a while?
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.800]   And that sounds great until you realize
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.680]   that this machine that we're in,
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.760]   it kind of rests on the fact that growth.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.840]   Listen, if we all woke up one day and decided
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.280]   we're not gonna prove ourselves anymore,
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.360]   no more innovation, we're happy where we are,
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.480]   sure, the stock market will stop growing,
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.800]   corporations will stop throwing off profits,
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.400]   and we'll probably descend into Mad Max territory
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.180]   or something, and people will be very angry.
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:21.100]   - So you're that optimistic?
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.240]   - No, I just don't think, I think as a species,
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.280]   the one thing that sets us apart
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.580]   is that we like to move forward
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.360]   and improve and have progress.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.840]   It's kind of just in our DNA, right?
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.400]   So Buffett, in 2008, wrote his "Buy American IM" thing
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.920]   in October, 2008.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.960]   He was like 30% too early, but so be it.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:38.800]   He said, "Over the long term,
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.540]   "the stock market will be good news.
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.380]   "In the 20th century,
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.220]   "the United States has endured two world wars,
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.160]   "other traumatic and expensive military conflicts,
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.180]   "the depression, a dozen or so recessions,
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.400]   "financial panics, oil shocks, a flu epidemic,"
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.240]   which was one of two now,
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.980]   "and the resignation of a disgraced president.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.280]   "Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497."
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.280]   That was in the fall of 2008.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.080]   The Dow is now over 33,000.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.920]   "Since then, we've had wars, a pandemic,
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.600]   "skyrocketing inflation and insurrection of the capital.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.500]   "Things are still moving forward.
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.340]   "People are still innovating.
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.760]   "Despite all the bad stuff, people just keep moving forward.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.800]   "So I do, however, think it makes sense
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.640]   "to temporary expectations of future returns."
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.280]   So John Thrope, this is one of my favorite charts,
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.120]   courtesy of the Credit Suisse yearbook.
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.640]   This shows the relative size of equities markets
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.920]   around the globe in 1899 and 2022.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.780]   The US made up 15% of the equity markets in 1900.
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.120]   They now make up 60%.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.040]   It's eating it like Pac-Man, basically,
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.280]   eating the rest of the world.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.420]   (crowd cheering)
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.320]   Nice sound effect.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.840]   Way to go.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.160]   And we still can't beat the rest of the world in soccer.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.000]   - True.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.560]   - So we're up like 10% per year for the last 100 years.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.000]   So they say the winner writes history books.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.320]   We're definitely the winner here.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.960]   I just don't think that's sustainable.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.720]   So if you look at valuations over time,
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.640]   they've been trending higher.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.660]   Dividend yields have been trending lower.
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:53.680]   It would make sense that returns are lower going forward.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.440]   Now, is that because trees don't go to the sky?
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.320]   I think not necessarily.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.960]   The reason that valuations used to be so much lower
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.280]   and returns used to be so much higher
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.740]   is because the stock market used to be way riskier.
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.900]   During World War I, the stock market closed for six months
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.280]   'cause liquidity all but dried up
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.920]   'cause people went away to war.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.080]   The Federal Reserve was created a year before that happened.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:10.920]   During the Great Depression,
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.600]   they basically made the depression worse.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.700]   They were raising rates.
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.680]   The stock market fell something like 85%.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.040]   Do you think that the government or the Fed
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.520]   would allow the stock market to fall 85% today?
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.360]   No way.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.720]   There's no way they would ever let that happen.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.400]   So I think if you take the Great Depression
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.000]   left-tail risk off the table,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.180]   risk premiums should compress.
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.020]   Now--
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.200]   - What if a bunch of Congress people
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.320]   were shorting the market, though?
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.920]   I could see that happening.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.320]   - Don't they do that anyway?
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.600]   So I think if you don't have to worry
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.440]   about this Great Depression
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.240]   'cause there's now a good lender of last resort,
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.440]   you probably don't have to ask for as high returns
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.280]   on the stocks.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.280]   So obviously, I'm not saying
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.120]   that the risk of a market crashes off the table.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.680]   It's obvious volatility in the stock market
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.500]   is still here to stay.
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:51.640]   Just look at the last three years.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.800]   It's not like it's gotten a ton easier.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.400]   I think we've taken the Armageddon situation off the table,
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.260]   unless we get an actual Armageddon.
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.580]   In that scenario, though,
[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.200]   we have Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck, just in case.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.940]   However, even if I'm right
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.880]   that future returns will be lower,
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.440]   the only thing that matters to actual investors
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.320]   is net returns, not gross returns, right?
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.600]   So I think gross returns
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.200]   will probably be lower in the future.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.040]   Why?
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.000]   Because costs were so much higher in the past.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.680]   In the past, it could cost anywhere
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.960]   from 1% to 3% in commissions to buy a stock, right?
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.000]   Then May Day came along in 1975.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.960]   They made it so that they didn't have a set prices
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:28.260]   for brokerages, cheap brokerages, discount brokerages,
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.400]   like Charles Schwab came along.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.440]   Costs have been completely wiped out.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.400]   Obviously, now it's free to trade a stock.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.960]   From 1900 to 1975, the average CAPE ratio
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.240]   for the U.S. stock market was less than 15 times.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.560]   Since 1976, it's 22 times on average, right?
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.760]   So valuations have gone up.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.320]   I think lowering costs helped that.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.100]   Bid-ask spreads have collapsed.
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.600]   You said these wide bid-ask spreads.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.700]   Back in the day, people used to trade stocks
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.340]   using fractions instead of decimal points.
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.520]   You used to have guys in funny jackets
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.600]   on a trading floor yelling at each other.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.000]   Now, we trade using computers, right?
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.320]   - Those were the days.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.080]   - Index funds didn't exist until the 1970s, right?
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.280]   You used to have to pay an upfront fee
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.640]   called a load to buy a mutual fund.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.680]   It could cost anywhere from 5% to 10%.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.440]   The very first index fund in 1976 from Vanguard
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.480]   had an 8% load.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.140]   You had to pay 8% of your purchase price
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.720]   to buy an index fund.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.920]   401(k)s have only been around since 1978.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.240]   Roth IRAs were created in 1997.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.760]   First ETF was also in the 1990s.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.660]   So it's never been easier to invest in the stock market
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.100]   at a low cost using tax-deferred accounts.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.500]   So I think even if gross returns are lower going forward,
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.420]   it's not 10% anymore.
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.020]   Let's say it's 6, 7, 8.
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.980]   On a net basis, they might actually be higher
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.020]   because it's so much easier to invest now.
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.780]   So that's my positive spin on it.
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.940]   Gross returns had to be higher in the past
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.700]   to incentivize people to invest in stocks
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.720]   'cause they were so much scarier.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.140]   That's not the case anymore.
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:47.820]   - What's the highest fee you remember
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.640]   for placing a trade for stocks,
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.540]   calling up a broker or something?
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:53.420]   - I mean, I don't know, Duncan.
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.380]   The first trade I ever made was a target date fund.
[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.020]   So it's always been pretty free for me.
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.940]   - I feel like I've heard people talk about the 40s,
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.620]   like $40 or something, which is pretty hard to imagine.
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.100]   - Yeah, it was pretty high back in the day.
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.020]   And I mean, the thing is, though,
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.860]   people back in the day were more buy and hold investors.
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:09.700]   They didn't trade as much.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.780]   So maybe that was a barrier
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:16.740]   from an emotional, behavioral perspective.
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:20.180]   But it used to be really, really expensive.
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.620]   And the other thing is the trees don't grow to the sky thing
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:24.500]   is more about outperformance.
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.180]   So the reason that a strategy can't outperform at all times
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.060]   is because if such a strategy existed,
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:34.020]   so much money would just plow into it
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.220]   that eventually sizes the enemy of outperformance
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:37.220]   and it wouldn't work anymore.
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.060]   That's what happens.
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.260]   That's the trees don't grow to the sky thing.
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.380]   It's not just that things can stop growing.
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.540]   Obviously, again, if we stop having progress
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.740]   and innovation and that stuff, all bets are off.
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.700]   But I tend to believe that people
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.820]   are still gonna wake up in the morning
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:50.860]   hoping to get better.
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:54.620]   - I see Oliver in the chat says
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.660]   they remember $80 to buy and sell.
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.500]   - Jeez.
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.700]   - It's pretty crazy.
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.300]   - Yeah, it used to be really, really high.
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.720]   The funny thing is you used to not have any sort of scale.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.140]   So if you were buying 100 shares of stock,
[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.140]   it would cost the same as buying 100,000 shares,
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.020]   which seems ridiculous, right?
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.540]   But that's what it used to be.
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.580]   - I think I just thought of a way to fix Robinhood.
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.280]   They just charge $80 a trade.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.280]   - Sold.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.220]   - Okay.
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.140]   - Let's do another one.
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.280]   - Up next, we have a question from Joe.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.160]   At what point does whole life insurance make sense?
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.300]   Many advisors seem to have a pretty negative opinion
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.700]   about it, but when does it actually make sense?
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.300]   My wife and I are in our mid 30s.
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.300]   We have $135,000 in brokerage account
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.100]   and about $200,000 between our 401ks.
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.900]   Our house is halfway paid off and we have no other debt.
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:45.980]   Our combined annual salary is roughly $210,000 gross.
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.300]   We also do not have any, we do not plan on having children.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.220]   Our financial advisor is suggesting a whole life policy,
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.660]   but we're having a hard time determining
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.740]   if our situation would warrant it.
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.340]   My wife's big thing is that because we won't have children,
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.980]   she wants to be able to pay for top nursing facilities,
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.300]   et cetera, down the road.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.600]   Wow, they are planning like way out,
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.060]   thinking about nursing facilities in your 30s.
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.220]   Yeah, it's a good thought.
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.060]   It's expensive.
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.080]   This one is beyond my pay grade.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.300]   So let's bring an insurance expert in.
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.500]   This is Jonathan Noby, he's gonna join us.
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.660]   He helps run our insurance business at Ritholtz.
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:17.700]   Hey, Jonathan.
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.020]   What's up, fellas?
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.500]   All right, before we get into the specifics here,
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.700]   which these people have, as Duncan said,
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.300]   really thought hard about this,
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.220]   just give me the main differences
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.100]   between whole life and term insurance.
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.100]   'Cause I was always told when I got my first insurance,
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.780]   when my daughter was born, I got life insurance.
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.140]   Everyone said due term, it's easier, it's cheaper.
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.900]   I think I pay $23 a month or something for it.
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.500]   Really cheap, it was easy.
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.900]   Didn't have to think too much about it.
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.780]   Tell us, explain the differences there.
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.700]   Sure, I'll explain those in one second.
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.300]   It's just that this question reminded me
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:49.000]   of my favorite New Yorker cartoon of all time.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.820]   John, if you could bring that up.
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.380]   So what's the best time to buy whole life?
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.260]   Never, how's never?
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:59.040]   All right, bring that down.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.020]   I'm only partially kidding.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:04.080]   Okay, so first let's talk about whole life
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.980]   in the spectrum of what insurance is.
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.460]   There's generally two different kinds of life insurance.
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:14.060]   There's term insurance and there's permanent insurance.
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.100]   Term insurance, the kind that you own and I own
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.620]   and most people own and the kind that we generally recommend.
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.940]   It's there for a term of time,
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.920]   whether that be 10 years or 15 years or 20 years
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.440]   or sometimes 30, but I don't love that.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.680]   You pay a level premium and it's there for that entire term.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.280]   And when the term is up, it's gone and that's it.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.880]   And it's generally, if you're young and healthy,
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.740]   not very expensive.
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.180]   Permanent insurance on the other hand,
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.900]   is the kind of insurance that is there until,
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:46.740]   at best case scenario, till the end of your life.
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.500]   Whole life insurance was the first kind
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.460]   of permanent insurance.
[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.180]   And it's one of a few different kinds.
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.600]   Now, most people don't know any more about insurance
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.420]   than like term versus whole
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.580]   and they mistake whole life
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:06.240]   for all kinds of permanent life insurance.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.620]   Whole life is a kind of permanent life insurance.
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.780]   It's not the only one.
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.780]   And there's things like universal life
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.980]   and variable universal life and indexed universal life
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.580]   and stuff like that.
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.180]   Now, we're not necessarily gonna get
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.800]   into what all of those are here.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.620]   So for our purposes, we're just going to assume
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:27.660]   term insurance versus permanent insurance.
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.980]   One thing I wanna say about this here,
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.980]   I'm gonna use quotes around the advisor
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.300]   who's recommending this to you, Joe.
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.740]   He's very likely an insurance salesman,
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.740]   doubling as an advisor sometimes,
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.660]   'cause the only people who generally recommend whole life
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.140]   are people who are insurance salesmen
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.980]   and worked for captive insurance companies
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.100]   who get paid to sell it.
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.020]   - Right, the way that I've,
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.860]   I guess the way that I've heard about it is,
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.780]   you can make a lot of promises
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.860]   and it sounds great in a pitch,
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:58.380]   but most advisors, especially who are fiduciaries
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.100]   and they're not earning commissions,
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.700]   they're not huge fans of this
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.280]   because there's a huge difference
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.780]   between an insurance product
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.540]   and something that works in an investment portfolio.
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.500]   - I generally agree with you.
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.820]   So let's talk a little bit specifically
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.260]   about the problem that Joe's trying to solve
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:16.940]   and let's understand insurance.
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.920]   'Cause I think this is gonna be helpful for everybody.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:24.100]   People buy insurance generally for one reason
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.820]   and one reason only.
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.660]   It's 'cause there will be a financial impact
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.860]   on their family were they to die.
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:31.340]   Now there's disability that comes into it
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.260]   in long-term care and we'll get to the long-term care thing
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.580]   in a second because that's what they're asking about here.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:40.580]   But our job as advisors is to actually help somebody
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.820]   figure out what the financial impact
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.060]   on their family will be were they to die
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.680]   or their spouse to die or something like that.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.920]   That's the job.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.300]   The job is not to say,
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.100]   "Boy, do I have a product that's in search of a problem."
[00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:54.940]   The job is to say,
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.340]   "What problem are you trying to solve?"
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.500]   But I think a lot of times the way these are sold,
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.980]   at least that I've seen is you buy this kind of product
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:02.820]   and you don't have to worry
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:03.940]   about the stock market's ups and downs
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.260]   and you're gonna be guaranteed a return.
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.720]   And that's the kind of thing where people go,
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.260]   "Oh, that sounds pretty good."
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.140]   - Right, so in a vacuum,
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.500]   permanent insurance generally does the things
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.540]   that advisors will say that it's gonna do.
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.720]   But one, nobody lives in a vacuum.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.660]   And two, like especially with Whole Life,
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.540]   I say it's a series of things,
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.020]   like it's a product in search of a problem
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.540]   and no one really ever has that problem.
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:30.540]   So I simply never, I should say rarely recommend it.
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.280]   Now for an individual, not this person, not for you, Joe,
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:37.700]   but for someone who has a permanent insurance need,
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.960]   meaning throughout the course of somebody's lifetime,
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.800]   if their death would cause financial challenges
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.260]   for their family,
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:49.060]   then that person has an insurance need late in their life.
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.340]   We'll use an example.
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.540]   Take someone who has a defined benefit pension
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.020]   from their job and they can't take something
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.740]   like a joint life payout on that pension.
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:00.500]   And that pension goes away when that person dies.
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.740]   If that person's spouse is gonna rely on that pension,
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.620]   well, then they need to own insurance
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:06.740]   or something like that,
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:09.540]   just to make sure that you could recreate the income
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:10.720]   that you lose.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.400]   That is a permanent need.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:17.500]   But for Joe, it sure doesn't look like
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.040]   they have a permanent need.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.060]   To have a mortgage they'd like to pay off.
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.160]   What they should figure out is what the impact is
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.780]   if either of them were to die on their family.
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.060]   And then they should own some term insurance
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.620]   to manage that impact.
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.940]   It's much less expensive.
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.820]   It solves the problem over what seems
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:36.300]   to be a fairly short period of time.
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.140]   It's probably only a 15 year risk for them
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.460]   or a 20 year risk.
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:41.860]   So term insurance seems like a much better idea.
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.260]   - And it sounds like they care more too.
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:47.500]   Their long-term worry is long-term care insurance, right?
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.380]   - Right, right.
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:52.340]   So it's an interesting way to think about long-term care.
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.240]   And we could spend a lot of time talking about
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.760]   how that industry got it wrong really badly
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.560]   in any number of ways.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.480]   The original kind of long-term care contracts
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.200]   that were issued by insurance carriers,
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.320]   there were these standalone long-term care contracts
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.920]   and they were dramatically underpriced
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.280]   because insurance companies didn't realize
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.160]   that no one would lapse their long-term care.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.080]   They assume, 'cause there's, you know,
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.800]   insurance is based on the law of large numbers.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.680]   So what insurance carriers can come up to terms with
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.160]   is everybody basically dies at the same time
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.840]   and everybody lapses the same,
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.520]   like insurance lapses at a certain rate.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.840]   So a certain percentage of people
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.200]   will just stop paying for their policies.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.480]   They assumed the same lapse rates on life insurance
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.080]   as they did for long-term care.
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.400]   Turns out nobody lapses their long-term care
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.080]   because everyone has an anecdote about how awful it is
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.640]   when a family member needs care and how expensive it is.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.760]   - So that's something that people wanna keep having.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:45.600]   - Right.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.040]   So long-term care is now delivered a little bit differently
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.480]   than it used to be.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.600]   It is possible to wrap long-term care
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.400]   into a life insurance chassis.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.840]   That's generally speaking how we do it for people
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.680]   who are looking at long-term care contracts.
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.080]   And there's different kinds of contracts,
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.880]   whether there's asset-based or there's like universal life
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.320]   with a long-term care rider or things like that.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.480]   There's only very few standalone long-term care policies
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.120]   left in the market.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.880]   And the ones that have been around for a while
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.800]   have seen dramatic increases in premium.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.640]   I mean, I'll simply use my parents' policy as an example.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.680]   Their premiums on the long-term care contract
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.720]   they bought like 15 years ago or 20 years ago
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.680]   or something like that have doubled since they bought it.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:31.240]   So, and that's different than other kinds of insurance
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.480]   where insurance carriers always reserve the right
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.160]   to raise long-term care premiums.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.080]   And they have, and people are suffering.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.640]   I imagine there's even--
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.480]   - For something like this case,
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.440]   it doesn't sound like they have too many
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.160]   extenuating circumstances.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.560]   The simple advice is just keep it simple.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.280]   Don't go into anything too complex
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.360]   unless there's a really good reason for it.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.200]   - Exactly.
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.440]   That seems like term insurance is the right thing here.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:56.920]   And if they're really wanna plan for a long-term care risk,
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.520]   then what they would consider might be one
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.440]   of the standalone long-term care contracts.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:05.960]   Because what that'll have is it will add an inflation factor
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.560]   to the benefit that they buy right now.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.600]   And if they have 30 years, I mean,
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.720]   they're in their mid thirties.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.440]   You're literally talking potentially 50 years
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.680]   before they would make a claim on that.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:20.440]   You have to have a reasonable inflation factor to that
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.040]   in order for it to make sense 50 years from now.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.640]   So I'm not even convinced that's--
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.400]   - They can probably worry about this later.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.600]   My long-term care plan is I'm gonna eat healthy
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.520]   and work out all the time, and I'm just gonna live forever.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.600]   - Good luck with that.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.040]   - Yeah, I mean--
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:36.880]   - It's like the guy in Bloomberg.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:37.700]   - Sounds like--
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:38.540]   - Let's do another one.
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.380]   Let's do another one, Duncan.
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:40.200]   - One thing I was gonna say about that,
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.440]   the positive about the high commissions on Whole Life
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.560]   is that I've seen some really good commercials.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.320]   So they're putting that money to good use,
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.600]   the companies that are bringing in big commissions on this.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.440]   - That's right.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.920]   - They're employing a lot of film industry people.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.840]   So I mean, that's the, you know, your money's--
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:53.800]   - You're Mr. Culling, Duncan.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.000]   - You know, the person who generally wins
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.400]   from the sale of a Whole Life contract
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.680]   is the person who sold it.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.320]   So keep that in mind.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.400]   - Right.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.400]   Okay, last but not least, we have a question from Johnny.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.320]   - We're gonna get a lot of hate mail
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.360]   from insurance people on this one.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.000]   - Well, yeah, it always happens.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.840]   That's what I said in the chat.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.680]   Every time a Whole Life comes up,
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.880]   there's like a little, a war breaks out, but yeah.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.720]   - That's all right.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.560]   - Okay.
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:18.380]   - Last question.
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.160]   - Yeah, so this question is from Johnny.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.840]   I have a soon-to-be two-year-old daughter
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.520]   and would like some opinions on options for savings.
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.920]   There seem to be many paths, 529, Roth,
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.280]   normal investment account, trust.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.540]   I feel like a 529 is limiting for the unknown future
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.860]   and ties funds to education only.
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.840]   I hear people setting up Roths for their child,
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.560]   but tying income to a two-year-old sounds a bit sketchy.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.400]   I would tend to agree.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.240]   I also hear the compound team mentioned
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.480]   lift-off accounts for children.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.880]   I assume these are just normal taxable accounts.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.680]   My wife and I both have lift-off accounts,
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.780]   so I feel like this would be an easy option,
[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:52.920]   but is there a tax benefit
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.360]   that might make others a better option?
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.680]   Is there a reason to contribute
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.260]   to a separate account for our daughter
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:59.960]   versus just adding that savings
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.960]   to the accounts we already have?
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.520]   If it matters, we live in Michigan,
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:07.360]   and in 2022 made about $230,000 of income.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.480]   And my quick follow-up to that is,
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.400]   I think this is something I've wondered before is,
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.140]   yeah, what is the exact advantage
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.080]   of putting the money into an account for a child
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.920]   as opposed to just having that money
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.720]   in your own account for your child?
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.560]   - Right, I guess I'll answer the lift-off stuff first.
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.880]   Yeah, I have an account at lift-off.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.200]   I just chose the easy option.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.240]   I have a 529 for my kids, too.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.560]   I didn't wanna go down the route
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.260]   of creating some sort of income for them,
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.720]   and then I think the taxes is probably the biggest deal
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.040]   if you wanna jump through the hoops.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.680]   My whole thinking was keep it easy,
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:41.800]   but Jonathan, I guess if people wanna jump through some hoops
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.560]   what kind of accounts make sense
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.040]   if they wanna save some taxes?
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:51.000]   - So if taxes are the driving consideration,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.360]   the first thing I would say is
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.980]   don't let taxes be the driving consideration.
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.280]   But with accounts like this,
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.600]   like everything in financial planning,
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.840]   everything's a trade-off.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.160]   I know that those pesky child labor laws
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.840]   get in the way of funding a Roth for your kids,
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.640]   so that's kind of off the table,
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.480]   but you can start something like that.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.760]   - I've been pounding the table for years
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.040]   saying that you should be able to open a Roth as a baby.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.700]   For every child in America.
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:13.600]   - That'd be great.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.760]   Or we should just be able to put 'em back to work again,
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.100]   like I should go to a farm and employ my kids.
[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:23.520]   So the one thing I'm not gonna include in this
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.440]   is given that we probably have insurance people
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.760]   watching this, they're gonna be screaming
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.200]   you should buy insurance on kids
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.920]   because the cash values that grow
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.840]   inside insurance contracts are tax-preferred.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.240]   I'm not even going to dignify that with a discussion.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.680]   I'm going to say we're not considering it.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.220]   - Jonathan, you're compounding the insurance hate mail here.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.640]   - Trying to.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.600]   - Okay, so here's generally the trade-offs you make
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.000]   with putting money in accounts for kids.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.320]   So there's the traditional brokerage option
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.460]   where you basically just earmark the money for your children,
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.680]   whether it be a lift-off account
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.520]   or your own taxable account or something like that.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.160]   - That's basically what I've done.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.440]   - I think that's probably the best idea.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.560]   But we're also gonna leave out
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:01.880]   the big estate planning questions here
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.120]   and trust account for kids and all that,
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.320]   'cause that's a different conversation.
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:09.240]   What they're also maybe asking about are custodial accounts.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.880]   Things like, now, does UTMAs or UTMAs?
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.840]   Here's the problem with custodial accounts,
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:14.800]   and I don't love them.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:18.800]   And I consulted our resident tax ninjas as well on this one,
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.220]   and they tend to agree with me,
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:22.560]   or should I say I agree with them?
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.840]   Problem with custodial accounts is that that money,
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.280]   the money that's transferred into there is irrevocable.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.800]   It is now your children's money.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.980]   You just happen to be the custodian of it.
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.960]   When that kid turns 18, whether they know it or not,
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.800]   or whether they're prepared, that money is theirs.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.760]   Now, I don't know anyone who's funded custodial accounts
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.640]   with tons of money where they're saying to themselves,
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:45.840]   oh my God, my 18-year-old
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.360]   has hundreds of thousands of dollars in this,
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.280]   and now they're not going to college.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.520]   But that's the challenge,
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.760]   is that they're not flexible at all.
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.280]   - Right, you wanted to have some control over the money.
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.020]   - Right, you're giving up control.
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.360]   In addition to that,
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.240]   if ever you're gonna be applying for financial aid,
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.320]   the expected family contribution,
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.320]   you fill out the FAFSA form.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.840]   Expected family contribution
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:13.800]   counts custodial money like that at a higher percentage
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.560]   than they do things like parents' money.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.520]   So that would reduce the chance of getting financial aid.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.160]   That comes straight from the bills, the tax team.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.280]   It's another reason not to use custodial accounts.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.920]   Regarding 529s, it's actually become a bit
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.960]   of a better option, was already a very good one.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.280]   I understand they're not perfect because you say you need,
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.000]   but someone says they don't want to lock them
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.640]   and to have to use them for education,
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.240]   but they're great anyway.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.840]   And they just became better
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.440]   with the recent omnibus spending bill.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:46.960]   Says that in 2024, people now have the ability
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:51.120]   to convert 529 money to Roth money.
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.640]   Now it's subject to the same funding options every year.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.760]   So you can only convert up to 6,500 bucks a year
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:01.600]   to a total of $35,000 over a person's lifetime.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.520]   But Ben, as an example,
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.880]   let's say your kids get scholarships
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.240]   and you have money in their 529s.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.280]   If the money's been in there for more than 15 years,
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.720]   they can convert that to Roth money eventually.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.560]   So that's a fan.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.720]   Yeah, it's a fantastic kind of little extra kicker
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.880]   that's rewarding savers along the way.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:21.400]   So I love 529 money.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:25.400]   And in the end, if 529 money is tax preferred as it grows,
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:29.720]   even if you can't use it, your kid gets a scholarship,
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.280]   doesn't go to college, whatever, you can't end up using it.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.960]   So you pay a penalty and you get the money out
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.800]   or you give it to somebody else.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.240]   You still have the money.
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.000]   Right, it's a fantastic way.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.200]   And what I really like about a 529 is my experience
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.280]   is that it's something that people know they have to fund,
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.440]   so they do it.
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.360]   We talk about how the great thing about financial goals
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.760]   is that it creates good behavior.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.520]   It's that it gives you the habits you need.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.720]   And Ben, you talk a lot all the time
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.960]   about automating everything.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:03.560]   529 contributions are almost always automated for people.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.400]   It's for savings.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.560]   Yeah, and if you don't use it,
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.920]   you can help your kids out down the line.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:07.880]   That way, you can pay a penalty.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.340]   So it's still a decent amount of money.
[00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:12.960]   All right, I wanna thank Jonathan for coming on the show.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.800]   If you have any hate mail for insurance people,
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:15.800]   send it to Duncan.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:19.280]   He's gonna sort through all of those.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.520]   If you have any other insurance questions,
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.920]   anything else financially related,
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:25.160]   askthecompoundshow@gmail.com, leave us a review,
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.560]   go to idontshop.com for all of your merchant needs.
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.600]   Duncan, we got anything new in there yet?
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.440]   - Actually, just right before the show,
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.880]   Josh had me drop a new sticker.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:37.460]   So there's a new TCAP sticker on there,
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.480]   inspired by TGI Fridays.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.880]   So yeah, go check that out.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.380]   Also, one thing I should mention on this note.
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:47.800]   Yeah, TGIF instead of TG, you know, yeah.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.240]   But yeah, one thing that I wanted to mention
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:52.080]   is if you have a coupon code from us,
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.840]   it might not work on some things in our shop.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.840]   It's because we aren't marking up stuff much at all.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.200]   And our platform that we use won't let you
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.480]   undercut base price of items.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.560]   So that's something a couple people have encountered.
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.160]   I just wanted to let everyone know what's going on there.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.600]   It's not a bad code.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.760]   It just means there's not enough of a markup
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:09.880]   for you to actually take that
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.520]   without going into the base cost.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.480]   - Duncan is doing this as slave labor.
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:16.560]   Zero margins, just like Amazon.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.720]   Keep those questions and comments coming.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.120]   Thanks to everyone who showed up in the live chat.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.800]   Remember to leave us a question in YouTube comments as well.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.280]   And we'll see you next week.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.160]   - See you, everyone.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.000]   - Cheers, guys.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.180]   (upbeat music)

[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.340]   (upbeat music)

[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.260]   (upbeat music)
