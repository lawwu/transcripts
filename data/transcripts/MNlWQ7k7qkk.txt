[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   I'll identify that to something that you can almost do absolutely nothing about.
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.680]   It's just someone did it, used your information, committed the crime.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.460]   How do you prove you didn't commit a crime, right?
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.960]   That's a little more difficult than someone nailing you for committing a crime.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.960]   Becomes more complicated.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.700]   That's why it's so important for people to be alert.
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.160]   If you get a notification about something, don't assume if you know nothing about it
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.000]   that it's a mistake.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.240]   At the same point, don't immediately jump and try to do something about it because it
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.080]   could be somebody committing a fraudulent act and getting you to click on the wrong
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.400]   link or open the wrong attachment as well.
