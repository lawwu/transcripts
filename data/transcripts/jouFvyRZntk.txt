[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.760]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.920]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.260]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.400]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.440]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.840]   My guest today is Dr. Matthew Hill.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.300]   Dr. Matthew Hill is a professor of cell biology and anatomy
[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.880]   at the University of Calgary.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.200]   His laboratory studies cannabis and its effects on stress,
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.720]   its effects on feeding,
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.080]   and its effects on the behavioral impacts
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.760]   of cannabis exposure at different stages of development.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.800]   The origin of today's podcast episode is a bit unique,
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.920]   so I'd like to share a little bit
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.220]   of that background with you.
[00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.200]   Previously, I did a solo episode
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.800]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast about cannabis,
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.200]   the biology of cannabis,
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.480]   some of its medical applications and uses,
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.680]   as well as some of its potential harms.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.040]   That episode came out several years ago now,
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.800]   and remains a very popular episode.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.880]   It's had millions of views and millions of listens.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.320]   Several months ago, we posted a clip of that episode
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.800]   to X, formerly known as Twitter.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.140]   And Dr. Matthew Hill responded to that clip on X
[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.680]   with criticism about the specific points
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.200]   made within that clip.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.440]   Most notably, my discussion of the data
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.720]   that cannabis use can, in some individuals, cause psychosis.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.680]   He also took issue with some of the specific points
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.760]   I made in that clip related to potential differences
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.480]   in the biology of the effects
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.080]   of different strains of cannabis,
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.200]   most notably indica versus sativa strains,
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.900]   and a few other points as well.
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.600]   Now, as somebody who's been in the field of science
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.960]   for several decades now,
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.920]   I'm very familiar with the fact that every field,
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.160]   every single field within science,
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.160]   has debates within it, controversies,
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.880]   and sometimes outright battles.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.840]   And to me, that's part of what makes science interesting.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.240]   It's an evolving process.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.920]   It's something for which we should all be very curious
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.200]   to try and understand what we know, what we don't know,
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.160]   and try and get to the real answers.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.240]   So right off the bat on X, I invited Dr. Hill
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.840]   onto the podcast, and he accepted the invitation.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.240]   So today's episode is really a unique one
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.800]   in that, first of all, we cover an enormous amount
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.280]   of biology and clinical data as it relates to cannabis,
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.880]   meaning today's discussion is not a debate.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.920]   It is really an up-to-date discussion
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.360]   about how cannabis works.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.760]   So we talk about THC versus CBD.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.800]   We address the question
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.080]   of whether or not indicas versus sativas
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.060]   have different biological and subjective effects or not.
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.200]   We, of course, talk about the potential correlation,
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.500]   maybe even causation, between cannabis use and psychosis.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.440]   I think you'll find that discussion very interesting.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.920]   And we talk about how cannabis relates to hunger,
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.580]   to memory, to anxiety, and to the treatment of anxiety.
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.420]   I'm certain that given the widespread use
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.060]   of cannabis nowadays, that you'll find the discussion
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.600]   to be both an informative and potentially useful one
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.960]   that could help guide decisions
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.940]   as to whether or not you or others should
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.800]   or should not use or avoid cannabis,
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.160]   as well as one that can simply inform
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.840]   about this very interesting compound.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.200]   And of course, you'll learn a lot of neuroscience
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.140]   and biology along the way.
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.960]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.520]   that this podcast is separate
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.680]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.800]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.740]   to bring zero-cost to consumer information
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.800]   about science and science-related tools
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.160]   to the general public.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.440]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.280]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.480]   Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.120]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.120]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.640]   I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.200]   about the critical need to get sleep,
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.640]   both enough sleep and enough quality sleep.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.920]   Now, one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.040]   is that your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.760]   by about one to three degrees in order for you to fall
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.280]   and stay deeply asleep.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.120]   And to wake up feeling refreshed,
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.380]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.080]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.400]   One of the best ways to ensure all of that happens
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.840]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.360]   And with Eight Sleep, it's very easy to do that.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.880]   You program the temperature that you want
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.120]   at the beginning, middle, and the end of the night,
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.160]   and that's the temperature that you're going to sleep at.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.600]   And it will track your sleep.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.500]   It tells you how much slow-wave sleep you're getting,
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.320]   how much rapid eye movement sleep you're getting,
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.160]   which is critical.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.900]   And all of that also helps you dial in
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.640]   the exact parameters you need
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.120]   in order to get the best possible night's sleep for you.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.920]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.320]   for well over three years now,
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.640]   and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.800]   Eight Sleep recently launched
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.240]   their newest generation pod cover, the Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.280]   The Pod 4 Ultra cover has improved cooling
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.560]   and heating capacity,
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.280]   higher fidelity sleep tracking technology,
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.920]   and the Pod 4 cover has snoring detection
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.260]   that will automatically lift your head a few degrees
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.360]   to improve airflow and stop your snoring.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.120]   If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.120]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.280]   to save $350 off their Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.720]   Eight Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.320]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.560]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.520]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.960]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.240]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.360]   That means the electrolytes,
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.640]   sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.080]   in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.240]   Now, I and others on the podcast have talked a lot
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.200]   about the critical importance of hydration
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.380]   for proper brain and bodily function.
[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.120]   Research shows that even a slight degree of dehydration
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.040]   can really diminish cognitive and physical performance.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.360]   It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.080]   in order for your body and brain to function at their best.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.640]   The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.040]   are critical for the functioning
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.240]   of all the cells in your body,
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.200]   especially your neurons or nerve cells.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.680]   To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.280]   of hydration and electrolytes,
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.740]   I dissolve one packet of Element
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.640]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.840]   when I wake up in the morning,
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.440]   and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.160]   I also drink Element dissolved in water
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.320]   during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing,
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.280]   especially on hot days if I'm sweating a lot
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.440]   and losing water and electrolytes.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.640]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.360]   you can go to drinkelement.com/huberman,
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.200]   spelled drinkelement.com/huberman,
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.940]   to claim a free Element sample pack
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.200]   with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.360]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.240]   to claim a free sample pack.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.360]   Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.120]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.160]   with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.240]   There are essentially three things
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.760]   that make up great therapy.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.720]   First of all, great therapy consists of having good rapport
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.280]   with somebody that you can really trust
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.720]   and talk to about the issues that you're dealing with.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.660]   Second of all, that therapist should provide support
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.000]   in the form of emotional support or directed guidance.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.900]   And third, expert therapy should provide useful insights,
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.080]   insights that allow you to better understand
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.680]   not just your emotional life and your relationship life,
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.200]   but of course also your relationship to yourself
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.000]   and to career goals and school goals,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.520]   meaning excellent therapy
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.920]   should also inspire positive action.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.480]   BetterHelp makes it very easy for you
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.320]   to find an expert therapist
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.880]   with whom you really resonate with
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.560]   and that can provide the benefits that I just described.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.960]   Also, because BetterHelp therapy is done entirely online,
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.080]   it's very time efficient
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.280]   and it's easy to fit into a busy schedule
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.580]   because it involves no commuting to a therapist's office,
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.240]   finding a parking spot, or sitting in a waiting room.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.720]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.880]   you can go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.960]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.240]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.320]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Matthew Hill.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.080]   Dr. Matt Hill, welcome.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.600]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.680]   - Delighted to have you here
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.380]   because you're an expert in the biology of cannabis,
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.500]   a topic that many, many people are curious about
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.940]   for a variety of reasons.
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.360]   So just to kick things off,
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.940]   maybe we can get people up to speed on what cannabis is,
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.800]   a little bit about how it works in the brain and body
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.440]   to produce the various effects that it produces
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.120]   and how some of that comes to be.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.260]   And then we can dig into some of the nuance.
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.800]   I have a lot of questions about different types,
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.840]   if you will, of cannabis,
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.860]   the relationship to mental health,
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.280]   potentially to mental illness.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.920]   We're gonna drill into all of that.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.080]   So just to kick things off, what is cannabis?
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.520]   - I mean, cannabis is a plant
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.180]   that has been around for some time.
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.960]   It's kind of got like a very rich history
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.720]   of use around the world for different cultures,
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.120]   for both kind of medicinal and spiritual
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.820]   and recreational purposes over several centuries.
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:19.120]   The plant has kind of become, I mean, in the West,
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.320]   it really wasn't a thing mainstream-wise
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.000]   until about the '60s.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.440]   And then it became kind of introduced
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.960]   as like a drug of choice that a lot of people started using
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.680]   during the rise of the hippie era.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.920]   And I think that was a lot of the time
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.600]   that cannabis got popularized.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.160]   And then I'd say more recently,
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.240]   cannabis has, into the '90s and on,
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.560]   has become kind of a very heavily used drug
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.680]   by a large swath of people, ranging from teenagers on up.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.600]   In terms of what it is inside it,
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.800]   I mean, it's a plant with a lot of very complex chemistry
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.680]   and biology behind it.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.120]   So there's a lot of molecules that it carries in it.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.240]   We call these cannabinoids.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.680]   And they come in a lot of different flavors,
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.080]   but the main one that's the most important one
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.080]   when we talk about cannabis
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.120]   and what drives the kind of intoxicating
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.320]   and what I would refer to as psychoactive effects
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.280]   of cannabis is delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol,
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.680]   or what we call THC.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.080]   And that really is what dictates the psychoactive
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.440]   and intoxicating properties of the plant.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.920]   And so the amount of THC that is within the cannabis plant
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.000]   will influence how high a person's gonna get
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.760]   when they consume it.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.440]   There are probably 70 to 100 and some odd other cannabinoids
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.360]   that are within cannabis.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.800]   Most of them are pretty trace levels,
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.240]   and they vary from different types to cannabis
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.080]   from one another.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.480]   But the other one that's had a lot of attention
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.080]   is cannabidiol, or what we call CBD.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.560]   CBD is structurally looks pretty similar to THC,
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.440]   but doesn't behave anything like THC.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.000]   It's not intoxicating at all.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.200]   Not sure, I would probably say it's not psychoactive
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.520]   in the sense that people can't tell
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.200]   if they're on it or not.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.440]   But I would, some people still say it's psychoactive
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.400]   because people claim it can affect anxiety state
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.600]   or mood state or other things.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.080]   So in that context, maybe psychoactive
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.840]   is still somewhat appropriate of a word to use.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.320]   And then there's a whole bunch of other things
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.200]   like cannabinol, cannabigerol,
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.680]   and these other minor cannabinoids,
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.600]   most of which we really don't understand
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.640]   any of the biology of.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.540]   We don't know what they're doing.
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.600]   They may influence some of the effects of THC,
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.280]   they may not, but they're there.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.280]   And they vary in their composition from different flavor
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.440]   of different cannabis to different flavor.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.520]   And then there's those other things called terpenes,
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.120]   which are kind of highly volatile compounds,
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.520]   but they're not specific to cannabis.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.400]   They're found in tons of other plants.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.560]   So this is a lot of which seems to contribute
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.680]   at least to some of the smell and the flavors of cannabis.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.560]   So these are things like limonene,
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.600]   which gives some cannabis kind of a citrusy odor
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.360]   or flavor to it.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.320]   Pinene, which gives things more of like a earthy tree
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.760]   kind of smell.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.320]   Beta-caryophyllene, myrcene, and these terpenes
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.940]   are also, some of which do have known biological activity,
[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.040]   some don't, and they vary quite heavily
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.760]   across different kinds of cannabis as well.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.920]   And again, there's some thought that they may be influencing
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.960]   some of the psychoactive or intoxicating properties
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.000]   of cannabis, but the reality is we really don't know
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.280]   a lot about them at this point.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.240]   There's kind of some emerging work that's starting
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.480]   to come out now that kind of plays with, you know,
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.880]   giving someone THC and adding in one other terpene
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.200]   or one other minor cannabinoid
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.640]   and seeing how it influences things.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.840]   And so you can imagine with the plethora of molecules
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.440]   that exist in cannabis, doing this in a piecewise manner
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.960]   could take decades to kind of really get to a point
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.580]   where we understand all the interactive components
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.420]   of cannabis.
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.560]   But people tend to refer to this as like an entourage effect.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.680]   That's kind of a phrase that gets used quite widely
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.680]   in the cannabis world.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.440]   And the idea behind that is that if you took pure THC,
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.040]   and so there are some like distillate pens and things
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.160]   that exist out there now in the product market,
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.080]   which are basically isolated THC with trace levels
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.620]   of anything of other stuff, would be very different
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.280]   than if you had THC in combination
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.840]   with some of these other molecules
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.800]   and how they might influence how THC itself
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.200]   is working or not, so.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.160]   - Fascinating plant.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.120]   You mentioned the psychoactive effects.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.680]   Some people listening to this and watching this
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.400]   presumably have experienced those psychoactive effects.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.600]   Others perhaps have not.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.680]   How could we describe for both groups
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.880]   what the quote-unquote psychoactive effects are?
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.760]   You mentioned the higher the concentration of THC,
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.360]   the quote-unquote higher someone will get, right?
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.260]   The greater the intensity of the high.
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.660]   What is the high?
[00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.040]   And I know people are probably chuckling saying,
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.720]   does Huberman not know because he's never done it?
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.920]   I mean, that's my own business.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.240]   I just want people to understand
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.800]   what you mean by psychoactive effects.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.080]   - So, I mean, the way that people would usually describe
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.080]   the intoxicating effects of cannabis is,
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.720]   they would, I mean, people often refer to it
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.640]   as there being some euphoria or some positive mood.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.820]   Not on the same order as what people would describe
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.760]   with say cocaine or some other stimulants,
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.400]   but there certainly is some kind of positive aspect.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.520]   I mean, if there wasn't, people wouldn't be using it
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.200]   if they didn't feel positive about it afterwards.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.000]   There can be other aspects
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.920]   in terms of changes in feeding behavior.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.320]   People might find things funnier than they found things.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.720]   It might change the way they perceive
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.460]   various environmental stimuli.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.360]   But it can also, for some people,
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.520]   create a bit of a dissociative state to some degree
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.000]   where people might feel a little bit out of body.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.400]   So, it's kind of a complicated,
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.460]   intoxicating state to describe, I would say,
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.440]   because usually if someone's referring
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.800]   to something like a stimulant, they're just like,
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.400]   oh, people feel like they're God.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.880]   They're like, you know.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.120]   - Possibility everywhere.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:45.960]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.920]   Like they're very happy and they're kind of jacked up.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.520]   And I think with cannabis,
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.360]   the way people would describe it would be very different.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.240]   It's like kind of an introspective state.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.080]   You might be more aware of your bodily feelings
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.400]   and states that are going on inside of you,
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.900]   your kind of internal state.
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.520]   But you also have like a different perspective
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.960]   on external stimuli.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.040]   You might process information a bit differently,
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.440]   focus on things a bit differently.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.480]   So, it's kind of a complicated state to describe,
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.320]   I would say.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.080]   Usually when people are assessing if someone's intoxicated,
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.600]   like the kind of lab work where people get someone high,
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.600]   they just kind of use what we call a visual analog scale,
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.360]   which is like a one to 100 or something,
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.180]   or a zero to 100 and say, do you feel high?
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.680]   Do you enjoy this?
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.120]   Would you say you feel euphoric?
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.240]   Is your mood elevated?
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.840]   So, they're kind of scaling things like that.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.440]   So, I think that's more typically in a lab setting,
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.040]   how you would define if someone's high or not from it.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.440]   And this is why when people do studies
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.180]   with something like a placebo cannabis
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.120]   or a very low THC cannabis, you'll see kind of a scaling.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.560]   So, even if you give someone a placebo cannabis,
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.120]   if they think that they're getting cannabis,
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.920]   a lot of people still respond by saying
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:49.880]   they feel a bit high.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.520]   - That's interesting, is that true
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.560]   even if they've never used cannabis before?
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.040]   - I'm not actually certain if you are allowed
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.760]   to have someone in a drug study
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.160]   if they've never done something before.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.800]   I think they have to have had some previous experience
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.880]   with a drug to be enrolled.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.760]   - And they pay you, so now pot smokers everywhere
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.600]   are running to look at subjects.
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.720]   - Yeah, but I think, yeah,
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.680]   I don't think you can use drug naive people.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.720]   I mean, I don't run human clinical lab studies,
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.960]   so I can't explicitly say it,
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.320]   but that's my understanding is that someone has to have had
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.700]   even limited, like, you know, not much,
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.720]   but at least once or twice.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.280]   They have to have experienced the drug before.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.920]   So, I don't know if you would take someone
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.000]   who was completely blind,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.320]   'cause I don't know how they would replicate that state
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.160]   if they're not expecting it.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:36.000]   - What about the effects of cannabis on time perception?
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   You know, there's this reputation that cannabis has
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.480]   for disrupting time perception,
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.840]   that people will think a long period of time has passed
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.940]   when in fact very little time has passed.
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.840]   Maybe it's sometimes even the reverse.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.380]   Is the mechanism by which cannabis
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.340]   can adjust time perception known?
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:56.900]   - I wouldn't say it's well worked out.
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.420]   There definitely seems to be some, like,
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:59.860]   temporal dilation, like you're saying,
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.780]   where people think things of, you know,
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.820]   someone will be high and someone will ask them,
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.300]   "How long do you think time has passed?"
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.220]   They would report usually longer periods of time
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.720]   have passed than actually have.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.460]   I feel like there is some older work I could dig up
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.260]   to see if I could find that is either in, like,
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.700]   it might even be in pigeons, but it might be in rodents.
[00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.120]   It's looking at, like, temporal ordering,
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.600]   and they give animals cannabinoids,
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.880]   and that's kind of a cleaner way of seeing,
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.680]   'cause they are very good at learning,
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.840]   like, if I wait 10 minutes
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.920]   and then I engage in a behavior, I get a reward.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.120]   And so you can really train animals
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.520]   to have this ordinal timing
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.040]   where they kind of know distinct periods of time.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.600]   And if they give them cannabinoids,
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.580]   they respond differently.
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.040]   So in that context,
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.240]   it does still seem to produce some state
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.560]   where there's an altered perception of time passing.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.160]   And so I think if we were gonna really understand
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.000]   the mechanism of it,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.120]   that would probably be the way to go,
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.720]   but I'm not super familiar with the work,
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.260]   'cause no one's, I mean,
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.840]   anything I can think of is pretty old.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.080]   I can't think of anything modern
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.440]   where people have actually looked at this.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.400]   - Interesting.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.240]   You mentioned effects of cannabis on appetite,
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.840]   and I know one of the medical uses of cannabis
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.080]   is in people that are undergoing treatment for cancer
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.520]   in order to stimulate appetite,
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.320]   because oftentimes they have very low
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.920]   or even no appetite due to the cancer treatment.
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.720]   Is the mechanism by which cannabis
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.400]   can stimulate appetite known?
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.200]   And if so, what is the general trend of effect?
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.720]   Makes people hungrier, obviously,
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.080]   but we hear again in kind of recreational terms
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.800]   of people getting the munchies,
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:31.960]   becoming exceedingly hungry.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.760]   Is that related to some cannabis induced effect
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.760]   on say blood sugar, like insulin or glucose regulation,
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.880]   or is it happening at a different level?
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.600]   - I think we almost need to take a step back actually
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.440]   to talk about how cannabis works in the brain
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.500]   before we kind of go into that.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:48.520]   So THC as a molecule exerts almost all its effects
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.440]   through acting at this one receptor for the most part
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.840]   that's widely expressed through the brain
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.720]   called the cannabinoid type one receptor.
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.560]   - CB1.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.600]   - Yeah, CB1 is the shorthand for it.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.920]   And I think as people tend to create analogies
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.200]   to describe what receptors are,
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.200]   for those of you who don't know,
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.080]   most people use like a lock and key analogy
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.120]   that a receptor would be a protein that sits on a cell
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.720]   and a molecule that binds to it like THC
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.440]   is the key that fits in that lock.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.260]   When it activates it, it triggers some biological process
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.980]   in the cell, in this case, a neuron
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.540]   that changes its activity in some capacity.
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.580]   And so THC acts on these CB1 receptors,
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.100]   which are very widely expressed.
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.980]   In fact, outside of like kind of ion channels
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.820]   that are expressed in the brain,
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.860]   the CB1 is I think one of the most,
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.860]   if not the most widely expressed receptor in the brain.
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.100]   It's everywhere.
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.340]   So it's really important.
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:41.580]   And I think as kind of you had alluded to previously,
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.400]   it doesn't exist in the, you know,
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.420]   this didn't evolve in humans in the hopes
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.980]   that one day humans would find cannabis.
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:47.820]   This is just-
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.900]   - Although cannabis users everywhere use that argument.
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.180]   - I know people love to leverage things.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.540]   If it's a plant, it's, you know, it's natural and safe.
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.680]   And there's obviously issues we'll talk about with that.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.000]   But I mean, really, this is just biological redundancy.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:01.840]   I mean, you know,
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.660]   nature only has so many ways to create something.
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.020]   And so there's gonna be things that end up overlapping
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:07.980]   in the way that they function.
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.760]   And so the receptor that's in the brain
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.580]   and throughout the body, the CB1,
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.220]   and there is also a CB2 receptor.
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.340]   It's not really expressed in the brain.
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:17.780]   It's in some of the immune cells in the brain
[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.480]   and maybe some limited distribution
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.940]   in actual brain cell neurons.
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.060]   - Where in the body is it expressed?
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.300]   - It's mostly immune cells.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.180]   So you'll see CB2 is mostly on like macrophages
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.380]   or other kinds of immune cells.
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:30.980]   - Cells that gobble up debris.
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.900]   - Yeah, and that basically, you know,
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.660]   regulate inflammatory processes.
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.180]   And so the main role of CB2 seems to be much more
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.660]   about like regulating inflammation.
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.300]   So that's kind of a separate role
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.300]   that can certainly impact the brain in different ways.
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.400]   But when we talk about the effects
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.460]   on the central nervous system and the brain and behavior,
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.580]   we're talking almost entirely about CB1.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.300]   And so both the CB1 and CB2 receptors, like I said,
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.940]   don't exist because nature was like,
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.140]   "Humans are gonna find cannabis.
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.780]   This will all work together now."
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.660]   So there are molecules our body produces,
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.320]   which we call endocannabinoids.
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.380]   And they are kind of funny little molecules
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.840]   'cause they don't really behave.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.740]   Like certainly in the brain,
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.780]   they don't behave like a normal neurotransmitter.
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.140]   So, I mean, I assume most people who listen to your podcast
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.060]   are relatively adept with the basic idea
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.180]   of how neurons work.
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:20.300]   So you have neuron A, let's call it the presynaptic neuron
[00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.420]   because you have that gap between the two cells
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.740]   where they communicate called the synapse.
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.460]   So neuron A releases a transmitter
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.420]   and it can be something that excites the neighboring cell,
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.100]   neuron B, or it can inhibit it.
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.920]   And so the way that we always kind of talk
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.240]   about neurotransmission in the brain
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.660]   is neuron A releases a chemical that crosses the synapse,
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.020]   acts on neuron B, and it can either jack
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.380]   that neuron's activity up or it can scale it down.
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:48.340]   And that affects brain-wide patterns of activity.
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.500]   And we call that anterograde
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.520]   because it moves from neuron A to neuron B,
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.980]   which is kind of the general flow of things
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.060]   and how we usually think about it.
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:00.020]   So endocannabinoids are kind of this little bit
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.220]   of an oddity in the sense that they could do the reverse.
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.840]   And so endocannabinoids are actually made in neuron B
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.780]   on the postsynaptic side, and then they go backwards
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.660]   and act on neuron A to regulate
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.220]   how much transmitter is released.
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.900]   And so in many ways, this is like,
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.900]   I kind of liken it to a thermostat model for the most part.
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:17.740]   Certainly if we're talking about something
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:18.660]   like excitability.
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.820]   So if neuron A is dumping out something
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.020]   that excites neuron B, like glutamate,
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.420]   which is an excitatory neurotransmitter,
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.780]   as neuron B gets too excited,
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.940]   it's gonna start releasing endocannabinoids
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.500]   to go back and tell neuron A to stop driving it.
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.220]   - So sort of a homeostatic scale
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:35.720]   trying to maintain a middle range.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.320]   - Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day,
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.200]   no matter how you discuss it and what system you discuss it,
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.960]   I think the majority of people in the cannabinoid field
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.680]   would agree that the primary physiological role
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.840]   of endocannabinoids is to maintain homeostasis.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:48.680]   That's what they do.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.160]   They keep everything in its happy place, let's say.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.240]   So like-
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.440]   - And that's probably why the CB1 receptor
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.200]   is so widely distributed is that neurons can excite
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.000]   or inhibit each other.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.400]   That is, raise or reduce the amount of electrical activity
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.480]   in the, let's say, nearby neuron.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.080]   'Cause we're talking about retrograde signaling.
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.840]   But ultimately you don't want runaway excitation
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:09.920]   'cause that looks like epilepsy.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:10.760]   - Exactly.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.240]   - And you don't want runaway inhibition
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.560]   because that looks like suppression
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.440]   of ability to think, move, et cetera.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.280]   - Exactly.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.960]   So you wanna keep things in where they should be.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.480]   And so you want neurons to get excited,
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.200]   but you don't want them to get overexcited.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.680]   So endocannabinoids in kind of a very prototypical sense
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.940]   act as this circuit breaker, essentially,
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.240]   where they go back and gate how much is coming in.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.640]   And they do this by, through various mechanisms,
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.880]   essentially turning off the electrical activity
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:36.920]   of that presynaptic neuron
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.880]   so that it stops releasing neurotransmitter.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.880]   They can also regulate, though,
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.480]   inhibitory neurotransmitter release as well.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.360]   And this is usually done through a little bit more
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.520]   of a complex process where it's driven by excitation,
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.780]   but then it regulates the inhibitory pathway.
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.600]   - So inhibiting the inhibitor leads to more excitation.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.440]   - Exactly.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.500]   I usually liken it to basically taking the brakes off
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.280]   of a car while you're going downhill kind of thing.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.200]   Like you'd use your braking system
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.480]   to keep things in check, but if you want to go faster,
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.720]   you take the foot off the brakes
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.860]   and you let things accelerate.
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:08.280]   And so this can be really important for things
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:12.440]   like forms of synaptic plasticity or neuroplasticity,
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.440]   let's say, where you want synaptic strengthening to happen.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.560]   So like under a learning event or something,
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.160]   you want that synapse to really hardwire better.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.800]   And so having endocannabinoids kind of turn off
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.040]   the inhibitory component is one of the mechanisms
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.360]   to facilitate that.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.800]   But at the same time,
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.040]   if you want to have a bit more adaptive flexibility,
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.040]   endocannabinoids can weaken that synapse at the same time
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.640]   by acting right at the excitatory terminal itself.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.920]   And so their ability to kind of play
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.920]   with the relative activity of a circuit
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.280]   is really dependent on which neuron they're acting on.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.440]   And so they can regulate excitation
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.480]   or inhibition differentially.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.000]   And I mean, CB1 receptors are found
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.240]   on virtually every single kind of neuron in the brain,
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.120]   except one.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.040]   I think you'll find this interesting 'cause it's dopamine.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.640]   And dopamine neurons are basically the only neurons
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.480]   in the brain that don't really,
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.680]   at least as far as we've been able to characterize to date,
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.320]   express cannabinoid receptors.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.280]   - Interesting.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.800]   If I may, earlier you mentioned
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.160]   one of the potential psychoactive effects
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.680]   of cannabis is euphoria.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.840]   Does that mean that the euphoria associated
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.880]   with cannabis use is independent of dopamine
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.360]   and is more reliant on something like perhaps
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.200]   the opioid receptor system
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.040]   or the serotonergic receptor system?
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.560]   - I wouldn't say that cannabinoids don't affect dopamine
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:34.520]   because what we understand in the ventral tegmental area,
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.720]   which is kind of the hotspot of dopamine neurons,
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.880]   or at least the ones that are involved
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.160]   in motivation and stuff,
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:44.360]   those neurons are regulated by a lot of inhibitory neurons
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.080]   that dump out inhibitory transmitter
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.600]   and keep those neurons kind of quiet.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.200]   - So there's an opportunity for indirect regulation.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.040]   - Exactly.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.160]   So what you have is those neurons
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.560]   that regulate the dopamine neurons
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.480]   are very rich in cannabinoid receptors.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.520]   This is actually kind of similar
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.080]   to how mu-opioid receptors work
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.440]   for things like morphine or heroin.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.840]   And essentially what the cannabinoid receptors will do
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.840]   is when they're activated,
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.760]   they'll turn off that inhibitory control.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.320]   And that allows dopamine neurons
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.640]   to kind of move into a state where they're more prone
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.440]   to go into burst firing and have big dumps of dopamine.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.160]   Whether or not that relates to the positive affect
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.000]   or the euphoria,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.400]   I don't think anyone has cleanly demonstrated that.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.280]   I mean, obviously dopamine's very complicated
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.080]   in terms of its relation to endpoints
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.840]   and whether it's reward or motivation,
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.800]   but cannabinoids definitely do have an influence
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:28.800]   on dopamine transmission.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.320]   They just don't tend to do it directly.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.200]   And I think that's this very bizarre
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.800]   and interesting component of cannabinoid signaling
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.000]   is why the brain would have evolved in a way
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.880]   to allow every other neurotransmitter system
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.720]   to be actively and directly regulated by endocannabinoids,
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.520]   but dopamine is kind of spared from this.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.040]   So I don't know.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.360]   No one, I mean, obviously you can always
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.400]   just theoretically guess as to why someone would do that.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.720]   I don't know what the reason for it would be,
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.760]   but it is something that has kind of intrigued
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.160]   a lot of people because every other system in the brain
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.920]   is so tightly controlled to some degree by endocannabinoids
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.920]   and then this one circuit is kind of free of it.
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:04.400]   So, but yeah, so the main role of endocannabinoids
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.080]   is really to regulate plasticity or homeostasis,
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.440]   allow flexibility of circuits
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.320]   to either goose up their activity
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.760]   or ramp it down if they need to,
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.440]   depending on the environment,
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.800]   depending on the experience of the organism.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.480]   So there's a lot of kind of roles
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.280]   that endocannabinoids play in that domain,
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.980]   but even within the endocannabinoids,
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.160]   I mean, there's two primary endocannabinoids.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.200]   And again, this is one of the weird things
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.440]   about how endocannabinoids work,
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.800]   because if you talk about things like serotonin or dopamine,
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.320]   you have a single molecule that gets released
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.440]   in the typical anterograde way
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.740]   and it diversifies at the level of a receptor.
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.280]   So serotonin has like, I don't know,
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.000]   like 15 receptors or 20 or something, no.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.880]   Dopamine has at least five.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.480]   And so the different actions
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.080]   that serotonin or dopamine will have
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.440]   is all driven by the diversification of the receptors.
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.320]   It's one molecule.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.200]   Whereas cannabinoids are the reverse.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.480]   Not only do they work backwards across the synapse
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.560]   and work in this retrograde fashion,
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.180]   but really you have one receptor
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.920]   that is regulated by two molecules.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.880]   So the diversification happens more at the level
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.260]   of the molecule than at the receptor,
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:06.960]   which is, again, very unique.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.240]   And the two molecules that we know
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.920]   are kind of the bona fide endocannabinoids.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.720]   There could be more.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.840]   They're called anandamide,
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.760]   which is actually kind of a funny name
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.400]   because it comes from the Sanskrit word anand for bliss.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.280]   And so Rafi Mashulam, who was in Israel
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.740]   when he discovered the molecule, you know,
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:31.000]   30 odd years ago, wanted it to reflect inner bliss.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.480]   And so he named it anandamide.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.440]   So it's like inner bliss with an amide bond
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.840]   is kind of the joke he had for it.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:36.680]   And so-
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.560]   - He discovered anandamide and decided to call it bliss
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.600]   because he had familiarity with cannabis
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.320]   or because he took anandamide as a direct experience.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.160]   - No, no, I mean-
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.560]   - It takes a lot for a scientist to discover a molecule,
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.600]   but then for a scientist to discover a molecule
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.680]   and then name it bliss for a particular reason,
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.160]   you have to speculate that they had some familiarity
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.000]   with the compound.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.800]   - Rafi Mashulam was also the guy who isolated
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.880]   and discovered THC.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.120]   So, I mean, he has a very,
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.200]   he's kind of the grandfather of the whole cannabinoid field.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.800]   So he has a landmark paper from 1964,
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.520]   which ironically,
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.200]   and this is one of these weird pop culture things.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.600]   I don't know if this is true.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.520]   That paper was published on April 20th, 1964.
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.360]   And so the joke is, is this where 420 came from?
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.240]   Because the original like birth date
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:22.520]   of the first THC paper was 420, 1964.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:26.160]   - Well, now that potential myth
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.560]   is definitely gonna propagate.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.800]   - Yeah, but yeah, so he'd been in the field for a while.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.840]   And so he had studied cannabis on that side.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:36.040]   And then in 1990, his lab isolated anandamide
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.480]   as being the first molecule
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.280]   that activated the receptor endogenously.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.240]   And so it was kind of, yeah,
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.400]   I think it was a little tongue in cheek
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.800]   that he named it the way he did.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.600]   A few years later, the second molecule,
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.360]   which is just called 2-arachidonylglycerol,
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.480]   or what we call 2-AG,
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.320]   that was discovered kind of in tandem,
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.000]   both again by Mashulam, but also by a Japanese group.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.280]   And so we understand these two molecules
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.760]   don't do the same thing.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.840]   Like they are a bit different.
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.680]   So the way anandamide binds the receptor
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.160]   is it's what we would call a high affinity,
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.480]   but low efficacy agonist, or molecule at least.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.080]   And what I mean by that is very low levels of anandamide
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.320]   are required to actually bind to the receptor.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.400]   But once it binds,
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.040]   its ability to stimulate a biological response
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.800]   in that neuron kind of caps out pretty fast.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.720]   So it doesn't have like a sledgehammer effect.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.520]   Whereas 2-AG seems to require
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.160]   a bit more concentration in the synapse
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.640]   to be able to bind to the receptor.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.880]   So it has a lower affinity for the receptor.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.520]   But once it binds to the receptor,
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.320]   it's like pretty heavy duty.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.120]   So it evokes a very robust
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.560]   intracellular signaling response.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.840]   And so why we have two endocannabinoids,
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.120]   we're not totally sure.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.160]   Some of us have theories.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.720]   I'm of the camp that I think
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.640]   they may play somewhat differential roles,
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.840]   either based on the synapse or the circuit
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.040]   that they're working in,
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.320]   or this idea that maybe anandamide
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.080]   might be more of a tonic molecule.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.720]   And what I mean by that is,
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.200]   we'll say it's like a stage setter.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.760]   So like anandamide might just be kind of
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.960]   made by neurons on an ongoing basis
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:06.800]   and just released.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.400]   And its job may be to kind of keep
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.560]   the steady state of a brain circuit
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.680]   in a desired range.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.600]   So that under resting conditions,
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.760]   it's not too active or too quiet.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.760]   - Your thermostat analogy is perfect here.
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:19.760]   - So in that context,
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.520]   it kind of is like just the thermostat of the house.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.040]   Whereas 2-AG is like,
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.480]   let's say the pinch hitter,
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.480]   who gets brought in to do the heavy lifting.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.000]   And so 2-AG during a situation,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.520]   like let's say something like even like a seizure
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.520]   is an extreme example,
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.760]   where you have a huge amount of neural activity.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.200]   Those neurons that are getting heavily activated
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.880]   during massive amounts of neural activity,
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.000]   start dumping out huge amounts of 2-AG.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.400]   And that acts as the,
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.320]   okay, we really need to turn off this circuit
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.440]   very quickly in this situation.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.400]   And in most of these forms of like synaptic plasticity,
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.240]   like I was saying earlier,
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.840]   where you need to either strengthen or weaken a synapse
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.320]   in response to a change in the environment
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.800]   or in response to an experience
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.440]   or something that's going on.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.340]   Most of that is driven by 2-AG signaling.
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.480]   And so, you know,
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.000]   all these forms of like turning things up or down
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.320]   in a kind of rapid and on-demand manner,
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.000]   that's mostly 2-AG.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.480]   So most people who study like neurophysiology
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.960]   and like record activity in neurons
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.040]   and look at endocannabinoids,
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.720]   they're almost entirely talking about 2-AG
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.020]   when they play with stuff.
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.480]   So yeah, that's kind of one of the ways we do it.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.760]   We say that anandamide may be more tonic
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.800]   and 2-AG might be more phasic.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.800]   And like brought online when needed,
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.840]   but doesn't do a lot.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.120]   There is some evidence that 2-AG may also have a role
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.160]   to regulate some circuits
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.760]   under kind of resting conditions as well.
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.440]   And there certainly are some situations
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.640]   where anandamide might get brought into play
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.780]   to affect plasticity,
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:48.720]   but as kind of like an umbrella idea of how we look at it,
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.620]   that's often how we divide those two up.
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:53.120]   So we kind of have these two molecules,
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.580]   they end of the day do the same thing.
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.060]   They're regulating neurotransmitter release
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:58.120]   through retrograde signaling,
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.720]   but what stimulation brings them online
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.040]   or what drives their activity may differentiate.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.240]   And we don't really understand all the details behind that
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.360]   outside of the fact that we very clearly know
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.880]   2-AG is activity dependent.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.380]   So as that neuron becomes more active,
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:13.700]   it's gonna make 2-AG to regulate its inputs.
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:17.200]   So yeah, you have this very complex system
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.720]   and it's really widely distributed in, you know,
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.560]   it's everywhere.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:21.400]   There's cannabinoid receptors
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.400]   and the endocannabinoid molecules are in the cortex,
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.240]   they're in the hypothalamus,
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.240]   they're in the striatum, the hippocampus, the cerebellum.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.160]   - All over the place.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.860]   - Except the one area where it's really interesting,
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:32.040]   actually, where you don't really see much receptor
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:35.800]   is in brainstem populations that regulate, you know,
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.840]   kind of unconscious cardiac and respiratory function.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.600]   So this is one of the things that really differentiates
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.840]   cannabis from opiates,
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.680]   because a lot of the signaling mechanisms
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:46.560]   between opioid receptors and cannabinoid receptors
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:47.760]   are quite similar.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.160]   But as it's been well-established,
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.840]   people can overdose and fatally and die from opiates
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:54.680]   relatively easily.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.880]   And the way that that tends to happen is
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.520]   when you activate the opiate receptors
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.520]   in the kind of cardiorespiratory parts of the brainstem,
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.200]   it depresses neural activity.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.600]   So as the person loses consciousness,
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.960]   they also unconsciously will stop regulating
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:08.800]   their own heart and breathing
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.480]   and it can be a fatal response.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.840]   Because cannabinoid receptors
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.800]   don't really exist in those regions,
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.160]   you don't get the same kind of impact
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:21.080]   in terms of suppressing heart rate and breathing function.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.820]   And so that's, I mean, you know,
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:24.660]   there's always the saying, like,
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:27.160]   there's never been an account of someone actually dying
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.240]   from a cannabis overdose or a THC overdose.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.840]   I mean, certainly people can do stupid things
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.660]   while they're intoxicated that result in their death,
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.040]   but in the same manner that someone can die
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.280]   from consuming too much opiates,
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.120]   that doesn't seem to be physically possible
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.660]   with cannabinoids as far as we've seen so far.
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:43.860]   And a lot of that is just because of the localization.
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:44.700]   Like for some reason,
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.400]   it's just not the receptors in that part of the brain, so.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.440]   - Very interesting.
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:53.520]   A lot of kind of a aficionado questions
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.640]   about the receptor biology.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.460]   I'll just spare everyone the details
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:01.000]   by just highlighting something that you already said
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.920]   far more eloquently than I will,
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.600]   which is, I think it is fascinating
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.760]   that this whole system has both a tonic,
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:10.760]   like a steady release capability and a phasic, you know,
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.520]   so the ability to spike, forgive the pun,
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.000]   the neuroscientists will know what I'm talking about,
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.360]   to spike more activity of the system
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.120]   superimposed on that tonic activity,
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.200]   because this is something that you see
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.520]   in the dopamine system.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.880]   This is something that you see
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.920]   in essentially every neuromodulator, neurotransmitter system,
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:29.800]   but it seems that the endocannabinoid system
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.800]   has accomplished this quite a bit differently.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:36.160]   So very interesting, unique system in a number of ways
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.960]   that raise a number of key questions.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:38.800]   - So yeah, if you go back
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.980]   to the munchies question you had,
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.200]   so if we tie into that, one of the,
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.040]   so there's a few ways, I mean,
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.120]   cannabinoids and feeding are a really interesting thing,
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.020]   because proto, like if you ask people,
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.440]   like kind of the prototypical responses to consuming cannabis
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.140]   most people would usually say munchies
[00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:57.720]   is one of the things that pops up pretty regularly.
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:02.720]   And so, you know, the cannabinoid receptors are very,
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.720]   they are expressed in these feeding circuits
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:08.200]   in the hypothalamus, and, you know,
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.440]   there's a lot of complex circuitry there
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.760]   that can regulate food-seeking behavior.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.600]   - Yeah, we just had an episode with Zach Knight
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.600]   from HHMI and UCSF, where he talked about
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.280]   like the AGRP neurons and different neurons
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.800]   of the hypothalamus, we can link to that
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.100]   in the show note captions.
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:27.040]   Nowadays, a rich understanding of the neurons
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:30.440]   that stimulate food-seeking, craving, and then eating.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.240]   - And so we know that like cannabinoids,
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.220]   they regulate, again, those inhibitory inputs
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:36.120]   around AGRP neurons, for example.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.520]   And so one thing they can do is disinhibit
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.560]   those AGRP neurons, so they become more active,
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.240]   and that can drive food-seeking behavior.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.000]   So that's certainly one mechanism of it,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.040]   but there's also a huge reward component to this
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:47.960]   in terms of the munchies.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:51.320]   And so we know that like you can also
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.200]   just dump anandamide, for example.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.960]   This is, you know, Steve Mahler and Kent Berridge
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.980]   did this work years ago, where they just put anandamide
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.000]   into the nucleus accumbens, and that can also stimulate
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   palatable food intake.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.860]   So you also have this ability to integrate
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.520]   with the reward circuitry.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.960]   And then there was also this fascinating paper
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:09.160]   from a Japanese group in PNAS, I think about 12 years ago.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.720]   And what they found was they would give a rodent
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.380]   a cannabinoid, and then they would stimulate
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.080]   different taste bud populations.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.560]   And then they would look at the gustatory cortical response
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.840]   to stimulating the populations.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.800]   And what they found is under the influence of a cannabinoid,
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.960]   if you stimulated sweet taste buds,
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.680]   you got an enhanced response in the gustatory cortex,
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.240]   but not if you did salty, bitter, or sour.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:32.800]   I don't know if they did umami in that one,
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:35.360]   but it was very explicit to sweet tasting.
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:39.360]   And so you have this kind of ability to like jack up
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.720]   the way the brain is processing sweet-tasting foods.
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.680]   You have this engagement of the reward circuitry,
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:46.080]   and then you also have this ability to regulate
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.720]   AGRP neurons, as well as the POMC neurons.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.100]   There's kind of both sides to that in the arcuate nucleus,
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.160]   to regulate multiple components of feeding.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:57.320]   But a big question is like,
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.820]   my lab has become kind of interested in this as well,
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.500]   because we have a component of my lab
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.020]   that studies feeding behavior.
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:05.560]   And one of my postdocs has been doing these projects
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.480]   for years now trying to understand,
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.400]   almost like at a behavioral mechanism level,
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.160]   what the munchies are.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.880]   And what she's been looking at is,
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.380]   we kind of started thinking about the idea that,
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:18.480]   what is it that, because it's not just food seeking,
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.940]   and it's not just, like just want to consume something.
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.240]   There's a maintenance of eating.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.200]   And so we know from humans and animals,
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.260]   you can satiate them, you can make someone full,
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.020]   and then get them high on cannabis,
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.500]   and they'll re-initiate eating.
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.500]   So that's an interesting thing in and of itself,
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.560]   because that means you're disrupting either
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.760]   the ability of the brain to detect satiety,
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:42.480]   or you're messing with a process we call reward devaluation.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.080]   And so reward devaluation is like,
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.200]   if you haven't eaten for a day,
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.240]   and you see like a picture of a pizza,
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.780]   someone brings a pizza in front of you,
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:51.000]   it just looks delicious.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.520]   That first slice tastes amazing.
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.440]   It's salty, it's fatty, it's delicious.
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.900]   You eat five of those slices, it feels greasy and nasty.
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:00.200]   And so that process of how you perceive the food,
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.840]   and its reward salience degrades as you eat,
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.640]   and as your brain basically shifts into a thing of,
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.640]   we don't need to consume calories and food anymore,
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.340]   we're okay, we're full now.
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.180]   And so we've done a series of experiments in the lab
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:15.300]   where you'd get the animals and either satiate it in advance
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.420]   where they have already devalued the food,
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.280]   and under a normal state, they won't eat it anymore,
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.320]   they won't work to get access to it.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.880]   And you get them high on like a cannabis extract.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.460]   We have these vape chambers that are like,
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:28.620]   I don't know how else to describe it
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:30.200]   outside of like a little hot box.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.320]   It's probably the best way to,
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:36.080]   'cause it's essentially a kind of a locked airtight box
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.400]   that the rat goes in and it gets like vapor puffs,
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.880]   and it fills up, and then they inhale this,
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.520]   and then it clears out, and they get another puff,
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.040]   and then it fills up, and we do this for like 15 minutes.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.520]   And we've titrated all this to get exactly
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.760]   blood levels of THC that you would achieve
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.400]   in someone who's consuming cannabis through smoking.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.280]   And so we get them to that point,
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.960]   and then give them access to food,
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.800]   and they will go gangbusters.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.400]   They eat food, doesn't matter what you give them.
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.120]   You give them plain chow, they go to town,
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.400]   you give them fatty, you give them sweet, they love it all.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.980]   But you pre-satiate them, and they get 'em stoned,
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:08.980]   they will re-initiate eating again.
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:10.480]   And you make 'em work for it
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.400]   where they have to like lever press,
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.700]   and you get 'em stoned, and they will go to town on that,
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:17.040]   and they will work, and--
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.640]   - Proof that even under the influence of cannabis,
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.880]   animals will work hard.
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:25.040]   - Yeah, they, for food, I don't know about other stuff,
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:26.160]   but for food, they certainly will.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.800]   I mean, and at least Weiritz and Cassie Moore
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.000]   have done this at Hopkins as well.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.240]   They've shown similarly,
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:31.960]   using what we call progressive ratio,
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.320]   which is essentially a thing where it's like
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.500]   the first time you press a lever,
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:36.480]   you immediately get a sugar.
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.320]   Next time you gotta hit it twice to get a pellet,
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.420]   then you have to hit it four times to get one.
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:41.820]   Yeah, then you gotta hit it 16,
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:44.680]   and then, and it kind of scales exponentially up.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.440]   I mean, we've had this one female
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.800]   we kind of joke about in the lab,
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.440]   this one female rat, and you get her high,
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.240]   and she'll do like 300 lever presses
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.880]   to get one sugar pellet, like she really wants it.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.680]   So you can really kind of goose up their motivation to eat,
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.400]   and so there's clearly a rewarding aspect to this
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.560]   because they're motivated to engage enough
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.660]   in working to get access to the food,
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:06.780]   but you can also do another way of testing this question,
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:10.080]   which is you can pair a food with something
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.560]   that will make the animal feel nauseous,
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.080]   like lithium chloride.
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.040]   This is kind of the way that you would test
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.080]   conditioned taste aversion.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.020]   So you give them access to a food,
[00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:18.860]   and then you give them something
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:19.720]   that makes them feel nauseous,
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.720]   and the animals will avoid that food.
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.720]   And so that's another way to kind of devalue a food
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.080]   is by pairing it with a nauseant
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.600]   so the animal no longer likes it.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.200]   So again, same situation, you can get the animal stoned,
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.480]   and it will re-engage in eating that food
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:36.280]   that it had devalued through being paired with a nauseant.
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.360]   So through either satiety
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:42.520]   or making it kind of a negative associated flavor
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.880]   because the animal got nauseous before,
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.680]   you can kind of override these effects by giving THC.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.600]   And so that could be a complex process
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:53.840]   that either involves changes in the reward circuitry.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.760]   This could be something that's like
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:56.160]   from the orbitofrontal cortex,
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.100]   which is a very important part of the brain
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:01.000]   that scales reward and kind of assesses
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.480]   how much someone wants to work
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.200]   or an organism wants to work to achieve a reward at the end.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.520]   So we haven't figured out the circuitry of this
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.760]   and where exactly it's acting,
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.820]   but I would say a lot of the stuff
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:14.080]   that we and others have done kind of supports this idea
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.680]   that a lot of what the munchies is
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.680]   is this ability to kind of almost lock in
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:21.460]   the reward value of food so that it doesn't decay.
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:23.920]   Despite satiety, despite eating over time,
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.960]   it just keeps it highly salient
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.200]   so that they want to work for it still.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.120]   And then similarly, we've also,
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.560]   we and others have also done work to show
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:32.920]   we can block satiety signals.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:35.200]   So we know endocannabinoids at least
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.760]   are capable of overriding leptin.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.040]   So leptin is an anorectic molecule,
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.440]   comes out from the fat,
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.720]   and usually we release it when we've eaten a lot,
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.040]   and it's one of these things
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.320]   that tells our brain, "Stop eating."
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.240]   You know, it works through, again,
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.680]   populations in the arcuate nucleus
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.800]   and changes the way those neurons function
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.880]   to drive food-seeking behavior.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.120]   And we and others have shown previously
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.080]   that if you elevate endocannabinoids,
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.200]   you can override that.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.720]   And actually, one of the mechanisms
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.320]   by which leptin seems to suppress feeding
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.680]   is actually by turning on
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.280]   the metabolism of endocannabinoids
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.840]   so that their levels decline.
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.680]   And so as you lose that endocannabinoid function,
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.360]   the animal is less interested in eating.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.160]   And so you can prevent these anorectic effects of leptin
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:20.000]   by, like, goosing up endocannabinoid activity.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:20.880]   As many of you know,
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.760]   I've been taking AG1 for more than 10 years now.
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.240]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.000]   To be clear, I don't take AG1 because they're a sponsor.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.120]   Rather, they are a sponsor because I take AG1.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:35.520]   In fact, I take AG1 once and often twice every single day,
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:39.000]   and I've done that since starting way back in 2012.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.600]   There is so much conflicting information out there nowadays
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.760]   about what proper nutrition is.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.740]   But here's what there seems to be a general consensus on.
[00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:49.080]   Whether you're an omnivore, a carnivore,
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.800]   a vegetarian, or a vegan,
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.960]   I think it's generally agreed
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.520]   that you should get most of your food
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:56.520]   from unprocessed or minimally processed sources,
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:59.020]   which allows you to eat enough, but not overeat,
[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:00.600]   get plenty of vitamins and minerals,
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.600]   probiotics, and micronutrients
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.040]   that we all need for physical and mental health.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.840]   Now, I personally am an omnivore,
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.380]   and I strive to get most of my food
[00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:11.160]   from unprocessed or minimally processed sources.
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.160]   But the reason I still take AG1 once
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.880]   and often twice every day
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:17.360]   is that it ensures I get all of those vitamins,
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.500]   minerals, probiotics, et cetera,
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.320]   but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.600]   It's basically a nutritional insurance policy
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:27.320]   meant to augment, not replace quality food.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.520]   So by drinking a serving of AG1 in the morning,
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.560]   and again in the afternoon or evening,
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.200]   I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.900]   And I, like so many other people that take AG1,
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:39.920]   report feeling much better in a number of important ways,
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.080]   such as energy levels, digestion, sleep, and more.
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:44.480]   So while many supplements out there
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:47.640]   are really directed towards obtaining one specific outcome,
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.400]   AG1 is foundational nutrition
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.600]   designed to support all aspects of wellbeing
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:54.100]   related to mental health and physical health.
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.480]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.940]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:00.360]   to claim a special offer.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:02.480]   They'll give you five free travel packs with your order,
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.080]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:09.240]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:13.080]   You're talking about increasing endocannabinoid activity,
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:16.100]   and we've said all this in the context of cannabis.
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:17.280]   So maybe we could talk a little bit
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.560]   about how the components in cannabis,
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.320]   THC mainly, but also CBD,
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.760]   impact these receptors, the CB1,
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.020]   and let's just leave CB2 out for the moment
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:30.020]   because it sounds like it's more of an immune system thing.
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:31.560]   But just to make it very clear,
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:37.280]   is there a way to increase the activity of endocannabinoids
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:41.000]   without ingesting THC?
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.080]   - Yes, I mean, they dynamically change all the time, so-
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:45.520]   - But you're talking about,
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:46.780]   you're talking about experimentally
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:48.960]   or recreationally adjusting their levels,
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.600]   but how does one do that without using THC?
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.280]   - So, okay, few things there, we'll take a step back.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:59.520]   So THC itself isn't going to,
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:02.240]   it does its thing by acting directly
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.760]   on the cannabinoid receptor, not-
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:07.360]   - So it sort of mimics the anandamide and 2AG.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:09.280]   - Yeah, so THC,
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.360]   going back to kind of the pharmacology of this.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:14.840]   So THC, if you look at how it interacts with the receptor,
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:18.480]   it's not a heavy duty molecule.
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:20.480]   So, I mean, this was kind of one of the things
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.760]   that came up before as well,
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.600]   is this idea that THC is a sledgehammer
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.200]   and it overrides endocannabinoids.
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.680]   - By the way, Matt's referring to the fact
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.560]   that I said that in a previous solo episode about this,
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.600]   and there I was nesting it in the concentrations of THC
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.120]   that can be found in high THC cannabis.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:35.960]   - Yeah.
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.520]   - So essentially what I was saying
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.400]   is that at very high THC concentrations,
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.800]   the amount, maybe not the binding affinity,
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:48.400]   but the amount of THC that is available to the CB1 receptors
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.000]   is going to exceed what's normally found
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.920]   in terms of the amount of anandamide
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.400]   that can bind to CB1 receptors,
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.280]   because what you're talking about
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.120]   is a super physiological condition.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.080]   - Yeah, I mean, you don't really actually need
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.560]   much THC in the brain to produce psychoactivity.
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:03.880]   Like it's a little bit of a mystery,
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.040]   to be honest, exactly how it works.
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:09.280]   I mean, I think the main way that most people
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.320]   in the cannabinoid theory field would look at this
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:15.800]   is that THC is not like a very strong agonist.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:17.160]   I mean, even if you look at its ability
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.880]   to trigger an intracellular response,
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.000]   it's much lower than 2-AG.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.920]   So it's actually more like anandamide.
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.640]   - So you said anandamide is high affinity, low efficacy.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:27.080]   - Yeah, so THC is the same.
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:28.920]   THC is actually only a partial agonist.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:30.880]   It's not even a full agonist at CB1.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.120]   - But it is high affinity.
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.680]   - It's high affinity, so it has the ability.
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:36.680]   So, but the tricky thing with that is
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:40.160]   it can out-compete 2-AG,
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:43.400]   but because it's a lower efficacy agonist than 2-AG,
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.600]   in that sense, it's almost blocking the effects,
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:47.880]   not amplifying them.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:49.200]   - Blocking the effects of 2-AG,
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.560]   but does it block the effects of anandamide?
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:55.320]   - THC and anandamide, I would kind of,
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.440]   the way I would visualize it is
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:58.760]   because they seem to have relatively similar affinities
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:00.720]   and efficacies of the receptor,
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.360]   they might, let's say, dance around.
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:04.000]   So it would be somewhat interchangeable.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.520]   The difference there is,
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.800]   and this, I think, is the big point
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:09.200]   about what THC does versus endocannabinoids,
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.200]   because we know now,
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.180]   through the pharmaceutical development of drugs
[00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.680]   that can boost anandamide levels, which exist,
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.520]   we have inhibitors that prevent their metabolism,
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:18.360]   we can elevate them.
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.640]   There's no intoxication and no psychoactivity
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.640]   associated with elevating anandamide.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.800]   - That's a very interesting point that we should highlight.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.300]   So there are drugs that now exist
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.160]   that can block the breakdown of anandamide,
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.280]   make more available,
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.960]   presumably by disrupting some enzymatic breakdown,
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.360]   and therefore lead to more binding
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:37.760]   of the now elevated levels of anandamide
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:38.960]   that are available to CB1,
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:41.440]   and you see no psychoactive effect.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.820]   People are not aware that they-
[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:44.780]   - Yeah, you can do, no one can guess.
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:45.620]   Yeah, no one can guess.
[00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:46.740]   - What is it used for?
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:48.780]   - Well, I mean, it was developed,
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:50.900]   the first molecule really was developed by Pfizer
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:53.580]   to look at if it could work on pain.
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.180]   The first trial that was done did not work.
[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:59.920]   It was like a kind of strange osteoarthritic knee pain trial
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.780]   that was like, even in that trial,
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:04.220]   the positive control of naproxen barely worked,
[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:07.380]   but because the pha inhibitor, which is,
[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:08.220]   take a step back,
[00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:10.500]   pha is the enzyme that chews up anandamide.
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.760]   So the drug that is developed inhibits that enzyme.
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.760]   So you prevent the enzymatic breakdown of anandamide.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:18.280]   So we just call them pha inhibitors.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:22.160]   So this drug will boost anandamide levels quite high,
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:24.800]   and in animal research showed some efficacy
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:25.960]   in modulating pain.
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:27.480]   And so they put it in a trial
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:28.320]   and it didn't work
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.200]   against the positive control of naproxen,
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.440]   which is like an NSAID, just like Advil, basically.
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:33.280]   - Aleve.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:34.120]   - Yeah, essentially, yeah.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:37.080]   So, and that drug didn't work that great to begin with.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.760]   So it was maybe some issues with the trial,
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:41.680]   but it essentially killed the development of the drug
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.520]   from that point on,
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.540]   because everyone's like, oh, it's not gonna work.
[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:45.240]   So it kind of shelved for a while.
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:50.520]   A colleague of mine, Marcus Heilig and Leah Mayo,
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:52.720]   Leah is now a colleague of mine in Calgary,
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:56.080]   but at the time she was a postdoc with Marcus in Sweden,
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.800]   and they were able to get access to this molecule
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.480]   right before COVID, essentially.
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:05.240]   And they did a trial in just healthy controls with it,
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:07.360]   which again, this is kind of jumping the gun
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.480]   on some of the other stuff I'll talk about,
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.720]   so I'll tether back to that.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:13.440]   But what they did was they dosed people for 10 days
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:16.280]   on this drug, and then we looked at stress and fear,
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.100]   because this is something that I study,
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:20.040]   this is something that they were interested in.
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:23.840]   And we did find that boosting anandamide with this drug
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:27.240]   over 10 days was sufficiently capable
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:29.840]   of dampening stress-induced autonomic responses.
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:32.640]   So like looking at heart rate or skin conductance.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.360]   I think skin conductance was the measure we did in there,
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:37.200]   but it's a proxy for like adrenaline release.
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:39.600]   So it blunted that, and it blunted subjective feelings
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.400]   of stress as well, so people had lower levels
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:43.280]   of saying they actually felt stressed.
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:47.600]   And it kind of helped remove this conditioned fear memory
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.640]   that they had trained people to do.
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.240]   And so I worked with them on kind of doing
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.500]   the biochemistry of this to make sure
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:54.200]   the drug was working properly.
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.040]   But it was very interesting because we did see
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:58.160]   in that situation where elevating anandamide
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:01.800]   produced kind of like a reduction in stress perception,
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.020]   a reduction in stress physiology responses,
[00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:07.820]   and kind of helped kind of reduce fear.
[00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:11.060]   And so that is kind of an interesting outcome
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:12.640]   because it tracks with some of the stuff
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:13.480]   we know about cannabis.
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.260]   And I'm sure we'll talk about some of the PTSD stuff
[00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:16.220]   and anxiety later.
[00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:18.300]   But so that's kind of one of the things.
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:20.460]   The drug has not really been used that widely yet.
[00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:23.860]   It's still, it's one of the frustrations I have
[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:26.480]   as a scientist who does a lot of translational work
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.280]   and with clinical partners like Leah,
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:32.340]   is that getting access to these molecules is not easy
[00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:34.900]   when they're not kind of wide, they're not like
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:35.740]   out in the market.
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:36.580]   So you can just go and get them.
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:39.040]   You really have to try and get access
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.700]   from the drug companies to be able to do trials with them.
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:44.700]   And so we are in the midst of trying to do that.
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:47.540]   We did just complete a trial that Leah and Marcus ran
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:50.440]   that I worked with them on as well, that was on PTSD.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:55.520]   And so there are various potential indications for this.
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.500]   I mean, Johnson & Johnson developed one as well,
[00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.180]   and they looked at it in social anxiety disorder.
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:01.620]   They had some moderate efficacy in their trial.
[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:04.260]   So I'd say the jury's still out on exactly
[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:05.540]   what we're gonna do with these,
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:08.260]   but they have some potential.
[00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:09.560]   I think in certain clinical settings,
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.300]   we just have to figure that out exactly.
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:14.100]   But I think going back to where we started this from,
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:15.300]   they're not psychoactive.
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.820]   And so, I mean, when Pfizer first made the drug,
[00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:20.140]   they were actually initially concerned
[00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:21.540]   that it wasn't getting in the brain
[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:23.460]   because no one could tell they were on the drug.
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:25.420]   I mean, this was the Wild West at this point.
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.220]   No one had any idea what endocannabinoids
[00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:28.340]   were actually gonna do.
[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:30.600]   People were basing it on what we knew about THC.
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.580]   So the assumption was people would have psychoactivity,
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:35.180]   but they didn't.
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:36.380]   Pfizer then actually had to do,
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:37.620]   they did a sleep study to show
[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:40.120]   that it did have some effects on sleep cycle,
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:41.420]   the same way THC does.
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:44.580]   And then they also did like an in vivo pet binding study
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:47.940]   to show that they could displace a radioactive molecule
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:49.900]   that would bind to the enzyme in the brain.
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.420]   - Seems like a lot of gymnastics
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:53.820]   to basically confirm what they already knew,
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:56.740]   which is that even greatly elevating the anandamide
[00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:59.420]   by blocking this enzymatic breakdown of anandamide
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:02.080]   leads to, at least from what I'm understanding,
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.960]   vastly different subjective experience
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:07.760]   than ingesting or smoking THC,
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:11.880]   which brings us back to THC and cannabis.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:15.440]   Like, you know, it seems that this thing
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:20.160]   that we call cannabis and THC are overlapping
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:23.000]   with the endogenous effects of anandamide.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.820]   But here you're not talking about endogenous normal levels.
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:27.080]   You're talking about pharmacologically
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.640]   greatly increasing anandamide,
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.640]   no psychoactive effect, no euphoria,
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.740]   no munchies, you know, et cetera.
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:37.740]   Then people smoke or take an edible of THC or cannabis
[00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:40.680]   and you get a vastly different set of effects.
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:44.720]   So maybe we could talk about THC and the CB1 receptor.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:48.320]   And since we're here, we might as well talk about CBD
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.320]   and the, I think you're going to tell us,
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:53.800]   the lack of interaction with CB1 receptor, right?
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:57.960]   And what is cannabis doing at the level of these receptors?
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:00.280]   Because it makes me wonder whether or not
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.200]   these receptors are the whole story
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:05.280]   or whether or not cannabis is, you know, as you mentioned,
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:08.480]   you know, 70 plus active molecules in there,
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:09.800]   terpenes and a bunch of other things
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.320]   that may modify their action.
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:15.420]   But this thing we call cannabis has many more actions
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:18.640]   than just mimicking the endogenous cannabinoid system.
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.480]   - Yeah, I mean, I think, I would say the main way
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.280]   that we think about this is the difference
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.800]   between endocannabinoids and THC
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.600]   is endocannabinoids are going to be released
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:30.120]   in a very specific spatial and temporal manner.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.600]   So-- - They evolve to do that.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.520]   - Yeah, so there's going to be, and I think like,
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:36.220]   it's very clear that like anandamide, for example,
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:39.040]   is not active at every synapse that has CB1.
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.800]   And so when we boost anandamide signaling
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:43.440]   by inhibiting its metabolism,
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.680]   all we're doing is amplifying anandamide signaling
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:48.120]   at the synapses it already exists.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:52.300]   Whereas THC, when you consume it orally or inhalation wise,
[00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:54.860]   and it gets into your blood and into your brain,
[00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:57.440]   it's just blanket activation.
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:59.160]   You're just carpet bombing the whole system
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.660]   indiscriminately, and so--
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:02.080]   - You're introducing the ligand,
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.500]   the thing that binds the receptor.
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:06.000]   This is far and away different than say like
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.320]   the actions of amphetamines,
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:10.240]   which are disrupting the normal biology
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:12.040]   in a way that's giving you an amplification
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:14.680]   of an endogenous mechanism, right?
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.640]   If that was all just nerd speak for those listening.
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:20.200]   It's one, in the context of amphetamines,
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.280]   what you're doing is you're taking an endogenous system,
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:23.600]   a naturally occurring system,
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.080]   and you're greatly amplifying the amount of dopamine,
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:28.400]   the amount of norepinephrine that's available.
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:31.860]   With what we're discussing today,
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:35.260]   the endocannabinoid system seems to be producing
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:39.160]   a set of effects that might overlap with the THC effects,
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.960]   but THC is doing a bunch of other things,
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:44.840]   and that's because THC, and we'll talk about CBD,
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:48.240]   but at least THC is acting as the ligand.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.380]   It's in some sense, we don't wanna say replacing,
[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:52.560]   but it's masking the effects of anandamide.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.100]   - I think the problem is when you just blanket activate
[00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:58.140]   all the CB1 receptors in the brain indiscriminately,
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:00.720]   like you do when you consume cannabis with THC,
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:03.680]   the resulting effect is the intoxicating state,
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:06.400]   and it's probably because there's a lot of CB1 receptors
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:08.480]   in the cortex, and those are gonna be
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:10.600]   differentially regulated at different times
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:13.520]   by endocannabinoids, whereas when THC hits them,
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.040]   all of them are gonna get affected at once,
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.640]   and if you think of the way that I had described
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.200]   how cannabinoid receptors work by essentially,
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:21.760]   I mean, at its simplest form,
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.920]   what cannabinoid receptors do is they change the way
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:27.040]   that two neurons talk to each other, and so--
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:28.920]   - So you're changing all the networks simultaneously.
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:30.120]   - Yeah, so if you hit a whole bunch
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:32.220]   of networks simultaneously, you're just gonna change
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:35.600]   the way that information processing and perception occurs,
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:37.820]   and I think as a consequence of that,
[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:39.600]   that's what produces the intoxicating state,
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:44.320]   not that THC is like a super-duper version
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.980]   of an endocannabinoid or that it's boosting endocannabinoids.
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:50.760]   It's kind of like just indiscriminately activating
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:52.600]   all the receptors as opposed to a system
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:55.120]   that's very finely tuned to do very specific things
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:56.360]   at very specific times.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:57.480]   - That's very helpful.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:00.560]   So the analogy that I was considering using coming in here,
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:03.000]   like the difference between endogenous testosterone
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.240]   or estrogen versus pharmacologic testosterone or estrogen
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:09.280]   given as a therapy is very different
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:11.880]   because that's a levels issue.
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:14.040]   This is a levels and an extent issue.
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:16.160]   - Yeah, this is a lot more to do with just, yeah,
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:17.880]   the nature of how it hits everything,
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:20.920]   because like, so for example, if we talk about feeding,
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:23.520]   we know it's been established at this point that,
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:25.800]   for example, if an organism doesn't eat for like a day,
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:30.640]   so you fasted, at that point in those feeding circuits
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:31.960]   in your brain, like the arcuate area
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:33.960]   where these AGRP neurons and stuff are,
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:36.640]   you'll start seeing elevations in endocannabinoids.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:40.000]   So endocannabinoid levels start kind of going up and up
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   following kind of fasting periods.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.380]   And part of this is because they're trying to engage
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.560]   that feeding circuitry now and they're shifting
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:48.280]   the activity of those neurons
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.040]   to promote food-seeking behavior
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:53.060]   because an organism is basically like energy-detecting
[00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:54.480]   its periphery and saying, oh, you know,
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.560]   we might be burning through our energy reserves,
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:57.920]   we should probably eat more.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:00.680]   And so there are obviously a few mechanisms that do this.
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:04.120]   NPY is another one and ghrelin and things like that.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.960]   So there's a lot of redundancy in these systems,
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.720]   but endocannabinoids are just one of the molecules
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:10.380]   that seem to fine-tune like the feeding circuitry.
[00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:12.080]   And so in states of fasting,
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:14.660]   endocannabinoids go up explicitly in that circuit.
[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:16.560]   And there's some evidence they also go up
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:17.760]   in like the nucleus accumbens
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.200]   and affect some of the reward circuitry.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:21.400]   So they're probably driving food-seeking behavior
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.280]   and enhancing the rewarding aspects of food
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:24.320]   at the same time.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:27.200]   And so that's like a natural endogenous mechanism
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.280]   to regulate feeding based on nutritional state.
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:32.940]   THC, on the other hand, you know, it hits the brain.
[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:34.680]   Yeah, some of it's gonna be the intoxication,
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:37.040]   but in tandem, you're gonna hit the CB1 receptors
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:38.540]   that are in those feeding circuits as well.
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:41.960]   And the consequence of that is gonna be,
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:43.880]   I mean, the way I kind of analogize it to people,
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:45.640]   as I say, it's almost like tricking the brain
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:47.760]   into thinking that you've been fasting
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:49.200]   because you're now activating receptors
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:50.400]   that are normally activated
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:52.220]   following kind of a fasting state.
[00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:54.080]   And as a consequence of that,
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:57.400]   it pushes someone or an organism or human or whatever
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:59.280]   into a state of food-seeking behavior
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.200]   because now food also has high reward value
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:02.480]   and they're kind of,
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:04.460]   the way that their food circuitry is responding,
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:05.400]   in the brain at least,
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:07.240]   seems to be similar to what would happen
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:08.280]   if they'd been fasted.
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:10.820]   And the thought is that's why when people,
[00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:12.960]   you know, when someone gets stoned,
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:14.480]   they're not like going to eat lettuce.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:16.380]   They want high calorie food.
[00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:19.360]   They tend to like things that are high carb, high fat.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:21.240]   That combo seems to be what people like
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:23.120]   when they're intoxicated with cannabis.
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:24.800]   And that comes with a lot of calories.
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.080]   And the point of that would be
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:28.560]   you're trying to replenish lost energy stores.
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:31.600]   And so this at least is the kind of the theory that I have
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:34.120]   about what it is that it's doing is, you know,
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:35.400]   and I think you can make this analogy
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:36.640]   for multiple different things.
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:38.020]   You know, if we talk about pain or stress,
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:40.480]   we can say similar kinds of things are going on,
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:43.280]   is that endocannabinoids normally do one thing,
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.240]   but when THC hits the brain,
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:46.660]   it's still activating these circuits
[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:48.700]   in addition to everything else that hits.
[00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:50.420]   So you still drive that response
[00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:51.440]   that the endocannabinoid system
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:53.460]   normally physiologically controls,
[00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:55.260]   but you're almost like tricking the brain
[00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:57.140]   into thinking you're in that state now.
[00:58:57.140 --> 00:58:58.660]   And so then you, then yeah,
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:00.760]   you go into food seeking behavior mode.
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:02.020]   - Super interesting.
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:04.140]   Well, I have to imagine that there are many people
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:07.260]   who use cannabis not to stimulate appetite,
[00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:08.380]   but for other reasons.
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:12.480]   They either like the euphoria or to adjust their anxiety.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:16.380]   What are some other known mechanisms
[00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:20.940]   by which cannabis can change people's psychology?
[00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:24.480]   Let me focus in on one particular aspect
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:27.220]   of subjective experience, which is focus.
[00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:29.080]   Do you think that some people use cannabis
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.620]   because it allows them to focus better?
[00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:34.660]   And I raise this specifically because I think that
[00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:38.420]   in the past, cannabis has had a bit of a reputation
[00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:40.140]   for making people spacey.
[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:43.140]   Now you use the word stoned, kind of out of it.
[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:45.380]   And yet I've heard of some potential uses
[00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:47.040]   for enhancing focus.
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:47.880]   - I mean, honestly,
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:49.260]   this is a bit of a tricky one to speak to
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:52.620]   because I just don't think there's good evidence for it.
[00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:54.340]   - Either way or?
[00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:55.180]   - I just don't.
[00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:56.140]   I mean, as far as I'm aware,
[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:58.460]   it hasn't been studied in a lot of depth.
[00:59:58.460 --> 00:59:59.860]   I mean, there's some things,
[00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:00.900]   a lot of the stuff that's been done
[01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:03.480]   is usually more like kind of acute memory tasks,
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:06.420]   like a working memory or recall or something like this,
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:09.020]   as opposed to explicitly studying focus.
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:11.340]   Anecdotally, there is certainly a lot of people
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:12.180]   that report that.
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:15.140]   - My understanding is that people who use cannabis
[01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:18.240]   have poor, certain forms of memory,
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.500]   but not necessarily poor memory across the board.
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.460]   Is that correct?
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:22.460]   - I don't think I would say that.
[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:24.660]   I don't think you could lump anything in that context.
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:27.900]   I mean, I would say the only thing you can say confidently
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:30.200]   that I would be comfortable saying is that
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.720]   acutely while someone's intoxicated on cannabis,
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:35.660]   there is definitely short-term effects on memory processing.
[01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:36.880]   So people tend to-
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:40.140]   - Negative effects or enhancements or decrements?
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:41.740]   - I would say most of it has to do
[01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:43.360]   with recall or consolidation.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:45.100]   So there does seem to be some,
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.380]   I mean, certainly the animal evidence
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:48.100]   is very compelling there, but again,
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:50.860]   we can talk to what some of the limitations of that are.
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:52.940]   But in humans, I would say most of the work
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:54.220]   that's been done would suggest
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:57.400]   there is some short-term memory deficits
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:00.600]   that are present during the intoxicated state.
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.660]   I have not seen very much compelling evidence
[01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.840]   of long-term effects that emerge,
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.580]   like when someone's not intoxicated,
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.620]   but they use cannabis somewhat regularly.
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:12.180]   I don't think there's anything compelling for that.
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:15.140]   And even in that case, like Carrie Cutler,
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:16.180]   who's at Washington State,
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:18.620]   she's done a lot of this stuff looking at
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:21.180]   cognitive processing and different kinds of memory tasks
[01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:24.820]   in users while they're stoned often.
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:27.060]   And within a person,
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:31.100]   either they have adapted to using it as much as they do,
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:33.240]   or they've developed some form of tolerance to it.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:35.240]   But even in regular users,
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.080]   the impact on memory processing
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.960]   is usually not super robust.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:40.800]   It's still there.
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.520]   I mean, I think the effects that are more often seen
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:47.080]   in kind of, let's say, smaller laboratory studies
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.480]   where they're using people who've used cannabis,
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.720]   but aren't regular users,
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.520]   might be a little bit more profound
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:55.720]   because they may not be used to that state, let's say.
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.080]   I mean, there's certainly something
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.160]   we call state-dependent learning,
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.640]   which I'm sure you're familiar with.
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.360]   And this is something people,
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.560]   I mean, I remember learning about this
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:03.960]   in undergrad through alcohol.
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.920]   So like, you know, someone,
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:07.720]   first time they get drunk, tries doing something,
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:08.920]   they're very bad at the task.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.260]   But if every time they're drunk, they do that task,
[01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.560]   they become better at doing it under the influence.
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:16.200]   And so then all of a sudden, you know,
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.040]   they regularly do this task while they're drunk
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:18.880]   and someone tests them,
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.320]   and they don't look like they're impaired at all
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.440]   because they've done it so much.
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.280]   And so-
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:24.400]   - I should just say this point has often been confused
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:28.920]   by undergraduates and others to assume that
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.440]   just because one can gain proficiency at a task
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.480]   while under the influence of a substance
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.860]   does not mean that you have higher proficiency
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:38.600]   at that particular task while under the influence.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.040]   In fact, the way it was presented to me
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:44.240]   when I was an undergraduate was incorrect.
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:48.280]   I remember the lecturer said and later corrected himself.
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.200]   I won't call him out here 'cause that's unfair.
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.360]   He's not here to defend himself,
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:56.120]   but it happens in lectures that people who studied drunk
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:58.120]   would be better off coming to the exam drunk.
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.120]   That is not true from what I understand.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.740]   - I don't think better off, no.
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:03.980]   - But they would probably score better than someone
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:07.000]   who had never studied drunk and came to the test drunk.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:07.840]   - Correct.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:10.000]   - Just because they had had some state-dependent learning.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.800]   And so I think when we're talking about,
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.080]   if you're talking about someone who's a chronic cannabis user
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:16.760]   they're going to have done a lot of cognitive tasks
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.120]   while they're under the influence.
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.680]   And so if you acutely test them,
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:23.520]   the impairment you might see in them is probably less
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.520]   than you would see in someone who's relatively naive
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.520]   or a much less experienced user.
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:30.280]   That being said, I think it's relatively well-established.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.100]   Most people would agree that acutely intoxication
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:36.420]   with cannabis does impair memory processes in some capacity.
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:38.100]   What explicit form of memory?
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:40.380]   I don't think I could speak to comfortably
[01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:42.020]   just 'cause I'm not a memory researcher
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:43.340]   and I know there's very specific things
[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:45.340]   of like episodic and declarative and whatnot.
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:49.300]   So I can't say that, but I'd say it's kind of generally,
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:51.140]   and I mean, again, you can replicate this in animals
[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:53.020]   where if you train them on a task
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:54.060]   while they're under the influence,
[01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:55.780]   they don't seem to have consolidated
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:57.180]   that information as well.
[01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:00.200]   But again, I don't really think
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.680]   there's super compelling evidence
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.960]   that there's kind of long-term permanent effects
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:07.120]   on cognitive function in individuals who use cannabis.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.640]   At least I've never seen anything that's replicable
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:13.160]   or reliable or stable in any way, so yeah.
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:14.200]   - Thanks for clarifying that.
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:18.160]   And also thank you for clarifying the discrepancy
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.640]   between endogenous cannabinoid binding
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.200]   and affinity for CB1 versus THC.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.720]   I really appreciate that because that's something
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.440]   that you and I discussed in light of the solo episode
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:31.060]   I did about cannabis, and now you've made it clear
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:33.820]   that THC does not bind with much higher affinity.
[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:35.900]   It's just, as I think your words were,
[01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:39.740]   assuming high THC levels in the cannabis carpet bombs
[01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:42.580]   all the networks as opposed to binding more
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:44.660]   with higher affinity at particular receptors.
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:46.380]   - Yeah, I mean, I don't actually even think it matters
[01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:47.720]   if it's high THC in the cannabis.
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:49.800]   I think like some people can get very intoxicated
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.860]   off of very, very low doses of cannabis.
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:52.700]   - Is that right?
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:55.140]   - I mean, you look at edibles, for example.
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:57.340]   I mean, this may be an interesting segue
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:58.580]   into root of administration stuff,
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:04:59.580]   'cause I think it's an important point
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:01.180]   that a lot of people don't recognize,
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:04.940]   is the difference between someone inhaling cannabis
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:06.680]   versus someone orally consuming cannabis
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:08.720]   is like a different game.
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:11.420]   - Yeah, let's talk about this, 'cause I know that you
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:13.640]   and I arrived at different understanding
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:18.640]   of the fastest, typical, and slowest routes of entry
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:25.180]   for THC into the system, to arrive at the brain, right?
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:28.980]   The numbers I gave in the previous discussion about this
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:31.620]   were related to how quickly inhaled smoke moves
[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:33.060]   from the lungs to the bloodstream
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:34.700]   and crosses the blood brain barrier.
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:35.620]   - Which is very fast.
[01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:37.660]   - Right, which is very fast.
[01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:39.260]   - I don't know if it's different than nicotine.
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:40.500]   I'm not sure.
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:41.860]   Again, I don't know if I would say that,
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:43.380]   but yeah, it's very fast.
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:48.380]   - Okay, so it may be that it is the same as nicotine.
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:50.180]   It may be that it's faster,
[01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:53.780]   but importantly, it can be fast.
[01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:56.020]   But typically, how fast is the onset
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.120]   of the subjective experience of,
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:03.120]   okay, somebody takes a hit off a joint or a bong hit
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:07.180]   and they start to experience the subjective effects
[01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:09.980]   of euphoria, et cetera, how quickly after?
[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:11.340]   - Two to five minutes, I would say.
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:12.180]   It's pretty fast.
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:15.020]   I mean, so this is one of the things with cannabis is,
[01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:18.900]   and again, this will kind of go into this idea
[01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:21.200]   of the change in potency of the plant as well.
[01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:26.300]   It's pretty quick and people titrate cannabis pretty well,
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:28.660]   like at least people who've used it a couple of times
[01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:29.500]   and understand this.
[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.700]   - I've seen some people not titrate it very well.
[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:34.220]   - Depending again on how you're, so again, this can vary.
[01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:38.340]   So like, you know, cannabis from the '70s was like,
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:40.260]   I don't know, 5% THC, let's say.
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:41.500]   It was pretty low.
[01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:43.540]   And nowadays, cannabis is,
[01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:45.680]   a lot of the commercial stuff is between 20 and 30,
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:48.140]   although whether those are super accurate numbers,
[01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:50.980]   not entirely clear, but so it's gone up a fair amount.
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:54.340]   - Yeah, I mean, that's not just a fair amount.
[01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:56.660]   I mean, if we were talking about alcohol concentration.
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:57.900]   - It's beer to vodka.
[01:06:57.900 --> 01:06:59.940]   Yeah, basically you're talking about a beer
[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:01.020]   or a wine to a spirit.
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:04.400]   - And there are aquavit varieties, so to speak.
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:07.720]   By the way, I think when people hear me talk about
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:10.380]   any kind of a drug that can be used recreationally
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:12.180]   or alcohol, I think some people assume that,
[01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:14.660]   you know, I'm ultra anti all these things.
[01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:15.820]   I'm actually not, right?
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:18.660]   I'm not an alcoholic, so I can drink a little bit
[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:20.760]   and I have, I just don't tend to.
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:23.820]   And we could discuss cannabis in a different venue.
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:27.740]   But the point here is we're not trying to frame this
[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:29.020]   as what people should or shouldn't do.
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:30.340]   We're just trying to inform people.
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:32.060]   I want to be very, very clear about that.
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:35.020]   So, but when I hear about, you know,
[01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:40.020]   20 to 30% concentration, as opposed to 5% concentration,
[01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:41.500]   that's significant.
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:44.620]   - So I would say this is what's super interesting.
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:47.620]   And this was something that came out of the way
[01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:50.380]   that cannabis research is done, certainly in the States.
[01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:52.660]   And Canada has been quite behind on this,
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:55.140]   even with legalization, we haven't caught up.
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:58.380]   But they have been doing lab-based studies of cannabis.
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:00.380]   You know, Meg Haney, Harriet DeWitt,
[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:01.980]   this cluster of researchers around the country,
[01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:04.960]   Ziva Cooper at UCLA here, have all done this where,
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.420]   you know, you have people come into the lab,
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:09.400]   you give them cannabis, you measure subjective outcomes
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.500]   or neuroimaging outcomes or whatnot.
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:15.760]   So to do this, you can't use commercial cannabis.
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:19.140]   And even like the state by state legalizations
[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:19.980]   hasn't changed this.
[01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:22.660]   So if you are doing cannabis research in humans
[01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:23.820]   and you're funded by like NIDA,
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:26.620]   which is National Institute of Drug Abuse,
[01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:28.980]   you get all your cannabis sourced.
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:30.340]   I mean, this may be changing.
[01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:31.820]   I think there are some shifts that are happening,
[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:33.500]   but historically in all the literature
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.380]   that we would talk about,
[01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:36.580]   that's kind of pre the last couple of years,
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.780]   all that cannabis came from one source,
[01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:41.340]   which was, I believe a farm in like Mississippi
[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:44.300]   that was essentially funded by NIDA to produce cannabis.
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:45.120]   - Lucky farm.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:47.740]   - And well, the cannabis that came out of it though,
[01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:50.140]   and this is one of the reasons a lot of the clinical stuff,
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:51.260]   people have kind of been like,
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:52.900]   "Oh, I don't know how representative this is."
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:55.620]   'Cause it reflects cannabis that I would say is more
[01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:56.820]   from like the seventies or eighties.
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:09:01.300]   So it would be like five to 9% kind of THC cannabis.
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:04.400]   Now, when you put someone in a lab setting
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:08.340]   and you get them to smoke to level of intoxication,
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:11.060]   people would take, you know, whatever, eight tokes,
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:12.740]   let's say, something like that.
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:14.260]   And that's where they would stop.
[01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:17.020]   And so, you know, a lot of the labs that use this
[01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:18.140]   have always been like,
[01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:19.940]   "Our people who are regular cannabis users
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:20.860]   are getting high off of it.
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:23.240]   It's not as potent as the stuff that's on the street,
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.060]   but they're clearly getting intoxicated from it
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.820]   and it's giving us reliable data."
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:29.980]   So when they started looking at the blood levels of THC
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:31.100]   that you achieve,
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:34.220]   it was around a hundred nanograms per mil of THC,
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:35.220]   give or take.
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:36.980]   That seemed to be where it was.
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:40.820]   Now, because of the way that the,
[01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:43.820]   you can legally study cannabis in the States,
[01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:46.540]   you couldn't just go down to a dispensary
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:48.460]   and buy the products that everyone on the street are using,
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:49.360]   which is kind of like,
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:50.780]   it's been a weird thing for a lot of people
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:51.620]   'cause they're like,
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:53.020]   "Why wouldn't you study what we're using?"
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:55.180]   But because of the legal aspects of this,
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:56.740]   you couldn't bring those products into the lab.
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:58.480]   They'd never been standardized.
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.360]   No one knew exactly what was in them,
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.560]   pesticides, all this other stuff that could influence it.
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.260]   So from a safety perspective,
[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:05.100]   it was always like,
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:08.800]   "No, you use the cannabis that's sourced from NIDA."
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:12.500]   So there's a group in Colorado,
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:15.140]   so Kent Hutchinson and Angela Bryan and Cinnamon Bidwell
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:17.060]   have kind of, I would say,
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:18.740]   became very creative actually
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:21.580]   to figure out how to study cannabis
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:23.980]   that's being used, I call it, in the wild,
[01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:26.100]   in kind of an ecological setting, let's say.
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:29.380]   And so they created what was called the Canavan.
[01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:32.580]   And the Canavan was a way to study people
[01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:34.340]   using products on the street,
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:36.540]   but not have them come into a laboratory setting
[01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:37.580]   where it was complicated.
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:39.140]   And so what they would do
[01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:42.500]   is they would drive the Canavan to someone's house,
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:44.100]   but they'd be parked on the street,
[01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:46.140]   and someone would use the product,
[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:49.980]   whatever it was, in their own property, in their own time,
[01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:53.020]   and then come into the Canavan to have blood taken,
[01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:54.380]   to look at what their THC levels are,
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:56.140]   and to undergo testing.
[01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:57.340]   And so it was actually like,
[01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:59.740]   I think this was a great advance in the field
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:01.620]   'cause it was this huge innovative approach
[01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:03.280]   that allowed us to start comparing
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:05.460]   what we've learned from lab-based settings
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:07.740]   with this kind of old school weed
[01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:08.740]   that was coming from NIDA
[01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:10.620]   with what is being used on the street.
[01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:11.460]   - I love this.
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:12.700]   I mean, as somebody whose lab has done
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:15.400]   a in-laboratory VR-based experiment
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.740]   on human anxiety and fear,
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:22.100]   and then compared that to a clinical study
[01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:25.000]   that we did sort of in mass,
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.160]   where people were at home
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:28.140]   doing specific respiration practices.
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:29.200]   You have many more subjects,
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:32.020]   but of course they're reporting back their effects.
[01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:34.380]   Well, you can monitor them by device,
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:37.340]   look at HRV, look at heart rate, et cetera.
[01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:39.780]   I think having the ability to compare and contrast
[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:43.600]   in-laboratory and ex-laboratory data is extremely valuable.
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:45.380]   - Yeah, and I mean, my view is you need both
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:47.460]   because you need the in-laboratory for the control
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:49.980]   because we all need control over various things,
[01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:52.580]   but you also need the ecological validity
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:55.060]   to see how it shakes out and make sure it looks the same.
[01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:57.500]   - Yeah, for people that have never been to a laboratory
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.820]   or tried to find a parking spot at a university,
[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:02.780]   that's an anxiety-inducing experience in and of itself.
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:04.780]   - A novel experience while someone's intoxicated
[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:06.340]   with cannabis can also create
[01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:07.540]   a very different altered state.
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:09.140]   - I would wanna be stoned in a laboratory.
[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:09.980]   I'll tell you that much.
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:12.540]   - I feel like there's pluses and minuses to both sides,
[01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:14.800]   but I think the data together is very compelling
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.860]   and that's where we get a lot of advance in the field.
[01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:20.100]   So what Kent and Angela and Cinnamon did with the Canavan
[01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:21.600]   was kind of create the situation
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:24.180]   that allowed this research to occur.
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:26.060]   And what we found fascinating,
[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:27.340]   I remember talking to Meg Haney about this
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:29.700]   because all the people in her lab studies
[01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:31.660]   tended to always hit around 100 nanograms per mil
[01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:34.860]   using this relatively lower potency cannabis.
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:36.500]   When Kent and Angela and Cinnamon
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:39.540]   started studying this in the people and taking blood,
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:40.740]   despite the fact that these people
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:43.340]   are now using cannabis that's 20 to 30%,
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:44.980]   their blood levels are the same.
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:47.560]   So they're still coming in around 100 nanograms per mil
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:50.700]   because people are really good at self-titrating.
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:54.300]   Now, where things fall apart is with the concentrates.
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:56.980]   So then you go into things like dabs
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:59.940]   or these high-potency products that are now like,
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:02.980]   'cause cannabis itself, realistically,
[01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:04.460]   from what I understand from the botanists
[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:06.820]   that I've talked to, you can't really grow a plant
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:09.260]   that's gonna exceed more than 25 to 30% THC
[01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:10.940]   just by sheer biology.
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:12.220]   So it taps out there.
[01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:14.100]   That's about as high as it's gonna go.
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:16.660]   Concentrates can go up to like 90, 98%.
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:18.020]   So you can get really, really-
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:19.780]   These are tinctures?
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:23.500]   Distillates, like, yeah, various just in oil-based forms
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:26.660]   that are very, very high-potency products.
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:29.380]   Those are incredibly challenging to titrate.
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:30.780]   Like, they cannot be titrated
[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:33.260]   because the sheer volume of THC that hits the system,
[01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:35.820]   even from a single hit, is so overwhelming.
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:38.780]   And so when the Colorado group looked at those,
[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:40.140]   their blood levels were closer
[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:41.980]   to 200 to 300 nanograms per mil.
[01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:44.620]   So with cannabis plant,
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:47.020]   there does seem to be this ability
[01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:49.260]   for people to relatively self-titrate.
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:51.260]   And then my buddy Ryan McLaughlin,
[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:52.540]   who's also at Washington State,
[01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:53.580]   he was really one of the ones
[01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:55.540]   that pioneered these vape chambers in rats
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:59.340]   and created this really cool model of self-administration,
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:02.220]   which was a very important thing to actually establish
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:03.540]   because it was very challenging
[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:05.820]   to get rodents to self-administer cannabis
[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:07.780]   if you're doing, like, an IV approach or something else
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:09.140]   'cause they found it quite aversive.
[01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:12.020]   But when you let rodents actually titer
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:13.460]   their ability to get vape hits,
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:15.500]   they will, like, work for this,
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:18.020]   the same way they will other reinforcing drugs.
[01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:20.740]   So it was a really important finding that you could do this.
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:23.500]   And what Ryan found was he actually did one study
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:27.220]   where he gave them access to a low-potency product,
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:30.460]   and we'll call it medium, and then a high.
[01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:32.100]   And what you ended up, if you look at the data,
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:33.540]   is the one the rats liked the best
[01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:35.180]   was the medium-potency product.
[01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:36.020]   Interesting.
[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:37.540]   And if you gave them the high-potency product,
[01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:39.740]   they would actually take less vape hits off of that
[01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:41.020]   than they would off the lower ones.
[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:42.900]   And again, all their blood levels
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:44.540]   tended to cluster in the same range
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:47.460]   because they titrated.
[01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:48.940]   Like, even at the rodent level,
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:49.980]   they're able to titrate
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:52.420]   because of the lag between inhalation
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:54.220]   and feeling the effects is only
[01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:56.260]   on the order of a couple of minutes.
[01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:58.740]   People can titrate better.
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:14:59.780]   I mean, not just people.
[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:01.020]   It seems like the rodents can as well.
[01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:03.620]   So the higher-potency cannabis,
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:04.660]   where it becomes a problem
[01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:06.220]   is if someone's highly inexperienced
[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:07.540]   and they consume a whole bunch of it
[01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:10.100]   without allowing that time lag to occur.
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:12.300]   And then they can probably exceed the levels
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:13.940]   they intended to and consume too much
[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:16.500]   and then have probably an adverse response.
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:18.100]   So does that mean that cannabis use
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:20.720]   rarely leads to tolerance of cannabis use?
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:22.720]   I wouldn't say that.
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:24.740]   There's definitely some degree of tolerance.
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:26.780]   The tolerance is definitely more prominent
[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:28.220]   when people start using concentrates.
[01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:29.180]   There's no question about that.
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:30.660]   I mean, we can talk about the concentrates,
[01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:31.940]   I guess, separately after.
[01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:32.780]   'Cause I would say,
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:34.560]   if we're talking about a harm reduction thing,
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:37.220]   that's more where we need to focus a lot more
[01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:39.020]   is this idea of these high-potency products.
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:41.540]   - Yeah, it sounds like those are precarious.
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:43.540]   That somebody who thinks they have a lot of experience
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:45.660]   or God forbid, no experience,
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:47.900]   takes a concentrate and is, what,
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:50.620]   no longer getting the euphoric experience
[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:52.480]   that they anticipated,
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:55.620]   but instead are getting, what, a paranoid anxiety attack.
[01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:58.340]   - I think you're far more likely to go overboard
[01:15:58.340 --> 01:15:59.360]   and have an adverse response.
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:00.940]   But also, I think the problem is,
[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:04.120]   if you're using a product of that potency
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:07.600]   and that much THC floods your system on a regular basis,
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.160]   the biological changes from that
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.480]   are going to be very different
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:12.160]   than what you get if, again,
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:16.520]   you're titrating your THC from inhaling plant
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:17.680]   at roughly the same level,
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:21.480]   whether that's a 10%, 5%, or 25%,
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:23.560]   people generally tend to scale.
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:24.880]   - This is a very important point,
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:25.760]   and I'm going to highlight it
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:29.160]   because I think it's very, very, very important.
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:31.180]   Although you're making it very clearly already,
[01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:33.000]   which is, these days we hear a lot
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.000]   about the "problems" with high THC containing cannabis
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.960]   as relative to what was present in the '70s and '80s,
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:43.620]   and presumably '90s as well.
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:45.920]   I was a teen in the '90s,
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:48.240]   so maybe I'm alluding to something there.
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:49.480]   But what you're saying is that
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:52.340]   unless one is talking about concentrates,
[01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:55.160]   that people, and animals in the laboratory,
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:58.060]   will self-regulate the amount of intake
[01:16:58.060 --> 01:16:59.480]   in a way that leads to
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:03.120]   approximately the same blood levels of THC.
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:05.280]   So it may not be as much of a concern,
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:08.280]   at least in light of the concerns about,
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:09.980]   oh, these levels are so high
[01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:12.740]   that people are overwhelming their system with THC.
[01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:15.480]   Basically, this could be stated in real-world terms
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:17.840]   as people are taking fewer tokes
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:21.100]   of the higher concentration stuff
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:22.620]   that allow them to match blood levels
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:24.680]   that were present in the person
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:26.660]   taking many more tokes in the '70s.
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:28.520]   So the joke I always make to people is I say,
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:30.880]   go watch a Cheech and Chong movie from the late '70s.
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.360]   Look at the size of the joints that they smoke
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:34.320]   in movies like that,
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.520]   relative to what you would see
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.560]   someone on the street consuming nowadays.
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:42.840]   So the advantage that existed from a titration perspective
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:46.360]   was with '70s weed, there's a large window to titrate.
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:49.000]   So people could take small amounts
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.880]   and not over-consume, let's say,
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:53.120]   because there was a much lower concentration
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:54.040]   of THC in the plant.
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:55.400]   So they're able to consume,
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:59.200]   even if they were doing it relatively fast,
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:01.280]   because of how little THC was coming into the system,
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:03.160]   it was a little easier to scale that.
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:05.040]   So there certainly is the propensity
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:07.960]   for people to over-consume higher-potency cannabis,
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:10.040]   even independent of concentrates,
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:12.280]   if they're not allowing that titration to occur.
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:14.200]   Also, if you have someone who is just
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:18.020]   exquisitely sensitive to THC for various reasons,
[01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:20.360]   even one or two tokes could be too much for them
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.440]   because at the higher potency,
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:25.280]   they may not have that ability to titrate quite as well.
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.080]   And so a lot of people,
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:29.620]   anecdotally, you talk to people about cannabis,
[01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:31.560]   and a lot of people who don't like cannabis have said,
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.560]   oh, you know, I've tried, the new stuff's too strong.
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.480]   And if there's someone who's kind of more in our age range
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.520]   who grew up in an earlier decade
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.020]   where things were a bit different,
[01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:41.640]   they may be referencing their own experience
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:42.480]   from when they were younger
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:43.480]   and what they were able to consume,
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:44.620]   and now they try doing the same
[01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:45.880]   and it hits them like a sledgehammer.
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:46.720]   - Got it.
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:48.100]   - So it's a little different in that sense,
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:51.000]   but, you know, and I don't think it's to say
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.640]   it's like not concerning
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:54.800]   that cannabis is as high as THC as it is.
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:57.000]   I just think if I'm gonna put my efforts
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.040]   into kind of like, you know,
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:01.160]   public health perspectives of this,
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:03.000]   I would be digging my feet in much more
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.800]   about the access to concentrates
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:06.760]   and the issues and the potential harms
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:07.720]   that are gonna come with them
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:10.280]   than I would about the cannabis flower myself.
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:12.680]   That's just my opinion based on what I see
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.880]   with the concerns and what we've seen
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:15.960]   from the data in humans.
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:19.160]   And I think the real world ecological studies
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.220]   that the Colorado group have done
[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:21.560]   have been very informative in the sense,
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:24.200]   because yeah, if the blood levels of THC
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.560]   you achieve from concentrates are double to triple
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:29.040]   of what you get even from higher potency flower,
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:29.920]   that's a concern.
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:31.720]   Like, I think that's where problems start arising
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:33.780]   because then you're gonna start seeing
[01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:35.340]   a lot higher degree of tolerance.
[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:37.400]   I mean, there used to be more of a debate in the field
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:39.200]   as to whether people develop tolerance,
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.200]   because one of the things with cannabis
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:42.400]   that I do find very interesting
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:44.680]   is with a lot of chronic users,
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:46.320]   they don't escalate the way you would see
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.460]   with cocaine or alcohol,
[01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:49.780]   where there's very profound tolerance that develops.
[01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:53.000]   And so, I mean, people definitely see this in cocaine
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.960]   where people can become tolerant almost immediately.
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:58.440]   And so, dosing starts scaling up very fast.
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:00.280]   - Yeah, usually it's the life destruction
[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:03.480]   that thwarts their progressive increase.
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:04.760]   Seriously. - Or the cost.
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:05.600]   I mean, the sheer cost.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.320]   - Another form of life deterioration.
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.480]   - Yeah, that is required to be able to maintain that.
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:11.560]   But with cannabis,
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:15.160]   it seems like there is some degree of tolerance
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.120]   that people exhibit.
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:17.520]   It varies from person to person,
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:21.700]   but as Meg has said to me many times,
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:23.300]   the guys that come in her studies,
[01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:24.880]   these are very heavy users,
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:28.440]   and then they will use this relatively low potency product
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:29.880]   and still get high off of it.
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:32.120]   And so, it's not to say that there's no tolerance.
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:33.740]   It's just, it's not as profound
[01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:35.840]   as I think we see with a lot of other drugs.
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:39.280]   And this is probably due to the fact of just like,
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:41.420]   we definitely see,
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:43.540]   like if we look at some pet imaging studies,
[01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:45.460]   chronic cannabis users do have some down--
[01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:46.300]   - Sorry, I have to interrupt.
[01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:49.420]   - Pet, positron emission tomography, not pets.
[01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:50.880]   Although people get their pets high
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.320]   and we don't know what those pets think about that.
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:54.880]   - Not good, don't get dogs high.
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:57.000]   - If also high, one can assume a lot of things
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.880]   about what your pet is thinking while also high.
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:01.560]   Sort of half joke there.
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:03.080]   But yes, positron emission tomography
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:08.080]   is one way to assess the binding of drugs within the brain
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:12.720]   as well as activity of endogenous neurotransmitters,
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:17.340]   neuromodulators, such as anandamide, dopamine, et cetera.
[01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:21.060]   - Yeah, so a typical pet study and a human looking at this,
[01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:23.140]   they'd give a molecule that's radiolabeled
[01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:25.340]   that will bind to CB1 receptors.
[01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:28.460]   You can scan them and then look at the emission rates
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:30.780]   of the radiation to get an idea of the density of receptors
[01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:31.780]   that are in the brain.
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:33.980]   Chronic cannabis users tend to have less.
[01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:40.140]   What that means in terms of the functional outcome
[01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:41.140]   is unclear.
[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:43.000]   I mean, there could be some,
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.920]   I think there's a lot of evidence
[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:47.560]   that there's some degree of a reservoir of CB1 receptors
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:49.660]   that there might be a lot more receptors there
[01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:51.040]   than we necessarily always need
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.880]   or are always using, let's say.
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:55.560]   So we might be downregulating a component of this,
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:57.560]   but maybe not all of the ones that are required
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:59.040]   to produce the psychoactive effects
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:01.480]   'cause there's clearly some maintenance of the system
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:04.600]   that allows someone to continue to get intoxicated.
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:07.020]   And so with cannabis users, we do see that.
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:09.680]   But you do see much more profound tolerance
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:12.660]   with people using high potency extracts and concentrates
[01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:13.500]   and things like this.
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:16.860]   And again, surely I think as a response to the biology
[01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:19.380]   of hitting the system that heavily
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:22.460]   with that much THC as it comes in
[01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:24.100]   'cause they can't titrate it the same way.
[01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:24.940]   - It makes sense.
[01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:27.620]   Yeah, these concentrates sound like something
[01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:31.100]   to at least pay attention to as a potential problem.
[01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:32.320]   I'd like to take a quick break
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:35.020]   and acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:37.620]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:40.300]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:41.940]   to help you better understand your body
[01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:43.980]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:45.180]   Now, I've long been a believer
[01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:47.860]   in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason
[01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:49.980]   that many of the factors that impact your immediate
[01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:52.380]   and long-term health can only be analyzed
[01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:54.220]   from a quality blood test.
[01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:56.960]   Now, a major problem with a lot of blood tests out there
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:59.980]   is that you get information back about metabolic factors
[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:02.140]   and hormones and lipids and so forth,
[01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:04.260]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:06.140]   With InsideTracker, they make it very easy
[01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:08.140]   to know what to do with those numbers
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:09.740]   because they have a personalized platform
[01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:11.040]   that allows you to see the levels
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:13.860]   of those metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera,
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:15.700]   and they give you specific directives
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:17.700]   that you can follow related to nutrition,
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:20.500]   behavioral modification, supplementation, and more
[01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:21.780]   that can help you bring those numbers
[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:24.100]   into the ranges that are optimal for you.
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:25.740]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:29.060]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:31.500]   to get 10% off their new membership program.
[01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:32.940]   InsideTracker membership offers
[01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:35.420]   significantly reduced prices on InsideTracker's
[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:37.020]   comprehensive blood panels.
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:41.860]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 10% off.
[01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:45.600]   Along the lines of use, tolerance, et cetera,
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:50.300]   is cannabis addictive and/or habit-forming?
[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:51.460]   And I think it's probably important
[01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:52.720]   that we distinguish between the two.
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:55.740]   I may have made this joke in the previous episode
[01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:57.620]   I did on cannabis.
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:00.700]   I've known a lot of chronic cannabis users
[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:04.980]   and none of them admit to being addicted.
[01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:08.180]   It's not my place to challenge them on that,
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:10.820]   but they do seem, in my experience,
[01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:12.260]   this is not an experiment,
[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:14.100]   but in my experience, more irritable
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:17.380]   when they don't have access to what they call
[01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:19.300]   their "medicine."
[01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:24.300]   So that speaks to a dependence or something,
[01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:25.860]   but then we need to be careful
[01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:29.060]   because in the classic sense, addiction,
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:32.220]   I've defined and others in the field of addiction
[01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:34.180]   have defined it as a progressive narrowing
[01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:35.460]   of the things that bring you pleasure,
[01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:40.180]   such that it causes disruption to other areas of life.
[01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:42.420]   Your life becomes maladaptive.
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:44.140]   - Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to play
[01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:45.300]   with the definition of addiction.
[01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:48.940]   I feel like I have enough friends in the addiction space
[01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:50.860]   that it's a very contentious field.
[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:53.620]   So, I mean, I will try and not use that word,
[01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:56.460]   although I understand talking to the general public,
[01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:57.340]   that's kind of, you know,
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:00.020]   if you say someone has a use disorder versus an addiction,
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:01.460]   that may not make sense to them.
[01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:02.620]   - But that's the nomenclature now
[01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:04.820]   that people are using, alcohol use disorder,
[01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:06.860]   cannabis use disorder.
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:08.300]   This is what you start to see now
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:09.860]   instead of saying being addicted to pot
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:10.780]   or being addicted to alcohol.
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:13.380]   - And so, I mean, an addiction is obviously
[01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:17.860]   a very complex thing that, again, I don't want to touch it
[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:20.300]   simply because it's not my space.
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:23.100]   But that being said, there's no question
[01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:24.700]   that people can develop cannabis use disorder.
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:27.020]   I mean, it's definitely a thing.
[01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:28.620]   So if we say, is cannabis addictive
[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:31.180]   in kind of a, you know, normal lay speak,
[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:32.860]   I would say, yes, it is addictive.
[01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:34.100]   What does that look like?
[01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:37.020]   How does that relate to other substances of abuse?
[01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:42.020]   I mean, certainly the outcomes associated with it
[01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:43.780]   are gonna be slightly different than someone,
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:45.780]   something like opiates or alcohol,
[01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:47.740]   because that's a totally different beast,
[01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:50.220]   because you have a fatality potential.
[01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:52.140]   There's a whole bunch of other health consequences.
[01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:55.300]   But if we look at how we would define a use disorder,
[01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:57.940]   the criteria for someone hitting cannabis use disorder
[01:25:57.940 --> 01:25:58.980]   is really no different
[01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:00.860]   than how someone would hit alcohol use disorder
[01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:02.140]   or opiate use disorder in the sense
[01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:04.020]   that it can consume their life.
[01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:06.100]   It can shift the way that they behave.
[01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:07.860]   They can put themselves in risky positions
[01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:08.980]   to get access to a drug.
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:12.780]   It can consume their time and their energy to have it.
[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:14.740]   Like you said, if they don't have access to it,
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:17.580]   it can trigger, you know, an assembly of behaviors
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:20.060]   that looks like irritability, anger, frustration,
[01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:21.420]   things like that.
[01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:26.420]   So, I mean, the numbers in terms of the conversion rate
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:28.820]   of use to developing use disorder,
[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:30.780]   I would say are not entirely clear.
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:32.940]   The kind of old numbers that used to get tossed around
[01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:35.180]   were like nine to 11% of people
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:37.420]   that would start initiating cannabis use
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:40.780]   would probably transition to develop use disorder.
[01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:43.220]   The more modern numbers, I would say, you know,
[01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:45.420]   if we're looking at people who are already using weekly,
[01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:47.420]   we're talking probably closer to 30%.
[01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:48.700]   Like, so it's a much higher,
[01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:50.260]   I mean, when you're using that frequently,
[01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:52.020]   then the rates of people who would qualify
[01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:54.100]   as having cannabis use disorder probably go higher.
[01:26:54.100 --> 01:26:55.900]   - So, I just wanna make sure I'm understanding clearly.
[01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:59.420]   For people that use cannabis weekly,
[01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:03.900]   the propensity for developing cannabis use disorder
[01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:05.900]   is on the order of about 30%.
[01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:07.500]   - Yeah, I'd say in that neighborhood,
[01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:10.020]   they would probably qualify as meeting criteria
[01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:11.260]   for cannabis use disorder.
[01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:13.300]   - 'Cause weekly doesn't seem like that often.
[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:16.380]   - No, I mean, it depends again on how you vary this.
[01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:18.540]   Like, I've had a lot of conversations with the public,
[01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:21.500]   and I think depending on someone's experience
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:23.700]   in their own or in their own inner circles,
[01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:24.540]   life with cannabis,
[01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:26.060]   the way they would view it is very differently.
[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:28.820]   'Cause I think a lot of people, you know,
[01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:31.060]   again, regardless of anyone's opinion of alcohol,
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:33.380]   if someone told you they had a glass of wine with dinner
[01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:35.100]   every night, I don't think people would say
[01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:37.260]   you have an alcohol use disorder.
[01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:38.540]   I think that's not uncommon.
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:39.580]   - I don't think they would.
[01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:42.580]   - Similarly, if someone had a brandy at the end of the night
[01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:45.180]   or like, you know, a nightcap to go to bed,
[01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:46.460]   and they did that on a nightly basis,
[01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:47.980]   I don't think anyone would say
[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:49.140]   that they have a use disorder.
[01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:51.100]   And I think with cannabis,
[01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:53.020]   there are a lot of people that kind of fall
[01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:56.140]   into that bracket that would use it, you know, even daily,
[01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:57.820]   but relatively infrequently,
[01:27:57.820 --> 01:28:00.420]   and kind of as an end of the day thing.
[01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:02.900]   I think some of them certainly would fall
[01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:04.780]   into the criteria of cannabis use disorder.
[01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:06.820]   'Cause if you start looking and say, well, you know,
[01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:09.420]   if you travel to like Egypt,
[01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:11.580]   are you gonna go put yourself at risk of going to jail
[01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:12.620]   to get access to cannabis?
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.100]   'Cause you can't function without it.
[01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:15.740]   If you do, then yeah, you know,
[01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:17.460]   you've got cannabis use disorder.
[01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:19.940]   You know, are you going to burn relationships?
[01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:22.860]   Are you gonna start failing at meeting responsibilities
[01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:24.260]   or getting things done on time
[01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:26.860]   because you're preoccupied with cannabis?
[01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:28.660]   Yes, you're gonna hit the criteria
[01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:30.220]   for cannabis use disorder.
[01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:33.300]   If it's someone who's kind of just intermittently using it,
[01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:36.220]   the same way that a lot of people casually use alcohol,
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:39.780]   I would say a lot of them probably wouldn't hit criteria.
[01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:42.820]   But I think to someone who has never had cannabis
[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:44.860]   in their inner circle or in their life,
[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:47.420]   they look at it like a drug like cocaine,
[01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:49.020]   whereas they're like, wow,
[01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:50.780]   if you were using cocaine on a daily basis,
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:52.700]   we'd be super concerned about you.
[01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:55.500]   And so I think that's this, like,
[01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:57.020]   it's just as you go, I mean,
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:29:00.580]   cannabis is in this really weird transitionary period,
[01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:03.060]   I would say, of going from illicit to not,
[01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:04.140]   just because of the changes
[01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:05.700]   in the legal regulatory framework.
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:07.140]   I mean, in Canada now,
[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:09.380]   we're like five and a half years into legalization.
[01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:12.740]   So in many ways, I would say the transition has happened
[01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:14.100]   where a lot of people view cannabis
[01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:15.340]   very similarly to alcohol,
[01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:17.300]   whereas you go to some states
[01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:18.860]   and the perspective is still very different.
[01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:20.020]   And certainly if you're still in one of the states
[01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:21.420]   where there's no legal access,
[01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:23.460]   people still look at cannabis the same way
[01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:26.300]   they look at a lot of other illicit drugs
[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:27.740]   like cocaine or amphetamines or things.
[01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:28.580]   - That's interesting.
[01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:30.980]   I was under the impression this has really changed
[01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:33.340]   over the last, you know, five, 10 years.
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:34.860]   You know, growing up, it was,
[01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:38.300]   I mean, I think there are still people in jail now
[01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:41.900]   because of possession and sale of cannabis.
[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:45.260]   And then of course there are stores not far from here
[01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:46.220]   where people are selling cannabis.
[01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:47.860]   - Ironic, yeah, sadly.
[01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:51.900]   I mean, obviously a big push for legalization
[01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:55.140]   is not endorsement of the safety of cannabis.
[01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:58.380]   It's more the harms associated with prohibition
[01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:00.500]   outweigh the harms associated with legalization.
[01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:02.940]   I think that's generally the public health perspective.
[01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:05.180]   That's certainly what motivated it in Canada.
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:07.740]   And there was, you know, some attempts, let's say,
[01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:08.660]   at restorative justice
[01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:11.260]   in terms of removing criminal records and things.
[01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:12.740]   May not have been entirely as successful
[01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:14.100]   as people had hoped it would be,
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:15.620]   but it certainly has changed things.
[01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:17.500]   I mean, we can look at our federal data
[01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.420]   and see that arrest rates related to cannabis
[01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:22.900]   are obviously very low compared to what they were.
[01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:24.140]   That obviously becomes very important
[01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:26.180]   because there are clearly minoritized communities.
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:29.220]   They get hit more with this than other communities.
[01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:32.860]   And so the kind of perpetual disenfranchisement
[01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:35.660]   that happens with a prohibition model
[01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:37.580]   in communities that are already suffering
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:40.420]   from various other things that affect them
[01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:41.940]   just potentiates all that.
[01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:44.380]   So I can understand the legal framework
[01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:46.900]   behind why there'd be a move to a legalization state
[01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:48.420]   over a prohibition state,
[01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:52.140]   which again, a lot of people confuse legality with safety,
[01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:53.780]   which is a weird,
[01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:55.620]   I mean, alcohol is the perfect example of this.
[01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:58.100]   I mean, you look at the scale of harms
[01:30:58.100 --> 01:30:59.300]   on a public health level.
[01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:01.740]   I mean, alcohol stacks at the top.
[01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:03.820]   Across the board in terms of harms to the individual,
[01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:06.180]   harms to society, it's a lot.
[01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:08.700]   Cannabis has harms, there's no question on that.
[01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:11.260]   It just would fall lower than alcohol.
[01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:12.820]   But the way that people view it,
[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:14.340]   a lot of people are like alcohol is legal,
[01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:15.180]   therefore it's safe,
[01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:17.260]   and it's not something to judge people on.
[01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:19.500]   Cannabis at least historically was illegal
[01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:20.780]   and in some states still is.
[01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:22.060]   So people view it very differently.
[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:25.300]   And I think it's an interesting thing
[01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:27.860]   because I feel like,
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:29.540]   despite the fact that some people hate the government
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:31.440]   and hate the way that it regulates their life,
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:33.480]   there's this weird passive belief that like,
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:34.900]   if the government dictates something as legal,
[01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:36.540]   that means it's safe.
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:39.660]   - Is the legalization of cannabis
[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:42.540]   leading to more cannabis users or fewer
[01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:48.500]   and/or incidents of people going into the emergency room,
[01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:51.620]   suffering from cannabis-induced psychosis,
[01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:53.100]   something that I hope we can also talk about.
[01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:53.940]   - Yeah.
[01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:57.500]   So it depends on how you break this down.
[01:31:57.500 --> 01:31:59.780]   So what we've seen in Canada is,
[01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:02.620]   I would say there's like demographic differences.
[01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:06.060]   Proportionately, when we look at the biggest change in use,
[01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:07.800]   it's actually elderly communities.
[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:11.700]   It's like 55 plus, especially women over 55 tend to be-
[01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:12.540]   - More cannabis use.
[01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:13.360]   - More cannabis use.
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:16.700]   Now granted, their baseline was quite low pre-legalization.
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:18.860]   So if you look at a fold change,
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:21.660]   it looks like a very dramatic increase.
[01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:24.500]   Raw numbers, it's probably not that high,
[01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:27.060]   but I mean, it was like one to 2% or something before,
[01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:28.900]   and now it's gone up to like 8% or something.
[01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:30.980]   So it's a fourfold increase kind of thing.
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:34.020]   So we do see the magnitude of that seems to be the biggest
[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:36.140]   in terms of where the use has come from.
[01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:39.780]   Definitely the young adult population, like 20, 24,
[01:32:39.780 --> 01:32:43.520]   that group has definitely seen increased use as well.
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:45.240]   - Does it split male, female?
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:48.000]   - Historically, cannabis tended to be more male biased.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000]   I'd say the gender separation there
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.600]   has kind of narrowed quite a bit,
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:56.680]   where you do see a lot more females used
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:58.760]   than historically had.
[01:32:58.760 --> 01:32:59.840]   There is a little bit of difference.
[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:02.040]   Females tend to prefer edibles over males.
[01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:05.080]   So males tend to like inhalation over females.
[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:07.400]   So like roots of administration vary a little bit
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:10.260]   based on who someone is.
[01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:14.500]   But yeah, interestingly, we don't have a lot
[01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:17.660]   of actual indication that teenagers have used more.
[01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:20.740]   So like, you know, you look at 14 to 18 year olds,
[01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:23.540]   that has been, now granted our baseline going in
[01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:25.780]   was pretty high as is down here in the States.
[01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:27.580]   I mean, Canada and the States both hover,
[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:29.880]   you look at like grade 12ers and you know,
[01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:31.700]   it's somewhere between 35 and 40% of them
[01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:32.780]   have used cannabis.
[01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:35.660]   Now, I mean, you even have some that are like,
[01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:38.240]   probably around 5% are probably almost daily users.
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:40.600]   So like you do have a pretty high baseline
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:41.680]   to begin with in that group,
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:44.920]   but that has remained relatively unchanged.
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:46.880]   If anything, some of the States when they legalized
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:49.580]   saw slight dips in teenage use of cannabis.
[01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:53.520]   So I think like that's obviously an important demographic
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:54.480]   to have tracked.
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:57.080]   This was one of the concerns with legalization
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:59.160]   was you'd prove, you know, increase access.
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:01.460]   Teenagers would get it from their parents and whatnot,
[01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:03.440]   or had just, you know, other siblings and stuff.
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:06.760]   And so you'd get this big boost in consumption,
[01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:08.920]   but we don't seem to see that in terms of raw numbers
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:10.320]   of teenagers who are using cannabis.
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:11.720]   So that's good.
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:12.820]   ER visits.
[01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:16.660]   So we did an interesting rollout in Canada.
[01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:20.380]   We legalized flour for a year before edibles came online.
[01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:22.500]   So we have kind of a before and after.
[01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:26.320]   Once edibles became available,
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:28.680]   there was a notable increase
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:33.240]   in unintentional pediatric consumption
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:36.080]   that resulted in ER visits because kids would, you know,
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:38.200]   a lot of these look like gummies and candies.
[01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:40.040]   People are buying them, not, you know,
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:41.600]   storing them properly.
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:43.120]   Kids would find them and eat them
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:46.440]   and like become very intoxicated.
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:49.520]   - I want to make mention of something along those lines.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:52.520]   I actually know somebody whose child
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:58.200]   accidentally ate THC containing gummies.
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:00.160]   Fortunately, the child was fine,
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:02.560]   but there are actually pretty serious
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:03.940]   ramifications for this.
[01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:07.680]   The parents actually are quite susceptible
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:11.520]   to legal action if this happens, right?
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:13.680]   So this is something to like really keep in mind.
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:16.160]   I mean, there are a million other health-related reasons
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:17.560]   why this is probably-
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.440]   - I don't know if that's true in Canada the same way,
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:20.320]   but in the States, yeah.
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:24.000]   - Yeah, like if your kid gets into a stash
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.960]   of THC containing gummies and ends up in the emergency room,
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:29.240]   there will also be, most likely,
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:32.080]   there'll be a police visit to that emergency room also,
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:34.560]   and it doesn't bode well for the parents.
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:35.880]   It's a very serious issue.
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:37.380]   And again, this was highlighted to me
[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:41.000]   by someone that I know who didn't anticipate any of this,
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.320]   but, you know, kids are good at finding candy.
[01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:44.880]   And if that candy contains THC
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:47.280]   and they end up in the emergency room, serious issues.
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:49.080]   Nonetheless, if your kid is acting strange
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:51.520]   'cause you think they ingested THC containing anything,
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:53.120]   take them to the emergency room anyway.
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:54.440]   - Well, so this was one of the things
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:58.440]   that also was influenced by legalization is in Canada,
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:01.640]   like some of the increase in the ER visits
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:04.760]   was because of the shift in legalization
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:06.280]   and the change in policy.
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:10.740]   And so, you know, if your kid ends up drunk underage,
[01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:12.280]   it's not the same ramifications
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:14.720]   as if your kid used an illegal substance underage.
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:17.640]   And so people are, once cannabis was legal,
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:21.220]   people were more likely to actually go into the ER
[01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:23.580]   because the consequences were different.
[01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:24.420]   - I see.
[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:27.000]   - And so, sure, some of this is availability,
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.920]   and some of it is just like, okay,
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:32.000]   I'm not as concerned now about something happening
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.220]   because I've taken my kid in.
[01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:34.060]   Like, I'm not gonna have my kid
[01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:35.320]   taken away from me or whatnot.
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:37.600]   So there is, I mean, both those factors,
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:38.560]   I think, have contributed to it,
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:41.200]   but we definitely see the majority,
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:42.920]   at least, of kids ending up in the ER
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:44.240]   is almost all based on edibles.
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:48.360]   That's, I can't imagine a situation
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:50.040]   where that would happen from inhalation.
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:51.440]   It would be very rare if it would.
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:53.840]   It's almost always edibles 'cause kids find them.
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:56.720]   - So as long as we're talking about edibles,
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:58.280]   is there any fundamental difference
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:02.320]   between the dose regulation that you talked about earlier
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:06.000]   of inhalants versus, excuse me, versus edibles?
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000]   Meaning earlier you said that even if it's high THC
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.660]   containing cannabis, people will self-regulate
[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:12.500]   to achieve the same,
[01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:14.640]   approximately the same blood concentrations.
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:17.280]   But with edibles, I imagine you eat half a cookie,
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:18.160]   a quarter of a cookie,
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:20.680]   and you can end up in a vastly different place
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:21.520]   than you expected.
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:25.680]   - So edibles, so this throws a wrench in the whole system.
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:28.760]   And I'll say this in the context of blood levels
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:30.960]   and then what that means from a regulatory capacity as well
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:32.240]   because of the impact this has.
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:37.240]   So edibles are very low doses for the most part.
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:38.960]   I mean, in Canada, at least,
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:40.840]   you cannot buy a pack of edibles.
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:42.140]   And I think this law might be changing,
[01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:43.760]   at least when they first brought it in,
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:46.200]   no pack could have more than 10 milligrams of THC in it.
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:49.520]   So that either meant one 10 mg gummy or two 5 mg gummies
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:52.600]   or four 2.5 mg gummies, you get it.
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.160]   So you couldn't, in one package,
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:55.760]   have more than 10 milligrams of THC.
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:59.960]   Now for people who are, I would say,
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:02.200]   relatively naive to cannabis or THC,
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:04.540]   even people who might use it intermittently,
[01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:07.640]   most people will feel five milligrams.
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:10.880]   Like they'll feel some form of intoxication.
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:13.280]   Some will even feel it at 2.5 mg.
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:15.120]   Most people will feel it at five.
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:17.520]   Virtually everyone will feel it at 10.
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:20.640]   Now, if you look at the blood levels these produce,
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:22.160]   we're now talking blood levels
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:24.000]   of two to five nanograms per mil.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.200]   So folds lower than what you get from inhalation.
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:28.040]   - Right, before you said 100.
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:30.680]   - Yeah, so this is dramatically lower.
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:34.520]   And so also the time course of this
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:35.640]   is fundamentally different.
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:40.560]   So in oral consumption, you're looking at a minimum
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:44.280]   of 30 to 45 minutes for onset of intoxication.
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:46.840]   For some people, up to 90 minutes after they've eaten.
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:49.720]   Now, this is also the reason why
[01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:52.000]   the majority of adverse events that happen with cannabis
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.240]   happen with edibles, because people don't understand this.
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:56.880]   And so they eat a cookie or a gummy.
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:38:58.640]   They wait half an hour, like I'm not feeling anything.
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:38:59.800]   I clearly didn't take enough.
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:01.480]   And then they'll double their dose.
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:03.760]   And then like 15 minutes later, it starts hitting them.
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:05.480]   And then like once it fully kicks in,
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:07.320]   it's just like a steamroller.
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:08.160]   - I've heard of this happening.
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:09.680]   - Yeah, I mean, there was that New York,
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:10.680]   I think it was Maureen Dowder,
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:13.560]   someone went down to Colorado and she ate like
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:16.160]   an insane amount of THC in a chocolate bar,
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:17.960]   something like 50 or 100 milligrams,
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:21.020]   and spent like the weekend on the floor of a hotel room
[01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:22.880]   being like, this was the most aversive experience.
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:24.480]   Why would anyone do this?
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:26.600]   And again, I think people just don't understand
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:27.520]   the dosing around this.
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:29.080]   And so this is one of the things we're trying to do
[01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:30.400]   in Canada, and that was create this idea
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:32.640]   of standardized dosing units, so that people have an,
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:34.520]   like we do with alcohol, where we say,
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:36.480]   one beer is the equivalent to one glass of wine
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:38.560]   versus like a shot of tequila or something,
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:41.620]   so that there's some comparator that people understand
[01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:44.480]   how many drinks are, you say two drinks you do,
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:45.320]   you're going to hit legal limit kind of thing.
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:46.640]   - Yeah, it seems very important.
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:49.320]   - Yeah, and so this is very difficult to do with cannabis
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:51.940]   because the dosing with oral consumption
[01:39:51.940 --> 01:39:55.100]   is just a different ball game than it is with inhalation.
[01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:57.620]   But what happens with oral consumption is like,
[01:39:57.620 --> 01:40:00.900]   it kind of very slowly leaks out of the GI tract.
[01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:03.580]   And it also goes through first pass metabolism in the liver.
[01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:05.700]   And what happens there is you get a metabolite
[01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:10.700]   called 11-hydroxy-THC, which seems to be a bit more potent
[01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:12.840]   than THC is in terms of its ability
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:13.820]   to activate the receptor.
[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:17.980]   So, and its efficacy at least at driving a response
[01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:20.080]   through CB1 receptors seems to be higher
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:22.720]   than what you would get with just the parent molecule
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:24.000]   of THC itself.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:29.600]   And so, and it seems to accumulate a lot more as well.
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:33.320]   So at any given time, you know, you've got THC
[01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:35.040]   kind of leaking out of the gut, going through the liver,
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:38.540]   making 11-hydroxy, and it progressively accumulates
[01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:39.380]   in the brain.
[01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:41.400]   And that's one of the reasons why it takes, you know,
[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:43.240]   45 to 90 minutes to kick in.
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:46.200]   But then the high itself also lasts like six hours,
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:48.500]   four to six, sometimes eight, depending on the person,
[01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:49.620]   what they've eaten.
[01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:52.840]   Versus inhalation is just this like spike.
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:54.300]   So you get this very rapid,
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:56.220]   'cause it goes right through the lungs into the blood,
[01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:58.100]   goes into the brain, but it also clears out.
[01:40:58.100 --> 01:41:00.980]   And so, yeah, people will start feeling intoxicated
[01:41:00.980 --> 01:41:02.420]   two to five minutes.
[01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:05.460]   The peak high is like 15 to 30 minutes
[01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:06.660]   maybe from consumption,
[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:08.300]   and then they'll start to come back down.
[01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:11.400]   And you will still see some indications of intoxication
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:13.300]   that can go on for three to four hours,
[01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:15.900]   but the bulk of the intoxication from inhalation
[01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:18.720]   is done by two hours for the most part.
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:21.560]   - As long as we're on the topic of time course,
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:23.720]   you know, based on what I was able to find,
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:28.280]   I believed, and tell me if I was wrong,
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:30.160]   that cannabis can stay in one system
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:31.480]   for as long as 80 days.
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:34.000]   The reason I brought this up previously
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.640]   was there are a number of people who have used cannabis
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:38.240]   are going to take a drug test
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:41.040]   and want to know how fast it can clear from their system.
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:45.600]   But based on conversations we had offline,
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:48.900]   sounds like that 80 days might be a bit too long.
[01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:51.380]   - I mean, you could still fail a drug test at 80 days.
[01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:53.100]   I would say, I feel like,
[01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:54.980]   I think the way it was worded more was like that,
[01:41:54.980 --> 01:41:56.360]   you made it sound like that was the standard.
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:58.100]   I wouldn't say that was the standard at all.
[01:41:58.100 --> 01:42:01.700]   I would say for the majority of people,
[01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:05.700]   30 days probably after that, they would not pass
[01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:07.340]   or they would be able to pass a drug test.
[01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:08.660]   - So abstinence for 30 days.
[01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:10.460]   - Yeah, after abstaining for 30 days.
[01:42:10.460 --> 01:42:12.060]   And it's going to be highly variable
[01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:13.940]   depending on how much you consume.
[01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:15.180]   I mean, if you're talking about someone
[01:42:15.180 --> 01:42:16.460]   who's used it once,
[01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:18.640]   I don't imagine it would be in your system that long.
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:19.900]   That'd be surprising.
[01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:23.660]   The thing is THC is a lipophilic molecule.
[01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:24.500]   - It's fat soluble.
[01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:25.340]   - Yeah, so it's fat soluble.
[01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:27.540]   It likes to store, it doesn't like the blood.
[01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:29.220]   The blood is aqueous and watery.
[01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:30.060]   It likes fat.
[01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:32.420]   So it goes into the brain, it goes into the fat
[01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:33.860]   and it kind of resides there.
[01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:38.860]   And it can essentially kind of slowly leak back as it,
[01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:44.020]   as THC concentrations in the blood would reduce,
[01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:46.440]   THC that's in the fat will start kind of leaking back
[01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:47.620]   into the blood still.
[01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:51.760]   So detectably you will still have THC for quite some time.
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:52.660]   I mean, some of this, again,
[01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:54.580]   it's gonna be dependent on how much cannabis someone's used,
[01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:56.380]   how much THC they've consumed,
[01:42:56.380 --> 01:42:58.500]   how long it's been in their system for.
[01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:01.220]   I would have thought this was gonna be somewhat reflective
[01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:03.040]   of people's body fat content.
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:04.540]   Although talking to colleagues who do this,
[01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:06.580]   they say not always.
[01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:10.140]   But we do know, you know,
[01:43:10.140 --> 01:43:12.840]   certain things like exercise, for example,
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:14.180]   anything that's gonna trigger adrenaline,
[01:43:14.180 --> 01:43:15.620]   'cause adrenaline is lipolytic.
[01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:19.020]   So adrenaline causes fat to metabolize
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:20.220]   and release stuff that's inside it.
[01:43:20.220 --> 01:43:22.820]   So there are plenty of cases I've heard from people
[01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:25.580]   where they were testing themselves and were negative
[01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:27.860]   and then went for a run or went to the gym
[01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:29.620]   and then tested positive.
[01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:30.820]   - Or lost weight.
[01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:32.040]   - Yeah, or they've lost weight.
[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:36.940]   And anything that's gonna cause the lipolysis to occur
[01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:39.200]   so that it releases that THC,
[01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:42.880]   you can certainly all of a sudden test positive again
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:44.980]   when someone had tested negative previously,
[01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:46.040]   just because of the fact
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:47.880]   that there still is some in the fat.
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:49.360]   And so this is where something like,
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:50.960]   and this is what I mean by standardization
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:52.760]   of regulatory issues become very complicated,
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:55.600]   was I remember right when legalization happened in Canada,
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:58.220]   all these kind of chemists were like talking to me
[01:43:58.220 --> 01:44:00.620]   about they're gonna create like a breathalyzer for cannabis
[01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:02.920]   because this way they'll be able to do roadside detection
[01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:05.240]   the same way they could do with alcohol.
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:07.100]   And I kept trying to say to them, I'm like,
[01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:10.520]   the rate limiting step here is not the science
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:12.760]   of detection thresholds.
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:15.960]   It's the biology of how the body processes cannabis.
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:18.000]   And you're never gonna get a test that works
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.520]   because you can take someone who has eaten an edible
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:23.600]   and is profoundly intoxicated
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:27.320]   and they will have possibly under five nanograms per mil
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:28.920]   of THC in their blood.
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:31.100]   - But you're talking about this metabolite
[01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:33.220]   that can come from the edibles
[01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:34.440]   that doesn't come from inhalants
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:35.280]   that can have a much more potent effect.
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:36.160]   - You get a bit of it from inhalant,
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:38.340]   but not nearly as much as you get from edibles.
[01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:39.180]   - So it's a different,
[01:44:39.180 --> 01:44:40.980]   it's sort of a different situation altogether.
[01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:42.500]   - It is, but it's also the timeline
[01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:44.580]   because of the fact that with inhalation,
[01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:47.420]   it's like a bolus that hits you at once.
[01:44:47.420 --> 01:44:48.920]   You get a high blood level.
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:52.380]   With edibles, it's like the time course.
[01:44:52.380 --> 01:44:54.900]   So, I mean, it's gonna be like five nanograms per mil,
[01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:57.660]   let's say, but it would be like that for a long time.
[01:44:57.660 --> 01:44:59.580]   Whereas the a hundred nanogram per mil from smoking
[01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:02.180]   is like for 20 minutes and then it starts dropping.
[01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:06.160]   So, but the problem is with the way that you detect it
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:09.320]   is you can take someone who's a chronic cannabis user
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:12.680]   and is completely sober and hasn't consumed in a day or two,
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:15.400]   and their basal levels of THC in their blood
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:16.880]   may be higher than someone
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:19.040]   who's profoundly intoxicated by an edible.
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:20.680]   Just by the sheer nature of the fact
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:23.200]   that it would reside in their fat tissue or their brain,
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:24.560]   it would leak back into the blood.
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:28.720]   And so you have this issue where,
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:30.760]   let's say your cutoff was five nanograms per mil,
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:32.900]   which is for some of the stuff detection thresholds
[01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:34.380]   would hover around that area.
[01:45:34.380 --> 01:45:37.820]   So you can have someone who's dead sober that tests positive
[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:40.660]   and someone who's profoundly intoxicated who tests negative.
[01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:42.700]   So it's like, what's the value in this?
[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:44.220]   It's not telling us anything.
[01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:46.180]   - Well, I guess it sounds like the drug tests
[01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:48.300]   either have to be revised or discarded.
[01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:50.620]   And it also sounds like if somebody is going to take
[01:45:50.620 --> 01:45:53.580]   a drug test for cannabis and they have used cannabis
[01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:57.540]   in any form in the previous 90 days, let's say,
[01:45:57.540 --> 01:46:00.220]   going for a run right before your test
[01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:03.800]   is going to liberate whatever the THC resides
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:04.640]   in the fat stores.
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:05.460]   - Potentially, yeah.
[01:46:05.460 --> 01:46:06.300]   So I mean, it is complicated.
[01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:08.260]   - A lot of people are writing this down.
[01:46:08.260 --> 01:46:11.980]   Along the lines of what's known and not known,
[01:46:11.980 --> 01:46:14.180]   I'm curious what is known and not known
[01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:19.180]   about the effects of cannabis THC in particular on hormones.
[01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:24.600]   I've seen studies that cite increases in testosterone
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:25.720]   from cannabis use.
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:29.040]   I've seen studies that cite increases in estrogen
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:31.920]   from cannabis use, and they argue for increased
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:34.440]   aromatization of testosterone into estrogen
[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:35.840]   as the mechanism.
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:39.640]   I've also seen studies that say the exact opposite.
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:43.680]   So is there any global takeaway message yet,
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:46.840]   or is it just highly variable or depends too much on dose
[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:49.160]   and individual age, et cetera, that we just really can't-
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:54.160]   - I would say there's nothing that's super clean cut.
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:55.680]   I mean, I know in the previous podcast,
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:57.480]   you talked about a prolactin thing.
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:59.640]   - Right, well, there's, and this is where I think
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:02.360]   it's important that people understand that,
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:05.040]   on this podcast, we cover science and studies,
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:07.560]   but we also pull from common experience
[01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:10.320]   that people want explained if we can.
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:13.280]   And one of the experiences that is talked about a lot
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:15.840]   in certain, let's just say online communities,
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:18.880]   is the experience of people who had no preexisting
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:21.360]   gynecomastia, male breast development,
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:25.280]   will smoke marijuana, do we call it marijuana these days?
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:26.620]   - We'll go with cannabis.
[01:47:26.620 --> 01:47:29.920]   I actually got someone, I got a lot of comments
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:31.880]   that said marijuana is an inappropriate term.
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:34.560]   Okay, smoke, we'll go back to that.
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:35.560]   That was new to me, I didn't know,
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:36.400]   so forgive me if I didn't know.
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:37.680]   - No, no, no, I mean, I understand it,
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:38.680]   but yeah, a lot of people don't know that.
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:42.520]   - Okay, so will smoke cannabis and experience gynecomastia,
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:45.880]   or in females, so males and females both have breast tissue,
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:50.380]   but in males, it's typically, it's not hypertrophied,
[01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:53.400]   but they'll smoke cannabis and get gynecomastia,
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:55.620]   growth of the male breast tissue.
[01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:57.260]   That's sometimes reversible, sometimes not,
[01:47:57.260 --> 01:47:59.300]   presumably through the aromatization of testosterone
[01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:01.280]   into estrogen, which then acts on the tissue,
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:05.280]   makes it grow, as well as reports of breast tissue
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:08.680]   tenderness after cannabis use in females.
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:11.960]   So that was sort of the origin of that discussion
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:16.620]   around does cannabis impact aromatization
[01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:17.960]   of testosterone into estrogen,
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:19.760]   and you can find a little bit of evidence for that,
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:21.520]   but you can also find evidence to the contrary
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:22.720]   in the scientific literature.
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:23.560]   So I'm just curious your thoughts on this.
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:24.600]   - It's super mixed, so I mean,
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:26.920]   you're talking about something like prolactin, for example,
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:28.840]   that is another one that's obviously involved
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:31.320]   in this whole cascade stuff.
[01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:34.080]   Generally, I would say the bulk of the literature
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:36.700]   actually says that cannabis would suppress prolactin,
[01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:37.540]   not increase it.
[01:48:37.540 --> 01:48:39.000]   That's the majority of the literature that's out there.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.920]   - Interesting, because dopamine is one of the main ways
[01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:43.840]   that prolactin is suppressed, they're kind of in a seesaw,
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:46.120]   they work in somewhat seesaw fashion.
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:48.120]   - And it probably, I mean, the rodent work would suggest
[01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:50.160]   it's through dopamine that's turning off prolactin,
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:52.160]   because you can reverse some of these effects
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:53.560]   by playing with dopamine signaling.
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:55.880]   So I don't doubt that's the mechanism.
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:58.440]   So typically, I would say more often,
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:00.720]   I mean, there's studies with inhalation and IV
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:03.840]   that have generally found reduced prolactin,
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:05.420]   and in chronic cannabis users,
[01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:08.360]   they find somewhat lower resting states of prolactin.
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:10.600]   That's been found in one study that came out of Yale.
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:11.680]   - Interesting.
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:14.040]   - Testosterone gets a little bit more complicated,
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:17.920]   because there are a lot of studies that find,
[01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:21.720]   A, to begin with, cannabis users may have higher levels
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:24.000]   of testosterone just at rest.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.160]   Now, whether that's a pre-existing thing--
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:26.840]   - Is there any reason to think that would be the case?
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:29.000]   - I don't know.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.960]   Yeah, I mean, that being said, a lot of the stuff,
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:34.320]   now, granted, this was mostly done in the '70s,
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:37.820]   and this is from my previous life,
[01:49:37.820 --> 01:49:39.920]   because my undergrad and graduate supervisor,
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:42.400]   he was a neuroendocrinologist who focused much more
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:44.400]   on sex hormones and reproductive hormones.
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:45.800]   So we've written a few reviews,
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:48.240]   so I've done reviews on this area,
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:50.520]   and I know the literature somewhat.
[01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:53.040]   It's mixed, but generally, from the '70s studies,
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:55.800]   what they would often see is that if they
[01:49:55.800 --> 01:50:00.400]   would serially look at testosterone after someone consumed,
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:01.680]   they would have little dips.
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:03.720]   Like, that wasn't uncommon for them to find it.
[01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:05.120]   Not every study found it.
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:09.880]   That being said, the kind of range that testosterone stayed
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:11.680]   in was always the normative range.
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:13.740]   Like, it was never that it went so low
[01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:15.840]   that someone would have classified as being hypogonadal
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:18.880]   or would lead to something like gynecomastia,
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:20.800]   at least from a testosterone deficiency side
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:23.660]   in terms of the balance between testosterone and estradiol.
[01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:28.080]   I don't know as much about the aromatization side of it.
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:29.920]   Again, I'd say it's pretty mixed.
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:33.760]   I mean, I don't think the gynecomastia stuff is,
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:36.240]   I mean, certainly people online might be talking about it,
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:37.680]   and there might be some other components to this.
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:40.680]   I've also heard, and again, this isn't like science.
[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:42.600]   This is just the same kind of stuff you see
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:44.800]   on random internet communities, people talking about,
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:46.480]   oh, well, you know, it has plant estrogens,
[01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:47.680]   so maybe they're subbing in
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:49.080]   and having estrogenic effects.
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:50.840]   I don't know how valid any of this is.
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:52.120]   - Yeah, it seems a bit, I mean,
[01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:54.720]   there are phytoestrogens in tons of different plants.
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:58.200]   The sort of attacks on soy and the attacks on,
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:00.840]   this I think grew out of the kind of the soy
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:04.180]   versus meat communities and plant-based versus carnivore.
[01:51:04.180 --> 01:51:06.280]   This podcast has always been agnostic
[01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:09.000]   with respect to nutrition and is really,
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:12.200]   if we encourage anything, it's that people consume
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:15.160]   unprocessed and minimally processed foods.
[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:16.600]   As the bulk of their food intake,
[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:17.920]   there seems to be enough data on that,
[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:19.560]   but whether or not people choose to be vegan
[01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:23.240]   and eat a lot of plants or carnivore and eat just meat,
[01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:25.040]   we've essentially stepped out of that debate
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:28.140]   because let's just say it's as futile
[01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:31.120]   as about any other debate.
[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:33.120]   You're just never gonna, it's completely circular.
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:34.840]   You end up right back in Twitter.
[01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:36.560]   - Yeah, and I think that, I mean,
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:38.520]   when it comes to something like this,
[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:40.320]   I've not seen any compelling evidence for it.
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:42.240]   So I can't, I certainly wouldn't say
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:45.400]   that it's a typical side effect that men would experience
[01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:47.600]   is like developing breast tissue in response to cannabis.
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:49.080]   I feel like if that was the case,
[01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:51.760]   it would be very known in the scientific community
[01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:53.000]   as something that comes out.
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:58.000]   - So this seems to be something that purportedly occurs
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.800]   on a backdrop of elevated androgens,
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:03.900]   meaning in puberty or a backdrop
[01:52:03.900 --> 01:52:06.920]   of some other form of androgen increase.
[01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:08.120]   - Like someone who's on steroids or something.
[01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:09.880]   - Yeah, but that's not the community I'm referring to.
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:13.240]   It seems that because transient gynecomastia
[01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:15.580]   during puberty is actually fairly common
[01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:17.960]   because of there's just so much androgen being produced
[01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:19.720]   in puberty that some gets aromatized.
[01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:22.880]   And that the idea, I'm not stating this as fact,
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:24.640]   is that it may exacerbate that.
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:26.280]   In any case, it sounds like the takeaway from this
[01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:29.320]   is that there aren't a lot of conclusive studies
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:31.400]   about the effects of cannabis on testosterone
[01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:34.320]   or estrogen or aromatization in any direction.
[01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:36.680]   - I don't, I mean, I'd say like,
[01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:39.320]   yeah, enough studies to suggest
[01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:41.700]   that you might see transient drops in testosterone
[01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:44.600]   from cannabis, and it seems to be relatively short-lived.
[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:47.800]   It doesn't seem to, but again,
[01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:49.400]   a lot of these studies also find
[01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:51.240]   that the basal testosterone is already
[01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:52.280]   kind of high to begin with.
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:54.160]   So you're staying in a normal dynamic range.
[01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:55.480]   - There it is again, it's homeostatic,
[01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:57.600]   just like the endocannabinoids.
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:52:58.600]   - Yeah, so, and that's the thing.
[01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:01.380]   I mean, testosterone fluctuates across the day anyway.
[01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:02.220]   So there's already, I mean,
[01:53:02.220 --> 01:53:03.360]   there's other things that fluctuate.
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:05.280]   It's like cortisol, all these hormones have cycles.
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:07.960]   So as long as you're in this normal range,
[01:53:07.960 --> 01:53:11.300]   there really shouldn't be any kind of like behavioral,
[01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:14.320]   like in terms of sex drive for testosterone
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:18.760]   or like physiological, like gynecomastia or some change in,
[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:20.960]   I mean, now there are potentially effects of THC
[01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:23.440]   directly on the testes that could affect sperm.
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:26.760]   That could happen independent of changes in testosterone.
[01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:28.120]   - Are those positive or negative changes?
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:31.080]   I'm assuming that the studies you're referring to
[01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:34.700]   saw disrupted what they call sperm quality,
[01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:36.440]   which has to do with motility, et cetera.
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:39.400]   - Yeah, I mean, a lot of the kind of in vitro stuff
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:40.580]   definitely would suggest that.
[01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:42.360]   Some of the animal stuff as well.
[01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:44.160]   The human stuff is definitely a bit mixed.
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:46.240]   I mean, but again, if anything, it would be like,
[01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:48.160]   yeah, it could have some effect on sperm.
[01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:49.000]   So I have like-
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.600]   - As we say this, I'm just chuckling to myself
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:53.240]   'cause anytime this conversation comes up
[01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:57.400]   about a substance and sperm quality or egg quality,
[01:53:57.400 --> 01:53:59.800]   I always get a barrage of comments of people telling me
[01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:02.200]   how many children they conceived while under the influence.
[01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:04.800]   No one is saying that you're going to be infertile,
[01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:08.000]   but if people are having challenges conceiving,
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.920]   it might be something to think about.
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:11.540]   - I would say that, I would agree on that.
[01:54:11.540 --> 01:54:14.460]   So I would say if someone was asking me this
[01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:16.620]   and they were trying to get pregnant and struggling,
[01:54:16.620 --> 01:54:18.560]   I would say, well, definitely cut cannabis
[01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:21.900]   because some people may be more impacted by it than others.
[01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:24.380]   So for some, you know, various biological reasons
[01:54:24.380 --> 01:54:26.260]   that we don't have a biomarker for,
[01:54:26.260 --> 01:54:27.860]   there may be some men that use cannabis
[01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:29.780]   and it has a profound effect on their sperm quality
[01:54:29.780 --> 01:54:30.860]   or their sperm capacitance,
[01:54:30.860 --> 01:54:33.060]   their ability to maintain fertility.
[01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:34.580]   And for the bulk majority of men,
[01:54:34.580 --> 01:54:35.860]   I'd say it's probably not the case.
[01:54:35.860 --> 01:54:38.240]   But again, if you're someone who is struggling
[01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:40.700]   and you use cannabis, male or female,
[01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:42.140]   I would say cut that out
[01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:44.180]   and see if that has an effect for you.
[01:54:44.180 --> 01:54:45.420]   - Along those lines,
[01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:48.460]   I saw kind of a jaw dropping statistic
[01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:52.740]   and I'm not sure I still believe it,
[01:54:52.740 --> 01:54:55.620]   but you tell me what you know about this,
[01:54:55.620 --> 01:55:00.620]   which is that up to 15% of pregnant women in the US
[01:55:00.620 --> 01:55:03.280]   have used cannabis during pregnancy.
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:06.780]   That just seems, that number just seems too high
[01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:08.860]   and yet, you know, it exists out there.
[01:55:08.860 --> 01:55:09.700]   - Yeah, it's very, I mean,
[01:55:09.700 --> 01:55:11.080]   I've heard higher numbers than that.
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:11.920]   - In the research literature.
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:12.740]   - No, I've heard higher numbers than that as well.
[01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:13.580]   - Okay, so I'm on the low end of this.
[01:55:13.580 --> 01:55:15.700]   - No, I mean, so I've heard as low as two
[01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:17.380]   and I've heard as high as 20.
[01:55:17.380 --> 01:55:21.300]   - Okay, two sounds like, okay, that I could imagine,
[01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:23.740]   but as high as 20.
[01:55:23.740 --> 01:55:25.580]   And do we know what the effects
[01:55:25.580 --> 01:55:27.380]   on the developing fetus are?
[01:55:27.380 --> 01:55:28.980]   - There's a lot to unpack there.
[01:55:28.980 --> 01:55:32.180]   So first thing, going back to the levels,
[01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:35.360]   that's challenging because again, this depends on,
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:36.600]   are you talking about self-report
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:38.620]   or are you talking about verified blood levels?
[01:55:38.620 --> 01:55:39.780]   'Cause those have varied.
[01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:41.140]   So some of the higher numbers
[01:55:41.140 --> 01:55:42.660]   actually come from blood levels
[01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:45.380]   where they've taken blood samples and found THC,
[01:55:45.380 --> 01:55:47.900]   but the women have reported not using cannabis.
[01:55:47.900 --> 01:55:51.180]   And so the idea that it's like the self-report numbers
[01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:52.300]   tend to come in around two or three.
[01:55:52.300 --> 01:55:53.800]   My guess is the real number
[01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:55.380]   is probably somewhere around 10%,
[01:55:55.380 --> 01:55:57.220]   but that also is gonna vary
[01:55:57.220 --> 01:55:58.260]   depending on what you're talking about
[01:55:58.260 --> 01:56:01.240]   because there are a proportion of people
[01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:04.060]   who are using cannabis and become pregnant
[01:56:04.060 --> 01:56:05.540]   and are unaware they're pregnant
[01:56:05.540 --> 01:56:06.980]   and are still using cannabis.
[01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:09.460]   And that would still qualify
[01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:11.300]   under the way that it's defined
[01:56:11.300 --> 01:56:13.820]   that someone used cannabis while pregnant.
[01:56:13.820 --> 01:56:17.180]   So the majority, I would say the overwhelming majority
[01:56:17.180 --> 01:56:19.020]   of people, once they learn they're pregnant,
[01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:20.500]   now that can be all the way up
[01:56:20.500 --> 01:56:22.720]   to almost the end of the first trimester,
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:24.820]   typically stop using cannabis.
[01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:27.380]   That seems to be the norm, I would say.
[01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:28.300]   - Important point there.
[01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:31.420]   - Yeah, and I think also the number that carry on
[01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:33.540]   through the entire gestational period
[01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:35.980]   is gonna be a lot less, I would guess.
[01:56:35.980 --> 01:56:38.940]   Now, the motivations for this quite often
[01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:42.740]   are more in the capacity of the kind of anti-nauseant
[01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:46.260]   qualities that cannabis can have for some people
[01:56:46.260 --> 01:56:48.780]   and for women struggling with morning sickness.
[01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:51.380]   Now, anecdotally, I have heard women say,
[01:56:51.380 --> 01:56:54.560]   with the history of things like thalidomide
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:56.580]   and other anti-nauseant drugs
[01:56:56.580 --> 01:56:59.700]   that had profound traitogenic effects on the fetuses,
[01:56:59.700 --> 01:57:02.820]   women have said that they would rather use cannabis
[01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:04.380]   than one of these other compounds
[01:57:04.380 --> 01:57:06.860]   because they're less concerned about the impacts of cannabis
[01:57:06.860 --> 01:57:10.920]   than they are because of the thalidomide effects
[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:11.760]   that happened.
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:14.820]   - Thalidomide effects are malformation of the limbs
[01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:17.420]   and other bodily structures in fetuses.
[01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:19.560]   It was an absolute tragedy of medicine
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:23.940]   that this occurred in even one birth.
[01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:27.260]   But yeah, it's the reason why thalidomide is now,
[01:57:27.260 --> 01:57:30.660]   I believe, banned as a drug for use during pregnancy.
[01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:32.340]   - Yeah, I actually have no idea,
[01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:33.740]   but I would imagine.
[01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:35.700]   I think it would be one of those hard things to sell,
[01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:37.340]   given its history, especially.
[01:57:37.340 --> 01:57:41.520]   But so I think there's a reticence of a lot of people
[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:44.580]   to consider using pharmaceuticals to regulate nausea
[01:57:44.580 --> 01:57:47.140]   because they're uncertain of the consequences of it.
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:50.300]   And they feel that cannabis may be safer.
[01:57:50.300 --> 01:57:54.540]   Now, that in and of itself could present some problems
[01:57:54.540 --> 01:57:56.120]   in terms of that thought process.
[01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:59.140]   Now, there was also a study that I thought was like,
[01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:02.980]   some of these things just frustrate you.
[01:58:02.980 --> 01:58:05.500]   It's where they actually decided to call,
[01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:06.460]   this was done in Colorado,
[01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:09.020]   where they called dispensaries and just acted naive
[01:58:09.020 --> 01:58:10.860]   and asked what their recommendations were.
[01:58:10.860 --> 01:58:13.140]   And it was something like 80 to 85% of them
[01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:16.420]   were actually recommending that people would use cannabis
[01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:18.020]   to manage morning sickness.
[01:58:18.020 --> 01:58:19.340]   And I thought that was like,
[01:58:19.340 --> 01:58:20.900]   it's just one of these disappointing things
[01:58:20.900 --> 01:58:24.060]   where you're like, why are you being so wildly irresponsible
[01:58:24.060 --> 01:58:25.460]   to kind of promote these things?
[01:58:25.460 --> 01:58:26.300]   And this is-
[01:58:26.300 --> 01:58:27.320]   - You're talking about the irresponsible
[01:58:27.320 --> 01:58:28.700]   that the dispensaries would say that?
[01:58:28.700 --> 01:58:29.540]   - Yeah.
[01:58:29.540 --> 01:58:30.380]   - It's irresponsible that the study
[01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:31.300]   was carried out that way,
[01:58:31.300 --> 01:58:33.500]   because it's a little bit of-
[01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:34.540]   - Entrapment.
[01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:35.980]   - You said it, not me.
[01:58:35.980 --> 01:58:36.820]   - Could be.
[01:58:36.820 --> 01:58:40.140]   I mean, you can balk at either side of this.
[01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:45.140]   I think it's, I mean, I have a lot of frustration
[01:58:45.140 --> 01:58:47.260]   in general with the information
[01:58:47.260 --> 01:58:49.100]   that bud tenders put out into the world.
[01:58:49.100 --> 01:58:49.940]   - Is that what they're called, bud tenders?
[01:58:49.940 --> 01:58:50.760]   - Yeah, bud tenders.
[01:58:50.760 --> 01:58:52.140]   That's kind of the colloquial term
[01:58:52.140 --> 01:58:54.020]   that people will use for someone who sells cannabis
[01:58:54.020 --> 01:58:55.620]   at a dispensary, which is in Canada.
[01:58:55.620 --> 01:58:58.520]   And I've heard this throughout the States as well.
[01:58:58.520 --> 01:59:01.500]   I personally have been a huge advocate
[01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:03.140]   for the fact that I think,
[01:59:03.140 --> 01:59:06.560]   so I worked in restaurants and bars and stuff
[01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:07.400]   when I was younger.
[01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:09.980]   And for me to serve alcohol, I had to undergo,
[01:59:09.980 --> 01:59:11.060]   I don't know if you do this in the States.
[01:59:11.060 --> 01:59:12.740]   In Canada, you have to do like a,
[01:59:12.740 --> 01:59:14.140]   it's like a weekend course essentially,
[01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:16.740]   called like serving it right, or some other terminology,
[01:59:16.740 --> 01:59:20.380]   where you learn the basics of alcohol, harms, blah, blah, blah
[01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:21.820]   how to tell if someone's intoxicated,
[01:59:21.820 --> 01:59:22.780]   when you have to cut them off,
[01:59:22.780 --> 01:59:23.820]   all these things that you have to do
[01:59:23.820 --> 01:59:24.900]   to be able to serve alcohol.
[01:59:24.900 --> 01:59:26.820]   I have no idea if this exists in the States,
[01:59:26.820 --> 01:59:29.040]   but it was a thing in Canada.
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:32.600]   - Bartenders in the US put in the comments on YouTube,
[01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:34.400]   do you have to undergo training about alcohol
[01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:35.240]   to be a bartender?
[01:59:35.240 --> 01:59:36.960]   - Like anything, even if it's just like an online quiz.
[01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:41.960]   But like, so I, my perspective is because pre-legalization,
[01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:44.240]   at least in Canada, there was somewhat of,
[01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:45.400]   I think of a misguided thought
[01:59:45.400 --> 01:59:47.040]   that people would leverage their physicians
[01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:48.560]   for knowledge about cannabis.
[01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:50.320]   And what's become very apparent
[01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:52.040]   is that the overwhelming majority of people
[01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:54.320]   talk to the people selling them the cannabis.
[01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:56.180]   And yet those people selling cannabis
[01:59:56.180 --> 01:59:59.940]   don't need to have undergone any form of education.
[01:59:59.940 --> 02:00:01.860]   And so like, this kind of kills me
[02:00:01.860 --> 02:00:04.060]   because we've worked very hard
[02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:05.820]   to try and create educational platforms
[02:00:05.820 --> 02:00:08.580]   that are like agnostic in terms of our position on cannabis
[02:00:08.580 --> 02:00:09.780]   that are just based on the science.
[02:00:09.780 --> 02:00:11.820]   I'm an executive director of an organization
[02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:13.100]   called the Canadian Consortium
[02:00:13.100 --> 02:00:15.180]   for the Investigation of Cannabinoids, the CCIC.
[02:00:15.180 --> 02:00:18.260]   And it's, we've done CME courses for physicians
[02:00:18.260 --> 02:00:19.760]   to try and train them about cannabis,
[02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:20.740]   because I think it's important
[02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:21.780]   that physicians understand this.
[02:00:21.780 --> 02:00:24.020]   But I've tried suggesting that I think
[02:00:24.020 --> 02:00:26.560]   that anyone selling cannabis should undergo
[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:30.180]   a course like this, just so that there's some consensus
[02:00:30.180 --> 02:00:33.420]   in the informed level that someone who comes in,
[02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:34.980]   because a lot of people going to buy cannabis
[02:00:34.980 --> 02:00:35.900]   are quite naive about it.
[02:00:35.900 --> 02:00:38.100]   And they just, I mean, even when we're talking about dosing,
[02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:39.900]   what we've talked about with edibles or smoking
[02:00:39.900 --> 02:00:42.380]   or how people consume it, like,
[02:00:42.380 --> 02:00:44.340]   you need to have a reliable source of information
[02:00:44.340 --> 02:00:46.700]   at the front line that is able to relay that to people.
[02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:48.940]   And it becomes very frustrating to me
[02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:52.460]   that they have become the main source of information
[02:00:52.460 --> 02:00:54.580]   that people go and I'm uncertain
[02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:56.140]   of what their level of training is.
[02:00:56.140 --> 02:00:57.340]   - You're certainly doing your part
[02:00:57.340 --> 02:01:00.460]   to provide the public education about cannabis now.
[02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:02.900]   So we all appreciate your highly informed
[02:01:02.900 --> 02:01:05.340]   and broad distribution of this information.
[02:01:05.340 --> 02:01:08.020]   Because this is also an issue with psychedelics,
[02:01:08.020 --> 02:01:10.740]   which currently don't have legal status in the US.
[02:01:10.740 --> 02:01:13.340]   This is an ongoing process of whether or not it will.
[02:01:13.340 --> 02:01:15.420]   Right now, things are really on the teeter totter
[02:01:15.420 --> 02:01:18.260]   with MDMA, where we await the decision from the FDA,
[02:01:18.260 --> 02:01:22.460]   but the early recommendation to the FDA
[02:01:22.460 --> 02:01:24.940]   was to not approve MDMA as a treatment for PTSD.
[02:01:24.940 --> 02:01:28.740]   That's sort of today and mid to late June, 2024,
[02:01:28.740 --> 02:01:29.780]   we'll see what happens.
[02:01:29.780 --> 02:01:33.260]   But this is also the case for ketamine,
[02:01:33.260 --> 02:01:34.700]   which has legal status,
[02:01:34.700 --> 02:01:36.620]   but many people are accessing ketamine
[02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:38.940]   not through a physician, but through online sources.
[02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:42.220]   So what you're speaking to here is a much larger issue.
[02:01:42.220 --> 02:01:45.180]   And I absolutely agree with you.
[02:01:45.180 --> 02:01:48.420]   I mean, I think most people are probably not aware,
[02:01:48.420 --> 02:01:51.980]   except by experience, positive or negative in some cases,
[02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:54.280]   about the differences in blood concentration
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:55.780]   as it relates to number of tokes
[02:01:55.780 --> 02:01:58.140]   versus concentration versus edible.
[02:01:58.140 --> 02:01:59.860]   I mean, these are critical themes,
[02:01:59.860 --> 02:02:01.260]   especially for where we're gonna go next,
[02:02:01.260 --> 02:02:04.780]   which is all the discussion about high THC and psychosis.
[02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:05.820]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:08.300]   So I think that, I just wish, I mean, again,
[02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:10.180]   even if this was just like an online course
[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:11.180]   that wasn't that much,
[02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:13.920]   but at least had some consensus of information
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:17.240]   that was the basics about how to have conversations.
[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:20.420]   And I mean, some of the, our system, at least,
[02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:22.160]   is somewhat provincially regulated.
[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:24.860]   So like, our organization has worked
[02:02:24.860 --> 02:02:26.420]   with like the Ontario group
[02:02:26.420 --> 02:02:27.980]   that deals with cannabis distribution,
[02:02:27.980 --> 02:02:31.060]   the OCS, which is Ontario Cannabis Stores,
[02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:34.340]   and helped to create some information pamphlets and stuff.
[02:02:34.340 --> 02:02:36.700]   Again, it's not the same as a teaching course,
[02:02:36.700 --> 02:02:39.820]   but at least it's like these little infographic stuff
[02:02:39.820 --> 02:02:42.980]   that kind of like gives people rough breakdowns of things
[02:02:42.980 --> 02:02:45.160]   and kind of gives you a little bit of information
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:46.840]   about dosing and understanding things,
[02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:47.880]   like especially with something like edibles,
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:50.240]   how long you should wait, just stuff like this.
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:51.440]   - It sounds like the take-home message
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:55.140]   is proceed with caution, you know, low and slow.
[02:02:55.140 --> 02:02:56.800]   - I mean, that's the, yeah, the-
[02:02:56.800 --> 02:02:58.600]   - Like don't ingest too much too quickly.
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:02:59.760]   Like really, you know,
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:02.320]   if one is going to explore this legally, of course,
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:06.640]   you know, take a little bit, wait, take a little bit, wait,
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:08.480]   because otherwise you're gonna get the,
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:09.800]   what was the reporter?
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:11.360]   - Oh, I think it was Maureen Dowd, but I-
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:12.200]   - Right, you're gonna-
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:13.520]   - I don't know, actually, when I say that-
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:16.040]   - Is she still on the floor in a Colorado hotel?
[02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:16.880]   - She may have recovered by now.
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:19.180]   - Reporting from the floor in Colorado.
[02:03:19.180 --> 02:03:24.180]   - But like, yeah, it can become very frustrating
[02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:26.480]   at just the kind of lack of understanding
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:27.800]   that exists in this space.
[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:30.460]   And so I think this is one of the reasons why
[02:03:30.460 --> 02:03:32.520]   we've really kind of tried to push the public health side
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:33.760]   of this a lot more.
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:37.040]   And we have, I mean, there was the Center for Addiction
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:38.200]   and Mental Health in Canada,
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:40.800]   which does a lot of the organization of these things.
[02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:42.120]   They did kind of put together
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:43.720]   what I found to be really useful,
[02:03:43.720 --> 02:03:45.440]   which again, could be leveraged in the States.
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:46.560]   These are all accessible online.
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:48.560]   It's called the Lower Risk Cannabis Use Guidelines.
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:50.520]   They kind of tried to create a framework
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:53.800]   that is similar to how people have done stuff with alcohol,
[02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:54.620]   that just kind of goes through,
[02:03:54.620 --> 02:03:56.740]   and a lot of it is this low and slow approach,
[02:03:56.740 --> 02:03:59.520]   but it's like, obviously, you want no risk, you abstain.
[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:01.120]   If you're gonna use, these are the different ways
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:03.320]   to engage in harm reduction.
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:05.960]   You know, like, obviously, oral consumption has,
[02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:08.720]   you avoid the issue of lung damage
[02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:10.360]   that you could get from smoking.
[02:04:10.920 --> 02:04:12.520]   But then, you know, with oral consumption,
[02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:13.960]   you have to be aware of dosing and timing
[02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:15.280]   and all these other considerations, but-
[02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:17.080]   - What about vaping?
[02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:19.660]   Can people self-regulate their THC concentration
[02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:21.600]   in the blood by vaping as well as they can
[02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:23.600]   by joint or bong or other forms of smoking?
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:25.880]   - I think that will depend on exactly what you're vaping.
[02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:28.380]   So in the States, I've noticed when people say vaping,
[02:04:28.380 --> 02:04:29.740]   they almost exclusively refer
[02:04:29.740 --> 02:04:32.280]   to some kind of oil-based product that's in a pen.
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:34.800]   So in those situations,
[02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:36.240]   that's gonna really heavily depend
[02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:38.960]   on what the concentration of THC in that product is.
[02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:41.500]   Now, the other form of vaping
[02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:44.080]   that I think is a little bit more common in Canada, maybe,
[02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:45.980]   is vaping of the plant matter itself.
[02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:48.500]   And so this is where they have like a vaporizer device
[02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:50.800]   that heats the cannabis to a point
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:53.200]   that will essentially hit the lift point
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:55.080]   to vaporize THC in the cannabinoids.
[02:04:55.080 --> 02:04:55.920]   - In a big bag.
[02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:57.560]   - Yeah, yeah, like a volcano.
[02:04:57.560 --> 02:04:58.400]   - I've seen it.
[02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:00.580]   - Yeah, but it doesn't create any plant combustion.
[02:05:00.580 --> 02:05:02.600]   And so there are studies that have been run on that
[02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:06.440]   that have shown that you avoid the combustion by-products.
[02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:08.360]   So people don't like exhale carbon monoxide
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:11.440]   or these other things that we know can be damaging
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:13.120]   if they're vaping plant matter.
[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:14.840]   That was actually somewhat approved
[02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:15.920]   as like a medical device.
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:18.040]   Pre-legalization when cannabis in Canada
[02:05:18.040 --> 02:05:20.100]   was only under medical authorization.
[02:05:20.100 --> 02:05:23.640]   Because of the reduced harm associated
[02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:26.880]   with vaporizing the plant matter versus smoking it,
[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:30.240]   that is, I would say, a safe guideline for harm reduction
[02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:32.360]   that if you're gonna try and avoid,
[02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:33.400]   there's still gonna be some issues
[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:35.080]   that happen with vaporization of plant matter,
[02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:36.860]   but it's not the same as combustion.
[02:05:36.860 --> 02:05:39.560]   So you avoid some of the other issues that come out.
[02:05:39.560 --> 02:05:42.640]   When we're talking about oil-based vapor products
[02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:43.520]   or whatever they're in,
[02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:46.000]   they're usually in some kind of oil-based solution.
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.440]   Who knows?
[02:05:48.440 --> 02:05:49.680]   I mean, we don't have the research on this.
[02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:50.600]   We just don't know.
[02:05:50.600 --> 02:05:53.800]   I mean, we certainly know there have been
[02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:55.960]   some pretty big errors of the things
[02:05:55.960 --> 02:05:56.800]   that happen in the States.
[02:05:56.800 --> 02:05:58.160]   There was that problem where all those people
[02:05:58.160 --> 02:06:00.440]   developed kind of, I don't know, popcorn lung
[02:06:00.440 --> 02:06:02.900]   or that lung inflammation where several people died
[02:06:02.900 --> 02:06:05.840]   from vaping products, which seemed to be a by-product,
[02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:08.340]   I believe, of them adding like vitamin E acetate
[02:06:08.340 --> 02:06:09.920]   or something into the...
[02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:12.080]   Because again, everyone just assumes it's inert,
[02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:15.280]   but then when it combusts through the vaporization process,
[02:06:15.280 --> 02:06:18.040]   it creates a massive irritant on lung tissue.
[02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:20.800]   And so that was just, you know...
[02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:22.680]   Again, in my mind, this is a problem
[02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:25.840]   with a lack of a federal regulatory framework
[02:06:25.840 --> 02:06:27.960]   because stuff like this happens.
[02:06:27.960 --> 02:06:30.120]   You would not see that on a federal landscape
[02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:32.880]   because you'd have to go through testing.
[02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:34.460]   It's kind of the Wild West you get down here.
[02:06:34.460 --> 02:06:36.320]   Every state has its own rules.
[02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:39.020]   People, there's not really a lot of regulation of things.
[02:06:39.020 --> 02:06:41.560]   - But if you go overseas, it's even more wild.
[02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:42.400]   I mean...
[02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:43.440]   - I mean, then you have no idea
[02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:44.940]   what you're consuming anywhere, I would say.
[02:06:44.940 --> 02:06:47.440]   Just because outside, I mean, again,
[02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:50.360]   Netherlands is a little bit of a different situation.
[02:06:50.360 --> 02:06:52.280]   They're not legal, they're decriminalized.
[02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:53.880]   I don't know how well the regulation over there,
[02:06:53.880 --> 02:06:54.720]   the product is.
[02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:56.960]   - No, I mean, we're going to be doing episodes on stem cells
[02:06:56.960 --> 02:06:58.480]   and you've got people flying out of country
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:06:59.660]   to do stem cell injections.
[02:06:59.660 --> 02:07:00.920]   People were getting them down in Florida
[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:02.840]   who went blind from the injections of stem cells
[02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:04.300]   into the eye in an attempt to save
[02:07:04.300 --> 02:07:06.540]   what little vision they already had.
[02:07:06.540 --> 02:07:09.220]   Probably don't want to get me started on that one.
[02:07:09.220 --> 02:07:12.540]   I'm in total agreement with you, by the way.
[02:07:12.540 --> 02:07:16.880]   I want to make sure that I ask about psychosis and paranoia.
[02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:20.740]   I've previously said, and I was sort of,
[02:07:20.740 --> 02:07:25.740]   I wasn't joking, but I have observed in my history
[02:07:25.740 --> 02:07:30.460]   that when people started to experience some degree
[02:07:30.460 --> 02:07:35.460]   of anxiety or paranoia when smoking cannabis,
[02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:39.040]   that sometimes the message they would receive back
[02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:42.720]   is to take more, to just adjust the subjective experience.
[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:45.400]   I think that's a terrible idea, terrible idea.
[02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:46.640]   - I am baffled that you heard that.
[02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:47.960]   I have no idea.
[02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:50.240]   - Well, let's just say I did more than hear it.
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:51.560]   See, I've observed it.
[02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:53.360]   - I cannot even understand that.
[02:07:53.360 --> 02:07:55.440]   That is the strangest thing I've ever heard, but okay, yeah.
[02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:59.720]   - Well, usually the advice of people in terms of,
[02:07:59.720 --> 02:08:01.280]   that was recreational drug taking,
[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:03.760]   is rarely excellent advice.
[02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:06.560]   - Yeah, no, no, no, that's, so, yeah.
[02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:09.040]   I mean, I agree with you on that point, for sure,
[02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:10.680]   that you should not be consuming more
[02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:12.120]   if you're having a bad reaction to it
[02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:14.360]   'cause that will just like grease the wheels
[02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:15.720]   going downhill, for sure.
[02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:17.240]   - Yeah.
[02:08:17.240 --> 02:08:21.320]   I also am aware that there are some very high profile papers
[02:08:21.320 --> 02:08:22.760]   that have been published in the last,
[02:08:22.760 --> 02:08:24.520]   really five years or so,
[02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:29.520]   pointing to potential increased risk for psychosis
[02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:30.920]   of lasting duration,
[02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:35.120]   even after the effects of cannabis have worn off
[02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:37.120]   in high THC cannabis users,
[02:08:37.120 --> 02:08:39.800]   in particular high THC cannabis users
[02:08:39.800 --> 02:08:42.160]   that initiate that cannabis use young,
[02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:45.400]   and this might be preferentially impacting males.
[02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:47.000]   I want to make clear that what I just said
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.240]   is not a statement of absolute fact.
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:53.400]   It's my understanding of the conclusions of these papers.
[02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:56.980]   There are other conclusions in these papers also,
[02:08:56.980 --> 02:09:00.320]   but that particular conclusion seems to be important enough
[02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:01.840]   that they place it in the abstract
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:04.160]   and it's reached major press headlines.
[02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:05.920]   So I guess the simple question,
[02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:08.880]   which probably doesn't have a simple answer,
[02:09:08.880 --> 02:09:13.120]   is does THC cause psychosis?
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:14.720]   - So yeah, there's not a simple answer to that.
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:16.720]   And I think that also is a question
[02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:17.560]   over whether you're talking
[02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:19.920]   about acute drug-induced psychotic episode
[02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:23.640]   versus the development of a chronic psychotic disease
[02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:25.120]   like schizophrenia.
[02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:28.040]   So the first arm of that is just,
[02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:30.060]   can people acutely have a psychotic episode
[02:09:30.060 --> 02:09:30.900]   to THC or cannabis?
[02:09:30.900 --> 02:09:33.440]   And the answer to that is yes, it's not common.
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:35.280]   I would say in terms of adverse events
[02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:36.840]   that happen with people consuming cannabis,
[02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:39.960]   it's on the rarer side, but it definitely can happen.
[02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:42.120]   - So less than 5% of people that-
[02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:43.000]   - Much less than that.
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:44.080]   I mean, it's certainly, I mean,
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:46.720]   if something like this was happening at a regular frequency,
[02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:49.440]   it would be very well-known.
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:50.960]   - What about anxiety attack?
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:52.360]   - Yeah, anxiety attack is, I'd say,
[02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:54.320]   more of a standard indication
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:55.640]   that someone's kind of gone overboard.
[02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:56.840]   Like that's not-
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:09:59.360]   - Dosage overboard, or does it carry the same set
[02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:02.880]   in setting considerations that, you know,
[02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:05.040]   psychedelics like psilocybin have?
[02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:05.860]   - Both.
[02:10:05.860 --> 02:10:08.080]   So I think there's some contextual component to it.
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:10.040]   There was like, I mean, back in the '70s
[02:10:10.040 --> 02:10:13.040]   when they did more, let's say, interesting studies,
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:15.680]   there's one where basically they dosed people on THC
[02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:18.120]   and then had them undergo oral surgery,
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:20.520]   which seems like, in hindsight, a very bad idea.
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:22.140]   And I think virtually everyone in that study
[02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:23.720]   had a panic attack.
[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:25.860]   So it really potentiated the stress
[02:10:25.860 --> 02:10:26.960]   of what they were undergoing.
[02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:29.520]   And had they been given that same dose
[02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:30.400]   in a different setting,
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:32.680]   I'm not sure it would have evoked that kind of response,
[02:10:32.680 --> 02:10:35.640]   but there is definitely a dose effect to this
[02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:37.880]   in terms of like, you know,
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:42.640]   the kind of classic low-dose aspects of THC or cannabis,
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:44.240]   like that are usually considered
[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:47.380]   more of the positive, pleasurable responses
[02:10:47.380 --> 02:10:49.720]   that are why people use, like it reduces anxiety,
[02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:51.180]   it relaxes, blah, blah, blah.
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:56.200]   That is more of like a low-to-normal-ish dose, let's say,
[02:10:56.200 --> 02:10:58.340]   of what someone consumes to produce those responses.
[02:10:58.340 --> 02:10:59.800]   If they start going upwards, though,
[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:02.760]   it's not like it's graded, it's like a full flip.
[02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:04.480]   Like, it's not linear at all.
[02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:06.080]   It's almost like it goes in the opposite direction.
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:08.880]   So, you know, someone can use cannabis to reduce anxiety,
[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:11.820]   but then cannabis can also trigger anxiety in other people,
[02:11:11.820 --> 02:11:14.440]   and even in the same person if they consume too much.
[02:11:14.440 --> 02:11:17.560]   And a lot of this, at least we think,
[02:11:17.560 --> 02:11:19.240]   has to do with the ability of it
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:21.560]   to regulate both excitatory neurotransmission
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:22.400]   and inhibitory.
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:25.360]   And so for reasons that we don't totally understand,
[02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:27.560]   there's like way more cannabinoid receptors
[02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:31.100]   on inhibitory neurons than there is on excitatory neurons.
[02:11:31.100 --> 02:11:35.240]   But in the early days of creating the genetic lines,
[02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:37.960]   Giovanni Maricicano and Beat Lutz were over in Europe,
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:41.920]   created like deletion of CB1 only from excitatory neurons
[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:43.720]   or only from inhibitory neurons.
[02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:45.360]   - Okay, so to just clarify for people,
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:49.280]   these are laboratory mice that are genetically modified
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:52.580]   so that they contain or lack specific receptors
[02:11:52.580 --> 02:11:55.480]   on particular neuron types
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:58.640]   so that researchers can parse the effects of THC
[02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:01.600]   on what we're referring to as inhibitory neurons,
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:04.840]   which quiet other neurons versus excitatory neurons,
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:06.800]   which excite other neurons and so forth.
[02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:10.680]   And in doing so, to understand some of the network biology,
[02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:14.080]   which is basically impossible to do in a typical mouse,
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:17.640]   what's called a wild type mouse or a human,
[02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:20.060]   because when one ingests the drug
[02:12:20.060 --> 02:12:21.800]   or when the mouse is given the drug,
[02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:24.000]   it affects any site in the brain,
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:25.240]   potentially any site in the brain
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:26.760]   where the CB1 receptor is expressed.
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:29.920]   - If you do like a full body deletion of CB1
[02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:31.360]   and you give a mouse THC,
[02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:33.600]   doesn't respond to it at all, not surprisingly.
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:34.800]   - That's a comforting experiment.
[02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:35.920]   You want to see that result.
[02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:36.760]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:38.400]   So that's how we know CB1 drives
[02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:40.520]   all the kind of psychoactive effects of THC.
[02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:44.320]   So if you delete CB1 off of inhibitory GABA neurons,
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:47.000]   even though that removes like 70%
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.560]   of the CB1 receptors in the brain,
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:51.440]   those animals look just like wild type.
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:53.800]   They still get, like they still exhibit
[02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:55.560]   all the classic signs of intoxication
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:57.280]   in terms of how they would respond
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:12:59.560]   to like pain sensitivity or locomotion
[02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:02.040]   or these other like assays we use in mice
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:03.500]   to tell if they're high.
[02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:07.160]   If you delete the CB1 only off of excitatory neurons,
[02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:08.160]   the glutamate neurons,
[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:12.080]   then you see what looks like the full knockout.
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:13.680]   So now the animals don't seem to get high.
[02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:16.760]   So even though the majority of CB1 receptors
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:19.040]   seem to be on these inhibitory GABA neurons,
[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:21.640]   it's the CB1 on the glutamatergic excitatory neurons
[02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:23.800]   that mediate most of the classic signs
[02:13:23.800 --> 02:13:27.240]   of what we would consider intoxication from THC or cannabis.
[02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:28.840]   But what's interesting is,
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:33.480]   Beat worked with the Spanish group 10, 12 years ago.
[02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:35.640]   Then they showed, they're looking at anxiety,
[02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:39.600]   that if you delete CB1 only off of excitatory neurons,
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:43.840]   you lose the anti-anxiety, anxiolytic effects of THC,
[02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:46.280]   but you still have the panicky,
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:48.600]   anxiogenic effects of high dose.
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:52.640]   If you delete CB1 off of only the inhibitory GABA neurons,
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:55.320]   you still have the low dose anti-anxiety effect,
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:57.200]   but now you don't have the high dose
[02:13:57.200 --> 02:13:59.480]   anxiogenic panicky effect.
[02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:03.600]   So what that was suggesting was that for some reason,
[02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:07.720]   CB1, like THC will initially hit CB1
[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:09.560]   on kind of glutamatergic neurons.
[02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:12.040]   And essentially the thought is,
[02:14:12.040 --> 02:14:14.240]   this will reduce excitatory transmission
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:16.000]   and probably quiet down circuits.
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:17.680]   And if we're talking about something like the amygdala,
[02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:20.320]   this is probably how it's reducing anxiety.
[02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:22.480]   Whereas as dosing starts to increase
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:25.080]   and you start to saturate the CB1 on the GABA neurons
[02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:26.840]   and turn off inhibition,
[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:29.560]   then the network effect is more of an amplification.
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:31.920]   And that seems to result in the development
[02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:35.120]   of kind of an anxiogenic pro-anxiety response
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:37.280]   that's obviously undesirable.
[02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:39.760]   Why there's this differential shift,
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:41.120]   it's not exactly clear.
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:44.120]   I mean, it's probably either due to some of the biology
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:46.800]   of exactly where the CB1 receptors sit
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:48.720]   on excitatory or inhibitory neurons
[02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:50.400]   relative to all the machinery
[02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:52.360]   that regulates transmitter release.
[02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:54.400]   I mean, Biat-Lutz has definitely done some stuff
[02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:56.880]   looking at the ability of cannabinoid receptors
[02:14:56.880 --> 02:14:58.920]   to evoke signaling responses in a cell.
[02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:00.560]   And on glutamate neurons,
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:02.600]   they're much more sensitive than they are in GABA neurons.
[02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:04.760]   So there's probably a dose threshold.
[02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:08.080]   So it does look like this kind of low dosing,
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:09.560]   what most people are trying to achieve,
[02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:10.960]   I would assume, when they consume cannabis
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:12.520]   is probably these effects mediated
[02:15:12.520 --> 02:15:15.480]   by quieting down excitatory transmission.
[02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:16.760]   And then the adverse effects
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:18.040]   when someone consumes too much
[02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:19.280]   and they have a negative response,
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:21.240]   that's probably due to the higher dose
[02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:24.000]   starting to saturate on the inhibitory neurons.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:25.720]   Now, we obviously can never test something like that
[02:15:25.720 --> 02:15:27.360]   in humans 'cause we can't know.
[02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:28.960]   But based on what we've seen in animals,
[02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:31.880]   that's my theory of kind of how this is working
[02:15:31.880 --> 02:15:34.200]   and why we see these kind of classic biphasic effects.
[02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:37.200]   So yeah, too much THC, not a good thing
[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:39.280]   'cause then you start maybe disinhibiting things
[02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:42.560]   like the amygdala and producing these kind of panicky,
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:44.840]   anxiogenic-like outcomes.
[02:15:44.840 --> 02:15:47.400]   On that scale though, I mean, paranoia, obviously,
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:49.440]   that's a hard, I don't know how you study that in a rodent.
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:52.120]   I mean, that's just a strange thing.
[02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:54.360]   But I mean, that's kind of the precedent
[02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:56.360]   of when you start going into the psychosis
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:59.880]   'cause obviously paranoia would be a big component of that.
[02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:01.760]   Someone once asked me a question about,
[02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:06.440]   what happens in the brain, like imaging-wise,
[02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:08.920]   when someone's having like a psychotic episode from cannabis?
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:10.000]   And I was kind of thinking like,
[02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:11.520]   how would that study get done?
[02:16:11.520 --> 02:16:14.780]   - Probably on accident because somebody takes cannabis,
[02:16:14.780 --> 02:16:19.600]   is in the scanner and then starts having a psychotic episode
[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:21.600]   but chances are they're going to try and get out.
[02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:22.780]   For those that don't know, these,
[02:16:22.780 --> 02:16:25.040]   I don't want to scare people out of doing MRI or fMRI,
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:28.800]   but you're typically told to stay extremely still.
[02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:30.920]   There's sometimes even a bite bar.
[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:32.160]   This is a very controlled environment,
[02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:34.800]   not an environment that you would want to be in
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:35.640]   during a psychotic episode.
[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:38.280]   - No, I can't actually even imagine how that would go down.
[02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:40.080]   So I'm like, this is something I don't think
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:41.040]   we're ever gonna have an answer to
[02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:42.840]   'cause I don't think you can actually ever test it.
[02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:45.320]   But in terms of people having this kind of
[02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:48.680]   psychotic response, it is pretty rare.
[02:16:48.680 --> 02:16:51.880]   I mean, and I say this because I can think of in Canada,
[02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:53.280]   kind of whenever it's happened
[02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:57.480]   and someone has actually done something wildly unpredictable
[02:16:57.480 --> 02:16:59.400]   because they've had a psychotic response to cannabis,
[02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:00.400]   it tends to make headlines.
[02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:02.100]   So it's not common.
[02:17:02.100 --> 02:17:05.280]   I could not give you an actual number,
[02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:07.400]   but it's certainly not a frequent thing
[02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:09.720]   because we would hear about this a lot more if we did.
[02:17:09.720 --> 02:17:11.840]   - And there's also the issue of polypharmacology,
[02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:13.680]   which is simply when people take one drug,
[02:17:13.680 --> 02:17:15.980]   then there's often the tendency to take another drug,
[02:17:15.980 --> 02:17:18.760]   either because it's available in those conditions
[02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:21.360]   or because their threshold to saying yes
[02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:23.120]   is a little bit lower.
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:27.000]   Do most people who take cannabis and achieve the high
[02:17:27.880 --> 02:17:29.560]   have a tendency to do other drugs?
[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:31.280]   It doesn't seem like a drug that people combine
[02:17:31.280 --> 02:17:33.300]   with a lot of other drugs.
[02:17:33.300 --> 02:17:35.920]   - I wouldn't say, I mean, there's certainly
[02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:38.200]   cannabis is used in tandem with other drugs,
[02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:40.800]   alcohol, psychedelics at times, for sure.
[02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:44.520]   But that being said, I mean,
[02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:46.960]   there is clearly a population of people that use cannabis
[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:48.160]   as their only drug that they use.
[02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:50.020]   I don't think that's that uncommon.
[02:17:50.020 --> 02:17:53.440]   But in the context of the psychosis stuff,
[02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:55.840]   I would definitely say, sure.
[02:17:55.840 --> 02:17:57.560]   I mean, if someone mixed it with amphetamine
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:18:00.280]   or something, you could have a very unpredictable response.
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:01.920]   But I mean, I think the psychotic responses
[02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:02.760]   that have been documented
[02:18:02.760 --> 02:18:04.440]   that are usually purely due to cannabis.
[02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:06.560]   Like it's not necessarily due
[02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:08.480]   to some kind of drug interaction there.
[02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:11.680]   There is something about the way that cannabis is changing,
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:14.360]   the way the brain functions in a way that for people
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:15.760]   who seem to be prone to this,
[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:18.000]   they can have a psychotic response.
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:19.740]   Again, I don't think it's a very typical thing,
[02:18:19.740 --> 02:18:22.600]   but we're talking about what that means in the context
[02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:25.760]   of like an actual disorder, like a chronic disorder,
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:28.880]   like schizophrenia, which is characterized by psychosis.
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:29.720]   I think we're talking about
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:30.640]   a whole different ball game here.
[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:32.360]   And this is an area that is,
[02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:35.080]   I mean, I think it's an important thing to discuss
[02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:36.000]   in the context of science
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:40.080]   because you can't establish causality.
[02:18:40.080 --> 02:18:43.360]   Like in my view, it's virtually impossible
[02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:45.640]   because there's just no way to control all the variables
[02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:46.800]   that play into this.
[02:18:46.800 --> 02:18:51.640]   What we can say definitively is individuals
[02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:53.880]   who have schizophrenia, first of all,
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:55.280]   they use cannabis at a higher rate
[02:18:55.280 --> 02:18:56.360]   than the general population.
[02:18:56.360 --> 02:18:57.200]   That's very clear.
[02:18:57.200 --> 02:18:59.380]   Yeah, they definitely use cannabis at a higher rate
[02:18:59.380 --> 02:19:01.360]   than the general population.
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:06.360]   There is definitely a relationship between using cannabis
[02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:09.440]   and having the initiation
[02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:11.240]   of the development of schizophrenia.
[02:19:11.240 --> 02:19:13.200]   And this is where a lot of the statistics
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:16.400]   that have been used to develop the risk assessment,
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:18.580]   essentially, like so that you have a greater risk.
[02:19:18.580 --> 02:19:20.040]   If you know, like you were saying,
[02:19:20.040 --> 02:19:21.560]   if you've used cannabis as a teenager,
[02:19:21.560 --> 02:19:24.040]   you use high potency as a lot of the research has shown,
[02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:25.200]   though they've done these studies
[02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:29.320]   and they say it relates to a greater risk of schizophrenia.
[02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:33.340]   Essentially, this is just a statistical association
[02:19:33.340 --> 02:19:35.960]   that they found that people who use cannabis,
[02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:38.400]   the conversion into schizophrenia happens at a higher rate
[02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:39.840]   and there's more people with schizophrenia
[02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:41.400]   who are using cannabis.
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:44.680]   - Is there a bias towards males developing psychosis?
[02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:47.320]   I know there may be a bias initially
[02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:50.940]   toward males in schizophrenia that could confound this.
[02:19:50.940 --> 02:19:52.280]   So we wanna be careful.
[02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:54.200]   - To be honest, in all the research I've,
[02:19:54.200 --> 02:19:55.560]   in all the literature I've read on this,
[02:19:55.560 --> 02:19:59.240]   I don't ever remember there being clear sex descriptions
[02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:00.800]   of the differences of males and females.
[02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:04.040]   I mean, again, historically cannabis was more used
[02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:04.920]   by males than females.
[02:20:04.920 --> 02:20:08.680]   So that could lean towards any bias that may be out there
[02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:12.760]   in the media, the popular, like just in general,
[02:20:12.760 --> 02:20:13.920]   what people talk about.
[02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:15.960]   I can't think of any study that I've ever read
[02:20:15.960 --> 02:20:19.160]   that explicitly said this was male bias per se.
[02:20:19.160 --> 02:20:23.180]   They usually just report numbers or proportions of people.
[02:20:23.180 --> 02:20:29.800]   The issue is, so yes, there's this relationship that exists
[02:20:29.800 --> 02:20:32.680]   and yes, we know that cannabis
[02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:33.880]   can trigger psychotic episodes.
[02:20:33.880 --> 02:20:36.480]   So if there's an individual who has schizophrenia,
[02:20:36.480 --> 02:20:39.400]   we know for certain that cannabis can lead to the onset
[02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:43.400]   of increases in positive symptoms like hallucinations
[02:20:43.400 --> 02:20:46.640]   and delusions and a full-blown psychotic episode.
[02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:49.560]   So I think the first thing to say, which is very clear,
[02:20:49.560 --> 02:20:52.040]   is in my view, if someone has schizophrenia,
[02:20:52.040 --> 02:20:53.440]   cannabis is contraindicated.
[02:20:53.440 --> 02:20:54.640]   Like you shouldn't be using cannabis
[02:20:54.640 --> 02:20:55.480]   if you have schizophrenia.
[02:20:55.480 --> 02:20:57.240]   I think that's a risk across the board.
[02:20:57.240 --> 02:20:59.680]   - What about a first relative who has schizophrenia?
[02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:02.000]   Because there's a strong genetic component to schizophrenia.
[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:03.720]   - So I was gonna say, then the next question
[02:21:03.720 --> 02:21:06.480]   is knowing who's gonna develop schizophrenia.
[02:21:06.480 --> 02:21:07.600]   Obviously we don't know this.
[02:21:07.600 --> 02:21:10.560]   And as you say, the only real predictive variable
[02:21:10.560 --> 02:21:12.880]   that we know of is a first degree family member
[02:21:12.880 --> 02:21:15.440]   that has schizophrenia, means that you have a higher risk
[02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:16.600]   of developing schizophrenia.
[02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:19.160]   So again, same with bipolar.
[02:21:19.160 --> 02:21:21.600]   I would say if there's bipolar or schizophrenia in a family,
[02:21:21.600 --> 02:21:25.120]   to me, those are the people who should avoid cannabis.
[02:21:25.120 --> 02:21:27.040]   Just in terms of the likelihood,
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:29.380]   there's a much greater likelihood that they'd have,
[02:21:29.380 --> 02:21:31.560]   it would relate to the onset of a disease
[02:21:31.560 --> 02:21:35.720]   or could accelerate its presentation in some capacity.
[02:21:35.720 --> 02:21:38.280]   I think where things get really complicated
[02:21:38.280 --> 02:21:42.000]   in this whole cannabis schizophrenia story is the causality.
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:45.120]   And there is a camp of people who have looked
[02:21:45.120 --> 02:21:47.520]   at this literature and definitively believe
[02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:50.160]   that cannabis causes schizophrenia.
[02:21:50.160 --> 02:21:53.560]   And they attribute a proportion of people
[02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:56.520]   who have schizophrenia to only having that schizophrenia
[02:21:56.520 --> 02:21:59.520]   because of the fact that they used cannabis.
[02:21:59.520 --> 02:22:01.240]   And I think you'd had some discussion about this
[02:22:01.240 --> 02:22:02.080]   in the last podcast.
[02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:03.920]   I can't remember exactly the way that you described it.
[02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:07.600]   - Yeah, I was looking toward some of the recent studies
[02:22:07.600 --> 02:22:10.520]   in Lancet, JAMA Psychiatry.
[02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:13.760]   I believe we can provide links to these again.
[02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:16.500]   And now more recently, there's been a lot of,
[02:22:16.500 --> 02:22:18.240]   let's just call it mainstream media coverage
[02:22:18.240 --> 02:22:21.920]   of this potential, I think is the right way to refer to it,
[02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:25.860]   potential linkage between adolescent teen
[02:22:25.860 --> 02:22:29.880]   and young adult use of high THC cannabis
[02:22:29.880 --> 02:22:32.200]   and lasting psychosis.
[02:22:32.200 --> 02:22:34.480]   But the more I hear you talk about this,
[02:22:34.480 --> 02:22:39.480]   the more I'm wondering if that idea is being amplified
[02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:43.860]   more than perhaps we ought to let it be amplified.
[02:22:43.860 --> 02:22:46.560]   - I mean, I think this is what happens when you have,
[02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:49.340]   I mean, obviously you're familiar with this.
[02:22:49.340 --> 02:22:50.680]   In science, there's different,
[02:22:50.680 --> 02:22:51.760]   some things that we can be a little bit
[02:22:51.760 --> 02:22:52.880]   more definitive about.
[02:22:52.880 --> 02:22:53.720]   And then there's some things
[02:22:53.720 --> 02:22:55.560]   that we just can't know for certain.
[02:22:55.560 --> 02:22:56.400]   It's just the way it is
[02:22:56.400 --> 02:22:58.120]   because of the way that we gather data
[02:22:58.120 --> 02:23:00.080]   and because of the way humans are.
[02:23:00.080 --> 02:23:01.840]   And this isn't a question I believe we can ask
[02:23:01.840 --> 02:23:04.540]   from an animal model perspective in the same capacity.
[02:23:04.540 --> 02:23:07.320]   So I don't think anyone would deny,
[02:23:07.320 --> 02:23:08.440]   at least anyone who's read the literature,
[02:23:08.440 --> 02:23:10.360]   that there's this relationship between cannabis use,
[02:23:10.360 --> 02:23:11.320]   especially in adolescence
[02:23:11.320 --> 02:23:13.000]   and the development of schizophrenia.
[02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.560]   Now, my perspective on this is,
[02:23:15.560 --> 02:23:17.720]   and I'll explain why I have this perspective
[02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:19.800]   and how I justify it, is to me,
[02:23:19.800 --> 02:23:21.760]   cannabis is fuel on a fire.
[02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:25.080]   So if someone is prone to developing schizophrenia,
[02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:26.360]   adding cannabis into the mix,
[02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:28.640]   I think will make it kick in faster and harder.
[02:23:28.640 --> 02:23:31.940]   So if there is a genetic vulnerability
[02:23:31.940 --> 02:23:34.240]   for developing schizophrenia
[02:23:34.240 --> 02:23:37.360]   or some biological predisposition that's there,
[02:23:37.360 --> 02:23:39.040]   I would say in that situation,
[02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:42.640]   cannabis can trigger an initial onset of the first episode
[02:23:42.640 --> 02:23:44.520]   and it can make the prognosis of the disease
[02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:46.840]   in the long-term a lot worse, let's say.
[02:23:46.840 --> 02:23:49.360]   - As I recall, and I may have this incorrectly,
[02:23:49.360 --> 02:23:53.820]   but as I recall from my undergraduate years,
[02:23:53.820 --> 02:23:57.720]   what you just said is also true for military service,
[02:23:57.720 --> 02:23:59.780]   for people that have a predisposition
[02:23:59.780 --> 02:24:01.320]   to develop schizophrenia,
[02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:04.560]   that active military duty can exacerbate it as well.
[02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:05.480]   - I mean, I've never heard that,
[02:24:05.480 --> 02:24:07.060]   but that would be a stressor.
[02:24:07.060 --> 02:24:08.400]   And stressors are other ways.
[02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:11.880]   I mean, a lot of, you know, the situations where,
[02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:13.820]   I mean, some of it's the age, but like, you know,
[02:24:13.820 --> 02:24:16.080]   for example, if someone is prone to develop schizophrenia,
[02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:17.120]   they move away to college.
[02:24:17.120 --> 02:24:18.800]   Even that stressor can be something
[02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:19.680]   that brings on an episode.
[02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:22.600]   But cannabis, very specifically,
[02:24:22.600 --> 02:24:24.720]   like different than any other drugs,
[02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:26.160]   like alcohol or cigarettes,
[02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:27.920]   as far as I understand it, at least,
[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:30.200]   the temporal relationship between cannabis use
[02:24:30.200 --> 02:24:32.040]   and the development of a first episode
[02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:33.240]   can be pretty linked.
[02:24:34.900 --> 02:24:37.140]   But the arguments that I've always had
[02:24:37.140 --> 02:24:39.340]   with people in this area who are very definitive
[02:24:39.340 --> 02:24:40.500]   on their end of the spectrum,
[02:24:40.500 --> 02:24:43.380]   that this is a causal relationship is,
[02:24:43.380 --> 02:24:48.500]   first of all, we have a few things
[02:24:48.500 --> 02:24:50.900]   that like I would leverage as kind of real world evidence
[02:24:50.900 --> 02:24:52.160]   that makes this questionable.
[02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:53.000]   So the first one is,
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:54.740]   like I was saying earlier in the episode,
[02:24:54.740 --> 02:24:57.900]   I mean, we really didn't have cannabis use in the West,
[02:24:57.900 --> 02:24:59.380]   like as a normal thing,
[02:24:59.380 --> 02:25:00.980]   as one of the drugs that was part of the repertoire
[02:25:00.980 --> 02:25:04.380]   of what people use recreationally until like the '60s.
[02:25:04.380 --> 02:25:07.700]   So unlike alcohol, which has like been there for centuries,
[02:25:07.700 --> 02:25:10.060]   we have a little bit of a before and after,
[02:25:10.060 --> 02:25:11.220]   what we can look at.
[02:25:11.220 --> 02:25:12.140]   - The Grateful Dead.
[02:25:12.140 --> 02:25:12.980]   - Yeah.
[02:25:12.980 --> 02:25:16.660]   So now granted, we don't have like really good prevalence data
[02:25:16.660 --> 02:25:20.020]   of what schizophrenia was in the era prior.
[02:25:20.020 --> 02:25:23.060]   I mean, even nowadays our prevalence data is not perfect,
[02:25:23.060 --> 02:25:26.580]   but if cannabis as a solitary variable
[02:25:26.580 --> 02:25:29.820]   was driving the genesis of schizophrenia de novo,
[02:25:29.820 --> 02:25:32.220]   in the absence of any kind of biological predisposition
[02:25:32.220 --> 02:25:33.660]   or genetic predisposition,
[02:25:33.660 --> 02:25:35.300]   I find it very hard to believe
[02:25:35.300 --> 02:25:36.740]   that we wouldn't have seen a shift
[02:25:36.740 --> 02:25:38.100]   in the prevalence of the disease
[02:25:38.100 --> 02:25:41.420]   as cannabis became more mainstream and more widely used.
[02:25:41.420 --> 02:25:43.740]   And generally schizophrenia rates
[02:25:43.740 --> 02:25:46.300]   have remained largely stable.
[02:25:46.300 --> 02:25:48.380]   People can make arguments about that, better care,
[02:25:48.380 --> 02:25:50.340]   other things to challenge that argument, sure.
[02:25:50.340 --> 02:25:52.100]   So another modern perspective would be,
[02:25:52.100 --> 02:25:54.660]   okay, well, let's look at Canada and the States, let's say,
[02:25:54.660 --> 02:25:56.540]   where we have, as I said earlier,
[02:25:56.540 --> 02:25:58.340]   teenagers in Canada and the States,
[02:25:58.340 --> 02:26:01.340]   by grade 12, 35 to 40% of teenagers
[02:26:01.340 --> 02:26:03.940]   have at least used cannabis somewhat sporadically,
[02:26:03.940 --> 02:26:06.500]   and somewhere around 5%-ish
[02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:07.820]   are probably using almost daily.
[02:26:07.820 --> 02:26:10.340]   So we have a concentrated group
[02:26:10.340 --> 02:26:12.820]   of what would be the high-risk population here
[02:26:12.820 --> 02:26:14.700]   that are using at a pretty high rate.
[02:26:14.700 --> 02:26:16.540]   And then we compare that to somewhere like, let's say,
[02:26:16.540 --> 02:26:18.820]   Norway or Sweden or any of the Scandinavian countries
[02:26:18.820 --> 02:26:21.580]   where cannabis is like not a thing,
[02:26:21.580 --> 02:26:23.900]   certainly not at a recreational level and not in teenagers.
[02:26:23.900 --> 02:26:25.060]   And I mean, the rate use rates there
[02:26:25.060 --> 02:26:28.300]   are probably under 5% globally for teenagers,
[02:26:28.300 --> 02:26:30.860]   like probably closer to two or 3%.
[02:26:30.860 --> 02:26:34.340]   So you have two countries that have pretty similar
[02:26:34.340 --> 02:26:36.580]   social structures and other capacities of things.
[02:26:36.580 --> 02:26:38.300]   We're both Western countries,
[02:26:38.300 --> 02:26:41.780]   and yet our schizophrenia rates, prevalence-wise,
[02:26:41.780 --> 02:26:43.580]   are relatively comparable.
[02:26:43.580 --> 02:26:45.100]   And yet in Canada and the States,
[02:26:45.100 --> 02:26:46.780]   our cannabis use rates in adolescents
[02:26:46.780 --> 02:26:49.940]   are wildly amplified compared to those countries.
[02:26:49.940 --> 02:26:53.020]   So again, if this was causing schizophrenia
[02:26:53.020 --> 02:26:55.900]   to develop as a disease out of nowhere,
[02:26:55.900 --> 02:26:57.300]   how would that not track?
[02:26:57.300 --> 02:26:59.100]   Like, how would that not be seen
[02:26:59.100 --> 02:27:01.060]   when you just look at individual variances
[02:27:01.060 --> 02:27:02.780]   across countries and prevalence rates?
[02:27:02.780 --> 02:27:06.380]   - Yeah, I hear your point loud and clear.
[02:27:06.380 --> 02:27:08.820]   I seem to recall that there is a higher incidence
[02:27:08.820 --> 02:27:12.420]   of schizophrenia independent of cannabis use
[02:27:12.420 --> 02:27:16.820]   closer to the poles and less so at the equator.
[02:27:16.820 --> 02:27:19.660]   I don't know if those statistics still hold up, but-
[02:27:19.660 --> 02:27:20.500]   - I have no idea.
[02:27:20.500 --> 02:27:21.340]   - Okay. - I don't know.
[02:27:21.340 --> 02:27:22.500]   - It'd be interesting for us to look into that
[02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:27.420]   because then it would argue that since we're comparing
[02:27:27.420 --> 02:27:30.440]   very Northern locations to less Northern locations,
[02:27:30.440 --> 02:27:33.580]   that perhaps cannabis was sort of exacerbating-
[02:27:33.580 --> 02:27:35.900]   - Yeah, I mean, you could probably use Greece or Italy.
[02:27:35.900 --> 02:27:37.380]   I mean, they're gonna have cannabis use
[02:27:37.380 --> 02:27:38.760]   higher than Scandinavian countries,
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:40.740]   but it's gonna be way lower than North America still.
[02:27:40.740 --> 02:27:41.820]   'Cause it's just-
[02:27:41.820 --> 02:27:44.080]   - What is it about North Americans and cannabis use?
[02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:45.100]   - I have no idea.
[02:27:45.100 --> 02:27:47.140]   I mean, I think it's just part of the culture here.
[02:27:47.140 --> 02:27:48.940]   It's just evolved totally differently.
[02:27:48.940 --> 02:27:49.900]   I mean, I think- - The Grateful Dead.
[02:27:49.900 --> 02:27:50.740]   No, I'm just kidding.
[02:27:50.740 --> 02:27:51.560]   I'm not picking on The Grateful Dead.
[02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:52.400]   I like The Grateful Dead.
[02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:55.100]   Rick Rubin convinced me to start listening to them again
[02:27:55.100 --> 02:27:56.220]   'cause my sister used to listen to them,
[02:27:56.220 --> 02:27:57.300]   and there's some great songs,
[02:27:57.300 --> 02:27:58.620]   and they're from Menlo Park, Palo Alto.
[02:27:58.620 --> 02:28:01.660]   So I've done my duty to listen.
[02:28:01.660 --> 02:28:03.300]   There's some great songs, so I'm not picking on them.
[02:28:03.300 --> 02:28:05.180]   But- - But I mean, like you also have,
[02:28:05.180 --> 02:28:08.260]   like in Europe though, alcohol is also much more normal,
[02:28:08.260 --> 02:28:09.380]   normalized in general.
[02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:11.500]   Like kids will drink, it's not abnormal
[02:28:11.500 --> 02:28:12.980]   for kids who are teenagers to drink.
[02:28:12.980 --> 02:28:15.180]   Alcohol is just much more of a cultural thing as well.
[02:28:15.180 --> 02:28:17.100]   And there are just differences.
[02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:17.940]   I mean, it's the same thing.
[02:28:17.940 --> 02:28:20.540]   You look at like the opioid crisis that we're going through.
[02:28:20.540 --> 02:28:22.060]   Sure, it's there to some degree in Europe,
[02:28:22.060 --> 02:28:23.740]   but it's nothing like it is in North America.
[02:28:23.740 --> 02:28:26.980]   We are just a different beast for a lot of drug use.
[02:28:26.980 --> 02:28:30.220]   - Do you see differences between United States and Canada
[02:28:30.220 --> 02:28:32.860]   with respect to either cannabis or opioid use?
[02:28:32.860 --> 02:28:33.900]   - I don't think dramatically.
[02:28:33.900 --> 02:28:35.580]   I think we're pretty comparable from,
[02:28:35.580 --> 02:28:36.840]   I mean, for cannabis rates,
[02:28:36.840 --> 02:28:38.220]   I would say they're almost the same.
[02:28:38.220 --> 02:28:40.940]   I've not seen, sure you might get some regional differences.
[02:28:40.940 --> 02:28:43.820]   Like we, I think Quebec has much lower rates of cannabis use
[02:28:43.820 --> 02:28:44.940]   than some other parts of Canada.
[02:28:44.940 --> 02:28:47.060]   And you guys probably in some Southern states maybe
[02:28:47.060 --> 02:28:48.460]   are a bit different than other states.
[02:28:48.460 --> 02:28:50.940]   So I don't know about that.
[02:28:50.940 --> 02:28:53.420]   But again, overall at a federal level,
[02:28:53.420 --> 02:28:56.500]   I think the, which is where most of the data aggregates,
[02:28:56.500 --> 02:28:58.860]   I would say that they're pretty comparable with each other.
[02:28:58.860 --> 02:29:00.380]   So they're not wildly different at all.
[02:29:00.380 --> 02:29:01.780]   And again, even if you talk about climate,
[02:29:01.780 --> 02:29:04.180]   a lot of the U.S. is a lot warmer than Canada
[02:29:04.180 --> 02:29:06.260]   and you guys are certainly closer to the equator than we are.
[02:29:06.260 --> 02:29:09.860]   So I mean, we know like you do see higher rates
[02:29:09.860 --> 02:29:11.360]   of schizophrenia in urban settings
[02:29:11.360 --> 02:29:12.700]   than you do in rural settings.
[02:29:12.700 --> 02:29:13.540]   And so, I mean--
[02:29:13.540 --> 02:29:14.580]   - It's a stressor argument.
[02:29:14.580 --> 02:29:16.220]   - There's other, I mean, you also have more,
[02:29:16.220 --> 02:29:17.420]   like there's just, yeah,
[02:29:17.420 --> 02:29:20.140]   there's a lot of transitory populations
[02:29:20.140 --> 02:29:21.180]   that come in and out of cities
[02:29:21.180 --> 02:29:22.940]   that you don't see as much in rural communities.
[02:29:22.940 --> 02:29:24.900]   There's a lot more mental health services.
[02:29:24.900 --> 02:29:26.700]   There's other variables that can influence that.
[02:29:26.700 --> 02:29:28.380]   I mean, no one's really, I think,
[02:29:28.380 --> 02:29:31.140]   sussed out a mechanism to explain why you see that.
[02:29:31.140 --> 02:29:35.300]   But so there are things that shift across places,
[02:29:35.300 --> 02:29:36.500]   but I don't think it has anything to do
[02:29:36.500 --> 02:29:38.300]   with the rates of cannabis use.
[02:29:38.300 --> 02:29:40.220]   And I mean, the other thing that became very interesting
[02:29:40.220 --> 02:29:42.880]   in this whole debate over the last 15 odd years
[02:29:42.880 --> 02:29:45.160]   that people have really been talking about this a lot more
[02:29:45.160 --> 02:29:48.700]   is the fact that there's also been several studies now
[02:29:48.700 --> 02:29:50.860]   that have done genetics either at the GWAS level
[02:29:50.860 --> 02:29:54.460]   or just even just looking at polygenic risk scores.
[02:29:54.460 --> 02:29:56.180]   And there's at least three papers
[02:29:56.180 --> 02:29:57.500]   that I can think of off the top of my head
[02:29:57.500 --> 02:30:00.020]   that I could put the citations down for, for sure,
[02:30:00.020 --> 02:30:04.060]   after this, that do look at this
[02:30:04.060 --> 02:30:06.100]   from a somewhat, let's say, unbiased perspective
[02:30:06.100 --> 02:30:07.660]   where they see, you know, there's some,
[02:30:07.660 --> 02:30:09.360]   there's certainly some genetic architecture
[02:30:09.360 --> 02:30:13.020]   that relates to people either initiating cannabis use
[02:30:13.020 --> 02:30:15.540]   or people developing cannabis use disorder.
[02:30:15.540 --> 02:30:17.300]   And there's clearly some genetic architecture
[02:30:17.300 --> 02:30:19.940]   that relates to risk for schizophrenia.
[02:30:19.940 --> 02:30:22.180]   And what these studies have found
[02:30:22.180 --> 02:30:24.000]   kind of across the three of them was quite similar,
[02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.420]   which was from their analysis,
[02:30:26.420 --> 02:30:29.260]   the directionality suggested much more
[02:30:29.260 --> 02:30:32.360]   that having genetic risk for schizophrenia
[02:30:32.360 --> 02:30:34.560]   predicted cannabis use,
[02:30:34.560 --> 02:30:36.740]   more so than cannabis use predicted
[02:30:36.740 --> 02:30:38.100]   the development of schizophrenia.
[02:30:38.100 --> 02:30:38.940]   - Interesting.
[02:30:38.940 --> 02:30:39.760]   - So what that would mean
[02:30:39.760 --> 02:30:42.040]   is that there is some underlying biology
[02:30:42.040 --> 02:30:46.360]   that might be shared between a biological vulnerability
[02:30:46.360 --> 02:30:47.780]   to develop schizophrenia
[02:30:47.780 --> 02:30:51.180]   and some factor that relates to people using
[02:30:51.180 --> 02:30:54.620]   and/or liking and/or excessively using cannabis.
[02:30:54.620 --> 02:30:57.660]   - I've spoken to many psychiatrists
[02:30:57.660 --> 02:31:01.140]   in an effort to find someone expert in ADHD.
[02:31:01.140 --> 02:31:02.780]   We've done two episodes on ADHD,
[02:31:02.780 --> 02:31:05.420]   focusing on everything from behavioral to nutritional,
[02:31:05.420 --> 02:31:08.020]   but also prescription drug treatments for ADHD.
[02:31:08.020 --> 02:31:10.860]   And what's interesting is that all of them
[02:31:10.860 --> 02:31:13.540]   have relayed the fact that many people,
[02:31:13.540 --> 02:31:17.020]   not just young people, but adults with ADHD
[02:31:17.020 --> 02:31:19.820]   will often use, not necessarily abuse,
[02:31:19.820 --> 02:31:22.440]   but will use stimulants like coffee
[02:31:22.440 --> 02:31:24.660]   and other forms of stimulants to a high degree.
[02:31:24.660 --> 02:31:26.660]   And then of course you can say,
[02:31:26.660 --> 02:31:28.900]   well, perhaps the stimulants are causing ADHD,
[02:31:28.900 --> 02:31:31.020]   but they actually argue for the opposite,
[02:31:31.020 --> 02:31:33.500]   which is that people are attempting to self-medicate.
[02:31:33.500 --> 02:31:36.820]   And then it's perhaps no surprise that most,
[02:31:36.820 --> 02:31:38.820]   not all, but most of the medications
[02:31:38.820 --> 02:31:40.880]   that are approved for the treatment of ADHD
[02:31:40.880 --> 02:31:43.560]   are variants of amphetamine or similar.
[02:31:43.560 --> 02:31:45.820]   So it's another case where,
[02:31:45.820 --> 02:31:47.380]   depending on whether or not you look through the lens
[02:31:47.380 --> 02:31:48.900]   of the drug leading to the condition
[02:31:48.900 --> 02:31:51.940]   or through the lens of the condition
[02:31:51.940 --> 02:31:53.980]   leading to the use of the drug,
[02:31:53.980 --> 02:31:56.620]   you can end up in two very different places,
[02:31:56.620 --> 02:31:59.700]   but it looks exactly the same through each lens,
[02:31:59.700 --> 02:32:00.540]   so to speak.
[02:32:00.540 --> 02:32:03.260]   - I think you, so, I mean, and this is, you know,
[02:32:03.260 --> 02:32:05.420]   I've debated with other researchers in the area,
[02:32:05.420 --> 02:32:07.780]   in print and in person,
[02:32:07.780 --> 02:32:10.100]   about the different interpretations of this.
[02:32:10.100 --> 02:32:12.220]   And one of the possibilities is, again,
[02:32:12.220 --> 02:32:13.900]   this idea of self-medication.
[02:32:13.900 --> 02:32:15.100]   I mean, independent of there being
[02:32:15.100 --> 02:32:17.180]   some underlying biological thing
[02:32:17.180 --> 02:32:18.700]   that just is a third variable
[02:32:18.700 --> 02:32:20.500]   that explains the relationship
[02:32:20.500 --> 02:32:22.580]   between cannabis and schizophrenia,
[02:32:22.580 --> 02:32:24.820]   the other possibility is self-medication.
[02:32:24.820 --> 02:32:27.220]   And there are some studies that suggest this
[02:32:27.220 --> 02:32:29.300]   and others that don't support it.
[02:32:29.300 --> 02:32:32.660]   Anecdotally, from having done work in the community
[02:32:32.660 --> 02:32:34.860]   and talked to individuals who have schizophrenia,
[02:32:34.860 --> 02:32:37.140]   who use cannabis, what their perspective on it is,
[02:32:37.140 --> 02:32:39.140]   what I've heard from a few of them is,
[02:32:39.140 --> 02:32:41.840]   you know, the medications that they're provided
[02:32:41.840 --> 02:32:45.300]   to manage the disease are relatively effective
[02:32:45.300 --> 02:32:47.120]   at managing, let's say, the positive symptoms,
[02:32:47.120 --> 02:32:48.960]   like hallucinations, delusions,
[02:32:48.960 --> 02:32:52.420]   that aspect of the disease is somewhat well-managed.
[02:32:52.420 --> 02:32:53.980]   But then there's another component,
[02:32:53.980 --> 02:32:55.140]   which is the negative symptoms,
[02:32:55.140 --> 02:32:57.300]   which is kind of like things that, you know,
[02:32:57.300 --> 02:33:00.180]   abolition, so they don't like engaging in stuff.
[02:33:00.180 --> 02:33:01.940]   There's some anxiety, some depression,
[02:33:01.940 --> 02:33:03.480]   some social withdrawal.
[02:33:03.480 --> 02:33:05.860]   And a lot of the medications don't manage
[02:33:05.860 --> 02:33:07.200]   that component of the disease,
[02:33:07.200 --> 02:33:09.240]   and they have said that they find cannabis
[02:33:09.240 --> 02:33:10.280]   helps that side of it,
[02:33:10.280 --> 02:33:12.460]   or it helps them de-arouse a little bit,
[02:33:12.460 --> 02:33:15.780]   even though a lot of them recognize it may trigger
[02:33:15.780 --> 02:33:18.220]   the development of some of the positive symptoms,
[02:33:18.220 --> 02:33:20.240]   they feel that they don't have any tool in their kit
[02:33:20.240 --> 02:33:21.520]   to manage the negative symptoms.
[02:33:21.520 --> 02:33:24.660]   And so it could be, in my mind, when I look at that,
[02:33:24.660 --> 02:33:26.020]   it could be a bit of a vicious cycle,
[02:33:26.020 --> 02:33:28.300]   where someone's using it to kind of band-aid one aspect,
[02:33:28.300 --> 02:33:30.020]   but making other aspects of the disease
[02:33:30.020 --> 02:33:31.060]   worse at the same time.
[02:33:31.060 --> 02:33:33.060]   So it can get very complicated.
[02:33:33.060 --> 02:33:37.400]   But so, I mean, there are various ways of looking at this
[02:33:37.400 --> 02:33:39.820]   in terms of, you know, so it's either you could say
[02:33:39.820 --> 02:33:42.340]   there's a causal argument, which is made by many,
[02:33:42.340 --> 02:33:44.020]   saying cannabis causes schizophrenia,
[02:33:44.020 --> 02:33:46.580]   and therefore if we eradicated it,
[02:33:46.580 --> 02:33:48.160]   I think you had alluded to something like that
[02:33:48.160 --> 02:33:49.000]   in the last podcast,
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:50.820]   that if you removed it, it would have this big effect
[02:33:50.820 --> 02:33:52.480]   in terms of reducing schizophrenia rates.
[02:33:52.480 --> 02:33:53.900]   And that's similar to the argument
[02:33:53.900 --> 02:33:55.820]   that a lot of the researchers in Britain have made,
[02:33:55.820 --> 02:33:58.200]   and I'm not personally convinced of that.
[02:33:58.200 --> 02:33:59.980]   And I say that simply because I look at the data
[02:33:59.980 --> 02:34:01.860]   from Scandinavia, and I'm like,
[02:34:01.860 --> 02:34:03.140]   well, there you have a population
[02:34:03.140 --> 02:34:04.680]   that barely uses any cannabis,
[02:34:04.680 --> 02:34:06.220]   and yet their schizophrenia rates are the same.
[02:34:06.220 --> 02:34:08.540]   So the only way in my mind,
[02:34:08.540 --> 02:34:10.220]   if I look at this kind of scientifically
[02:34:10.220 --> 02:34:11.740]   from a data perspective,
[02:34:11.740 --> 02:34:14.580]   that cannabis could be causing schizophrenia de novo
[02:34:14.580 --> 02:34:16.220]   in a subset of people,
[02:34:16.220 --> 02:34:18.740]   is that there must be an equal proportion of people
[02:34:18.740 --> 02:34:21.020]   for whom, for some reason and somehow,
[02:34:21.020 --> 02:34:24.060]   cannabis is preventing them from developing schizophrenia
[02:34:24.060 --> 02:34:26.260]   so that it's a zero-sum game at the end of the day,
[02:34:26.260 --> 02:34:27.560]   and there's no change in rates.
[02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:30.540]   Like, I can't actually understand any other model
[02:34:30.540 --> 02:34:31.900]   that could explain this.
[02:34:31.900 --> 02:34:34.240]   - Yeah, no, the way you're explaining it now
[02:34:34.240 --> 02:34:35.680]   makes perfect sense.
[02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:37.340]   I do want to make sure that we distinguish
[02:34:37.340 --> 02:34:41.100]   between schizophrenia, like psychosis,
[02:34:41.100 --> 02:34:43.780]   or schizophrenia itself induced by cannabis,
[02:34:43.780 --> 02:34:46.980]   and manic bipolar episode.
[02:34:46.980 --> 02:34:49.140]   So people who have a predisposition
[02:34:49.140 --> 02:34:50.900]   or full-blown manic bipolar,
[02:34:50.900 --> 02:34:52.940]   sometimes called manic depression,
[02:34:52.940 --> 02:34:54.660]   but there's still a lot of nuance there.
[02:34:54.660 --> 02:34:56.500]   We did an episode about this
[02:34:56.500 --> 02:34:59.420]   that people can also find linked in the show note captions.
[02:34:59.420 --> 02:35:02.540]   But in any case, is there any evidence
[02:35:02.540 --> 02:35:04.300]   for the fact that people who suffer from
[02:35:04.300 --> 02:35:07.140]   or have a predisposition to manic bipolar
[02:35:07.140 --> 02:35:11.540]   conditions like bipolar depression, for instance,
[02:35:11.540 --> 02:35:14.400]   should avoid high THC cannabis?
[02:35:14.400 --> 02:35:18.860]   - So, well, first of all, I mean,
[02:35:18.860 --> 02:35:23.060]   in like hereditability family trees, for example,
[02:35:23.060 --> 02:35:24.940]   where you look at something like bipolar schizophrenia,
[02:35:24.940 --> 02:35:26.820]   the two do kind of track together.
[02:35:26.820 --> 02:35:27.640]   - Sure.
[02:35:27.640 --> 02:35:30.140]   - So it's not, I mean, I think it's hard to separate these
[02:35:30.140 --> 02:35:33.440]   in some capacity because, you know,
[02:35:33.440 --> 02:35:35.820]   I remember years ago at Society for Neuroscience,
[02:35:35.820 --> 02:35:37.140]   Glenn Close was one of the,
[02:35:37.140 --> 02:35:38.280]   I don't know if you were at that meeting,
[02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:39.120]   but Glenn Close was one of the-
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:39.940]   - The actress.
[02:35:39.940 --> 02:35:40.780]   - Yeah, she was one of the public speakers
[02:35:40.780 --> 02:35:43.920]   and she had talked about schizophrenia in her family tree.
[02:35:43.920 --> 02:35:45.980]   And she kind of put up this family tree of like,
[02:35:45.980 --> 02:35:48.300]   you know, her family and the one,
[02:35:48.300 --> 02:35:49.860]   the previous relatives in her family
[02:35:49.860 --> 02:35:53.500]   and showed like the individuals who had schizophrenia
[02:35:53.500 --> 02:35:54.780]   and bipolar as well.
[02:35:54.780 --> 02:35:55.620]   And this is something I think
[02:35:55.620 --> 02:35:57.900]   that's been seen a fair amount is,
[02:35:57.900 --> 02:36:00.940]   there is some co-relationship in the way that these track
[02:36:00.940 --> 02:36:02.140]   at a hereditability level.
[02:36:02.140 --> 02:36:04.460]   And so I don't know that area really well enough
[02:36:04.460 --> 02:36:05.940]   to be able to comment on it.
[02:36:05.940 --> 02:36:08.500]   And from the cannabis perspective,
[02:36:08.500 --> 02:36:12.020]   bipolar is definitely much less studied
[02:36:12.020 --> 02:36:13.740]   and focused on than schizophrenia is.
[02:36:13.740 --> 02:36:16.160]   But I think also to the comment about the high THC thing,
[02:36:16.160 --> 02:36:18.700]   I think this is the other part of the argument
[02:36:18.700 --> 02:36:20.140]   that's emerged out of this.
[02:36:20.140 --> 02:36:22.380]   And this is the other part where I see a lot
[02:36:22.380 --> 02:36:25.660]   of the causality arguments kind of crumble
[02:36:25.660 --> 02:36:26.700]   onto themselves to some degree.
[02:36:26.700 --> 02:36:28.500]   And there's been others who've made these very similar
[02:36:28.500 --> 02:36:29.740]   arguments to what I'm making here,
[02:36:29.740 --> 02:36:34.220]   which is the push that came out of this out of the UK,
[02:36:34.220 --> 02:36:36.640]   at least was much more that it's this high potency
[02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:38.220]   kind of skunk cannabis they referred to,
[02:36:38.220 --> 02:36:40.540]   which first of all was based on a smell,
[02:36:40.540 --> 02:36:42.820]   which they didn't really hadn't done a lot of analytics on.
[02:36:42.820 --> 02:36:45.220]   So it was people make the assumption of it smells stronger,
[02:36:45.220 --> 02:36:46.180]   it's more potent cannabis.
[02:36:46.180 --> 02:36:48.580]   That's not really true 'cause THC doesn't dictate the odor.
[02:36:48.580 --> 02:36:50.600]   That's, as I was saying, more of a terpene thing,
[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:53.300]   but certainly I'm sure some of the skunk cannabis
[02:36:53.300 --> 02:36:55.100]   they were referring to is high potency cannabis.
[02:36:55.100 --> 02:36:56.980]   And so the analysis on this,
[02:36:56.980 --> 02:36:58.420]   if you actually go back to those papers and read
[02:36:58.420 --> 02:37:01.660]   is they often use like hash or low potency cannabis
[02:37:01.660 --> 02:37:02.700]   as their control where they show
[02:37:02.700 --> 02:37:04.500]   no association with cannabis.
[02:37:04.500 --> 02:37:06.460]   And so that's what's used this argument
[02:37:06.460 --> 02:37:10.540]   that it's the high potency cannabis that has driven this.
[02:37:10.540 --> 02:37:12.820]   So now the problem with this argument in my view,
[02:37:12.820 --> 02:37:17.820]   again, I look for what is the answer
[02:37:17.820 --> 02:37:19.380]   that fits in with the data?
[02:37:19.380 --> 02:37:21.560]   Like what's the most parsimonious explanation here
[02:37:21.560 --> 02:37:23.580]   that everything can be explained by?
[02:37:23.580 --> 02:37:25.660]   And so the problem with that argument is if you look
[02:37:25.660 --> 02:37:27.260]   at the cannabis schizophrenia literature,
[02:37:27.260 --> 02:37:29.740]   everything goes back to this one 1987 Lancet paper
[02:37:29.740 --> 02:37:32.300]   out of Sweden, where in that paper,
[02:37:32.300 --> 02:37:35.100]   they essentially looked at,
[02:37:35.100 --> 02:37:37.600]   they have really detailed life records and health records.
[02:37:37.600 --> 02:37:39.400]   And this was Swedish conscripts.
[02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:42.260]   And they essentially found that if someone had used cannabis
[02:37:42.260 --> 02:37:44.060]   the rate, the risk of developing schizophrenia
[02:37:44.060 --> 02:37:45.380]   had gone up and up.
[02:37:45.380 --> 02:37:48.380]   And so this was based on a cohort of people
[02:37:48.380 --> 02:37:49.540]   when it was published in '87,
[02:37:49.540 --> 02:37:51.180]   that the data would have been collected
[02:37:51.180 --> 02:37:53.520]   through like the '60s, '70s, early '80s.
[02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:56.340]   So we're talking about Sweden and cannabis,
[02:37:56.340 --> 02:37:58.180]   where it's not a country that has high cannabis use rates.
[02:37:58.180 --> 02:37:59.880]   And in an era when cannabis was hovering
[02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:02.620]   in a two to 5% THC range,
[02:38:02.620 --> 02:38:04.820]   that was the initial finding
[02:38:04.820 --> 02:38:06.660]   that provided this association between it.
[02:38:06.660 --> 02:38:09.060]   And yet the cannabis in that study
[02:38:09.060 --> 02:38:10.140]   that they would have been referring to
[02:38:10.140 --> 02:38:12.420]   would have been incredibly low potency
[02:38:12.420 --> 02:38:15.540]   compared to what has happened or like what it is today.
[02:38:15.540 --> 02:38:18.180]   So if the argument is that it's only related
[02:38:18.180 --> 02:38:21.040]   to high potency, how would that initial finding
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:22.820]   have ever been found?
[02:38:22.820 --> 02:38:24.060]   Because it doesn't make any sense.
[02:38:24.060 --> 02:38:25.940]   Whereas the alternate explanation
[02:38:25.940 --> 02:38:27.120]   that others have put forward,
[02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:29.020]   which I agree with and is far more sound,
[02:38:29.020 --> 02:38:33.140]   is that there is some biological reason
[02:38:33.140 --> 02:38:35.060]   why individuals who are either prone to develop
[02:38:35.060 --> 02:38:38.220]   or who have schizophrenia like cannabis.
[02:38:38.220 --> 02:38:40.220]   And they will tend to seek out
[02:38:40.220 --> 02:38:42.940]   the highest potency product they can get access to.
[02:38:42.940 --> 02:38:44.500]   So in the '70s in Sweden,
[02:38:44.500 --> 02:38:47.580]   that would have been two to 5% THC cannabis.
[02:38:47.580 --> 02:38:50.180]   Nowadays it's higher potency cannabis.
[02:38:50.180 --> 02:38:52.420]   - Or maybe they seek out lots of different forms
[02:38:52.420 --> 02:38:54.700]   of recreational drugs and cannabis just happens
[02:38:54.700 --> 02:38:56.060]   to be one that they land on.
[02:38:56.060 --> 02:38:57.860]   Which raises the other question,
[02:38:57.860 --> 02:39:00.620]   which is it's hard to imagine
[02:39:00.620 --> 02:39:02.980]   that these people who develop psychosis
[02:39:02.980 --> 02:39:06.920]   who happen to be using cannabis are only using cannabis.
[02:39:06.920 --> 02:39:08.220]   It could be, but-
[02:39:08.220 --> 02:39:09.940]   - I mean, they also, there's no question
[02:39:09.940 --> 02:39:11.940]   there's a lot of nicotine consumption.
[02:39:11.940 --> 02:39:13.840]   I mean, individuals with schizophrenia use,
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:14.960]   they smoke a lot of cigarettes.
[02:39:14.960 --> 02:39:17.020]   I mean, that's also much higher
[02:39:17.020 --> 02:39:18.340]   than the general population rate.
[02:39:18.340 --> 02:39:20.480]   - Which is known to stimulate dopaminergic
[02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:21.320]   and other path.
[02:39:21.320 --> 02:39:22.820]   - There could be other reasons.
[02:39:22.820 --> 02:39:26.100]   Again, there may be some reason why they like it.
[02:39:26.100 --> 02:39:28.460]   And I think this is something
[02:39:28.460 --> 02:39:29.640]   that I think we just don't understand.
[02:39:29.640 --> 02:39:31.980]   It's a very challenging thing to figure out why it is
[02:39:31.980 --> 02:39:33.700]   that individuals that have certain diseases
[02:39:33.700 --> 02:39:35.460]   may like certain substances.
[02:39:35.460 --> 02:39:37.740]   Is it helping them?
[02:39:37.740 --> 02:39:40.160]   I mean, some people have argued that perhaps nicotine,
[02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:42.340]   for example, might enhance cognition
[02:39:42.340 --> 02:39:43.900]   in individuals with schizophrenia.
[02:39:43.900 --> 02:39:45.140]   And that may be why they like it.
[02:39:45.140 --> 02:39:47.260]   - I think it enhances cognition in everybody.
[02:39:47.260 --> 02:39:49.180]   It just carries certain health concerns.
[02:39:49.180 --> 02:39:51.020]   And by the way, it doesn't enhance all forms
[02:39:51.020 --> 02:39:54.940]   of cognition, but there is a nice body of work
[02:39:54.940 --> 02:39:57.740]   to support the idea that nicotine delivered
[02:39:57.740 --> 02:39:59.020]   in any number of different forms
[02:39:59.020 --> 02:40:02.120]   can improve cognitive function to some extent.
[02:40:02.120 --> 02:40:03.780]   But I don't suggest people run out and do it.
[02:40:03.780 --> 02:40:07.220]   And in fact, it's one of the more quickly
[02:40:07.220 --> 02:40:10.760]   abused drugs nowadays
[02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:13.400]   because of the non-smoking delivery routes
[02:40:13.400 --> 02:40:16.180]   that are becoming really popular, pouches and things.
[02:40:16.180 --> 02:40:18.340]   In fact, I was chewing a little bit of Nicorette gum
[02:40:18.340 --> 02:40:19.980]   to kind of do an experiment.
[02:40:19.980 --> 02:40:20.980]   I liked it a lot.
[02:40:20.980 --> 02:40:23.220]   And then I decided to stop completely recently
[02:40:23.220 --> 02:40:26.700]   because it just, it wasn't having the same effect.
[02:40:26.700 --> 02:40:28.100]   And I found myself reaching for more
[02:40:28.100 --> 02:40:30.980]   and that's the time when I usually back out.
[02:40:30.980 --> 02:40:32.660]   - Well, yeah, no.
[02:40:32.660 --> 02:40:36.100]   Nicotine's a whole other thing, which I, yeah.
[02:40:36.100 --> 02:40:37.500]   - We'll have you back to talk about nicotine.
[02:40:37.500 --> 02:40:39.480]   - No, I definitely do not know enough about that
[02:40:39.480 --> 02:40:41.780]   to have any kind of informed conversation.
[02:40:41.780 --> 02:40:44.100]   So I don't know.
[02:40:44.100 --> 02:40:45.780]   I would say to me at the end of the day,
[02:40:45.780 --> 02:40:47.620]   if I put all the data together,
[02:40:47.620 --> 02:40:49.820]   what I would kind of,
[02:40:49.820 --> 02:40:52.380]   the perspective that I have on this is
[02:40:52.380 --> 02:40:54.980]   for some reason, be it genetic architecture
[02:40:54.980 --> 02:40:56.580]   or biological predisposition,
[02:40:56.580 --> 02:40:58.620]   individuals who are prone to develop schizophrenia
[02:40:58.620 --> 02:41:01.940]   also seem to be prone to use cannabis
[02:41:01.940 --> 02:41:04.720]   and use it possibly at excessive levels
[02:41:04.720 --> 02:41:07.420]   or possibly at higher potency products they seek out.
[02:41:07.420 --> 02:41:10.980]   Using cannabis, if someone is prone to develop it,
[02:41:10.980 --> 02:41:14.380]   may initiate or trigger the onset of the disease.
[02:41:14.380 --> 02:41:15.820]   And I think in the longterm,
[02:41:15.820 --> 02:41:18.340]   it will likely make the prognosis of the disease worse.
[02:41:18.340 --> 02:41:23.340]   So if you were a psychiatrist in a clinic
[02:41:23.340 --> 02:41:28.100]   and you consistently see patients presenting saying,
[02:41:28.100 --> 02:41:30.060]   I didn't have psychosis, I used cannabis,
[02:41:30.060 --> 02:41:34.260]   now I have psychosis, and it converts into schizophrenia,
[02:41:34.260 --> 02:41:38.420]   I can understand why the association would be made
[02:41:38.420 --> 02:41:42.280]   regularly that there's kind of a domino effect here
[02:41:42.280 --> 02:41:44.700]   and causality becomes attributed.
[02:41:44.700 --> 02:41:46.780]   But I think when we take a step back
[02:41:46.780 --> 02:41:50.880]   and look at the larger data in its kind of entirety,
[02:41:50.880 --> 02:41:52.940]   to me, it's a very tricky argument to make
[02:41:52.940 --> 02:41:53.820]   because there's a lot of things
[02:41:53.820 --> 02:41:56.380]   that you just can't explain from that perspective.
[02:41:56.380 --> 02:41:58.620]   And this is also one of the things
[02:41:58.620 --> 02:42:01.540]   that I find absolutely bizarre about cannabis in general
[02:42:01.540 --> 02:42:06.540]   is it's a wildly polarizing topic of conversation.
[02:42:06.540 --> 02:42:09.580]   And people have incredibly deep rooted opinions
[02:42:09.580 --> 02:42:11.820]   on both sides of the spectrum.
[02:42:11.820 --> 02:42:16.220]   And for some reason, if I don't say cannabis is the devil
[02:42:16.220 --> 02:42:19.060]   and causes disease, that means I'm an advocate.
[02:42:19.060 --> 02:42:20.400]   And then on the other side of the coin,
[02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:22.220]   if I don't say cannabis cures everything,
[02:42:22.220 --> 02:42:23.140]   I'm a prohibitionist.
[02:42:23.140 --> 02:42:24.980]   So like, I'm in this fun position
[02:42:24.980 --> 02:42:26.620]   where I get hate mail from both sides.
[02:42:26.620 --> 02:42:28.180]   And everyone just generally,
[02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:29.180]   depending on their perspective,
[02:42:29.180 --> 02:42:30.260]   thinks that I have a bias
[02:42:30.260 --> 02:42:31.540]   kind of going in one way or the other.
[02:42:31.540 --> 02:42:33.400]   And I'm very, you know, want it this way
[02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:34.240]   or want it this way.
[02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:35.060]   And at the end of the day, I'm just like,
[02:42:35.060 --> 02:42:36.100]   no, I just like data.
[02:42:36.100 --> 02:42:38.300]   So I'm like, I'm gonna try and answer things
[02:42:38.300 --> 02:42:39.280]   as best as I can with that.
[02:42:39.280 --> 02:42:42.180]   And to me, that's the perspective I've maintained.
[02:42:42.180 --> 02:42:46.580]   And I do think that like, these aren't trivial questions
[02:42:46.580 --> 02:42:48.020]   because when we went through
[02:42:48.020 --> 02:42:49.600]   the legalization process in Canada,
[02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:52.420]   this was something that came up again and again and again,
[02:42:52.420 --> 02:42:54.780]   was this association with schizophrenia.
[02:42:54.780 --> 02:42:57.780]   And in the UK, this is something that comes up again
[02:42:57.780 --> 02:42:58.660]   and again and again,
[02:42:58.660 --> 02:43:00.220]   because whenever there's any discussion
[02:43:00.220 --> 02:43:02.280]   about the UK moving forward to legalization,
[02:43:02.280 --> 02:43:03.380]   these ideas come back.
[02:43:03.380 --> 02:43:07.260]   And so the public health kind of consequence of this
[02:43:07.260 --> 02:43:08.900]   is not intangible.
[02:43:08.900 --> 02:43:11.040]   And so for people to be making
[02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:13.180]   these very strong causality arguments
[02:43:13.180 --> 02:43:16.640]   and having this kind of opinion
[02:43:16.640 --> 02:43:19.660]   that a lot of people just take up,
[02:43:19.660 --> 02:43:21.020]   I think can have a lot of influence.
[02:43:21.020 --> 02:43:22.480]   And so that's why like,
[02:43:22.480 --> 02:43:23.540]   there's literally no reason
[02:43:23.540 --> 02:43:24.780]   I should have a dog in this fight.
[02:43:24.780 --> 02:43:27.440]   I don't study schizophrenia in any capacity.
[02:43:27.440 --> 02:43:30.280]   And it's not my area of research,
[02:43:30.280 --> 02:43:32.560]   but because I'm in the cannabis field,
[02:43:32.560 --> 02:43:36.100]   I always feel very strongly that we need to maintain clarity
[02:43:36.100 --> 02:43:37.100]   over what the data says
[02:43:37.100 --> 02:43:39.660]   and not get caught in these opinion-based arguments.
[02:43:39.660 --> 02:43:41.620]   And I feel like this is one of these areas
[02:43:41.620 --> 02:43:42.900]   that has just kind of,
[02:43:42.900 --> 02:43:45.180]   the amount of people I talk to that regularly tell me
[02:43:45.180 --> 02:43:47.380]   that they know that cannabis causes schizophrenia
[02:43:47.380 --> 02:43:48.780]   and they're terrified if someone uses it,
[02:43:48.780 --> 02:43:51.700]   'cause it's gonna cause them to become schizophrenic,
[02:43:51.700 --> 02:43:53.580]   I am just kind of shocked by.
[02:43:53.580 --> 02:43:56.980]   So this has clearly permeated the general population
[02:43:56.980 --> 02:43:58.740]   that there's a widespread belief of this.
[02:43:58.740 --> 02:44:00.740]   - You know, I think it's because of these
[02:44:00.740 --> 02:44:01.980]   very high profile papers
[02:44:01.980 --> 02:44:05.240]   and the way those were picked up by traditional media.
[02:44:05.240 --> 02:44:08.520]   And this seems to be something that every couple of years,
[02:44:08.520 --> 02:44:10.720]   there's a resurgence of this idea.
[02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:12.200]   Clearly people are curious about it.
[02:44:12.200 --> 02:44:14.000]   And so I just want to say,
[02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:18.680]   thank you for clarifying what is now to me obvious
[02:44:18.680 --> 02:44:21.880]   that it could be that there's a relationship there.
[02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:24.880]   It's clearly not the case yet.
[02:44:24.880 --> 02:44:25.820]   And it may never be the case
[02:44:25.820 --> 02:44:27.580]   that there's a causal relationship there.
[02:44:27.580 --> 02:44:28.660]   And it could just as well be
[02:44:28.660 --> 02:44:31.020]   that people who have a predisposition to schizophrenia
[02:44:31.020 --> 02:44:33.520]   are seeking out cannabis use and engaging in cannabis use.
[02:44:33.520 --> 02:44:35.420]   And I think that's a very important principle
[02:44:35.420 --> 02:44:38.260]   for our listeners and viewers to just hear and understand
[02:44:38.260 --> 02:44:41.900]   anytime we're talking about a substance and a condition.
[02:44:41.900 --> 02:44:43.420]   - Yeah, and I mean, I think, again,
[02:44:43.420 --> 02:44:44.980]   this is, again, no endorsement
[02:44:44.980 --> 02:44:46.460]   that that doesn't mean that it's safe
[02:44:46.460 --> 02:44:47.620]   and that that's without harm.
[02:44:47.620 --> 02:44:49.460]   I'm just strong of the opinion
[02:44:49.460 --> 02:44:51.860]   that I don't think individuals with schizophrenia
[02:44:51.860 --> 02:44:53.780]   or who have, you know, first degree relatives
[02:44:53.780 --> 02:44:54.620]   should use cannabis
[02:44:54.620 --> 02:44:56.520]   because I think there's a high degree of risk there.
[02:44:56.520 --> 02:44:58.000]   But that's a very different argument
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.740]   than making saying cannabis causes schizophrenia.
[02:45:00.740 --> 02:45:02.260]   And if we remove it from society,
[02:45:02.260 --> 02:45:03.880]   we'll see drops in rates of schizophrenia.
[02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:05.480]   I don't believe there's any evidence
[02:45:05.480 --> 02:45:07.600]   that actually could support that.
[02:45:07.600 --> 02:45:10.280]   So it's just a nuanced argument.
[02:45:10.280 --> 02:45:13.040]   And this is a good thing about more of a long-form podcast
[02:45:13.040 --> 02:45:14.320]   is it allows for nuance.
[02:45:14.320 --> 02:45:15.740]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[02:45:15.740 --> 02:45:19.080]   Let's talk about strains of cannabis.
[02:45:19.080 --> 02:45:23.400]   I've spoken before about the sativa
[02:45:23.400 --> 02:45:25.140]   versus the indica strains.
[02:45:25.140 --> 02:45:28.200]   And certainly there is a lot, a lot, a lot
[02:45:28.200 --> 02:45:31.560]   of subjective anecdotal descriptions
[02:45:31.560 --> 02:45:35.500]   about differences in the "effects" of those
[02:45:35.500 --> 02:45:37.160]   as reported by users.
[02:45:37.160 --> 02:45:40.520]   When I talked about this before in the cannabis episode,
[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:44.040]   I leaned on a paper that took those subjective reports
[02:45:44.040 --> 02:45:46.200]   of arguably many, many people,
[02:45:46.200 --> 02:45:48.980]   pushed those subjective reports
[02:45:48.980 --> 02:45:50.640]   through what was known about the strains
[02:45:50.640 --> 02:45:51.900]   they claim to have used.
[02:45:51.900 --> 02:45:54.340]   So this is, you know, people are reporting their use.
[02:45:54.340 --> 02:45:56.680]   We assume honestly, but you always have to assume
[02:45:56.680 --> 02:45:58.500]   that there, I guess people could be lying
[02:45:58.500 --> 02:46:00.620]   about which strains or misinformed.
[02:46:00.620 --> 02:46:03.040]   But, and then using machine learning
[02:46:03.040 --> 02:46:07.380]   to couple their subjective experiences
[02:46:07.380 --> 02:46:10.700]   as they report them to indica versus sativa strains.
[02:46:10.700 --> 02:46:13.360]   And then by looking at the chemical composition
[02:46:13.360 --> 02:46:14.860]   of those different products,
[02:46:14.860 --> 02:46:16.780]   because these were products that they had consumed,
[02:46:16.780 --> 02:46:20.620]   trying to tap chemical composition to strain,
[02:46:20.620 --> 02:46:24.900]   in this case, that mainly the indica sativa discrepancy
[02:46:24.900 --> 02:46:26.860]   to subjective experience.
[02:46:26.860 --> 02:46:30.660]   And I know that you and presumably others
[02:46:30.660 --> 02:46:32.460]   in the field of cannabis research
[02:46:32.460 --> 02:46:35.460]   take real issue to that sort of approach.
[02:46:35.460 --> 02:46:38.640]   And perhaps I have the feeling
[02:46:38.640 --> 02:46:40.140]   this is what you're gonna say,
[02:46:40.140 --> 02:46:45.140]   rest on the idea that we, at least at this point in time,
[02:46:45.140 --> 02:46:47.140]   really can't say anything about
[02:46:47.140 --> 02:46:51.140]   the different biological effects of sativas versus indicas.
[02:46:51.140 --> 02:46:52.560]   And yet at the beginning of the episode,
[02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:54.900]   you said that there are many, many different
[02:46:54.900 --> 02:46:57.460]   cannabinoid compounds in cannabis.
[02:46:57.460 --> 02:47:01.540]   So three questions, and I'll keep these very short.
[02:47:01.540 --> 02:47:04.180]   One, do you think that there are different
[02:47:04.180 --> 02:47:07.100]   subjective effects of different strains of cannabis
[02:47:07.100 --> 02:47:10.520]   that can be attributed to the different strains, right?
[02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:13.020]   Not just to individual differences in experience.
[02:47:13.020 --> 02:47:15.900]   And then the second is, do you think that
[02:47:15.900 --> 02:47:18.260]   there will ever be a time in which we can understand
[02:47:18.260 --> 02:47:20.740]   this plant flower, right?
[02:47:20.740 --> 02:47:22.880]   To the extent that we can engineer it
[02:47:22.880 --> 02:47:25.560]   to provide specific subjective experiences,
[02:47:25.560 --> 02:47:27.940]   perhaps more positive than negative, et cetera.
[02:47:27.940 --> 02:47:30.980]   And then there's a third question, but I'll hold off.
[02:47:30.980 --> 02:47:34.180]   - Okay, so, yes.
[02:47:34.180 --> 02:47:38.940]   So going back to just the idea with the indica sativa thing.
[02:47:38.940 --> 02:47:43.700]   So the indica and sativa names,
[02:47:43.700 --> 02:47:45.780]   at least from everything I've understood
[02:47:45.780 --> 02:47:47.980]   from everyone that I talked to and being in this field,
[02:47:47.980 --> 02:47:50.140]   is those are botanical terms
[02:47:50.140 --> 02:47:52.540]   that largely refer to shape of the plant,
[02:47:52.540 --> 02:47:55.020]   the way the bud grows, blah, blah, blah.
[02:47:55.020 --> 02:47:58.400]   They do not track with chemical composition in any way.
[02:47:58.400 --> 02:48:03.700]   In fact, Nick Jacobus has done like a lot of analysis
[02:48:03.700 --> 02:48:07.160]   of like thousands and thousands of different kinds
[02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:08.900]   of cannabis that have been submitted
[02:48:08.900 --> 02:48:13.820]   for kind of biochemical analysis to understand THC, CBD,
[02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:16.020]   terpenes, minor cannabinoid content.
[02:48:16.020 --> 02:48:20.740]   And essentially his work, as well as from all the people
[02:48:20.740 --> 02:48:25.260]   that have done the genetics on this is the variability
[02:48:25.260 --> 02:48:29.340]   that exists within what someone calls an indica or a sativa
[02:48:29.340 --> 02:48:33.540]   is greater than the variability that there is between them.
[02:48:33.540 --> 02:48:37.560]   And there is no such thing as a chemical profile
[02:48:37.560 --> 02:48:39.260]   that exists in something that's a sativa
[02:48:39.260 --> 02:48:40.900]   versus something that's an indica.
[02:48:40.900 --> 02:48:43.020]   - Is it possible that there's a chemical profile
[02:48:43.020 --> 02:48:45.500]   that relates to the most common indicas
[02:48:45.500 --> 02:48:46.980]   or most common sativas?
[02:48:46.980 --> 02:48:48.660]   - I mean, I think in Nick's analysis,
[02:48:48.660 --> 02:48:50.980]   there was like a couple of terpenes
[02:48:50.980 --> 02:48:53.180]   that may have loaded on a little bit
[02:48:53.180 --> 02:48:54.380]   onto things that were sativas,
[02:48:54.380 --> 02:48:56.260]   but there was tons of sativas
[02:48:56.260 --> 02:48:57.700]   that didn't fall into that bracket.
[02:48:57.700 --> 02:49:00.700]   - Okay, well then that immediately to me negates
[02:49:00.700 --> 02:49:03.860]   the sort of premise of this paper that I was referring to
[02:49:03.860 --> 02:49:06.420]   that divides according to indica sativa.
[02:49:06.420 --> 02:49:08.640]   And yet the paper is also trying to distinguish
[02:49:08.640 --> 02:49:12.060]   among all the different types or products of cannabis.
[02:49:12.060 --> 02:49:16.420]   Meaning, is there some other feature of the cannabis plant
[02:49:16.420 --> 02:49:18.860]   that does relate to these different subjective effects?
[02:49:18.860 --> 02:49:23.000]   Because people do seem to get different subjective effects
[02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:26.060]   from different products that relate in some way to things
[02:49:26.060 --> 02:49:28.180]   other than the concentration of THC.
[02:49:28.180 --> 02:49:30.620]   - Yeah, I would, my honest opinion
[02:49:30.620 --> 02:49:32.020]   is this is expectancy bias.
[02:49:32.020 --> 02:49:33.540]   This is all expectancy bias.
[02:49:33.540 --> 02:49:34.380]   I mean- - I see.
[02:49:34.380 --> 02:49:35.700]   So they purchase something that they think
[02:49:35.700 --> 02:49:37.420]   is gonna make them calm and it makes them feel calm.
[02:49:37.420 --> 02:49:40.400]   - If 20 people tell you that taking this makes you calm,
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:42.460]   you cannot remove your expectation bias
[02:49:42.460 --> 02:49:44.660]   from the fact that when you consume it, you feel calm.
[02:49:44.660 --> 02:49:47.460]   Like, and this has been, I think,
[02:49:47.460 --> 02:49:49.820]   one of the most common things with cannabis
[02:49:49.820 --> 02:49:52.140]   is like this whole area is so ripe
[02:49:52.140 --> 02:49:54.880]   with these expectancy biases that people have
[02:49:54.880 --> 02:49:56.940]   about what they assume.
[02:49:56.940 --> 02:49:58.940]   If you go, someone goes into, you know,
[02:49:58.940 --> 02:50:00.340]   and a bud tender tells them,
[02:50:00.340 --> 02:50:03.000]   "This is a sativa, it's gonna energize you."
[02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.260]   There's no way to remove that expectancy bias
[02:50:05.260 --> 02:50:06.800]   from what you get.
[02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:10.040]   And I mean, like from talking to a lot of people
[02:50:10.040 --> 02:50:11.860]   that kind of study this more explicitly,
[02:50:11.860 --> 02:50:13.140]   they always say the biggest predictor
[02:50:13.140 --> 02:50:15.140]   of what someone feels when they consume cannabis
[02:50:15.140 --> 02:50:17.780]   is what they're told on the label it's gonna do to them.
[02:50:17.780 --> 02:50:19.600]   I mean, and a lot of- - It's pretty wild.
[02:50:19.600 --> 02:50:20.440]   It speaks to, you know,
[02:50:20.440 --> 02:50:21.980]   I did an episode on the placebo effect.
[02:50:21.980 --> 02:50:23.020]   - Yeah, it's similar. - And a lot of people
[02:50:23.020 --> 02:50:24.100]   hear placebo effect and they go,
[02:50:24.100 --> 02:50:25.580]   "Okay, well, then everything's a placebo."
[02:50:25.580 --> 02:50:27.260]   The placebo effect is amazing.
[02:50:27.260 --> 02:50:29.300]   There's dose response to the placebo effect
[02:50:29.300 --> 02:50:31.660]   of nicotine on cognition, dose response.
[02:50:31.660 --> 02:50:33.080]   If you're told you got a high dose
[02:50:33.080 --> 02:50:34.840]   when you actually got a low dose,
[02:50:34.840 --> 02:50:36.620]   you will exhibit the high dose
[02:50:36.620 --> 02:50:39.240]   neurocognitive enhancement effect.
[02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:40.500]   And by brain imaging,
[02:50:40.500 --> 02:50:43.300]   it shows a high dose-like enhancement
[02:50:43.300 --> 02:50:44.700]   of the relevant brain areas.
[02:50:44.700 --> 02:50:46.900]   In other words, the expectancy drives changes
[02:50:46.900 --> 02:50:48.300]   in brain activity. - It's across the board.
[02:50:48.300 --> 02:50:51.300]   I mean, again, this is not unique to cannabis in any way.
[02:50:51.300 --> 02:50:53.440]   It's just cannabis is so ripe for this
[02:50:53.440 --> 02:50:57.140]   because of the lore that it just exists.
[02:50:57.140 --> 02:50:58.780]   Like people say this.
[02:50:58.780 --> 02:51:00.440]   I mean, the issue has been,
[02:51:00.440 --> 02:51:03.020]   and I just asked Ryan Vandery this.
[02:51:03.020 --> 02:51:04.200]   As far as I know,
[02:51:04.200 --> 02:51:06.980]   I don't believe there's actually ever been a clinical trial
[02:51:06.980 --> 02:51:08.340]   that has blinded people
[02:51:08.340 --> 02:51:10.780]   and given them sativas or indicas
[02:51:10.780 --> 02:51:12.620]   and actually had them predict what they are
[02:51:12.620 --> 02:51:14.380]   or been able to characterize
[02:51:14.380 --> 02:51:16.380]   any kind of phenotypic description
[02:51:16.380 --> 02:51:19.100]   of what that intoxicated state feels like.
[02:51:19.100 --> 02:51:21.600]   And because all the,
[02:51:21.600 --> 02:51:23.460]   like the paper that you were referring to
[02:51:23.460 --> 02:51:26.740]   where it was users who had got the product,
[02:51:26.740 --> 02:51:29.780]   they can't remove their own inherent biases
[02:51:29.780 --> 02:51:31.660]   from their own experience.
[02:51:31.660 --> 02:51:33.500]   It's gonna influence it.
[02:51:33.500 --> 02:51:34.580]   There's no way around it.
[02:51:34.660 --> 02:51:38.420]   And so people kind of lean into this
[02:51:38.420 --> 02:51:41.060]   and probably not consciously,
[02:51:41.060 --> 02:51:42.820]   but they, I mean, the amount of people I've talked to
[02:51:42.820 --> 02:51:46.540]   that really genuinely believe this to their core
[02:51:46.540 --> 02:51:49.680]   that sativa does this and indica does this
[02:51:49.680 --> 02:51:51.340]   is fascinating to me.
[02:51:51.340 --> 02:51:53.660]   Because again, like you have these two,
[02:51:53.660 --> 02:51:55.580]   like THC is what drives the high.
[02:51:55.580 --> 02:51:56.900]   That's very clear.
[02:51:56.900 --> 02:51:58.860]   And you can take a sativa and an indica
[02:51:58.860 --> 02:52:02.260]   that have virtually identical levels of THC
[02:52:02.260 --> 02:52:03.660]   and yet people will report
[02:52:03.660 --> 02:52:05.860]   very different intoxicating states that come out of that.
[02:52:05.860 --> 02:52:10.500]   - Do you think this also explains the lore
[02:52:10.500 --> 02:52:12.460]   or perhaps it's real
[02:52:12.460 --> 02:52:15.280]   that different alcohols produce different drunks?
[02:52:15.280 --> 02:52:18.140]   You know, I mean, I've heard of,
[02:52:18.140 --> 02:52:19.220]   I've got friends who will swear
[02:52:19.220 --> 02:52:21.020]   that whiskey makes them feel aggressive
[02:52:21.020 --> 02:52:23.140]   and vodka is mellow
[02:52:23.140 --> 02:52:27.060]   and white tequilas feel different than the other tequilas.
[02:52:27.060 --> 02:52:28.980]   And for people listening to this,
[02:52:28.980 --> 02:52:30.140]   they go, okay, well, that's not science.
[02:52:30.140 --> 02:52:31.240]   I agree, that's not science.
[02:52:31.240 --> 02:52:33.020]   That's just anecdote.
[02:52:33.020 --> 02:52:36.300]   And yet, you know,
[02:52:36.300 --> 02:52:38.460]   the chemical composition of these different drinks
[02:52:38.460 --> 02:52:41.300]   is different, but ultimately we're talking about alcohol,
[02:52:41.300 --> 02:52:42.140]   right?
[02:52:42.140 --> 02:52:43.360]   Different sugar contents, you know,
[02:52:43.360 --> 02:52:44.540]   different hangover propensity.
[02:52:44.540 --> 02:52:46.020]   - I mean, I have to believe the majority
[02:52:46.020 --> 02:52:47.540]   that's an expectancy bias.
[02:52:47.540 --> 02:52:49.180]   I have a hard time believing that these things
[02:52:49.180 --> 02:52:51.660]   are really driven by fundamental biological differences
[02:52:51.660 --> 02:52:53.020]   within, 'cause anything else that's,
[02:52:53.020 --> 02:52:55.180]   I mean, that's the thing like,
[02:52:55.180 --> 02:52:56.540]   sure, some of the labs now,
[02:52:56.540 --> 02:52:58.420]   there is a movement to start looking at
[02:52:58.420 --> 02:53:01.760]   can certain compositions of other things in cannabis
[02:53:01.760 --> 02:53:04.160]   start to maybe modulate or influence?
[02:53:04.160 --> 02:53:05.760]   This is called, like I think I've said this before,
[02:53:05.760 --> 02:53:07.520]   the entourage effect, this idea
[02:53:07.520 --> 02:53:09.200]   that THC alone might do one thing,
[02:53:09.200 --> 02:53:12.120]   but then layering in other terpenes
[02:53:12.120 --> 02:53:14.200]   or minor cannabinoids may influence that effect.
[02:53:14.200 --> 02:53:15.600]   That is a theory.
[02:53:15.600 --> 02:53:18.420]   That's not a thing that we know definitively in any way.
[02:53:18.420 --> 02:53:19.840]   And in fact, there's virtually no research
[02:53:19.840 --> 02:53:21.440]   that's ever been done to test this.
[02:53:21.440 --> 02:53:23.360]   There's some stuff that's starting to come out now,
[02:53:23.360 --> 02:53:27.060]   like Ryan Vandrie at Hopkins recently published a paper
[02:53:27.060 --> 02:53:28.920]   where they kind of, in a dose-dependent manner,
[02:53:28.920 --> 02:53:31.240]   added limonene, which is one of these terpenes,
[02:53:31.240 --> 02:53:33.440]   like I said, I think gives it like a citrusy odor,
[02:53:33.440 --> 02:53:38.000]   into the THC and did find at a really high dose,
[02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:39.320]   probably a dose that I don't think
[02:53:39.320 --> 02:53:41.000]   you could actually find in cannabis.
[02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:41.920]   It's a little bit higher
[02:53:41.920 --> 02:53:43.080]   than what you would have gotten there,
[02:53:43.080 --> 02:53:45.600]   but limonene did seem to be able to curb
[02:53:45.600 --> 02:53:48.120]   the ability of high-dose THC to make someone feel anxious.
[02:53:48.120 --> 02:53:49.620]   And this was done in a blinded manner.
[02:53:49.620 --> 02:53:53.620]   So there's, I think, some validity to the interaction,
[02:53:53.620 --> 02:53:56.000]   whether that's occurring in cannabis, naturally,
[02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.760]   because of the levels of THC to limonene, I don't know,
[02:53:58.760 --> 02:54:00.780]   but it really was one of the first demonstrations
[02:54:00.780 --> 02:54:03.840]   that adding in a terpene could actually influence
[02:54:03.840 --> 02:54:08.840]   a component of the intoxicated state in a blinded manner,
[02:54:08.840 --> 02:54:09.840]   I think is interesting.
[02:54:09.840 --> 02:54:11.560]   And Ziva Cooper, who's here at UCLA,
[02:54:11.560 --> 02:54:13.600]   is doing some work with beta-caryophyllene,
[02:54:13.600 --> 02:54:17.800]   which is probably the second most abundant terpene,
[02:54:17.800 --> 02:54:19.320]   I think, from Nick Giacomas' work.
[02:54:19.320 --> 02:54:21.720]   I think myrcine may have been the highest prevalent terpene
[02:54:21.720 --> 02:54:23.480]   across all types of cannabis.
[02:54:23.480 --> 02:54:25.040]   Beta-caryophyllene's probably the second,
[02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:27.960]   and limonene, I think, is probably the third.
[02:54:27.960 --> 02:54:32.780]   And so, I think they, I mean, and so they're looking at,
[02:54:32.780 --> 02:54:34.920]   I think Ziva's work is in the context of pain.
[02:54:34.920 --> 02:54:37.160]   So they're trying to look at if a fixed dose of THC,
[02:54:37.160 --> 02:54:39.160]   if you add in varying levels of beta-caryophyllene,
[02:54:39.160 --> 02:54:40.040]   does this influence this?
[02:54:40.040 --> 02:54:42.760]   So, because again, you do see this in patient communities
[02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:44.440]   where they say, well, this strain helps my pain
[02:54:44.440 --> 02:54:45.800]   better than that strain.
[02:54:45.800 --> 02:54:48.440]   And so it's like, okay, is there actual legitimacy to this?
[02:54:48.440 --> 02:54:50.320]   Or again, is this just an expectancy bias
[02:54:50.320 --> 02:54:52.680]   because someone who sold this to you told you
[02:54:52.680 --> 02:54:54.660]   that this strain is better for pain?
[02:54:54.660 --> 02:54:57.120]   And the problem is these are all subjective endpoints.
[02:54:57.120 --> 02:54:59.600]   I mean, this is like pain, sleep, anxiety.
[02:54:59.600 --> 02:55:01.120]   These are all, I mean, it's how someone
[02:55:01.120 --> 02:55:01.960]   personally experiences it.
[02:55:01.960 --> 02:55:04.860]   And we know from all the clinical trials that study
[02:55:04.860 --> 02:55:07.840]   pain, sleep, and anxiety, there's massive placebo effects
[02:55:07.840 --> 02:55:09.840]   that happen in all these conditions.
[02:55:09.840 --> 02:55:13.600]   And so it's very difficult to actually make any kind
[02:55:13.600 --> 02:55:16.240]   of sound statements about this in the absence
[02:55:16.240 --> 02:55:18.520]   of there being kind of clinical trials
[02:55:18.520 --> 02:55:19.860]   that have clearly started to do this.
[02:55:19.860 --> 02:55:21.920]   But it's like, as you can imagine,
[02:55:21.920 --> 02:55:23.040]   when you start doing the math,
[02:55:23.040 --> 02:55:25.260]   given the amount of terpenes and the amount of combinations
[02:55:25.260 --> 02:55:27.680]   at different levels, how overwhelming this could become.
[02:55:27.680 --> 02:55:29.280]   'Cause maybe, you know, there's a few that you need
[02:55:29.280 --> 02:55:31.840]   in there that interact with THC, not just one.
[02:55:31.840 --> 02:55:33.680]   There is like a lot of work that's happened
[02:55:33.680 --> 02:55:35.660]   in the last few years that has really started
[02:55:35.660 --> 02:55:37.240]   to try and look at if these terpenes
[02:55:37.240 --> 02:55:39.880]   or minor cannabinoids act at the cannabinoid receptor,
[02:55:39.880 --> 02:55:40.960]   which none of them seem to.
[02:55:40.960 --> 02:55:43.960]   So this isn't like you've got things that modulate
[02:55:43.960 --> 02:55:46.220]   how THC is binding to CB1.
[02:55:46.220 --> 02:55:47.660]   If they're doing something else,
[02:55:47.660 --> 02:55:49.480]   it's probably through an interaction
[02:55:49.480 --> 02:55:50.760]   with another neurochemical system
[02:55:50.760 --> 02:55:53.080]   that's influencing what THC is doing.
[02:55:53.080 --> 02:55:57.400]   So I'm not against the idea that like different chemovars
[02:55:57.400 --> 02:56:00.960]   or what people call strains of cannabis
[02:56:00.960 --> 02:56:03.680]   could do different things subjectively.
[02:56:03.680 --> 02:56:05.120]   I just am remiss to believe this
[02:56:05.120 --> 02:56:06.480]   until I see some blinded data.
[02:56:06.480 --> 02:56:08.980]   Because I think outside of that,
[02:56:08.980 --> 02:56:10.960]   we know how powerful an expectancy bias is.
[02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:13.380]   So it makes it very, very challenging
[02:56:13.380 --> 02:56:15.760]   to make any kind of firm statements.
[02:56:15.760 --> 02:56:19.880]   And so kind of in the context of like how you introduce this,
[02:56:19.880 --> 02:56:22.880]   that was, again, I think like one of the issues
[02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:24.480]   that I took with the other podcast
[02:56:24.480 --> 02:56:27.180]   was because as you've said,
[02:56:27.180 --> 02:56:29.360]   I understand the thought process you went through.
[02:56:29.360 --> 02:56:30.900]   Like you had this paper
[02:56:30.900 --> 02:56:32.920]   where people were reporting subjective effects.
[02:56:32.920 --> 02:56:34.120]   There's some neuroimaging data
[02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:35.000]   that's been done with cannabis.
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.960]   So you kind of said, okay, this is what that was.
[02:56:37.960 --> 02:56:39.360]   And that was what Sativa did
[02:56:39.360 --> 02:56:41.680]   and versus this is what Indica did.
[02:56:41.680 --> 02:56:43.680]   So I think it's important that you explain that.
[02:56:43.680 --> 02:56:44.680]   'Cause I do think that like-
[02:56:44.680 --> 02:56:46.240]   - Well, that's what the data pointed to.
[02:56:46.240 --> 02:56:47.840]   But now what I'm realizing is that
[02:56:47.840 --> 02:56:49.960]   anytime we're talking about cannabis,
[02:56:49.960 --> 02:56:53.620]   because of the 70 plus cannabinoids present
[02:56:53.620 --> 02:56:57.320]   that could modify or join,
[02:56:57.320 --> 02:56:59.980]   so work in parallel with the effects of THC,
[02:56:59.980 --> 02:57:01.960]   we're really talking about polypharmacology.
[02:57:01.960 --> 02:57:02.880]   It's not a pure subject.
[02:57:02.880 --> 02:57:04.840]   It's not like giving anandamide
[02:57:04.840 --> 02:57:08.640]   or it's not like adjusting levels of endogenous anandamide.
[02:57:08.640 --> 02:57:10.900]   This raises, I think, an equally important issue
[02:57:10.900 --> 02:57:13.320]   for us to resolve, which is CBD,
[02:57:13.320 --> 02:57:14.400]   which we didn't talk about earlier.
[02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:17.360]   When Nolan Williams, who's a psychiatrist,
[02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:18.440]   he's one of these phenoms,
[02:57:18.440 --> 02:57:21.960]   triple board certified psychiatry neurology,
[02:57:21.960 --> 02:57:23.960]   colleague of mine from Stanford School of Medicine,
[02:57:23.960 --> 02:57:25.600]   who mainly works on Ibogaine
[02:57:25.600 --> 02:57:27.080]   and transcranial magnetic stimulation.
[02:57:27.080 --> 02:57:30.180]   But we talked about cannabis a bit
[02:57:30.180 --> 02:57:31.160]   when he was on the podcast.
[02:57:31.160 --> 02:57:33.800]   And he mentioned a strain of cannabis
[02:57:33.800 --> 02:57:37.440]   that is available in Colorado, which is pure CBD.
[02:57:37.440 --> 02:57:40.800]   I think it's called Charlotte's Web.
[02:57:40.800 --> 02:57:45.800]   And the parents of children who have epilepsy
[02:57:46.520 --> 02:57:50.560]   will move there or go there just to get this strain
[02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:53.400]   because it seems to help their epileptic seizures.
[02:57:53.400 --> 02:57:54.240]   - Yeah, I mean, I would say
[02:57:54.240 --> 02:57:55.360]   that's definitely not true nowadays.
[02:57:55.360 --> 02:57:58.780]   That pre-legalization anywhere outside of Colorado,
[02:57:58.780 --> 02:57:59.620]   that was true.
[02:57:59.620 --> 02:58:01.640]   People were gravitating there towards it.
[02:58:01.640 --> 02:58:03.560]   - Yeah, so the questions are,
[02:58:03.560 --> 02:58:04.400]   could you tell us a little bit
[02:58:04.400 --> 02:58:07.000]   about the biology of the CBD receptor,
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.760]   mainly as it relates to CB1 or not?
[02:58:09.760 --> 02:58:12.040]   Does it bind CB1 as well?
[02:58:12.040 --> 02:58:13.560]   If not, how is it working?
[02:58:13.560 --> 02:58:15.280]   And you mentioned that people will not report
[02:58:15.280 --> 02:58:18.000]   any subjective effect of taking a pure CBD compound,
[02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:19.420]   so lacking THC.
[02:58:19.420 --> 02:58:21.920]   But it sounds like it may have some usefulness
[02:58:21.920 --> 02:58:24.040]   for treatment of epilepsy.
[02:58:24.040 --> 02:58:27.240]   And what are some other established,
[02:58:27.240 --> 02:58:31.680]   meaning clinical trials and/or lab data
[02:58:31.680 --> 02:58:33.940]   to support the use of CBD for any type
[02:58:33.940 --> 02:58:38.200]   of either psychiatric condition, pain, et cetera?
[02:58:38.200 --> 02:58:39.900]   - So, I mean, the first thing that's interesting
[02:58:39.900 --> 02:58:41.560]   that I think a lot of people don't understand
[02:58:41.560 --> 02:58:46.560]   about CBD is CBD doesn't really exist
[02:58:46.560 --> 02:58:48.080]   in any form of street cannabis.
[02:58:48.080 --> 02:58:49.680]   And it hasn't for a very long time.
[02:58:49.680 --> 02:58:51.480]   - You mean there's no CBD in there?
[02:58:51.480 --> 02:58:52.300]   - There's some.
[02:58:52.300 --> 02:58:54.160]   There's very, very low levels of CBD.
[02:58:54.160 --> 02:58:58.000]   And the reason that is is because THC and CBD
[02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.440]   are both made from the same precursor molecule.
[02:59:00.440 --> 02:59:02.600]   And which direction it goes in is based purely
[02:59:02.600 --> 02:59:06.600]   on which synthetic enzyme converts it to either THC or CBD.
[02:59:06.600 --> 02:59:10.680]   And so as people have clearly chased THC
[02:59:10.680 --> 02:59:12.520]   and wanted cannabis that's rich in THC,
[02:59:12.520 --> 02:59:13.680]   and so cannabis has been bred
[02:59:13.680 --> 02:59:15.680]   to become higher content in THC,
[02:59:15.680 --> 02:59:18.880]   by default, CBD has been bred out of the plant.
[02:59:18.880 --> 02:59:20.700]   And it has largely been bred out of the plant
[02:59:20.700 --> 02:59:22.440]   for quite some time.
[02:59:22.440 --> 02:59:25.400]   And so this, I always find it interesting
[02:59:25.400 --> 02:59:27.200]   that there's this community that's like,
[02:59:27.200 --> 02:59:29.600]   oh, well, THC is the recreational cannabis
[02:59:29.600 --> 02:59:31.000]   and CBD is the medical cannabis.
[02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:32.640]   And I'm always like, that's bizarre.
[02:59:32.640 --> 02:59:35.360]   Because historically, there's always been,
[02:59:35.360 --> 02:59:38.400]   like THC has been what people have bred cannabis for.
[02:59:38.400 --> 02:59:40.680]   And so kind of any medical benefits
[02:59:40.680 --> 02:59:42.880]   that people have reported from cannabis per se,
[02:59:42.880 --> 02:59:45.960]   usually are THC and CB1 driven.
[02:59:45.960 --> 02:59:48.880]   CBD is this other molecule that,
[02:59:48.880 --> 02:59:50.200]   we can go into the pharmacology in a second,
[02:59:50.200 --> 02:59:53.520]   but again, it's just, it's, I mean,
[02:59:53.520 --> 02:59:56.000]   I think in the analysis that Nick Jachomas did
[02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:59.380]   of all these strains and types of cannabis that exist
[02:59:59.380 --> 03:00:01.400]   in the United States, when they went through their thing
[03:00:01.400 --> 03:00:03.400]   of thousands and thousands of kinds of cannabis,
[03:00:03.400 --> 03:00:07.500]   it was like 3% of them maybe had like more than 1% CBD.
[03:00:07.500 --> 03:00:09.640]   Like it's very low, like there's almost none.
[03:00:09.640 --> 03:00:13.000]   And in Canada to get a CBD rich strain,
[03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.160]   you have to basically explicitly buy it
[03:00:15.160 --> 03:00:18.120]   because it has to be bred to make CBD.
[03:00:18.120 --> 03:00:20.240]   And so this is the kind of chemo of our distinction.
[03:00:20.240 --> 03:00:21.680]   I think you did allude to this last time,
[03:00:21.680 --> 03:00:23.160]   which is the type one, type two, type three.
[03:00:23.160 --> 03:00:27.080]   So type one is high THC, type two is like somewhat balanced
[03:00:27.080 --> 03:00:28.280]   and type three is high CBD.
[03:00:28.280 --> 03:00:32.320]   And now I think like 90 to 90 something low percent
[03:00:32.320 --> 03:00:34.360]   of all cannabises that are out there are type one.
[03:00:34.360 --> 03:00:36.960]   Like they're all high THC 'cause that's what's been bred.
[03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:39.120]   There's a few that have been mixed.
[03:00:39.120 --> 03:00:40.840]   And so are kind of equal proportions,
[03:00:40.840 --> 03:00:43.200]   but you're never gonna get high equal proportions.
[03:00:43.200 --> 03:00:47.380]   So like a high THC cannabis is like 20 to 30%.
[03:00:47.380 --> 03:00:49.160]   If you go for type two, which is mixed,
[03:00:49.160 --> 03:00:52.240]   they're both gonna fall around 12%,
[03:00:52.240 --> 03:00:53.720]   maybe a little more, but in that range.
[03:00:53.720 --> 03:00:55.720]   And then same if you've got a type three, it's high CBD,
[03:00:55.720 --> 03:00:59.040]   it's gonna be 20-ish percent CBD and very low THC.
[03:00:59.040 --> 03:01:02.520]   And so no one has ever kind of grown CBD rich cannabis
[03:01:02.520 --> 03:01:05.720]   outside of this recent boom in the last decade
[03:01:05.720 --> 03:01:08.000]   that's happened about people wanting CBD
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:09.120]   because of the Charlotte's Web,
[03:01:09.120 --> 03:01:13.600]   which was popularized by I think Sanjay Gupta on CNN
[03:01:13.600 --> 03:01:16.200]   in like 2012 or something, it was a while ago.
[03:01:16.200 --> 03:01:17.740]   But that was what got a huge movement
[03:01:17.740 --> 03:01:20.120]   going around this idea of CBD.
[03:01:20.120 --> 03:01:22.760]   And yeah, so the Charlotte's Web was like,
[03:01:22.760 --> 03:01:24.120]   I believe that was what they had named
[03:01:24.120 --> 03:01:25.920]   that kind of cannabis that they'd extracted it from.
[03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:28.280]   And so it was a tincture that they were using
[03:01:28.280 --> 03:01:31.000]   that was very high CBD content that they were finding
[03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:34.420]   was controlling pediatric seizures in kids.
[03:01:34.420 --> 03:01:38.480]   Now, this has actually been studied pretty effectively.
[03:01:38.480 --> 03:01:40.380]   Most of it's come out of Boston.
[03:01:40.380 --> 03:01:44.720]   Elizabeth Thiel has been one of the main leads on this
[03:01:44.720 --> 03:01:46.400]   and she's a neurologist there
[03:01:46.400 --> 03:01:48.320]   that has done a lot of the work on this.
[03:01:48.320 --> 03:01:50.760]   And so they have, I think very clearly,
[03:01:50.760 --> 03:01:52.700]   and the data is incredibly compelling.
[03:01:52.700 --> 03:01:54.040]   Their research is one of the reasons
[03:01:54.040 --> 03:01:57.240]   why CBD has been descheduled or changed in its scheduling
[03:01:57.240 --> 03:01:59.320]   down to a, what is it, five?
[03:01:59.320 --> 03:02:00.240]   What is it, class?
[03:02:00.240 --> 03:02:02.320]   - CBD?
[03:02:02.320 --> 03:02:03.140]   - Yeah, like CBD.
[03:02:03.400 --> 03:02:07.640]   I mean, given the availability of CBD everywhere
[03:02:07.640 --> 03:02:09.240]   in gummies and drinks.
[03:02:09.240 --> 03:02:12.360]   And I mean, you can get it in a convenience store.
[03:02:12.360 --> 03:02:14.840]   - So it's been kind of, a lot of it's been like shifted
[03:02:14.840 --> 03:02:16.320]   in its classification status
[03:02:16.320 --> 03:02:19.320]   because it actually has been shown very clearly
[03:02:19.320 --> 03:02:20.500]   to have medical benefit.
[03:02:20.500 --> 03:02:23.160]   And so it was very specific.
[03:02:23.160 --> 03:02:25.360]   It was a very specific form of pediatric epilepsy
[03:02:25.360 --> 03:02:26.540]   called Dravet syndrome.
[03:02:26.540 --> 03:02:29.680]   Now, there's other forms of pediatric epilepsy.
[03:02:29.680 --> 03:02:32.080]   I know Elizabeth has studied in addition
[03:02:32.080 --> 03:02:34.640]   that has found comparable levels of efficacy,
[03:02:34.640 --> 03:02:36.680]   but essentially what they have shown
[03:02:36.680 --> 03:02:40.440]   is that like very high doses of CBD
[03:02:40.440 --> 03:02:45.040]   are relatively effective at calming down the seizures.
[03:02:45.040 --> 03:02:46.980]   In some kids, it's profound.
[03:02:46.980 --> 03:02:48.720]   Like in some kids, you're talking about kids
[03:02:48.720 --> 03:02:50.760]   that were having dozens of seizures a day
[03:02:50.760 --> 03:02:51.920]   to essentially none.
[03:02:51.920 --> 03:02:54.140]   And so, and I can understand.
[03:02:54.140 --> 03:02:55.240]   - Yeah, that's super impressive.
[03:02:55.240 --> 03:02:56.520]   - From a grassroots perspective,
[03:02:56.520 --> 03:02:58.240]   I can understand if you were a parent
[03:02:58.240 --> 03:03:00.240]   who had a child with a disease like this
[03:03:00.240 --> 03:03:03.320]   that was largely intractable and not that well controlled
[03:03:03.320 --> 03:03:04.400]   from the medications they were on.
[03:03:04.400 --> 03:03:06.300]   And then something came around
[03:03:06.300 --> 03:03:07.800]   that showed this level of efficacy,
[03:03:07.800 --> 03:03:09.200]   you would gravitate towards it.
[03:03:09.200 --> 03:03:10.600]   Like that makes sense to me.
[03:03:10.600 --> 03:03:12.160]   And I think the work that Elizabeth
[03:03:12.160 --> 03:03:14.120]   and her colleagues have done has been really important
[03:03:14.120 --> 03:03:17.080]   to establish the efficacy of this,
[03:03:17.080 --> 03:03:21.240]   of CBD in these disease states.
[03:03:21.240 --> 03:03:23.120]   And so I don't think at this point,
[03:03:23.120 --> 03:03:25.040]   there's a lot of controversy around that.
[03:03:25.040 --> 03:03:27.240]   The question that comes out though is,
[03:03:27.240 --> 03:03:28.480]   so how is it working?
[03:03:28.480 --> 03:03:30.240]   And we don't have a mechanism.
[03:03:30.240 --> 03:03:32.840]   So as you had said, like CBD receptor,
[03:03:32.840 --> 03:03:35.520]   there is no CBD, like there's no receptor that CBD binds to.
[03:03:35.520 --> 03:03:37.160]   - I was under the impression that CBD
[03:03:37.160 --> 03:03:40.520]   also bound to the CB1 receptor.
[03:03:40.520 --> 03:03:42.480]   - No, I mean, certainly not.
[03:03:42.480 --> 03:03:44.600]   - Or that under some conditions,
[03:03:44.600 --> 03:03:47.920]   it can modulate the shape of the receptor
[03:03:47.920 --> 03:03:49.600]   to adjust THC binding.
[03:03:49.600 --> 03:03:50.480]   But now you're telling me
[03:03:50.480 --> 03:03:52.720]   that these two things rarely coexist together.
[03:03:52.720 --> 03:03:53.760]   So I guess the question--
[03:03:53.760 --> 03:03:54.860]   - You can dose them.
[03:03:54.860 --> 03:03:56.160]   Like you can certainly, I mean,
[03:03:56.160 --> 03:03:57.680]   you can have products that are made
[03:03:57.680 --> 03:03:59.720]   that are like oil-based products, at least,
[03:03:59.720 --> 03:04:01.120]   that have a certain amount of CBD
[03:04:01.120 --> 03:04:03.400]   and a certain amount of THC, and people do go for those.
[03:04:03.400 --> 03:04:04.680]   And there's this, I mean,
[03:04:04.680 --> 03:04:05.920]   one of the arguments people make is they say,
[03:04:05.920 --> 03:04:09.000]   oh, introducing CBD reduces the adverse effects of THC.
[03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:10.840]   And like, well, if you're using it in a strain,
[03:04:10.840 --> 03:04:13.520]   that's simply because the strain of cannabis has less THC.
[03:04:13.520 --> 03:04:14.480]   - Right, so it's impossible to separate.
[03:04:14.480 --> 03:04:15.320]   - So you bred it out.
[03:04:15.320 --> 03:04:17.840]   But I mean, like a lot of this was based on some work
[03:04:17.840 --> 03:04:19.940]   that came out a long time ago from Brazil,
[03:04:19.940 --> 03:04:22.760]   where they showed that like giving CBD
[03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:24.360]   with a relatively high dose of THC
[03:04:24.360 --> 03:04:28.240]   could curb some anxiety that came out from high dose THC.
[03:04:28.240 --> 03:04:29.760]   - I thought the explanation for that
[03:04:29.760 --> 03:04:34.720]   was that CBD can modify the CB1 receptor
[03:04:34.720 --> 03:04:36.880]   in some way that makes THC less able
[03:04:36.880 --> 03:04:39.360]   to engage with the THC. - There is some evidence
[03:04:39.360 --> 03:04:40.320]   to support that,
[03:04:40.320 --> 03:04:42.880]   that like we would call these allosteric modulators.
[03:04:42.880 --> 03:04:44.920]   There's some evidence to suggest that CBD
[03:04:44.920 --> 03:04:48.020]   may interact with a allosteric site
[03:04:48.020 --> 03:04:51.680]   on the cannabinoid receptor that makes THC bind less.
[03:04:51.680 --> 03:04:53.300]   - Doesn't sound like you're particularly convinced
[03:04:53.300 --> 03:04:54.140]   by that evidence.
[03:04:54.140 --> 03:04:56.200]   I'm looking at the look on your face.
[03:04:56.200 --> 03:04:58.040]   For those listening, I'm looking at Matt,
[03:04:58.040 --> 03:05:00.180]   and I think he's being generous here.
[03:05:00.180 --> 03:05:02.000]   Let me ask it a little differently.
[03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:02.840]   - It's definitely more complex than that.
[03:05:02.840 --> 03:05:05.280]   - Does anyone know what CBD binds to?
[03:05:05.280 --> 03:05:07.320]   - So the most convincing thing that I've seen
[03:05:07.320 --> 03:05:09.960]   that CBD binds to is the work that C.C. Hilliard has done
[03:05:09.960 --> 03:05:11.080]   looking at its ability
[03:05:11.080 --> 03:05:14.120]   to essentially block adenosine uptake.
[03:05:14.120 --> 03:05:16.920]   And so it can inhibit the adenosine transporter.
[03:05:16.920 --> 03:05:19.080]   - So that should make people feel more alert.
[03:05:19.080 --> 03:05:20.920]   - No, because you're getting more adenosine.
[03:05:20.920 --> 03:05:22.040]   So you get an accumulation.
[03:05:22.040 --> 03:05:24.260]   It blocks the adenosine transport mechanism.
[03:05:24.260 --> 03:05:25.100]   - I see.
[03:05:25.100 --> 03:05:27.140]   - So you get an accumulation of adenosine,
[03:05:27.140 --> 03:05:28.740]   which is more sedative.
[03:05:28.740 --> 03:05:31.540]   And that, I mean, in the PNAS paper
[03:05:31.540 --> 03:05:34.780]   that C.C.'s lab had from 2006,
[03:05:34.780 --> 03:05:36.580]   they showed that that also mediated,
[03:05:36.580 --> 03:05:38.180]   it was the adenosine, I think, 2A receptor
[03:05:38.180 --> 03:05:42.060]   that drove the anti-inflammatory effects of CBD.
[03:05:42.060 --> 03:05:43.820]   So it was the secondary effect by--
[03:05:43.820 --> 03:05:45.580]   - Sort of the opposite of--
[03:05:45.580 --> 03:05:46.400]   - Caffeine.
[03:05:46.400 --> 03:05:47.240]   - Of caffeine.
[03:05:47.240 --> 03:05:48.080]   - Yeah, no, if I remember doing--
[03:05:48.080 --> 03:05:48.900]   - The way you're describing this,
[03:05:48.900 --> 03:05:50.340]   it sounds like the anti-caffeine.
[03:05:50.340 --> 03:05:51.700]   - That's kind of how I describe to people
[03:05:51.700 --> 03:05:54.160]   if they ever ask me for what the pharmacology of CBD is.
[03:05:54.160 --> 03:05:55.940]   I'm like, that's not the only mechanism,
[03:05:55.940 --> 03:05:58.360]   but the thing that was important in C.C.'s studies
[03:05:58.360 --> 03:06:00.340]   that I think is relevant is that it was
[03:06:00.340 --> 03:06:03.500]   not super high concentrations of CBD that caused that.
[03:06:03.500 --> 03:06:06.700]   So you could get this adenosine accumulation at,
[03:06:06.700 --> 03:06:10.780]   you know, you're not talking like micromolar levels of CBD,
[03:06:10.780 --> 03:06:12.420]   which is what a lot of studies have done.
[03:06:12.420 --> 03:06:14.020]   And so even when we're talking about
[03:06:14.020 --> 03:06:15.620]   the allosteric modulatory site,
[03:06:15.620 --> 03:06:17.020]   yes, there's evidence for it.
[03:06:17.020 --> 03:06:18.400]   And it is convincing evidence,
[03:06:18.400 --> 03:06:20.180]   it's just the dose range in there.
[03:06:20.180 --> 03:06:22.980]   You're kind of like, who's getting hit with CBD
[03:06:22.980 --> 03:06:24.700]   at that level where you're getting these effects?
[03:06:24.700 --> 03:06:27.580]   And more so when they've done the blinded work,
[03:06:27.580 --> 03:06:29.500]   like when Ryan Vandery at Hopkins again,
[03:06:29.500 --> 03:06:32.660]   who is one of the main people who's done a lot of this work,
[03:06:32.660 --> 03:06:36.940]   has actually blindly given people CBD dosing with THC,
[03:06:36.940 --> 03:06:39.100]   finds the opposite, that it actually amplifies
[03:06:39.100 --> 03:06:40.820]   some of the effects of THC.
[03:06:40.820 --> 03:06:42.100]   And this was something we learned
[03:06:42.100 --> 03:06:44.560]   from the pediatric epilepsy world was that
[03:06:44.560 --> 03:06:46.660]   when you start giving CBD at relatively high doses,
[03:06:46.660 --> 03:06:48.060]   one of the things it does is saturate
[03:06:48.060 --> 03:06:49.500]   a lot of liver enzymes.
[03:06:49.500 --> 03:06:53.420]   And so some of the efficacy in the pediatric epilepsy space
[03:06:53.420 --> 03:06:57.060]   may be a secondary effect due to an accumulation
[03:06:57.060 --> 03:06:59.480]   of some of the anti-epileptics as well,
[03:06:59.480 --> 03:07:01.660]   because they're not being metabolized the same way.
[03:07:01.660 --> 03:07:03.620]   And this has now been very well replicated.
[03:07:03.620 --> 03:07:06.460]   We know that once you start taking CBD,
[03:07:06.460 --> 03:07:08.580]   when they hit doses that are at the clinical level,
[03:07:08.580 --> 03:07:10.860]   you're gonna start having hepatic effects.
[03:07:10.860 --> 03:07:12.100]   So it's gonna affect the liver,
[03:07:12.100 --> 03:07:13.720]   and it's gonna affect the ability of the liver
[03:07:13.720 --> 03:07:15.840]   to chew up other drugs.
[03:07:15.840 --> 03:07:20.120]   And there's very specific SIP enzymes,
[03:07:20.120 --> 03:07:22.120]   like the cluster of enzymes that metabolize things,
[03:07:22.120 --> 03:07:24.200]   there's very specific ones that CBD hits.
[03:07:24.200 --> 03:07:27.600]   And so as a consequence, one of them is what chews THC up.
[03:07:27.600 --> 03:07:30.560]   So you can get a potentiation of THC
[03:07:30.560 --> 03:07:31.880]   by inhibiting its metabolism
[03:07:31.880 --> 03:07:33.600]   if you have high enough CBD on board.
[03:07:33.600 --> 03:07:35.880]   - Given the effects on adenosine that you described before,
[03:07:35.880 --> 03:07:37.720]   that it's sort of what we're calling,
[03:07:37.720 --> 03:07:40.380]   just for sake of discussion, the anti-caffeine,
[03:07:40.380 --> 03:07:42.840]   how do we explain the preponderance of CBD
[03:07:42.840 --> 03:07:45.360]   added to energy drinks that also contain caffeine?
[03:07:45.360 --> 03:07:47.520]   There's like no logic there. - Expectancy bias.
[03:07:47.520 --> 03:07:50.480]   - There you go, everything can't be expectancy bias.
[03:07:50.480 --> 03:07:51.920]   I have a feeling it's gonna be interesting
[03:07:51.920 --> 03:07:54.000]   to see in the comment section on YouTube.
[03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:58.000]   I mean, presumably there's some regular pot smokers
[03:07:58.000 --> 03:07:58.960]   listening to this.
[03:07:58.960 --> 03:08:01.640]   And the expectancy bias is so strong,
[03:08:01.640 --> 03:08:03.400]   as I allude to in the placebo episode
[03:08:03.400 --> 03:08:04.880]   and we've been talking about here.
[03:08:04.880 --> 03:08:08.120]   And yet it's so strong that I think
[03:08:08.120 --> 03:08:09.600]   people will also be convinced
[03:08:09.600 --> 03:08:11.840]   that there are real differences between different strains
[03:08:11.840 --> 03:08:15.740]   because they've maybe done the non-formal blind,
[03:08:15.740 --> 03:08:19.760]   someone gave them their weed and someone else,
[03:08:19.760 --> 03:08:21.520]   and then they got a completely different effect, right?
[03:08:21.520 --> 03:08:25.240]   They're not expecting something different necessarily
[03:08:25.240 --> 03:08:26.320]   in a particular direction,
[03:08:26.320 --> 03:08:27.760]   but they get a very different effect.
[03:08:27.760 --> 03:08:30.560]   But that to me just speaks to the idea that,
[03:08:30.560 --> 03:08:33.480]   again, cannabis sounds like polypharmacology,
[03:08:33.480 --> 03:08:35.100]   70 different cannabinoids,
[03:08:35.100 --> 03:08:38.080]   THC being among the more powerful components,
[03:08:38.080 --> 03:08:42.700]   but it's yoked in the sense that, as you said,
[03:08:42.700 --> 03:08:44.120]   people self-regulate their intake,
[03:08:44.120 --> 03:08:46.520]   provided they're smoking, not ingesting it by edible.
[03:08:46.520 --> 03:08:48.640]   And so it's almost like THC is being held constant.
[03:08:48.640 --> 03:08:49.840]   And then there's this constellation
[03:08:49.840 --> 03:08:51.840]   of other things around it that are modified.
[03:08:51.840 --> 03:08:54.360]   And people eventually veer towards what they like,
[03:08:54.360 --> 03:08:57.040]   what they can afford, what works with their lifestyle.
[03:08:57.040 --> 03:08:59.360]   And then they come up with a bunch of theories
[03:08:59.360 --> 03:09:01.120]   based on packaging, what they're told,
[03:09:01.120 --> 03:09:04.240]   but presumably also some real effects of these terpenes,
[03:09:04.240 --> 03:09:06.280]   the CBD component, et cetera.
[03:09:06.280 --> 03:09:08.560]   It can't all be just psychological interpretation.
[03:09:08.560 --> 03:09:10.160]   - So what you're saying is like what we said
[03:09:10.160 --> 03:09:11.200]   is the entourage effect.
[03:09:11.200 --> 03:09:13.080]   And I think that is a theory that is held
[03:09:13.080 --> 03:09:14.440]   by a lot of people that this exists.
[03:09:14.440 --> 03:09:16.700]   I mean, the reality is these terpenes
[03:09:16.700 --> 03:09:19.400]   and minor cannabinoids exist at such low levels
[03:09:19.400 --> 03:09:22.220]   that there's a couple of kinds of cannabis
[03:09:22.220 --> 03:09:24.200]   that might have a high enough level
[03:09:24.200 --> 03:09:25.040]   where you're seeing something.
[03:09:25.040 --> 03:09:28.360]   But yeah, I mean, I agree to the extent
[03:09:28.360 --> 03:09:30.840]   that it would be a little wild
[03:09:30.840 --> 03:09:32.800]   if everyone's subjective experience
[03:09:32.800 --> 03:09:34.440]   across different kinds of cannabis
[03:09:34.440 --> 03:09:36.960]   was entirely driven by some kind of expectancy,
[03:09:36.960 --> 03:09:38.600]   which I can't imagine is accounting for all of it.
[03:09:38.600 --> 03:09:43.320]   But I think when we talk about sativa versus indica,
[03:09:43.320 --> 03:09:45.920]   I think there's a huge bias that's going into there.
[03:09:45.920 --> 03:09:49.440]   But one of the things with CBD that's interesting,
[03:09:49.440 --> 03:09:52.120]   unlike THC, is you can actually do
[03:09:52.120 --> 03:09:54.320]   pretty clean blinded studies
[03:09:54.320 --> 03:09:56.280]   because it's really hard to give someone THC
[03:09:56.280 --> 03:09:58.720]   and them not know they're on THC.
[03:09:58.720 --> 03:10:00.640]   - This was the big problem with the MDMA trial
[03:10:00.640 --> 03:10:03.560]   that happened recently is that people who got the placebo
[03:10:03.560 --> 03:10:04.680]   knew they got placebo.
[03:10:04.680 --> 03:10:06.320]   People who got the drug knew they got the drug.
[03:10:06.320 --> 03:10:07.400]   It's very hard.
[03:10:07.400 --> 03:10:09.560]   You could do a dose response, but it's very difficult.
[03:10:09.560 --> 03:10:12.240]   - It's very challenging to give someone a psychoactive drug
[03:10:12.240 --> 03:10:14.480]   and a placebo and them not know which one they have.
[03:10:14.480 --> 03:10:17.400]   Whereas because CBD doesn't produce an intoxicating state,
[03:10:17.400 --> 03:10:20.740]   it's not really perceptible from the person who's taken it,
[03:10:20.740 --> 03:10:22.720]   that it's doing anything,
[03:10:22.720 --> 03:10:24.560]   that actually does make it far more amenable
[03:10:24.560 --> 03:10:25.960]   to do blinded trials with.
[03:10:25.960 --> 03:10:28.760]   And so, I mean, the interesting thing with CBD,
[03:10:28.760 --> 03:10:30.480]   and this is where I get a lot of people
[03:10:30.480 --> 03:10:32.300]   that get angry at me as well,
[03:10:32.300 --> 03:10:36.120]   is that I would argue that the overwhelming majority
[03:10:36.120 --> 03:10:38.040]   of the effects of CBD that people report
[03:10:38.040 --> 03:10:39.320]   are all placebo effects.
[03:10:39.320 --> 03:10:43.480]   And I say that because people leverage the epilepsy stuff
[03:10:43.480 --> 03:10:44.840]   and some of the clinical work and say,
[03:10:44.840 --> 03:10:45.880]   but we know it does things.
[03:10:45.880 --> 03:10:47.460]   And my response to them is,
[03:10:47.460 --> 03:10:50.080]   do you know what dose those people are getting?
[03:10:50.080 --> 03:10:51.840]   'Cause this is something that for some reason
[03:10:51.840 --> 03:10:55.000]   has not made the transition from science into pop culture.
[03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:57.460]   - This is a similar phenomenon with GLP-1.
[03:10:57.460 --> 03:11:01.280]   I and other people have pointed to the fact
[03:11:01.280 --> 03:11:05.160]   that certain food products or certain drinks
[03:11:05.160 --> 03:11:07.280]   or certain activities can increase GLP-1,
[03:11:07.280 --> 03:11:08.380]   glucogon-like peptide,
[03:11:08.380 --> 03:11:13.160]   which is now becoming more commonplace knowledge
[03:11:13.160 --> 03:11:15.080]   because of ozempic, manjaro, et cetera,
[03:11:15.080 --> 03:11:17.400]   as very powerful weight loss tools,
[03:11:17.400 --> 03:11:19.760]   although there's questions about muscle loss, et cetera.
[03:11:19.760 --> 03:11:22.560]   And then we had Dr. Zachary Knight on,
[03:11:22.560 --> 03:11:26.760]   who explained that even a fourfold increase in GLP-1
[03:11:26.760 --> 03:11:28.880]   brought about through a prescription drug
[03:11:28.880 --> 03:11:31.660]   or ingestion of a particular food or drink
[03:11:31.660 --> 03:11:34.120]   does not lead to any appreciable weight loss.
[03:11:34.120 --> 03:11:37.320]   However, when one achieves a thousand fold increases
[03:11:37.320 --> 03:11:39.960]   in GLP-1 through the use of things like ozempic, manjaro,
[03:11:39.960 --> 03:11:41.400]   you see profound weight loss,
[03:11:41.400 --> 03:11:44.460]   meaning that you need enormous effects
[03:11:44.460 --> 03:11:47.840]   in order to see the clinically relevant changes
[03:11:47.840 --> 03:11:49.160]   in that case, weight loss.
[03:11:49.160 --> 03:11:52.040]   So it sounds like a similar thing with CBD.
[03:11:52.040 --> 03:11:54.680]   So if somebody takes a CBD gummy
[03:11:54.680 --> 03:11:56.740]   and they feel that they sleep better,
[03:11:56.740 --> 03:11:59.400]   you would argue that that's entirely expectation bias.
[03:11:59.400 --> 03:12:00.240]   - I think that's a placebo effect.
[03:12:00.240 --> 03:12:02.120]   And I say that because the majority of gummies
[03:12:02.120 --> 03:12:04.720]   are about like two megs, five megs, 20 megs maybe.
[03:12:04.720 --> 03:12:06.600]   - I don't know, I've never taken a CBD product.
[03:12:06.600 --> 03:12:08.400]   I know a few years ago, they were all the rage.
[03:12:08.400 --> 03:12:10.960]   I just, I was never tempted to do it.
[03:12:10.960 --> 03:12:11.840]   And I'm aware,
[03:12:11.840 --> 03:12:13.120]   and we'll talk about this a little bit more,
[03:12:13.120 --> 03:12:15.820]   that there is evidence, according to Matt Walker,
[03:12:15.820 --> 03:12:18.360]   who did a six episode series with us on sleep,
[03:12:18.360 --> 03:12:21.800]   that THC does help certain people fall asleep,
[03:12:21.800 --> 03:12:25.480]   but it can dramatically alter the architecture of sleep
[03:12:25.480 --> 03:12:28.240]   in ways that are probably not great.
[03:12:28.240 --> 03:12:29.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:12:29.080 --> 03:12:32.760]   I mean, THC in sleep is definitely a whole other thing.
[03:12:32.760 --> 03:12:34.600]   But sure, a lot of people report this with CBD.
[03:12:34.600 --> 03:12:37.320]   But again, so most CBD edibles
[03:12:37.320 --> 03:12:38.560]   or things that people take
[03:12:38.560 --> 03:12:39.960]   that are sold through commercial markets
[03:12:39.960 --> 03:12:44.000]   are in the range of two to 25 megs of CBD.
[03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:45.680]   So then I say to them,
[03:12:45.680 --> 03:12:48.520]   so you're aware that in the pediatric epilepsy studies,
[03:12:48.520 --> 03:12:52.200]   the dose ranges are like 1,500 to 2,000 megs.
[03:12:52.200 --> 03:12:54.440]   And then you're talking about a child
[03:12:54.440 --> 03:12:57.440]   who weighs on the order of, what, 20 kilos, maybe,
[03:12:57.440 --> 03:13:00.400]   you know, like 40, 60 pounds, somewhere in that range,
[03:13:00.400 --> 03:13:04.240]   versus, so if you start dosing by weight,
[03:13:04.240 --> 03:13:05.600]   which is how most of these things are done,
[03:13:05.600 --> 03:13:07.860]   well, they'll say 20 megs per kig or whatnot.
[03:13:07.860 --> 03:13:12.800]   So someone my size, so I weigh a bit over 200 pounds,
[03:13:12.800 --> 03:13:16.680]   for me to take that dose of CBD,
[03:13:16.680 --> 03:13:21.440]   and let's say 20 megs per kig at like 90-odd kilos,
[03:13:21.440 --> 03:13:23.680]   I mean, you're talking about me taking-
[03:13:23.680 --> 03:13:24.840]   - A liver-damaging dose.
[03:13:24.840 --> 03:13:28.000]   - An insane, or maybe I wouldn't say damaging.
[03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:29.980]   It's definitely influencing
[03:13:29.980 --> 03:13:31.720]   how the liver metabolizes other things,
[03:13:31.720 --> 03:13:33.080]   'cause it's gonna saturate those enzymes,
[03:13:33.080 --> 03:13:35.000]   but you're taking a very high dose.
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:37.760]   - So if, for instance, you were to take a high dose of CBD
[03:13:37.760 --> 03:13:41.280]   and then maybe have a couple alcohol-containing drinks,
[03:13:41.280 --> 03:13:42.440]   that could be problematic, right?
[03:13:42.440 --> 03:13:44.360]   Because you're talking about the two-hit model.
[03:13:44.360 --> 03:13:45.880]   - Yeah, I can't speak to that,
[03:13:45.880 --> 03:13:46.920]   'cause I actually do not know
[03:13:46.920 --> 03:13:48.480]   the metabolism of alcohol well enough.
[03:13:48.480 --> 03:13:50.600]   I don't believe so, 'cause that's alcohol dehydrogenase.
[03:13:50.600 --> 03:13:53.720]   So that would probably be a separate enzyme pathway
[03:13:53.720 --> 03:13:54.560]   than the SIPs.
[03:13:54.560 --> 03:13:55.400]   This is more like-
[03:13:55.400 --> 03:13:56.320]   - Separate enzyme pathway,
[03:13:56.320 --> 03:13:58.880]   but you're challenging the liver.
[03:13:58.880 --> 03:14:00.800]   - Yeah, but I don't know if it would have an effect
[03:14:00.800 --> 03:14:01.640]   in that capacity.
[03:14:01.640 --> 03:14:02.800]   I mean, they've definitely seen this,
[03:14:02.800 --> 03:14:04.840]   like they know the list of medications
[03:14:04.840 --> 03:14:06.000]   that this is a problem for.
[03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:09.980]   So it's things like warfarin, and like blood thinners,
[03:14:09.980 --> 03:14:11.360]   and the anti-epileptics funnel
[03:14:11.360 --> 03:14:13.400]   into the same metabolic pathway as this THC.
[03:14:13.400 --> 03:14:15.960]   So there's certain things that this would influence.
[03:14:15.960 --> 03:14:17.120]   I don't know if I would say
[03:14:17.120 --> 03:14:18.680]   this would be in the context of alcohol,
[03:14:18.680 --> 03:14:20.960]   but I think more so, I mean,
[03:14:20.960 --> 03:14:22.480]   what I try and point out to people repeatedly
[03:14:22.480 --> 03:14:25.760]   is I have yet to see a blinded clinical study
[03:14:25.760 --> 03:14:28.880]   that has found any effect of CBD that's efficacious,
[03:14:28.880 --> 03:14:32.280]   that's under 300 to 500 milligrams.
[03:14:32.280 --> 03:14:35.120]   And yet, in the wild,
[03:14:35.120 --> 03:14:37.080]   and people who are using it on their own,
[03:14:37.080 --> 03:14:39.160]   we're using doses of 10 to 20 milligrams,
[03:14:39.160 --> 03:14:40.800]   and reporting these effects.
[03:14:40.800 --> 03:14:41.640]   And the thing is,
[03:14:41.640 --> 03:14:43.080]   that I think a lot of people don't also realize,
[03:14:43.080 --> 03:14:46.760]   is CBD has absolutely horrific bioavailability.
[03:14:46.760 --> 03:14:49.360]   Like, so if you take it orally in an oil,
[03:14:49.360 --> 03:14:51.480]   or in a gummy, or whatever you consume it in,
[03:14:51.480 --> 03:14:52.800]   now this might be different
[03:14:52.800 --> 03:14:54.200]   with some of these beverages that are out there.
[03:14:54.200 --> 03:14:55.360]   I don't know if anyone's actually ever done
[03:14:55.360 --> 03:14:58.400]   the pharmacokinetics on them, at least I've never seen it.
[03:14:58.400 --> 03:15:00.960]   But standard routes, we're talking 4%.
[03:15:00.960 --> 03:15:02.860]   Like, very, very little.
[03:15:02.860 --> 03:15:05.200]   Actually leaves your gut into your bloodstream.
[03:15:05.200 --> 03:15:07.960]   Now, we do know from the studies from GW,
[03:15:07.960 --> 03:15:10.160]   who created the pharmaceutical version of CBD
[03:15:10.160 --> 03:15:13.320]   that was used for a lot of the pediatric epilepsy studies,
[03:15:13.320 --> 03:15:15.680]   that they did, I don't know if it was random
[03:15:15.680 --> 03:15:19.560]   or intentional, find that opposite to something like alcohol,
[03:15:19.560 --> 03:15:21.640]   if you had just eaten a fatty meal,
[03:15:21.640 --> 03:15:23.640]   that actually enhanced the bioavailability
[03:15:23.640 --> 03:15:25.240]   of CBD dramatically.
[03:15:25.240 --> 03:15:28.080]   So then it went up to like maybe 20%, got into the blood.
[03:15:28.080 --> 03:15:31.080]   But that's probably because, again, CBD is a fatty molecule,
[03:15:31.080 --> 03:15:32.480]   it likes fatty environments.
[03:15:32.480 --> 03:15:34.480]   And for some reason, having fat in the stomach
[03:15:34.480 --> 03:15:36.880]   and in the gut seems to promote its ability
[03:15:36.880 --> 03:15:38.040]   to get into the bloodstream.
[03:15:38.040 --> 03:15:40.720]   - Can see now, it's the steak and CBD,
[03:15:40.720 --> 03:15:44.520]   or the CBD with omelet protocol.
[03:15:44.520 --> 03:15:45.620]   I'm just kidding, folks.
[03:15:45.620 --> 03:15:48.000]   I'm not suggesting that protocol.
[03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:50.760]   - But yeah, I mean, and so because of this,
[03:15:50.760 --> 03:15:53.100]   it's like you're taking very low doses of CBD
[03:15:53.100 --> 03:15:55.440]   that have very poor bioavailability,
[03:15:55.440 --> 03:15:58.040]   and then people really stand by the effects of these.
[03:15:58.040 --> 03:16:00.120]   And so I'm like, you know, what I would always say
[03:16:00.120 --> 03:16:02.300]   is if it works for you, there's no reason to stop it,
[03:16:02.300 --> 03:16:06.280]   but because you're having benefit from it.
[03:16:06.280 --> 03:16:08.000]   But would I ever recommend someone do this?
[03:16:08.000 --> 03:16:10.440]   No, I wouldn't, because I can't say
[03:16:10.440 --> 03:16:12.940]   that I think that this has any biological activity.
[03:16:12.940 --> 03:16:14.920]   Because even when we start looking at
[03:16:14.920 --> 03:16:17.720]   these potential targets of what CBD could interact with,
[03:16:17.720 --> 03:16:19.320]   and there's a couple of receptors people have said,
[03:16:19.320 --> 03:16:21.600]   you know, it might interact with serotonin receptor,
[03:16:21.600 --> 03:16:24.080]   there's some of these like random orphan receptors
[03:16:24.080 --> 03:16:25.200]   that we don't know a lot of what they do
[03:16:25.200 --> 03:16:26.520]   that CBD might interact with,
[03:16:26.520 --> 03:16:28.920]   but like the concentrations you need to hit those
[03:16:28.920 --> 03:16:33.400]   are reasonable, and you're not getting that in the blood,
[03:16:33.400 --> 03:16:35.340]   and certainly not in the brain of people
[03:16:35.340 --> 03:16:37.480]   from consuming incredibly low doses of CBD.
[03:16:37.480 --> 03:16:41.300]   So the whole market that exists for CBD,
[03:16:41.300 --> 03:16:43.080]   to me is a little bizarre.
[03:16:43.080 --> 03:16:45.140]   And I think for a lot of us in the cannabis field,
[03:16:45.140 --> 03:16:47.400]   this has been one of the most bizarre social experiments
[03:16:47.400 --> 03:16:49.540]   we've ever watched, because like, you know,
[03:16:49.540 --> 03:16:51.480]   if you asked me in 2010 to walk into a room
[03:16:51.480 --> 03:16:53.320]   and ask how many people knew what CBD is,
[03:16:53.320 --> 03:16:54.880]   like maybe one out of a hundred,
[03:16:54.880 --> 03:16:57.080]   like no one knew what CBD was.
[03:16:57.080 --> 03:17:00.480]   And now it's like 80 to 90% would know what it is.
[03:17:00.480 --> 03:17:02.780]   'Cause everyone, you can't walk down a street
[03:17:02.780 --> 03:17:06.000]   in any city in North America and not see CBD products,
[03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:08.880]   whether it's some kind of cream or like a shake
[03:17:08.880 --> 03:17:12.460]   or some random like concoction that people have added CBD,
[03:17:12.460 --> 03:17:14.820]   'cause now it's gonna, you're saying the energy drinks,
[03:17:14.820 --> 03:17:16.420]   like it's just, it's bizarre to me
[03:17:16.420 --> 03:17:17.540]   how much this has taken off,
[03:17:17.540 --> 03:17:19.760]   because it seems to have somehow migrated
[03:17:19.760 --> 03:17:22.380]   into being a health product in some capacity, so.
[03:17:22.380 --> 03:17:23.220]   - Yeah, I've never tried
[03:17:23.220 --> 03:17:25.220]   any of these CBD containing products.
[03:17:25.220 --> 03:17:27.540]   I think a lot of what you're describing
[03:17:27.540 --> 03:17:29.660]   speaks to the fact that, you know,
[03:17:29.660 --> 03:17:34.420]   people are eager for things that can help them
[03:17:34.420 --> 03:17:36.300]   adjust their anxiety and sleep better.
[03:17:36.300 --> 03:17:39.200]   You know, which is a large reason
[03:17:39.200 --> 03:17:41.720]   why a lot of this podcast has focused
[03:17:41.720 --> 03:17:45.040]   on respiration-based tools and other base tools
[03:17:45.040 --> 03:17:46.960]   that can help people with anxiety.
[03:17:46.960 --> 03:17:51.960]   I think that many people suffer from just too much activation
[03:17:51.960 --> 03:17:54.000]   in their autonomic nervous system.
[03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:56.960]   And I would argue there are much better things
[03:17:56.960 --> 03:18:00.600]   that are not of a ingestible type, you know,
[03:18:00.600 --> 03:18:02.840]   things that one can do that are science supported, right?
[03:18:02.840 --> 03:18:06.200]   There are clinical studies, meditation, breath work,
[03:18:06.200 --> 03:18:07.940]   any, not so much breath work, I would argue,
[03:18:07.940 --> 03:18:10.480]   but certain patterns of breathing, meditation,
[03:18:10.480 --> 03:18:11.500]   cognitive behavioral therapy.
[03:18:11.500 --> 03:18:14.200]   There are a whole bunch of different things, as you know.
[03:18:14.200 --> 03:18:16.360]   So I don't know what explains the CBD craze,
[03:18:16.360 --> 03:18:19.520]   but you certainly have shed light on what is,
[03:18:19.520 --> 03:18:22.240]   and mainly what is not known about CBD.
[03:18:22.240 --> 03:18:24.080]   And I think it's really important for people to hear.
[03:18:24.080 --> 03:18:27.520]   - Yeah, I mean, again, it's, I think from my point of view,
[03:18:27.520 --> 03:18:28.720]   it's an ethical thing as well,
[03:18:28.720 --> 03:18:30.740]   because like this isn't covered by insurance.
[03:18:30.740 --> 03:18:32.120]   People are spending their own money on this.
[03:18:32.120 --> 03:18:34.120]   And so I find it really challenging
[03:18:34.120 --> 03:18:36.000]   to recommend someone to be spending what can,
[03:18:36.000 --> 03:18:37.040]   I mean, if you're, especially if you're talking
[03:18:37.040 --> 03:18:38.200]   about an actual clinical dose,
[03:18:38.200 --> 03:18:40.380]   I mean, for someone to take CBD at the level
[03:18:40.380 --> 03:18:43.140]   where it could actually be shown to have some benefit
[03:18:43.140 --> 03:18:45.140]   in some condition, of which currently
[03:18:45.140 --> 03:18:47.240]   it really is just pediatric epilepsy,
[03:18:47.240 --> 03:18:49.820]   like this idea with sleep, pain, anxiety,
[03:18:49.820 --> 03:18:52.640]   there's not a lot of super conclusive data.
[03:18:52.640 --> 03:18:54.740]   And I'd say most of the trials that have been done
[03:18:54.740 --> 03:18:57.880]   have not found really good evidence
[03:18:57.880 --> 03:18:59.280]   of benefit in any capacity.
[03:18:59.280 --> 03:19:01.280]   So it makes it very challenging
[03:19:01.280 --> 03:19:03.660]   to recommend this in any capacity,
[03:19:03.660 --> 03:19:04.840]   especially, I mean, if someone,
[03:19:04.840 --> 03:19:06.800]   if finances aren't an issue, sure, go for it.
[03:19:06.800 --> 03:19:09.520]   But, you know, I understand people are,
[03:19:09.520 --> 03:19:11.000]   like you say, looking for solutions.
[03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:13.200]   - So it doesn't sound like CBD is the solution.
[03:19:13.200 --> 03:19:16.240]   - I would, I am not convinced by the data that exists
[03:19:16.240 --> 03:19:19.920]   that it's really doing what a lot of people claim it's doing.
[03:19:19.920 --> 03:19:22.720]   - Except supporting the placebo effect, perhaps, perhaps.
[03:19:22.720 --> 03:19:24.860]   - It's a great study of the placebo effect.
[03:19:24.860 --> 03:19:26.120]   - I want to make sure before we close
[03:19:26.120 --> 03:19:29.400]   that we touch on some of the potential harms
[03:19:29.400 --> 03:19:32.960]   or asserted harms of THC,
[03:19:32.960 --> 03:19:34.600]   because I think there's a lot of misunderstanding
[03:19:34.600 --> 03:19:35.440]   about this.
[03:19:35.440 --> 03:19:39.120]   We talked about psychosis and the lack of evidence
[03:19:39.120 --> 03:19:41.520]   for a direct causal effect.
[03:19:41.520 --> 03:19:42.720]   You give a beautiful description
[03:19:42.720 --> 03:19:44.640]   as to how we should think about all of that
[03:19:44.640 --> 03:19:46.180]   based on the current literature.
[03:19:46.180 --> 03:19:51.180]   But cannabis and driving is a potential hazard, right?
[03:19:51.180 --> 03:19:53.480]   And some people will laugh.
[03:19:53.480 --> 03:19:55.040]   They'll be like, oh, driving too slow,
[03:19:55.040 --> 03:19:57.440]   as opposed to, you know, driving drunk or driving too fast.
[03:19:57.440 --> 03:19:59.640]   Okay, we can talk about that.
[03:19:59.640 --> 03:20:02.040]   We talked about the potential for addiction
[03:20:02.040 --> 03:20:05.980]   and the evidence potentially for and against that, right?
[03:20:05.980 --> 03:20:11.640]   There's also this, the big black or gray box of, you know,
[03:20:11.640 --> 03:20:12.640]   all the things we don't know
[03:20:12.640 --> 03:20:15.240]   about what regular cannabis use could do.
[03:20:15.240 --> 03:20:16.920]   And yet I know a lot of people
[03:20:16.920 --> 03:20:19.280]   who've used cannabis for years,
[03:20:19.280 --> 03:20:21.480]   mainly as a replacement for alcohol,
[03:20:21.480 --> 03:20:22.480]   at least that's how they describe it.
[03:20:22.480 --> 03:20:23.880]   Well, it's not as bad as alcohol,
[03:20:23.880 --> 03:20:25.720]   but you hear that a lot, okay?
[03:20:25.720 --> 03:20:29.720]   But what are some actual, if any,
[03:20:29.720 --> 03:20:32.320]   what are some actual harms of cannabis use
[03:20:32.320 --> 03:20:33.600]   that people need to take into account
[03:20:33.600 --> 03:20:36.280]   and just weigh against the fact that every compound,
[03:20:36.280 --> 03:20:38.120]   caffeine, even water can kill you
[03:20:38.120 --> 03:20:39.440]   if you drink too much of it.
[03:20:39.440 --> 03:20:41.680]   And then let's make sure that we touch on this issue
[03:20:41.680 --> 03:20:44.500]   of cannabis and driving or operating machinery.
[03:20:44.500 --> 03:20:47.380]   But I think the machine most people are thinking about
[03:20:47.380 --> 03:20:49.160]   these days is driving.
[03:20:49.160 --> 03:20:52.640]   - Yeah, so health harms.
[03:20:52.640 --> 03:20:55.220]   I mean, someone smoking,
[03:20:55.220 --> 03:20:57.340]   obviously there's risks for lung damage.
[03:20:57.340 --> 03:21:00.340]   I would say the evidence for things like lung cancer
[03:21:00.340 --> 03:21:03.240]   certainly don't hold the way they do with cigarette smoke.
[03:21:03.240 --> 03:21:04.640]   - Because people are smoking less of it
[03:21:04.640 --> 03:21:06.940]   or there's just fewer carcinogens in there.
[03:21:06.940 --> 03:21:08.560]   - I don't think you could make the argument
[03:21:08.560 --> 03:21:10.280]   about fewer carcinogens per se.
[03:21:10.280 --> 03:21:12.980]   I think probably it relates more to the frequency.
[03:21:12.980 --> 03:21:15.560]   I mean, Donald Tashkin, who's in California here,
[03:21:15.560 --> 03:21:17.560]   I think he was at UCLA, I'm not a hundred percent sure,
[03:21:17.560 --> 03:21:18.600]   but I know he was in California.
[03:21:18.600 --> 03:21:20.360]   He did like very long-term studies
[03:21:20.360 --> 03:21:21.900]   tracking cannabis smokers
[03:21:21.900 --> 03:21:24.800]   and basically did not find associations with lung cancer
[03:21:24.800 --> 03:21:26.480]   the way that you do with cigarette smoking.
[03:21:26.480 --> 03:21:28.220]   Why that's the case, I don't think anyone has,
[03:21:28.220 --> 03:21:29.500]   like people have theories.
[03:21:29.500 --> 03:21:32.080]   Some suggest because a lot of this in vitro animal work
[03:21:32.080 --> 03:21:33.040]   with really high dosing
[03:21:33.040 --> 03:21:35.900]   suggests it could have anti-proliferative effects for tumors.
[03:21:35.900 --> 03:21:38.000]   Whether that's real or not, I don't know.
[03:21:38.000 --> 03:21:41.440]   But like, I think more likely it's because most people
[03:21:41.440 --> 03:21:42.720]   who smoke cigarettes, at least,
[03:21:42.720 --> 03:21:45.840]   that were, you know, the relationship with lung cancer
[03:21:45.840 --> 03:21:48.080]   were people who were smoking regularly throughout the day.
[03:21:48.080 --> 03:21:51.280]   And it's very rare someone smokes cannabis at that frequency.
[03:21:51.280 --> 03:21:53.000]   Maybe if they isolated that population,
[03:21:53.000 --> 03:21:54.440]   they would see relationships with lung cancer.
[03:21:54.440 --> 03:21:56.560]   I just don't think it's been borne out by the data
[03:21:56.560 --> 03:21:57.400]   the same way.
[03:21:57.400 --> 03:21:59.200]   Certainly lung damage, emphysema,
[03:21:59.200 --> 03:22:01.160]   things like that are on par.
[03:22:01.160 --> 03:22:02.420]   If you have any combustion product,
[03:22:02.420 --> 03:22:03.360]   you're gonna have damage there.
[03:22:03.360 --> 03:22:04.880]   There's no question about that.
[03:22:04.880 --> 03:22:08.000]   So again, harm reduction perspective would be, you know,
[03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:10.400]   oral routes of administration bypass lung damage.
[03:22:10.400 --> 03:22:12.400]   They come with their own issues with dosing and whatnot.
[03:22:12.400 --> 03:22:14.760]   But if you're talking about physical harms,
[03:22:14.760 --> 03:22:15.800]   that's one thing to avoid,
[03:22:15.800 --> 03:22:18.040]   that you could bypass that aspect of it with.
[03:22:18.040 --> 03:22:23.660]   There is some, I don't think we are at a point
[03:22:23.660 --> 03:22:26.320]   where we can say the state of it.
[03:22:26.320 --> 03:22:28.880]   There is something with cardiovascular function
[03:22:28.880 --> 03:22:33.880]   and cannabis that relates to higher frequency
[03:22:33.880 --> 03:22:39.240]   of strokes, perhaps, or cardiac events in some capacity.
[03:22:39.240 --> 03:22:42.000]   The data is not entirely clear in this sense yet.
[03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:43.220]   I mean, we don't see, again,
[03:22:43.220 --> 03:22:45.080]   it's not like super clean relationships
[03:22:45.080 --> 03:22:46.720]   like we're seeing that were there
[03:22:46.720 --> 03:22:48.120]   when they established, you know,
[03:22:48.120 --> 03:22:49.800]   cigarette smoking and lung cancer kind of thing.
[03:22:49.800 --> 03:22:51.360]   I think that effect was so profound.
[03:22:51.360 --> 03:22:54.980]   And the population of smokers used to be so high it was.
[03:22:54.980 --> 03:22:58.140]   - Can this potential, I wanna highlight potential,
[03:22:58.140 --> 03:23:00.060]   relationship between cannabis use
[03:23:00.060 --> 03:23:05.060]   and cardiovascular issues be bypassed, no pun intended,
[03:23:05.060 --> 03:23:08.180]   by using edibles, not inhalants,
[03:23:08.180 --> 03:23:10.140]   or is it related to THC itself?
[03:23:10.140 --> 03:23:15.260]   - I would probably guess, and this is a guess,
[03:23:15.260 --> 03:23:18.300]   that the, you know, anything, again, combustion smoke-wise,
[03:23:18.300 --> 03:23:19.860]   I mean, maybe not vaping plant matter,
[03:23:19.860 --> 03:23:22.100]   but at least the combustion from smoking
[03:23:22.100 --> 03:23:23.580]   probably exacerbates this,
[03:23:23.580 --> 03:23:26.120]   just because any kind of combustion product
[03:23:26.120 --> 03:23:27.620]   is gonna have some vascular effects
[03:23:27.620 --> 03:23:29.040]   to some degree on the system.
[03:23:29.040 --> 03:23:30.060]   So I imagine it would make it worse,
[03:23:30.060 --> 03:23:32.980]   but THC itself has a very complex effect
[03:23:32.980 --> 03:23:34.580]   on cardiovascular function
[03:23:34.580 --> 03:23:39.580]   because it tends to cause, typically, vasodilation.
[03:23:39.580 --> 03:23:42.500]   So you get widening of the blood vessels,
[03:23:42.500 --> 03:23:44.460]   which is why it relates to a lot of people
[03:23:44.460 --> 03:23:46.700]   will experience postural hypotension.
[03:23:46.700 --> 03:23:48.820]   So sometimes when, what that is is
[03:23:48.820 --> 03:23:50.180]   if you stand up and your blood pressure
[03:23:50.180 --> 03:23:51.520]   doesn't catch up with you,
[03:23:51.520 --> 03:23:53.740]   so you get really lightheaded and people will collapse.
[03:23:53.740 --> 03:23:56.420]   And so this is not uncommon to happen to people
[03:23:56.420 --> 03:23:57.700]   and with edibles as well.
[03:23:57.700 --> 03:23:59.940]   So it's not just from smoking.
[03:23:59.940 --> 03:24:01.980]   But when they've consumed cannabis in some capacity,
[03:24:01.980 --> 03:24:03.680]   there are some people that seem to be very sensitive
[03:24:03.680 --> 03:24:04.900]   to the vasodilating effects.
[03:24:04.900 --> 03:24:06.160]   And so when they stand up,
[03:24:06.160 --> 03:24:07.380]   their blood pressure can't match
[03:24:07.380 --> 03:24:08.780]   the shift in gravity that happens.
[03:24:08.780 --> 03:24:11.700]   And so not enough blood perfuses the brain and they go down.
[03:24:11.700 --> 03:24:12.700]   And that can be transient.
[03:24:12.700 --> 03:24:15.400]   They'll come to a minute or two later, but it happens.
[03:24:16.300 --> 03:24:19.980]   But as a consequence of the vasodilation
[03:24:19.980 --> 03:24:21.340]   is it triggers tachycardia,
[03:24:21.340 --> 03:24:22.860]   which is an accelerated heart rate.
[03:24:22.860 --> 03:24:26.380]   And so that's a very reliable physiological response
[03:24:26.380 --> 03:24:27.920]   for a lot of people who use cannabis.
[03:24:27.920 --> 03:24:32.060]   And so it's a bit of a tricky thing
[03:24:32.060 --> 03:24:36.740]   because obviously if there is some underlying heart
[03:24:36.740 --> 03:24:39.640]   or a cardiac sensitivity or issue,
[03:24:39.640 --> 03:24:42.060]   the tachycardia itself can be a problem.
[03:24:42.060 --> 03:24:44.420]   I mean, so like, you know,
[03:24:44.420 --> 03:24:46.740]   if someone has like an underlying heart condition
[03:24:46.740 --> 03:24:49.040]   where at rest it may not present itself,
[03:24:49.040 --> 03:24:52.380]   but the shifts into that kind of beating faster
[03:24:52.380 --> 03:24:53.460]   to compensate for the fact
[03:24:53.460 --> 03:24:55.500]   that you've got a drop in blood pressure
[03:24:55.500 --> 03:24:58.300]   can put strain on the heart
[03:24:58.300 --> 03:25:01.340]   in a way that could unmask a vulnerability or an event.
[03:25:01.340 --> 03:25:03.400]   And again, this is me theorizing
[03:25:03.400 --> 03:25:05.300]   what I think it could be based on what we understand
[03:25:05.300 --> 03:25:08.300]   to some degree about how it affects cardiovascular function.
[03:25:08.300 --> 03:25:12.940]   There are occasionally people who have reported
[03:25:12.940 --> 03:25:14.540]   having like elevated blood pressure.
[03:25:14.540 --> 03:25:16.740]   I mean, some of that also could be from like an anxiety state
[03:25:16.740 --> 03:25:19.540]   or whatnot coming around, but the typical response,
[03:25:19.540 --> 03:25:21.460]   and this is usually driven by cannabinoid receptors
[03:25:21.460 --> 03:25:24.060]   that are in the vascular beds themselves,
[03:25:24.060 --> 03:25:26.060]   that it causes a vasodilatory response.
[03:25:26.060 --> 03:25:28.500]   And so that is usually the first step.
[03:25:28.500 --> 03:25:31.500]   The second is the uptick in the heart rate.
[03:25:31.500 --> 03:25:33.820]   So you get these kind of effects over time.
[03:25:33.820 --> 03:25:37.580]   There's some work looking at like, you know,
[03:25:37.580 --> 03:25:40.300]   vascular stiffness that can evolve over time.
[03:25:40.300 --> 03:25:42.700]   And cannabis users, there's some evidence to suggest
[03:25:42.700 --> 03:25:44.740]   that you might get more of that emerging.
[03:25:44.740 --> 03:25:47.900]   And so again, that could relate to a vulnerability
[03:25:47.900 --> 03:25:51.260]   to have strokes or other kind of cardiovascular events
[03:25:51.260 --> 03:25:52.140]   in that sense.
[03:25:52.140 --> 03:25:55.780]   So I think the issue in terms of like
[03:25:55.780 --> 03:25:58.620]   why it is more difficult for us to say anything
[03:25:58.620 --> 03:25:59.660]   definitively at this point,
[03:25:59.660 --> 03:26:01.700]   it's just obviously the timeline of this.
[03:26:01.700 --> 03:26:04.860]   I mean, you know, cigarette smoking was an easier thing
[03:26:04.860 --> 03:26:06.900]   to establish in that context because, you know,
[03:26:06.900 --> 03:26:09.400]   once antibiotics and medicine advanced in like the forties
[03:26:09.400 --> 03:26:10.240]   and the thirties and stuff,
[03:26:10.240 --> 03:26:11.700]   and people started living longer,
[03:26:11.700 --> 03:26:13.500]   you started seeing a lot of these effects
[03:26:13.500 --> 03:26:14.940]   of cigarette smoking emerge because-
[03:26:14.940 --> 03:26:17.820]   - And yet it took a while for the medical community
[03:26:17.820 --> 03:26:20.020]   to adopt the idea that cigarette smoking was bad.
[03:26:20.020 --> 03:26:20.980]   - Oh, I know.
[03:26:20.980 --> 03:26:21.820]   It's wild-
[03:26:21.820 --> 03:26:23.340]   - Physicians would smoke in clinic,
[03:26:23.340 --> 03:26:25.340]   there were ashtrays in the doctor's office.
[03:26:25.340 --> 03:26:28.100]   - I mean, my grandparents grew up in Belfast.
[03:26:28.100 --> 03:26:30.020]   They had smoked for years and they had even said like,
[03:26:30.020 --> 03:26:31.020]   when they were younger, doctors would say,
[03:26:31.020 --> 03:26:33.080]   oh, have a cigarette after a meal, it promotes digestion.
[03:26:33.080 --> 03:26:34.900]   So it was kind of wild to hear that stuff
[03:26:34.900 --> 03:26:36.620]   when you think of how cigarettes are viewed nowadays.
[03:26:36.620 --> 03:26:41.380]   But it is, I don't think we've kind of been able
[03:26:41.380 --> 03:26:43.540]   to track this long enough to be able to say
[03:26:43.540 --> 03:26:44.740]   with certainty what we're seeing.
[03:26:44.740 --> 03:26:47.940]   But I think there's like, if people ask me about risks
[03:26:47.940 --> 03:26:50.500]   and harms of cannabis, the first thing I always say is,
[03:26:50.500 --> 03:26:52.100]   you know, schizophrenia and bipolar.
[03:26:52.100 --> 03:26:54.500]   Those are the main concern areas, I think,
[03:26:54.500 --> 03:26:56.260]   where you want to avoid cannabis.
[03:26:56.260 --> 03:26:59.660]   And I would also say, if anyone has cardiovascular issues,
[03:26:59.660 --> 03:27:00.980]   they should avoid cannabis.
[03:27:00.980 --> 03:27:03.860]   Just 'cause that's more of like, I would say a being safe,
[03:27:03.860 --> 03:27:06.020]   'cause I don't know how to actually explicitly say
[03:27:06.020 --> 03:27:08.220]   what I would say the harms associated with it are.
[03:27:08.220 --> 03:27:09.420]   But I think there is something there.
[03:27:09.420 --> 03:27:11.260]   I've seen enough evidence that's like,
[03:27:11.260 --> 03:27:14.380]   starting to coalesce into a story
[03:27:14.380 --> 03:27:16.540]   that's like, there's something here.
[03:27:16.540 --> 03:27:18.420]   So I would, that's where I would say
[03:27:18.420 --> 03:27:19.300]   that I think there's risk.
[03:27:19.300 --> 03:27:21.220]   There's also things like
[03:27:21.220 --> 03:27:23.180]   this bizarre cyclic vomiting syndrome,
[03:27:23.180 --> 03:27:24.660]   which is this really strange thing
[03:27:24.660 --> 03:27:27.040]   that has become really apparent.
[03:27:27.040 --> 03:27:29.180]   We've seen this in Canada a bit more now with legalization,
[03:27:29.180 --> 03:27:31.140]   again, 'cause people are going into ERs more,
[03:27:31.140 --> 03:27:34.500]   where it's this somewhat strange phenomenon
[03:27:34.500 --> 03:27:36.180]   where it's usually people
[03:27:36.180 --> 03:27:38.140]   who are pretty excess cannabis users,
[03:27:39.180 --> 03:27:42.460]   they just start puking and they can't stop it.
[03:27:42.460 --> 03:27:45.500]   And it's like this intractable vomiting that they get into.
[03:27:45.500 --> 03:27:47.400]   And then bizarrely,
[03:27:47.400 --> 03:27:50.860]   one of the things that seems to cure it is a hot shower,
[03:27:50.860 --> 03:27:53.340]   which is, I can't even begin to understand this.
[03:27:53.340 --> 03:27:54.700]   I mean, there's also--
[03:27:54.700 --> 03:27:56.020]   - I'm chuckling at the example
[03:27:56.020 --> 03:27:59.060]   'cause you are so very clearly rooted in science,
[03:27:59.060 --> 03:28:00.540]   but that just came out of nowhere.
[03:28:00.540 --> 03:28:02.020]   Like, okay, cool, a hot shower,
[03:28:02.020 --> 03:28:03.980]   deliberate heat exposure, folks.
[03:28:03.980 --> 03:28:04.820]   There it is.
[03:28:04.820 --> 03:28:07.100]   - I have been trying to understand how this was--
[03:28:07.100 --> 03:28:09.120]   - I'm not enjoying it because it's deliberate heat exposure,
[03:28:09.120 --> 03:28:11.820]   but it just speaks to the fact that we're talking about
[03:28:11.820 --> 03:28:16.060]   smoking being a regular part
[03:28:16.060 --> 03:28:18.460]   of the medical community's behaviors
[03:28:18.460 --> 03:28:20.800]   up until a few decades ago.
[03:28:20.800 --> 03:28:25.100]   And then a hot shower being the treatment
[03:28:25.100 --> 03:28:26.580]   for this chronic vomiting.
[03:28:26.580 --> 03:28:29.740]   And it speaks to the fact that with science and medicine,
[03:28:29.740 --> 03:28:31.020]   we do know a ton.
[03:28:31.020 --> 03:28:32.580]   It's amazing how much we've progressed this,
[03:28:32.580 --> 03:28:35.940]   especially in the last 100 years, last 25 years even.
[03:28:35.940 --> 03:28:37.920]   But it's also astounding
[03:28:37.920 --> 03:28:41.960]   how these seemingly surprising antidotes
[03:28:41.960 --> 03:28:45.320]   to uncomfortable conditions can hold up over time
[03:28:45.320 --> 03:28:47.960]   in the absence of any randomized control trials
[03:28:47.960 --> 03:28:48.880]   or mechanistic data.
[03:28:48.880 --> 03:28:51.200]   - I mean, I really struggled to understand,
[03:28:51.200 --> 03:28:52.760]   'cause certainly I don't think it was doctors
[03:28:52.760 --> 03:28:53.600]   that figured this out.
[03:28:53.600 --> 03:28:56.120]   This was people, I think, who were experiencing this.
[03:28:56.120 --> 03:28:58.320]   And then they started telling doctors this.
[03:28:58.320 --> 03:29:01.000]   And then I think, and I can only imagine,
[03:29:01.000 --> 03:29:02.480]   I'm like, maybe they're going in the shower
[03:29:02.480 --> 03:29:04.640]   'cause they're like vomiting on themselves.
[03:29:04.640 --> 03:29:05.480]   - Probably.
[03:29:05.480 --> 03:29:07.580]   - I inadvertently realized that being in a hot shower
[03:29:07.580 --> 03:29:09.100]   somehow seemed to calm this down.
[03:29:09.100 --> 03:29:10.180]   I have seen a study
[03:29:10.180 --> 03:29:12.260]   where they actually applied capsaicin cream,
[03:29:12.260 --> 03:29:13.880]   and that also seemed to provide benefit.
[03:29:13.880 --> 03:29:16.240]   - So something about activation of the heat, thermal--
[03:29:16.240 --> 03:29:17.700]   - It's something with thermoregulation,
[03:29:17.700 --> 03:29:18.540]   'cause the other thing
[03:29:18.540 --> 03:29:20.860]   that seems to have shown some benefit is propanolol,
[03:29:20.860 --> 03:29:22.780]   which again would suggest some kind of sympathetic.
[03:29:22.780 --> 03:29:23.740]   - Which is a beta blocker.
[03:29:23.740 --> 03:29:24.580]   - It's a beta blocker.
[03:29:24.580 --> 03:29:25.500]   So yeah, it's your effect.
[03:29:25.500 --> 03:29:27.060]   So there's something with autonomic.
[03:29:27.060 --> 03:29:30.060]   It must be messing up some kind of autonomic balance
[03:29:30.060 --> 03:29:31.780]   or something with thermoregulation.
[03:29:31.780 --> 03:29:35.300]   Why that results in this kind of bizarre vomiting syndrome
[03:29:35.300 --> 03:29:36.240]   I have no idea,
[03:29:36.240 --> 03:29:38.100]   but I remember when I first started hearing
[03:29:38.100 --> 03:29:39.820]   the stories of this years ago,
[03:29:39.820 --> 03:29:40.660]   and I was just like, how?
[03:29:40.660 --> 03:29:43.120]   'Cause I mean, it is again, surprisingly counterintuitive
[03:29:43.120 --> 03:29:46.600]   because one of the medical uses
[03:29:46.600 --> 03:29:49.000]   that people have used cannabis for is as an antinauseant,
[03:29:49.000 --> 03:29:50.680]   especially in the context of chemotherapy.
[03:29:50.680 --> 03:29:54.160]   And so something that typically has antinauseant qualities
[03:29:54.160 --> 03:29:56.280]   suddenly triggering a vomiting syndrome
[03:29:56.280 --> 03:29:59.440]   is kind of a paradoxical.
[03:29:59.440 --> 03:30:01.960]   - And yet we started off today's conversation
[03:30:01.960 --> 03:30:03.240]   with you explaining beautifully
[03:30:03.240 --> 03:30:07.200]   how activation of these CB1 receptors
[03:30:07.200 --> 03:30:10.880]   are homeostatic in some sense, the thermostat analogy.
[03:30:10.880 --> 03:30:13.680]   And maybe after chronic use,
[03:30:13.680 --> 03:30:16.920]   there's some, the seesaw sort of gets flipped to one side
[03:30:16.920 --> 03:30:17.760]   and gets stuck.
[03:30:17.760 --> 03:30:19.080]   - I think that's how most people have tried
[03:30:19.080 --> 03:30:22.400]   to kind of conceptualize what's going on is maybe like,
[03:30:22.400 --> 03:30:24.080]   and it seems to involve the insular cortex,
[03:30:24.080 --> 03:30:26.040]   at least the antinauseant effects of cannabinoids
[03:30:26.040 --> 03:30:27.960]   are involved through the insular cortex.
[03:30:27.960 --> 03:30:31.140]   And so maybe you like have burned out those receptors
[03:30:31.140 --> 03:30:31.980]   from chronic use.
[03:30:31.980 --> 03:30:34.760]   And so that endogenous mechanism isn't working
[03:30:34.760 --> 03:30:36.480]   or it's somehow flipped in the other direction
[03:30:36.480 --> 03:30:38.160]   now in that circuit becomes sensitized,
[03:30:38.160 --> 03:30:40.880]   but it is a very bizarre,
[03:30:40.880 --> 03:30:43.320]   but very real thing that seems to happen.
[03:30:43.320 --> 03:30:44.640]   Again, this isn't common.
[03:30:44.640 --> 03:30:48.960]   Like I've heard a couple of people I've met describe it,
[03:30:48.960 --> 03:30:51.160]   but it's not like it's happening
[03:30:51.160 --> 03:30:52.840]   to every 10th or 20th person or something.
[03:30:52.840 --> 03:30:54.680]   It's a little more infrequent,
[03:30:54.680 --> 03:30:56.160]   but it's certainly happening enough
[03:30:56.160 --> 03:30:58.980]   that we've now captured it at a federal data level
[03:30:58.980 --> 03:31:00.680]   that this is a thing that people are showing up
[03:31:00.680 --> 03:31:01.520]   in the ER for.
[03:31:01.520 --> 03:31:03.760]   - Interesting, so a hot shower.
[03:31:03.760 --> 03:31:05.480]   - Yeah, so apparently if it happens,
[03:31:05.480 --> 03:31:07.040]   hot shower is what people claim.
[03:31:07.040 --> 03:31:10.620]   So yeah, so for me, I would say the main harms
[03:31:10.620 --> 03:31:11.460]   that people need to be aware of
[03:31:11.460 --> 03:31:13.640]   are the schizophrenia bipolar,
[03:31:13.640 --> 03:31:15.440]   possible cardiovascular effects.
[03:31:15.440 --> 03:31:17.120]   And then this is one of these syndromes
[03:31:17.120 --> 03:31:17.960]   that can come out of it,
[03:31:17.960 --> 03:31:20.620]   as well as possible lung damage from smoking.
[03:31:20.620 --> 03:31:23.960]   Those are the main, I think genuine bonafide health issues
[03:31:23.960 --> 03:31:26.000]   associated with cannabis that people should be aware of.
[03:31:26.000 --> 03:31:28.760]   I mean, I know we're not gonna probably go into depth
[03:31:28.760 --> 03:31:30.480]   with it, on the other side with the medical stuff,
[03:31:30.480 --> 03:31:32.160]   it's a little bit more challenging.
[03:31:32.160 --> 03:31:33.900]   I mean, a lot of this is just because
[03:31:33.900 --> 03:31:37.560]   we really don't have good studies that have been done
[03:31:37.560 --> 03:31:40.200]   in any capacity that have really definitively told us
[03:31:40.200 --> 03:31:43.640]   if cannabis has like really bonafide medical benefit.
[03:31:43.640 --> 03:31:44.720]   - Yeah, I was gonna ask you about that.
[03:31:44.720 --> 03:31:47.200]   It's always nice to end on a positive side
[03:31:47.200 --> 03:31:49.160]   and we don't wanna demonize cannabis,
[03:31:49.160 --> 03:31:51.360]   nor do we wanna glorify it.
[03:31:51.360 --> 03:31:55.000]   But the examples that I've heard of medical uses
[03:31:55.000 --> 03:31:57.280]   for cannabis include appetite stimulation.
[03:31:57.280 --> 03:31:58.380]   We talked about that.
[03:31:59.560 --> 03:32:01.960]   For glaucoma, lowering eye pressure and glaucoma,
[03:32:01.960 --> 03:32:06.440]   the age and age-related increase in eye pressure
[03:32:06.440 --> 03:32:09.500]   are two of the major risk factors for glaucoma,
[03:32:09.500 --> 03:32:12.760]   which is the most common blinding disease,
[03:32:12.760 --> 03:32:14.600]   second to cataract.
[03:32:14.600 --> 03:32:16.480]   More than 70 million people suffer from it.
[03:32:16.480 --> 03:32:17.880]   Everybody, regardless of age,
[03:32:17.880 --> 03:32:19.400]   get your eye pressures checked.
[03:32:19.400 --> 03:32:21.000]   There are drops for this, but okay,
[03:32:21.000 --> 03:32:23.700]   cannabis can reduce eye pressure and glaucoma.
[03:32:23.700 --> 03:32:28.280]   Nausea, you mentioned, and then anxiety.
[03:32:28.280 --> 03:32:31.820]   It sounds like if people get the dose right
[03:32:31.820 --> 03:32:33.120]   and it's right for them,
[03:32:33.120 --> 03:32:35.320]   that in some cases it can help them with their anxiety.
[03:32:35.320 --> 03:32:36.560]   And the reason I raised that one
[03:32:36.560 --> 03:32:39.040]   is because it seems that most people
[03:32:39.040 --> 03:32:42.040]   who decide to use cannabis regularly
[03:32:42.040 --> 03:32:45.360]   are using it as perhaps for its euphoric effects,
[03:32:45.360 --> 03:32:47.120]   but as kind of a mild sedative,
[03:32:47.120 --> 03:32:48.440]   a way to relax in the same way
[03:32:48.440 --> 03:32:50.280]   that they would use a glass or two of wine.
[03:32:50.280 --> 03:32:51.400]   What are your thoughts on that?
[03:32:51.400 --> 03:32:53.520]   Because I think this is the most common use case.
[03:32:53.520 --> 03:32:55.480]   - Yeah, I mean, you look at, I mean,
[03:32:55.480 --> 03:32:56.980]   the other one that wasn't on there,
[03:32:56.980 --> 03:32:58.000]   but you've mentioned this before
[03:32:58.000 --> 03:32:58.960]   and I have as well as pain.
[03:32:58.960 --> 03:33:00.240]   So chronic pain. - The pain, thank you.
[03:33:00.240 --> 03:33:01.640]   - Pain is, I would say, the number one.
[03:33:01.640 --> 03:33:02.720]   So pain is certainly the one
[03:33:02.720 --> 03:33:04.660]   that there's the most amount of evidence for.
[03:33:04.660 --> 03:33:08.120]   And I would say when you talked about this
[03:33:08.120 --> 03:33:09.080]   in the previous podcast,
[03:33:09.080 --> 03:33:11.600]   you were mostly correct about this component of it
[03:33:11.600 --> 03:33:13.380]   in the sense that it's not that cannabis
[03:33:13.380 --> 03:33:15.240]   is a profound analgesic.
[03:33:15.240 --> 03:33:18.880]   It's that cannabis, it has some analgesic properties,
[03:33:18.880 --> 03:33:21.580]   but it's not like super sledgehammer in that sense.
[03:33:21.580 --> 03:33:22.920]   But what it does seem to do is
[03:33:22.920 --> 03:33:25.200]   it seems to strip away the affective component of pain
[03:33:25.200 --> 03:33:26.040]   to some degree.
[03:33:26.040 --> 03:33:28.120]   And so what I have consistently heard
[03:33:28.120 --> 03:33:30.200]   from chronic pain patients when they use cannabis
[03:33:30.200 --> 03:33:32.460]   is they say, "Yeah, my pain's still there,
[03:33:32.460 --> 03:33:34.240]   "but now the pain's background noise.
[03:33:34.240 --> 03:33:35.680]   "So I can sleep at night."
[03:33:35.680 --> 03:33:37.080]   And just being able to sleep, I think,
[03:33:37.080 --> 03:33:38.800]   is actually providing a huge amount of the benefit
[03:33:38.800 --> 03:33:39.720]   to that community.
[03:33:39.720 --> 03:33:42.560]   But it's the day-to-day.
[03:33:42.560 --> 03:33:43.960]   Like they're able to function with the pain
[03:33:43.960 --> 03:33:45.760]   because it doesn't,
[03:33:45.760 --> 03:33:47.240]   they don't become focused on it the same way
[03:33:47.240 --> 03:33:49.280]   because they're able to kind of push it to the background.
[03:33:49.280 --> 03:33:52.520]   That seems to be the main ability of cannabis.
[03:33:52.520 --> 03:33:55.340]   I mean, yes, there's some mild analgesic properties to it
[03:33:55.340 --> 03:33:57.080]   to some degree, but it really seems to be much more
[03:33:57.080 --> 03:33:57.920]   that component of it.
[03:33:57.920 --> 03:33:59.560]   And I think you alluded to something like that
[03:33:59.560 --> 03:34:00.900]   in the previous podcast.
[03:34:00.900 --> 03:34:02.680]   You'd said something about how it's changing
[03:34:02.680 --> 03:34:04.200]   the emotional state of pain.
[03:34:04.200 --> 03:34:06.400]   - And we know from the biopsychosocial model of pain
[03:34:06.400 --> 03:34:11.380]   that emotions and interpretation of the sensation of pain
[03:34:11.380 --> 03:34:13.800]   is a huge component of what people refer to
[03:34:13.800 --> 03:34:15.160]   as chronic and acute pain.
[03:34:15.160 --> 03:34:18.200]   - Yeah, so the pain thing, I think, is a central one.
[03:34:18.200 --> 03:34:19.240]   And that's one of the only ones
[03:34:19.240 --> 03:34:21.320]   that there's a little bit of actual research on.
[03:34:21.320 --> 03:34:22.720]   Most of it's either with isolated THC.
[03:34:22.720 --> 03:34:23.720]   I think there's one or two studies
[03:34:23.720 --> 03:34:24.920]   that have actually looked at smoked cannabis
[03:34:24.920 --> 03:34:27.100]   and found small signals of benefit.
[03:34:27.100 --> 03:34:30.900]   But so anxiety is an interesting one.
[03:34:30.900 --> 03:34:32.400]   And so, I mean, obviously this is more near and dear
[03:34:32.400 --> 03:34:35.000]   to my heart because I study stress and anxiety
[03:34:35.000 --> 03:34:38.280]   as my primary area and cannabinoids and endocannabinoids
[03:34:38.280 --> 03:34:39.640]   in that space.
[03:34:39.640 --> 03:34:43.500]   And yeah, you look at questionnaire-based studies
[03:34:43.500 --> 03:34:46.120]   about why people smoke cannabis and like 85% of them
[03:34:46.120 --> 03:34:47.720]   will say because it reduces stress
[03:34:47.720 --> 03:34:49.560]   and it makes me feel less anxious.
[03:34:49.560 --> 03:34:51.040]   I mean, that was like a big impetus
[03:34:51.040 --> 03:34:53.720]   as to why we started studying endocannabinoid regulation
[03:34:53.720 --> 03:34:55.940]   of it because similar to feeding and pain,
[03:34:55.940 --> 03:34:57.520]   where we know endocannabinoids are involved
[03:34:57.520 --> 03:34:58.800]   in regulated feeding circuits
[03:34:58.800 --> 03:35:00.560]   and endocannabinoids are also integrated
[03:35:00.560 --> 03:35:02.520]   into pain circuitry and can provide
[03:35:02.520 --> 03:35:04.360]   some endogenous analgesic signals,
[03:35:04.360 --> 03:35:07.040]   we figured the same was gonna be true for stress
[03:35:07.040 --> 03:35:09.720]   and anxiety, which to some degree it is.
[03:35:09.720 --> 03:35:12.400]   But it's very complicated because it can be,
[03:35:12.400 --> 03:35:15.200]   like I said before, biphasic where some lower doses
[03:35:15.200 --> 03:35:18.040]   are anxiolytic, higher doses can promote anxiety.
[03:35:18.040 --> 03:35:20.520]   But for the majority of people who use cannabis regularly,
[03:35:20.520 --> 03:35:22.420]   it's because it helps reduce anxiety.
[03:35:22.420 --> 03:35:26.720]   Now, whether that would hold weight in a clinical trial
[03:35:26.720 --> 03:35:27.640]   is a different story.
[03:35:27.640 --> 03:35:30.080]   There is some old evidence from like,
[03:35:30.080 --> 03:35:31.480]   I'd say the '70s, early '80s,
[03:35:31.480 --> 03:35:34.160]   where they were using synthetic forms of THC,
[03:35:34.160 --> 03:35:36.200]   like nabalone, which is something you can get in Canada,
[03:35:36.200 --> 03:35:37.560]   or Marinol or Dronabinol,
[03:35:37.560 --> 03:35:39.580]   which I think is what's accessible in the States,
[03:35:39.580 --> 03:35:41.920]   where they did find some evidence to suggest
[03:35:41.920 --> 03:35:44.000]   it was on par with like a benzodiazepine,
[03:35:44.000 --> 03:35:45.120]   like diazepam or something.
[03:35:45.120 --> 03:35:47.120]   I can't remember exactly what the comparator
[03:35:47.120 --> 03:35:48.660]   they'd used in there, but there was some evidence
[03:35:48.660 --> 03:35:53.320]   for there being some anti-anxiety properties of THC.
[03:35:53.320 --> 03:35:55.520]   And that tracks generally well
[03:35:55.520 --> 03:35:58.860]   with the self-reported literature that's out there.
[03:35:58.860 --> 03:36:03.660]   Now, whether that's the same as an ability
[03:36:03.660 --> 03:36:05.280]   to have benefit in something like PTSD
[03:36:05.280 --> 03:36:06.620]   is a different question.
[03:36:06.620 --> 03:36:07.800]   It gets a little bit more complicated
[03:36:07.800 --> 03:36:10.360]   'cause obviously PTSD has an anxiety component to it,
[03:36:10.360 --> 03:36:12.520]   but there's a lot more to it as well.
[03:36:12.520 --> 03:36:15.040]   And again, there's very little research in this space.
[03:36:15.040 --> 03:36:18.380]   There was one really, really small study
[03:36:18.380 --> 03:36:20.580]   done by the Canadian military.
[03:36:20.580 --> 03:36:23.460]   First, they did one version of it that was an open label.
[03:36:23.460 --> 03:36:25.340]   Open label trials for people who don't know,
[03:36:25.340 --> 03:36:26.940]   it's just basically everyone knows what they're getting.
[03:36:26.940 --> 03:36:28.020]   It's not blinded in any way,
[03:36:28.020 --> 03:36:30.260]   but because of the self-reported data
[03:36:30.260 --> 03:36:33.740]   from the veteran population about cannabis helping,
[03:36:33.740 --> 03:36:35.220]   especially with sleep.
[03:36:35.220 --> 03:36:36.620]   And the big thing that they reported
[03:36:36.620 --> 03:36:38.380]   was that it suppressed their nightmares.
[03:36:38.380 --> 03:36:41.020]   And so, post-traumatic stress disorder
[03:36:41.020 --> 03:36:43.100]   is a very complex disease for many reasons.
[03:36:43.100 --> 03:36:46.120]   And one component of it is the re-experiencing events
[03:36:46.120 --> 03:36:49.160]   that happen during sleep where there's a lot of nightmares
[03:36:49.160 --> 03:36:52.400]   and individuals will kind of re-experience the trauma
[03:36:52.400 --> 03:36:54.880]   that led to the development of the PTSD.
[03:36:54.880 --> 03:36:57.520]   And there does seem to be some suggestion
[03:36:57.520 --> 03:36:58.860]   that because they're remembering it
[03:36:58.860 --> 03:37:00.120]   and maybe changing the details
[03:37:00.120 --> 03:37:01.680]   'cause they're in a dreamscape space
[03:37:01.680 --> 03:37:03.940]   that they reconsolidate it a little bit more.
[03:37:03.940 --> 03:37:06.160]   And there's often a high degree of sympathetic activation
[03:37:06.160 --> 03:37:08.540]   and arousal that goes on with these nightmares.
[03:37:08.540 --> 03:37:11.040]   And some of the belief is that
[03:37:11.040 --> 03:37:13.260]   this is part of the sensitization process
[03:37:13.260 --> 03:37:14.700]   that can happen in PTSD
[03:37:14.700 --> 03:37:16.300]   where the disease can worsen over time
[03:37:16.300 --> 03:37:19.200]   because the re-experiencing and the re-consolidation
[03:37:19.200 --> 03:37:21.880]   and the sensitization of the disease that happens
[03:37:21.880 --> 03:37:24.700]   over time in this kind of sleep state can make it worse.
[03:37:24.700 --> 03:37:28.380]   And so, the majority of veterans who have used cannabis
[03:37:28.380 --> 03:37:29.500]   and report benefit,
[03:37:29.500 --> 03:37:31.980]   if you actually talk to them about it,
[03:37:31.980 --> 03:37:33.580]   as I've done in a few different situations
[03:37:33.580 --> 03:37:35.460]   and also just look at the anecdotal data,
[03:37:35.460 --> 03:37:37.360]   almost all of it talks explicitly about sleep.
[03:37:37.360 --> 03:37:40.620]   And they say, "Oh, we use cannabis or THC before bed.
[03:37:40.620 --> 03:37:41.940]   We find we don't have the nightmares."
[03:37:41.940 --> 03:37:44.660]   And just the simple trickle-down effect of that
[03:37:44.660 --> 03:37:46.340]   is hugely beneficial for them.
[03:37:46.340 --> 03:37:48.500]   And so, the Canadian military did an open label trial
[03:37:48.500 --> 03:37:49.780]   on this, again, not blinded.
[03:37:49.780 --> 03:37:52.140]   It was small numbers, but they basically found,
[03:37:52.140 --> 03:37:53.580]   soon as they put people on Nabilone,
[03:37:53.580 --> 03:37:56.180]   this synthetic version of THC,
[03:37:56.180 --> 03:37:58.340]   it vary in like a large proportion,
[03:37:58.340 --> 03:38:00.100]   I think like 85% of them almost stopped
[03:38:00.100 --> 03:38:01.380]   having these nightmares.
[03:38:01.380 --> 03:38:03.580]   And this was like a treatment-resistant population
[03:38:03.580 --> 03:38:04.980]   that was pretty severe.
[03:38:04.980 --> 03:38:06.420]   So, this was a big benefit.
[03:38:06.420 --> 03:38:09.340]   So, they then took the open label and did what you should
[03:38:09.340 --> 03:38:11.540]   and moved forward to do a double-blind placebo controlled.
[03:38:11.540 --> 03:38:13.740]   Now, it was a very small sampled studies.
[03:38:13.740 --> 03:38:16.180]   And that is obviously always a problem with human work
[03:38:16.180 --> 03:38:18.180]   is if this was like 15 or 17 people.
[03:38:18.180 --> 03:38:20.380]   So, not powered enough to really make
[03:38:20.380 --> 03:38:21.460]   any kind of firm conclusions,
[03:38:21.460 --> 03:38:23.380]   but interesting in the sense that at least it was done
[03:38:23.380 --> 03:38:24.860]   in a proper crossover design
[03:38:24.860 --> 03:38:26.660]   where they got placebo at one point,
[03:38:26.660 --> 03:38:28.380]   they got Nabilone at one point, it was switched.
[03:38:28.380 --> 03:38:30.900]   They didn't know which one they were on.
[03:38:30.900 --> 03:38:33.460]   Because they're taking it right before bed,
[03:38:33.460 --> 03:38:35.740]   maybe that will remove some of the subjective bias.
[03:38:35.740 --> 03:38:37.160]   Again, you can't totally remove it,
[03:38:37.160 --> 03:38:39.580]   but like if someone's taking it within an hour or so
[03:38:39.580 --> 03:38:41.820]   of going to sleep, they may not feel high the same way.
[03:38:41.820 --> 03:38:44.140]   But even under the double-blinded conditions,
[03:38:44.140 --> 03:38:46.020]   they found a very effective suppression
[03:38:46.020 --> 03:38:48.820]   of the nightmares and the re-experiencing.
[03:38:48.820 --> 03:38:50.340]   And then they also, at the same time,
[03:38:50.340 --> 03:38:52.460]   found this increase in kind of quality of life measures,
[03:38:52.460 --> 03:38:53.580]   which tracked with the fact
[03:38:53.580 --> 03:38:55.580]   that they were probably sleeping better.
[03:38:55.580 --> 03:38:58.460]   I don't think they actually reported any change
[03:38:58.460 --> 03:39:01.100]   or even looked at maybe the overall PTSD score.
[03:39:01.100 --> 03:39:02.860]   They only reported or really focused
[03:39:02.860 --> 03:39:04.220]   on the nightmare component of it,
[03:39:04.220 --> 03:39:05.860]   'cause that was the primary outcome of the study.
[03:39:05.860 --> 03:39:07.420]   But, so I thought that was interesting,
[03:39:07.420 --> 03:39:09.660]   'cause that's, if you look at the anecdotal data in PTSD,
[03:39:09.660 --> 03:39:11.100]   that's where a lot of it is focused on,
[03:39:11.100 --> 03:39:13.020]   is using it as a kind of,
[03:39:13.020 --> 03:39:15.220]   I wouldn't maybe call it a sleep aid,
[03:39:15.220 --> 03:39:18.260]   because it's really more of a modulator of the dream state.
[03:39:18.260 --> 03:39:19.500]   And I think this is- - Presumably,
[03:39:19.500 --> 03:39:20.580]   because it's reducing the amount
[03:39:20.580 --> 03:39:21.940]   of rapid eye movement sleep you're getting,
[03:39:21.940 --> 03:39:25.220]   which most people will probably hear and interpret as bad.
[03:39:25.220 --> 03:39:26.880]   But you know, REM deprivation
[03:39:26.880 --> 03:39:28.420]   is actually one treatment for depression.
[03:39:28.420 --> 03:39:30.800]   So there are certain case conditions
[03:39:30.800 --> 03:39:35.260]   where dreaming and REM is not advantageous.
[03:39:35.260 --> 03:39:36.100]   - Yeah. - And you're describing one.
[03:39:36.100 --> 03:39:38.980]   - I mean, depression and PTSD are both two disorders
[03:39:38.980 --> 03:39:41.060]   that are characterized by changes in REM.
[03:39:41.060 --> 03:39:42.460]   Like they have earlier onset to REM,
[03:39:42.460 --> 03:39:43.540]   so they go into REM faster.
[03:39:43.540 --> 03:39:45.580]   They tend to have some altered architecture
[03:39:45.580 --> 03:39:46.660]   of the REM component of their sleep.
[03:39:46.660 --> 03:39:48.340]   So in those states,
[03:39:48.340 --> 03:39:50.620]   maybe suppressing REM isn't actually a bad thing.
[03:39:50.620 --> 03:39:52.660]   At least certainly for PTSD,
[03:39:52.660 --> 03:39:54.680]   I would imagine in terms of the context of the nightmares,
[03:39:54.680 --> 03:39:56.820]   that's providing some benefit.
[03:39:56.820 --> 03:40:00.820]   Whether or not it globally is changing the disease severity
[03:40:00.820 --> 03:40:01.900]   or improving the disease,
[03:40:01.900 --> 03:40:04.340]   I don't think we really have any evidence to say.
[03:40:05.340 --> 03:40:09.220]   But again, I can understand the desire
[03:40:09.220 --> 03:40:11.460]   for people to kind of self-medicate, let's say,
[03:40:11.460 --> 03:40:12.700]   by using this as an approach
[03:40:12.700 --> 03:40:15.300]   to try and reduce that component of their sleep
[03:40:15.300 --> 03:40:17.660]   so that they sleep better, they feel better, maybe.
[03:40:17.660 --> 03:40:18.740]   You know, maybe down the road,
[03:40:18.740 --> 03:40:21.100]   it would help the prognosis of the disease long-term
[03:40:21.100 --> 03:40:22.540]   if it's not sensitized in the same way.
[03:40:22.540 --> 03:40:25.660]   But I don't think we have any strong data
[03:40:25.660 --> 03:40:27.780]   that we can leverage in that capacity to be able to say it.
[03:40:27.780 --> 03:40:30.820]   But to me, it's one of the more interesting areas.
[03:40:30.820 --> 03:40:34.420]   I think anxiety disorders in general,
[03:40:34.420 --> 03:40:35.880]   there's definitely some potential.
[03:40:35.880 --> 03:40:37.660]   So as I had mentioned earlier,
[03:40:37.660 --> 03:40:41.520]   the fall inhibitor that elevates anandamide levels.
[03:40:41.520 --> 03:40:43.500]   So Johnson & Johnson did do a trial
[03:40:43.500 --> 03:40:44.860]   on social anxiety disorder.
[03:40:44.860 --> 03:40:47.540]   It's published, I think, from a few years ago,
[03:40:47.540 --> 03:40:49.960]   '21 or something, I can pull up the reference for that,
[03:40:49.960 --> 03:40:52.460]   where they did find some benefit.
[03:40:52.460 --> 03:40:53.340]   It wasn't huge.
[03:40:53.340 --> 03:40:55.360]   And some of this had to do with the design of the study
[03:40:55.360 --> 03:40:57.460]   'cause they kind of underdosed the patients a bit.
[03:40:57.460 --> 03:40:59.820]   And so not everyone actually showed the elevation
[03:40:59.820 --> 03:41:01.500]   in anandamide when they went back and looked,
[03:41:01.500 --> 03:41:03.340]   but when they actually isolated the group of people
[03:41:03.340 --> 03:41:04.980]   that had higher anandamide,
[03:41:04.980 --> 03:41:06.700]   in that proportion of the patients,
[03:41:06.700 --> 03:41:08.340]   they did see some symptom improvement.
[03:41:08.340 --> 03:41:10.020]   So it did support it.
[03:41:10.020 --> 03:41:12.500]   And this is, I mean, very similar.
[03:41:12.500 --> 03:41:13.820]   Like for us, this is a big thing
[03:41:13.820 --> 03:41:15.740]   because all of the work that we focused on
[03:41:15.740 --> 03:41:17.600]   is looking at how stress and stress hormones
[03:41:17.600 --> 03:41:19.940]   regulate largely anandamide signaling.
[03:41:19.940 --> 03:41:22.660]   And I mean, one of the main things that we've demonstrated
[03:41:22.660 --> 03:41:24.560]   that's been replicated relatively well over the years
[03:41:24.560 --> 03:41:27.220]   is that stress exposure can actually cause
[03:41:27.220 --> 03:41:28.980]   a rapid loss of anandamide signaling.
[03:41:28.980 --> 03:41:30.580]   And it's that loss of anandamide signaling
[03:41:30.580 --> 03:41:33.660]   that seems to facilitate some synaptic strengthening
[03:41:33.660 --> 03:41:36.300]   in the amygdala and promote activity in areas
[03:41:36.300 --> 03:41:38.420]   that are involved in these anxiety circuits.
[03:41:38.420 --> 03:41:41.620]   And so the thought has always been,
[03:41:41.620 --> 03:41:42.900]   well, if anandamide, you know,
[03:41:42.900 --> 03:41:45.780]   it's that job as it's kind of tonic housekeeper,
[03:41:45.780 --> 03:41:47.360]   keeping things in that homeostatic range,
[03:41:47.360 --> 03:41:50.420]   let's say we're talking about explicitly an anxiety circuit,
[03:41:50.420 --> 03:41:52.580]   you know, there's individual variation that exists
[03:41:52.580 --> 03:41:53.620]   in humans across everything.
[03:41:53.620 --> 03:41:55.500]   So one of our predictions has been
[03:41:55.500 --> 03:41:58.460]   maybe people who are on the high end of the anxiety spectrum
[03:41:58.460 --> 03:42:00.020]   might be on the low end of their
[03:42:00.020 --> 03:42:01.840]   tonic anandamide signaling spectrum.
[03:42:01.840 --> 03:42:03.860]   And we've gotten a little bit of support from that
[03:42:03.860 --> 03:42:05.860]   from animal work, where we've screened animals
[03:42:05.860 --> 03:42:08.300]   based on anxiety and looked at endocannabinoid levels
[03:42:08.300 --> 03:42:10.420]   in the amygdala and found lower anandamide.
[03:42:10.420 --> 03:42:12.980]   - That's extremely interesting because it squares
[03:42:12.980 --> 03:42:16.700]   with my, again, non-laboratory observation
[03:42:16.700 --> 03:42:20.380]   that a lot of people use cannabis
[03:42:20.380 --> 03:42:22.300]   to deal with their anxiety, right?
[03:42:22.300 --> 03:42:23.840]   So what you're saying is that, you know,
[03:42:23.840 --> 03:42:26.500]   there's a range of kind of, let's just say,
[03:42:26.500 --> 03:42:28.740]   baseline circuit activation within the amygdala
[03:42:28.740 --> 03:42:30.500]   and related structures in mice, in humans,
[03:42:30.500 --> 03:42:32.180]   presumably in other animals also.
[03:42:32.180 --> 03:42:36.420]   If people take a compound that adjusts
[03:42:36.420 --> 03:42:40.280]   the sort of homeostatic level of what's considered
[03:42:40.280 --> 03:42:43.040]   low, moderate, and high activation of those circuits
[03:42:43.040 --> 03:42:44.400]   that include the amygdala,
[03:42:44.400 --> 03:42:47.500]   then perhaps they're bringing their anxiety into range.
[03:42:47.500 --> 03:42:50.840]   In a way that perhaps is different than with alcohol,
[03:42:50.840 --> 03:42:52.020]   which is more acute, you know,
[03:42:52.020 --> 03:42:53.660]   people have a couple of drinks, they'll feel relaxed,
[03:42:53.660 --> 03:42:56.640]   but then there's this phenomenon of anxiety, you know,
[03:42:56.640 --> 03:42:59.020]   the next day, feeling a little anxious
[03:42:59.020 --> 03:42:59.860]   when they're not drinking.
[03:42:59.860 --> 03:43:01.940]   Whereas it's interesting that many people
[03:43:01.940 --> 03:43:03.820]   who use cannabis for this purpose
[03:43:03.820 --> 03:43:05.700]   are not using it all day long.
[03:43:05.700 --> 03:43:07.380]   They are perfectly able to wait
[03:43:07.380 --> 03:43:09.060]   until the nighttime or evening.
[03:43:09.060 --> 03:43:10.900]   And of course people can wait for their happy hour
[03:43:10.900 --> 03:43:13.780]   for a drink as well, but it's far and away different
[03:43:13.780 --> 03:43:16.020]   than the way we envision something like alcohol use disorder
[03:43:16.020 --> 03:43:18.460]   where somebody discovers that alcohol really helps
[03:43:18.460 --> 03:43:20.640]   with their anxiety and then they're drinking, you know,
[03:43:20.640 --> 03:43:23.000]   maybe one at lunch, maybe a couple at dinner,
[03:43:23.000 --> 03:43:25.420]   and then in the evening to fall asleep at night.
[03:43:25.420 --> 03:43:26.740]   I'm describing extremes here,
[03:43:26.740 --> 03:43:29.340]   but I find your hypothesis to square really well
[03:43:29.340 --> 03:43:30.980]   with the real world observations.
[03:43:30.980 --> 03:43:32.500]   And it's an interesting one.
[03:43:32.500 --> 03:43:33.780]   - There is some evidence to actually support it.
[03:43:33.780 --> 03:43:36.420]   So my buddy, Sachin Patel, who's at Northwestern now,
[03:43:36.420 --> 03:43:39.140]   but he was at Vanderbilt when he did this study.
[03:43:39.140 --> 03:43:41.740]   They basically played with these drugs
[03:43:41.740 --> 03:43:44.100]   that you can use to prevent endocannabinoid synthesis.
[03:43:44.100 --> 03:43:46.220]   So you can create a state of like
[03:43:46.220 --> 03:43:48.660]   impaired endocannabinoid function.
[03:43:48.660 --> 03:43:49.500]   - In humans.
[03:43:49.500 --> 03:43:50.860]   - And they did this in rodents.
[03:43:50.860 --> 03:43:52.540]   So this was done in mice and they basically,
[03:43:52.540 --> 03:43:54.680]   but one of the questions was is,
[03:43:54.680 --> 03:43:56.940]   so A, does like, you know,
[03:43:56.940 --> 03:43:58.580]   reductions in endocannabinoid function
[03:43:58.580 --> 03:43:59.940]   produce states of anxiety?
[03:43:59.940 --> 03:44:01.620]   And they did demonstrate that.
[03:44:01.620 --> 03:44:03.420]   So you could deplete endocannabinoid levels
[03:44:03.420 --> 03:44:05.580]   and you got the emergence of an anxiety state.
[03:44:05.580 --> 03:44:06.540]   So then you could give drugs
[03:44:06.540 --> 03:44:09.940]   that would boost the endocannabinoids to normalize this.
[03:44:09.940 --> 03:44:11.380]   So again, it kind of fit with the idea,
[03:44:11.380 --> 03:44:14.340]   but then they did one key study where then they gave THC
[03:44:14.340 --> 03:44:16.700]   and saw could THC fill in the gap?
[03:44:16.700 --> 03:44:19.100]   And they found that like boosting endocannabinoids,
[03:44:19.100 --> 03:44:21.900]   giving THC on a background of low endocannabinoids
[03:44:21.900 --> 03:44:25.260]   was able to reverse that anxiety phenotype
[03:44:25.260 --> 03:44:27.060]   and bring it back into more of the normal range.
[03:44:27.060 --> 03:44:30.020]   So again, maybe for some people,
[03:44:30.020 --> 03:44:32.060]   this is if this, again, this is theoretical.
[03:44:32.060 --> 03:44:34.100]   So I don't know how much of a spectrum there is
[03:44:34.100 --> 03:44:35.500]   if there are people that are at this low end,
[03:44:35.500 --> 03:44:37.920]   but certainly I think from the animal literature,
[03:44:37.920 --> 03:44:39.800]   there's some foundation for making a theory
[03:44:39.800 --> 03:44:40.820]   that's similar to what you're saying,
[03:44:40.820 --> 03:44:44.260]   which is maybe some people are trying to fill in a gap
[03:44:44.260 --> 03:44:45.820]   of something that's deficient in them
[03:44:45.820 --> 03:44:48.420]   and therefore that can help them feel less anxious.
[03:44:48.420 --> 03:44:50.300]   And that again, may be very different
[03:44:50.300 --> 03:44:52.740]   than someone who is like, you know,
[03:44:52.740 --> 03:44:54.100]   very anxious for different reasons
[03:44:54.100 --> 03:44:55.500]   or has normal endocannabinoid function
[03:44:55.500 --> 03:44:56.880]   or something else might be at play there.
[03:44:56.880 --> 03:44:58.340]   So- - Very interesting.
[03:44:58.340 --> 03:45:00.520]   - Yeah, I think I could explain some of the heterogeneity
[03:45:00.520 --> 03:45:01.940]   that exists out there for sure, yeah.
[03:45:01.940 --> 03:45:03.700]   - So perhaps genetic differences
[03:45:03.700 --> 03:45:06.140]   in sort of baseline levels of anxiety,
[03:45:06.140 --> 03:45:09.040]   perhaps map to endogenous levels of anandamide
[03:45:09.040 --> 03:45:11.820]   and might predict propensity for THC use.
[03:45:11.820 --> 03:45:14.140]   - Yeah, I mean, we have definitely found
[03:45:14.140 --> 03:45:15.940]   in human populations through work I've done
[03:45:15.940 --> 03:45:18.140]   with a lot of clinical collaborators and others,
[03:45:18.140 --> 03:45:21.100]   like, you know, we look at endocannabinoids in the blood
[03:45:21.100 --> 03:45:22.300]   and it's not in the brain,
[03:45:22.300 --> 03:45:23.940]   but they are lipids that can move
[03:45:23.940 --> 03:45:25.420]   pretty easily back and forth.
[03:45:25.420 --> 03:45:27.600]   And we have found relationships
[03:45:27.600 --> 03:45:29.420]   between peripheral endocannabinoid levels
[03:45:29.420 --> 03:45:31.460]   and mood states, both anxiety
[03:45:31.460 --> 03:45:33.300]   and kind of depressive measures,
[03:45:33.300 --> 03:45:38.100]   which does, you know, somewhat relate to the possibility
[03:45:38.100 --> 03:45:40.860]   that this could be real, we don't know.
[03:45:40.860 --> 03:45:43.420]   It's been hard obviously for various reasons
[03:45:43.420 --> 03:45:44.260]   to really track this,
[03:45:44.260 --> 03:45:47.060]   but we've never looked at an anxiety disorder population.
[03:45:47.060 --> 03:45:48.600]   We've done some work with post-traumatic
[03:45:48.600 --> 03:45:50.220]   stress disorder populations.
[03:45:50.220 --> 03:45:51.780]   There's been work in depression populations
[03:45:51.780 --> 03:45:53.660]   that have found some relationships that are pretty similar.
[03:45:53.660 --> 03:45:56.300]   So it's certainly a possibility,
[03:45:56.300 --> 03:45:58.700]   but again, this is all like our theory at this point.
[03:45:58.700 --> 03:46:00.500]   So we'll see as things kind of move forward
[03:46:00.500 --> 03:46:02.380]   if they pan out, but yeah.
[03:46:02.380 --> 03:46:04.460]   - Fantastic, and I really appreciate
[03:46:04.460 --> 03:46:06.460]   that you're able to share some of what your laboratory
[03:46:06.460 --> 03:46:09.360]   is working directly on now and looking into the future.
[03:46:09.360 --> 03:46:13.540]   And I want to thank you for what has been
[03:46:13.540 --> 03:46:18.540]   an incredibly clear, precise, and in many cases actionable,
[03:46:18.540 --> 03:46:20.840]   whether or not it leads to a yes or a no,
[03:46:20.840 --> 03:46:26.220]   actionable information here, because cannabis and CBD,
[03:46:26.220 --> 03:46:29.940]   as you pointed out, are kind of everywhere around us.
[03:46:29.940 --> 03:46:34.860]   And people are making decisions about cannabis and CBD.
[03:46:34.860 --> 03:46:38.260]   And I also want to thank you because
[03:46:38.260 --> 03:46:40.900]   what initially started off as a bit of a confrontation
[03:46:40.900 --> 03:46:43.380]   online, which I alluded to in the introduction
[03:46:43.380 --> 03:46:46.700]   that I gave, has now evolved into a collaboration
[03:46:46.700 --> 03:46:50.460]   that I'm certain based on the exquisitely clear
[03:46:50.460 --> 03:46:53.220]   and generous information that you've provided
[03:46:53.220 --> 03:46:56.860]   has led to better education, more clarity,
[03:46:56.860 --> 03:46:58.820]   and therefore better informed choices
[03:46:58.820 --> 03:47:00.380]   for all the people listening and watching.
[03:47:00.380 --> 03:47:03.500]   So I really, truly appreciate you coming out here,
[03:47:03.500 --> 03:47:05.840]   sitting down with me, discussing these issues,
[03:47:05.840 --> 03:47:09.580]   clarifying points that were unclear before,
[03:47:09.580 --> 03:47:14.100]   and also pointing to the fact that this is a complex system,
[03:47:14.100 --> 03:47:15.440]   a complex biology.
[03:47:15.440 --> 03:47:18.780]   There are a lot of things about psychosis,
[03:47:18.780 --> 03:47:22.820]   about negative effects, about potential positive uses
[03:47:22.820 --> 03:47:25.740]   of cannabis that just are not yet clear.
[03:47:25.740 --> 03:47:28.860]   And thanks to excellent researchers like you
[03:47:28.860 --> 03:47:31.440]   are likely going to be clarified in the years to come.
[03:47:31.440 --> 03:47:35.860]   So thank you ever so much for your time, for your research,
[03:47:35.860 --> 03:47:39.140]   and for your attention to the public health education effort
[03:47:39.140 --> 03:47:40.140]   around cannabis.
[03:47:40.140 --> 03:47:41.860]   - Thanks, and I think it's also important,
[03:47:41.860 --> 03:47:44.540]   I think it's good as you had said that like,
[03:47:44.540 --> 03:47:47.820]   for people to see that scientists can have disagreements,
[03:47:47.820 --> 03:47:49.220]   I think it's important.
[03:47:49.220 --> 03:47:51.820]   I think it's good that you kind of provided me
[03:47:51.820 --> 03:47:53.780]   an opportunity to correct the record
[03:47:53.780 --> 03:47:57.540]   and did so in a very appropriate manner.
[03:47:57.540 --> 03:47:58.940]   I think this was a great discussion
[03:47:58.940 --> 03:48:02.420]   for people to understand, different perspectives,
[03:48:02.420 --> 03:48:07.420]   also good to highlight where it was that I had had issue
[03:48:07.720 --> 03:48:09.360]   with your previous podcast.
[03:48:09.360 --> 03:48:11.640]   And I think the discussions that came out of that
[03:48:11.640 --> 03:48:14.120]   were for the better, so that's all the best.
[03:48:14.120 --> 03:48:16.760]   And hopefully if there's other contentious issues
[03:48:16.760 --> 03:48:19.400]   that happen down the road, similar things, move forward
[03:48:19.400 --> 03:48:21.540]   and you chat with people in that area as well, yeah.
[03:48:21.540 --> 03:48:24.560]   - Yeah, if somebody who is expert in a particular area
[03:48:24.560 --> 03:48:26.160]   takes issue with something specific
[03:48:26.160 --> 03:48:27.960]   and can substantiate it with something
[03:48:27.960 --> 03:48:30.920]   that can foster better understanding,
[03:48:30.920 --> 03:48:33.520]   without fail, I'll reach out to them.
[03:48:33.520 --> 03:48:36.920]   Now, how quickly we're able to get them here, et cetera,
[03:48:36.920 --> 03:48:37.920]   is always an issue.
[03:48:37.920 --> 03:48:41.160]   Sometimes we can put an addendum to a podcast.
[03:48:41.160 --> 03:48:44.000]   Nowadays, that's easier using what's called
[03:48:44.000 --> 03:48:45.680]   dynamic insertion, where we can go back
[03:48:45.680 --> 03:48:47.080]   and actually make a correction.
[03:48:47.080 --> 03:48:49.920]   But listen, the best situation is always when
[03:48:49.920 --> 03:48:53.600]   this podcast can mimic the real world of research science
[03:48:53.600 --> 03:48:55.080]   as you and I both know it to exist,
[03:48:55.080 --> 03:48:58.160]   where if we had been in a meeting and you presented data,
[03:48:58.160 --> 03:48:59.900]   I presented data and we disagreed,
[03:48:59.900 --> 03:49:01.920]   what we would probably do would be to head,
[03:49:01.920 --> 03:49:03.400]   well, traditionally it would be to the bar,
[03:49:03.400 --> 03:49:05.360]   but we'd grab a cup of coffee or go for a walk
[03:49:05.360 --> 03:49:08.080]   and we would talk about it, hash it out,
[03:49:08.080 --> 03:49:11.720]   and then potentially bring it up again at the next meeting.
[03:49:11.720 --> 03:49:13.540]   So in some sense, what we've done here
[03:49:13.540 --> 03:49:15.160]   over the last month or so,
[03:49:15.160 --> 03:49:17.280]   and certainly during today's podcast,
[03:49:17.280 --> 03:49:20.200]   is to do something to that effect.
[03:49:20.200 --> 03:49:21.980]   - And I think it's really good for people in the public
[03:49:21.980 --> 03:49:24.080]   to know this is how science progresses.
[03:49:24.080 --> 03:49:26.140]   This is, you know, someone says something,
[03:49:26.140 --> 03:49:27.280]   someone disagrees with it,
[03:49:27.280 --> 03:49:29.120]   you get an opportunity to clarify things.
[03:49:29.120 --> 03:49:31.480]   And I think that that's really good
[03:49:31.480 --> 03:49:32.440]   just to move things forward.
[03:49:32.440 --> 03:49:36.080]   So I think that was a good process that we've gone through.
[03:49:36.080 --> 03:49:36.960]   - Yeah, likewise.
[03:49:36.960 --> 03:49:38.720]   And it's certainly within the spirit of the podcast.
[03:49:38.720 --> 03:49:41.520]   In no way, shape or form do I purport
[03:49:41.520 --> 03:49:43.760]   to get everything right and where I've made mistakes,
[03:49:43.760 --> 03:49:45.480]   I really strive to correct them.
[03:49:45.480 --> 03:49:47.640]   And listen, it's been a real honor
[03:49:47.640 --> 03:49:49.060]   and privilege to have you out here.
[03:49:49.060 --> 03:49:51.360]   Thanks for coming all the way from Canada.
[03:49:51.360 --> 03:49:53.640]   And I do hope to have you back again
[03:49:53.640 --> 03:49:55.080]   as the research evolves
[03:49:55.080 --> 03:49:57.640]   and we can learn more about these topics and more.
[03:49:57.640 --> 03:49:59.600]   So thank you so much, Matt, appreciate you.
[03:49:59.600 --> 03:50:01.020]   - Great.
[03:50:01.020 --> 03:50:02.840]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[03:50:02.840 --> 03:50:05.160]   about cannabis with Dr. Matthew Hill.
[03:50:05.160 --> 03:50:06.420]   I hope you found the discussion
[03:50:06.420 --> 03:50:08.720]   to be as informative as I did.

[03:50:38.040 --> 03:50:39.880]   I do read all the comments.
[03:50:39.880 --> 03:50:41.000]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[03:50:41.000 --> 03:50:42.200]   I have a new book coming out.
[03:50:42.200 --> 03:50:43.840]   It's my very first book.
[03:50:43.840 --> 03:50:45.240]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[03:50:45.240 --> 03:50:47.360]   An Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[03:50:47.360 --> 03:50:48.560]   This is a book that I've been working on
[03:50:48.560 --> 03:50:49.700]   for more than five years,
[03:50:49.700 --> 03:50:52.040]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[03:50:52.040 --> 03:50:53.560]   of research and experience.
[03:50:53.560 --> 03:50:56.640]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep
[03:50:56.640 --> 03:50:59.120]   to exercise, to stress control,
[03:50:59.120 --> 03:51:01.560]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[03:51:01.560 --> 03:51:04.960]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[03:51:04.960 --> 03:51:07.040]   for the protocols that are included.
[03:51:07.040 --> 03:51:10.920]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[03:51:10.920 --> 03:51:13.280]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[03:51:13.280 --> 03:51:15.080]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[03:51:15.080 --> 03:51:16.840]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[03:51:16.840 --> 03:51:19.420]   An Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[03:51:19.420 --> 03:51:21.560]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[03:51:21.560 --> 03:51:24.420]   I am @hubermanlab on all social media channels.
[03:51:24.420 --> 03:51:25.720]   So that's Instagram,
[03:51:25.720 --> 03:51:27.440]   X, formerly known as Twitter,
[03:51:27.440 --> 03:51:29.680]   Threads, LinkedIn, and Facebook.
[03:51:29.680 --> 03:51:31.120]   And on all those platforms,
[03:51:31.120 --> 03:51:33.320]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[03:51:33.320 --> 03:51:34.800]   some of which overlap with the contents
[03:51:34.800 --> 03:51:36.240]   of the "Huberman Lab" podcast,
[03:51:36.240 --> 03:51:38.380]   but much of which is distinct from the contents
[03:51:38.380 --> 03:51:39.880]   of the "Huberman Lab" podcast.
[03:51:39.880 --> 03:51:43.240]   Again, that's @hubermanlab on all social media channels.
[03:51:43.240 --> 03:51:44.480]   If you haven't already subscribed
[03:51:44.480 --> 03:51:46.500]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[03:51:46.500 --> 03:51:47.920]   our Neural Network newsletter
[03:51:47.920 --> 03:51:49.600]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[03:51:49.600 --> 03:51:51.460]   that includes podcast summaries,
[03:51:51.460 --> 03:51:54.120]   as well as protocols in the form of brief PDFs
[03:51:54.120 --> 03:51:55.520]   of one to three pages,
[03:51:55.520 --> 03:51:57.400]   where I spell out the specific do's,
[03:51:57.400 --> 03:51:58.640]   and in some cases, do nots,
[03:51:58.640 --> 03:52:00.160]   but mostly do's related to things
[03:52:00.160 --> 03:52:02.200]   like how to optimize your sleep,
[03:52:02.200 --> 03:52:04.240]   how to regulate your dopamine levels.
[03:52:04.240 --> 03:52:07.200]   There's a protocol for neuroplasticity and learning,
[03:52:07.200 --> 03:52:09.340]   as well as protocols for fitness,
[03:52:09.340 --> 03:52:11.200]   which we call the foundational fitness protocol,
[03:52:11.200 --> 03:52:13.680]   includes everything sets, reps, cardiovascular training.
[03:52:13.680 --> 03:52:15.920]   Again, all available, completely zero cost.
[03:52:15.920 --> 03:52:18.120]   You simply go to hubermanlab.com,
[03:52:18.120 --> 03:52:19.200]   go to the menu tab,
[03:52:19.200 --> 03:52:21.680]   scroll down to newsletter and provide us your email.
[03:52:21.680 --> 03:52:22.740]   But I should point out,
[03:52:22.740 --> 03:52:25.000]   we do not share your email with anybody.
[03:52:25.000 --> 03:52:26.340]   Thank you once again for joining me
[03:52:26.340 --> 03:52:28.880]   for today's discussion with Dr. Matthew Hill.
[03:52:28.880 --> 03:52:30.920]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:52:30.920 --> 03:52:33.020]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:52:33.020 --> 03:52:35.600]   (upbeat music)
[03:52:35.600 --> 03:52:38.180]   (upbeat music)
