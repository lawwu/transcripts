[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320]   I would like to call your attention this evening to verses 25, 26, and 27 in the 11th chapter
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.400]   of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.720]   "For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:24.280]   be wise in your own conceits, that blindness in part has happened to Israel, until the
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:31.340]   fullness of the Gentiles be come in; and so all Israel shall be saved.
[00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.840]   As it is written, 'There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.840]   from Jacob.'
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:46.000]   For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sin."
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.720]   Now we are looking at this great statement contained here, and which I have already described
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:02.000]   to you as the Apostle's way of expressing his absolute certainty about the restoration
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.080]   of the Jews to the kingdom of God and to the Christian Church.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.280]   He puts it, as I have shown you, in the form of a prophecy.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:23.040]   And last Friday night we were drawing out some of the implications of that fact.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.000]   Now then, we can come, therefore, to the actual statement itself this evening.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.080]   Here is a statement which is not only of great and vital importance, but one which is in
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.960]   many ways very difficult.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.200]   And the result is, it has been the subject of much controversy, much difference and disagreement
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.200]   of opinion.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.080]   Now that is so for a number of reasons, in the form in which the Apostle puts it, I suppose,
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.760]   being the main reason for that.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.480]   However, it behoves us, therefore, to examine it very carefully.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.160]   And I trust we have all been praying together, as I was trying to pray for you just now,
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.320]   that we may be enlightened of the Spirit.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.920]   It is such an important statement.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.120]   Now the Apostle gives his prophecy in the last part of verse 25 and the first part of
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.160]   verse 26.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.680]   Then in the second half of verse 26 and in verse 27, he supports it and substantiates
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.560]   it by quotations from the Old Testament.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.680]   In other words, he is following his usual method, makes his statement, proves it, confirms
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.000]   it, shows that in a sense it is not a novelty by means of his quotation from the Old Testament.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.120]   Now here then is the essential prophecy, that blindness in part is heaven to Israel until
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.240]   the fullness of the Gentiles become hidden, and so all Israel shall be saved.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.360]   That is the prophecy.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.520]   And remember, it is a prophecy.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.240]   It is the revelation of a mystery, something inaccessible to the mind of men, something
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:19.880]   men cannot foresee nor foretell, but something that has been revealed by God to his servant
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.160]   in order that he in turn might make it known to others.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.720]   And that is what he is doing here.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.480]   He does not want them to be ignorant.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.320]   He does not want them, as it were, eventually to make fools of themselves by having said
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.960]   the wrong thing and then to be shown publicly to have said and thought the wrong thing.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.960]   Very well.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.360]   Now then, how do we approach this?
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.320]   There are two main ways in which a statement like this can be approached.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:59.120]   One is, first and foremost, to give a general statement as to its meaning, and then support
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.120]   that by means of a detailed examination.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.280]   That is the method that is adopted by Charles Hobbes, for instance, and others.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.040]   But there is a second method, and to me it seems to be the preferable one.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.360]   And it is this, that we first of all take the statement as it tells, break it up into
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:22.760]   its component parts, try to discover the meaning of the words and of the phrases, and then,
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:30.440]   having got our exact detailed meaning, we can then state the doctrine and argue concerning
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.060]   it, consider the rival points of view, and evaluate them together.
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.380]   It seems to me that that is the better procedure.
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.140]   So we've got to spend most of our time this evening, therefore, in what I would describe
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.180]   again as being the mechanics of interpretation.
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.620]   Let's see what the actual words are.
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.700]   Now, I commend this method for this reason.
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.660]   I think it's almost foolish to be having a general argument as to what the apostle
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.220]   is saying until we are quite clear in our minds as to what he is saying.
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.820]   It's foolish to take up the rival schools of thought with regard to the meaning of "all
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.820]   Israel shall be saved" until we've examined the component parts of the whole great statement.
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.420]   Very well, so we start with the word "blindness".
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:26.260]   This is the mystery that he is revealing to them, that blindness, in part, has happened
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.260]   to Israel.
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:34.260]   Now, blindness is the word here in the authorised version that is before me.
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.580]   In a sense, it is quite an accurate and a good translation.
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:45.540]   But the word that was used by the apostle does not mean blindness in and of itself.
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.500]   It means hardness.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.740]   It means obtuseness.
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.300]   It means insensibility.
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.060]   That's the root meaning.
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.380]   And of course, ultimately, therefore, it does come to mean blindness.
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.940]   If you're insensitive to truth, you can't see it.
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.060]   So they were quite justified in using the word blindness.
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.900]   But as they have used hardness in other places, it seems to me that it would have been better
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.980]   if they had used hardness here.
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.820]   Now, there's nothing new about this statement to those of us who are familiar with this
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.220]   particular epistle.
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.500]   We really have this idea put before us in this same chapter already in verses 8, 9,
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.820]   and 10, where you read, "According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.940]   of slumber, eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear until this
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.940]   day.
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.860]   And David said, 'Let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumbling block,
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.460]   and a recompense unto them.
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.460]   Let their eyes be darkened that they may not see, and bow down their back all the way.'"
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.460]   Same idea.
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:07:01.660]   And he's here putting it like this, that this blindness in part has happened to Israel.
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:11.340]   And of course, we've had the same essential idea in chapter 9, where you get it particularly
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:17.860]   in the 18th verse, where we read, "Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy,
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:23.180]   and whom he will he hearteneth."
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:28.980]   Now this is an idea that you get in the Scriptures, that the trouble with the children of Israel
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:34.180]   was a heartness that led to blindness.
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:41.140]   And this, according to statements in the Scripture, is ultimately the cause of unbelief.
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:45.900]   Take for instance the way in which the author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts it in the
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.180]   third chapter, take verse 8.
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:54.620]   He says, he's quoting, "Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost says today, if ye will hear his
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:01.900]   voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness,
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:08.100]   when your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years."
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:13.260]   So this man, the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, makes an exhortation of all this.
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:19.900]   Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.340]   from the living God.
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:30.500]   But exhort one another daily, while it is called today, lest any of you be hardened
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.460]   through the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.660]   For we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:43.460]   unto the end, and again the quotation, "While it is said today, if ye will hear his voice,
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:48.100]   harden not your hearts, as in the provocation."
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:54.940]   Now that's the idea that is conveyed by this word, "blindness."
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:09:00.300]   The trouble with Israel, the reason why the Jews as a nation rejected their own Messiah
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.860]   and his teaching, and rejected the teaching of the apostles, and dealt with them in the
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.660]   cruel fashion they did, was that they had become hardened.
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.820]   They'd become insensitive to truth.
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.300]   Truth could make no impression upon them.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.100]   They'd lost a sensibility.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.740]   It's a terrible thing, this.
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:26.100]   And it is the ultimate explanation, as I say, of all unbelief.
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:31.180]   Now in that third chapter of 2 Corinthians that I was reading at the beginning, the apostles
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:37.620]   got the same idea, but there he puts it in terms of a veil over their hearts, so that
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.620]   they're not able to see.
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.620]   They've been blinded.
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:45.060]   This terrible inability to see the truth.
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.580]   Now that's what he means by the word, "blindness."
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.980]   But then we come to this qualifying statement.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:59.140]   He says that blindness in part is happened to Israel.
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.940]   What does he mean by "in part"?
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:09.260]   And here again, you see, there is obviously room for several different interpretations.
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.380]   Some people say that it means partial blindness.
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.380]   Partial blindness.
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:19.260]   That the Jews were not totally blind, but they were partially blind.
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:24.020]   That they still saw aspects of the truth, but they couldn't see it all.
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:31.060]   Now this has got to be rejected completely, because the trouble with Israel was that she
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.420]   was totally blind.
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:38.340]   To reject the Messiah means a total blindness.
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:43.180]   And that was the charge that our Lord so constantly brought against the Pharisees.
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.900]   They claimed that they had light, that they were teachers of the people, that they were
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.260]   experts in the law.
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.100]   But the trouble was they were absolutely ignorant.
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.700]   It was a total blindness.
[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.500]   Take the case of this Apostle Paul himself.
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:01.460]   You remember how in writing to Timothy he refers to the days when he was a persecutor
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.420]   and a blasphemer and injurious.
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.740]   But you remember what he says?
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.740]   He says, "I did it ignorantly."
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:09.740]   Ignorantly.
[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.740]   In unbelief.
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:15.020]   It was nothing but ignorance, and it was a total ignorance.
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:21.060]   Or take the way he puts it in Philippians 3, where he gives a list of his excellencies
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:27.060]   as a Pharisee, as a Jew, an Hebrew of the Hebrews, his knowledge of the law and so on.
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:33.500]   But what he came to see was that he was totally ignorant of the true meaning of the law.
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.620]   It was a total blindness, not a partial blindness.
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.700]   And the trouble with Israel is not that she suffers from a partial blindness, it is a
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.860]   total blindness.
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:50.340]   Then others would say that what it means is that blindness has happened to a part of Israel.
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.580]   But it isn't true of all of them, but only true of some of them.
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.860]   Well of course, that was true.
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:59.900]   We've already seen in this chapter that the Apostle makes that same point himself.
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.860]   He says, "I am a believer."
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:06.860]   Not only that, he says, "There is a remnant according to the election of grace."
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.100]   Some of the Jews had believed.
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:16.980]   So in a sense, it is true to say that it was only some of the nation of Israel that were
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:21.380]   unable to see the truth of the gospel.
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:27.500]   And yet I am also going to reject that explanation of the meaning of this term.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:35.060]   And I do so for this reason, that the Apostle here is dealing not with individuals, but
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.460]   with the nation as a whole.
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.100]   Now I've had to keep on saying that.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.780]   But in this chapter he is really dealing with the nation as a whole.
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:49.540]   The fact was that the nation as a whole was outside the church and had rejected the Messiah
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.540]   and the gospel.
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.780]   And he's here dealing with the nation as a whole.
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:58.460]   So I reject both those suggested explanations as to what he means by saying that blindness
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.540]   in part has happened to Israel.
[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.100]   Well then what is he saying?
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.140]   Well it should be read like this.
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:09.820]   That blindness has happened in part to Israel.
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:15.860]   Not partial blindness has happened to Israel, or blindness has happened to a part of Israel,
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.980]   but blindness has happened in part to Israel.
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.980]   What does that mean?
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:29.380]   Well, it means that he is referring to length of time, not the intensity of the blindness,
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.860]   but the duration of the blindness.
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.620]   So that a better way of translating this would be this.
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:39.660]   That blindness has happened temporarily to Israel.
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.540]   That's what he means.
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:50.220]   Blindness for the time being, a temporary blindness has happened to Israel, or blindness
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.860]   has happened temporarily to Israel.
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:59.180]   Now what confirms that of course is the use of the word until.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.980]   Blindness in part has happened to Israel until.
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:07.860]   The blindness is not permanent, it's not everlasting.
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.860]   It is a temporary blindness.
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.700]   That's what he means by in part.
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.200]   Blindness has happened to Israel until.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:22.860]   So it's a question of duration of the blindness and not the intensity of the blindness.
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:28.980]   Now you'll see that when we come together upon these points it will make the exposition
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:33.540]   I think quite inevitable and my method of approach will be justified.
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:38.700]   But now we come to the next phrase which is, is happened.
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:43.700]   You see every single statement here, every phrase, every word is of great importance.
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:53.340]   Blindness in part is happened to Israel, which means of course has happened.
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.460]   Why do I pay attention to this?
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:15:02.940]   Is he saying any more than that Israel as a whole is blind?
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:07.340]   Israel obviously is because if he only meant that he'd have said that.
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:12.700]   When he says that blindness in part has happened to Israel, he does mean that it is something
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.740]   that has happened to them.
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:22.580]   And that means this, that the blindness or the hardness to which he is referring is what
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:29.620]   we had to call when we were doing chapter 9, a judicial blindness.
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.660]   In other words it isn't something that they've produced themselves, it is something that
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:37.780]   has happened to them, something that has been put upon them.
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:42.900]   Now the way in other words of interpreting this is again to go back to chapter 9 and
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:50.140]   to read there what we read about God's dealings with Pharaoh.
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.740]   Verse 17 and so on.
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:56.940]   For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, even for this same purpose have I raised thee up,
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:02.740]   that I might show my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:03.740]   earth.
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:10.620]   Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he harden up.
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.380]   You remember we dealt with that.
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.740]   You may not like that.
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.820]   Not a question of liking, I don't like it.
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:23.460]   But when you're reading the scripture what matters is not what you like, or what I like,
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:24.460]   it's what the scripture says.
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.580]   Neither is it a matter of whether you can understand it or not.
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.140]   Who can understand such things?
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.940]   Paul says it's a mystery.
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:36.500]   And you remember the answer that he gave to the clever objector in chapter 9.
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.660]   Thou wilt say then unto me, why doth he yet find fault?
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.220]   For who hath resisted his will?
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:47.980]   To which the answer is, Nay, but O men, who art thou that replyest against God?
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:53.420]   Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus?
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:57.820]   Doth not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.900]   and another unto dishonour?
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:05.700]   How foolish it is for men to pit their little understandings against profound truth like
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:06.700]   this.
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.740]   Do you understand a miracle?
[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.700]   Do you understand the rebirth?
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.620]   Well if you think you do, you don't know what it is because our Lord told Nicodemus that
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:19.660]   it's a mystery, comparable only to the effect of the wind.
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.340]   Marvel not that I said unto thee, ye must be born again.
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:29.980]   The moment you take up this attitude of saying I don't understand it and I don't like it,
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:34.540]   you as a Christian are putting yourself into the same position as an unbeliever.
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.900]   You're using exactly the same arguments.
[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.740]   People don't believe in God because they can't understand the idea of a God.
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.940]   That's the typical unbeliever's argument.
[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:50.580]   It's not what we understand, it is what has been revealed.
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:58.060]   And I'm saying this in order that I may remind you of what a serious thing it is to pit your
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:06.700]   understanding or your likes or dislikes against the word of the eternal and almighty God.
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:11.260]   Blindness in part has happened to Israel.
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.780]   It's been something that has been put upon them.
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:18.180]   Now this doesn't mean that God is the author of unbelief, but what it does mean is this,
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:23.820]   that because of their unbelief and their persistence in it, he deliberately hardens them as he
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.220]   did with Pharaoh.
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:31.500]   Now all that has been stated already in verses 8, 9, and 10 which I've already read to you
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.500]   this evening.
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:37.300]   And of course, we've had it again in verses 11 and 12.
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.100]   I say then, have they stumbled that they should fall?
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.100]   God forbid.
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:49.300]   But rather, through their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles for to provoke them,
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.300]   the Jews, to jealousy.
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:54.660]   Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.180]   of the Gentiles, how much more their fullness.
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:01.820]   God has chosen to do this to them in order to bring in the Gentiles and ultimately to
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.780]   provoke them to jealousy.
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:11.020]   But the point we are making therefore is this, that a part of the mystery is this, that God
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:21.260]   has inflicted upon the Jews as a whole, as a nation, and as a race, this judicial blindness.
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:27.580]   Now let me show you how our blessed Lord himself really taught exactly the same thing.
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:33.740]   Do you remember what he says as it's recorded in the gospel according to St. Matthew in
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:41.540]   chapter 13, as to why he spoke in parables?
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:42.540]   Listen to this.
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:50.820]   Verse 10, "And the disciples came and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?"
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.980]   How often has this been misunderstood?
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:57.900]   I've heard evangelists sometimes using the argument of parables in this way.
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.820]   They want to justify their own use of stories.
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.740]   They tell stories and they justify it.
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:08.020]   They say, "But our Lord told stories, didn't he tell the parables?"
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.500]   It's got to be made simple.
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:13.180]   They think that that is why our Lord spoke in parables.
[00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:14.980]   But listen to what he says himself.
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.300]   They ask him, "Why speakest thou unto them in parables?"
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:24.220]   He answered and said unto them, "Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:29.340]   of the kingdom of God, but to them it is not given.
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:34.100]   For whosoever hath to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance; but whosoever
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:38.420]   hath not, from him shall be taken away, even that he hath.
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:48.540]   Therefore speak I unto them in parables, because they seeing see not, and hearing they hear
[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.500]   not, neither do they understand.
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:58.140]   And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing you shall hear and
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:03.780]   shall not understand, and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive.
[00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:11.260]   For this people thought is wax gross, and their ears are dumb of hearing, and their
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:15.700]   eyes have they closed, lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:20.460]   their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:21.460]   heal them.
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:26.820]   But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:31.540]   For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:36.180]   things which ye see, and have not seen them, and to hear those things which ye hear, and
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:38.860]   have not heard them.
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:44.620]   It is exactly the same thing as he says at the end of Matthew 11, I thank your Father
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:52.340]   Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:22:00.300]   hast revealed them unto babes, even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.740]   This is the deliberate action of God.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:09.380]   He blinds, he hardens in a judicial manner the race of the Jews, in order that he may
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:14.460]   not only punish them, but that he may bring his great purpose to pass, of sending the
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:20.100]   gospel to the Gentiles, and even ultimately through that, to bring back the Jews as a
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.100]   whole.
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:31.780]   What he is saying is an example, therefore, of judicial hardening or judicial blindness.
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:36.180]   Our Lord spoke in parables, lest they might understand.
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:41.220]   He spoke in parables in order that they might not understand, and they didn't.
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:46.740]   They misunderstood completely, and that was because their hearts were hardened.
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:55.380]   Very well then, you see, the parallel is this, as it is God who inflicts this judicial blindness
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:04.860]   upon the Jews, it is God also who, sometime in the future, is going to open their eyes
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:09.540]   and restore them, and graft them in again.
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:15.020]   It is always God's action, both in the hardening and in the restoring.
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:22.220]   You notice the phrase in verse 26, where he begins to quote, "As it is written, there
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:26.620]   shall come out of Zion the deliverer."
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:34.180]   And remember, it is the deliverer who shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:39.220]   It isn't that Jacob at some future time is going to decide to believe.
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.740]   No, no.
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:44.780]   The God who blinds is the God who heals.
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:50.820]   The God who casts out, breaks away the natural branches, is the same God who is able to graft
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:51.820]   them in again.
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.860]   It is God's action on both sides.
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:24:01.740]   It is the Redeemer, the deliverer alone, who has the ability to turn away ungodliness.
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:05.780]   We mustn't think of it as some voluntary action in the future on the part of the Jews.
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:06.780]   No, no.
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:12.020]   It would continue forever as they are now, were it not God's purpose to enlighten them,
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:17.020]   to drive away their ungodliness, and to bring them back into the olive tree to which they
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:18.420]   originally belong.
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:24.460]   Now this is therefore, you see, a most important phrase.
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:28.620]   And the fact that the apostle says that the exact time when this is going to take place
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:33.580]   is now, this is going to happen when the fullness of the Gentiles comes in.
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:35.940]   It is all a part of God's plan.
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.760]   It is all God's action.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.940]   He casts down, he raises up.
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.940]   Same God.
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:50.900]   Christ is set for the fall and the rising again of many in Israel.
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:52.180]   It is a mystery, isn't it?
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:54.180]   Well, he says it is.
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:57.700]   He doesn't want us to be ignorant of this mystery.
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.060]   Have you ever thought about this?
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:08.540]   This extraordinary effect of the way in which the Jews as a whole reacted to their own Messiah?
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.180]   It is a profound mystery.
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:16.340]   Well, thank God, here we are given some insight and understanding into this great mystery.
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:18.820]   And then the next phrase, of course, is "to Israel."
[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:24.620]   And I'm just reminding you that it means to Israel as a whole and not to individuals.
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:26.300]   The next word is the word "until."
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.500]   Well, I've already shown you the significance of that.
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:34.780]   It links up with this temporary hardening, temporary blindness.
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:35.980]   Until.
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:36.980]   Until when?
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.700]   Well, until the fullness of the Gentiles become in.
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:45.980]   Now, here again is the most important statement.
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:50.380]   What's the meaning of the fullness of the Gentiles?
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:54.660]   And there have been many different explanations of this.
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:26:01.540]   There are some who say that it just means this, that the apostle is saying that as long
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:11.540]   as the Gentiles keep on coming into the Christian church, so some of the Jews will also be converted.
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.540]   You see what it means?
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:17.720]   They say God has finished with the nation of Israel as such altogether.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.780]   But still, you'll get individual conversions among the Gentiles.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:25.780]   And the apostle is simply saying here that these individual occasional conversions of
[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:34.700]   the Jews will go on taking place as long as the gospel is still preached to the Gentile.
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:38.580]   That's one explanation that is put forward.
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:46.540]   Another one which is put forward is this one, that the fullness of the Gentiles means that
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:54.820]   the Gentiles will make up the fullness that has been partially depleted by the defection
[00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:55.820]   of the Jews.
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.820]   Now, let me put that more simply.
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:26:59.820]   Put it like this.
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:07.660]   Here, you see, is the olive tree, consisting originally of Jews and Jews only.
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:11.740]   But the Jews reject the Messiah and they go out.
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.820]   Very well, there's a gap left.
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.640]   The olive tree is no longer full, as it were.
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:22.020]   And they say that what this fullness of the Gentiles means, that the Gentiles are being
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:30.100]   brought in to make up that fullness, part of which has got lost through the defection
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.820]   of the Jews.
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:37.860]   But now there is an obvious answer again to this.
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:43.780]   Centuries ago, far more Gentiles had been converted to Christianity and had entered
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:49.820]   the Christian Church than the total number of the Jews alive at the time of our Lord.
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.460]   And it's still going on, and will go on.
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:56.260]   So obviously and patently, it cannot mean that.
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.380]   Well then, what does it mean?
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:03.620]   Well, I suggest it means what we interpreted the word fullness to mean back in verse 12.
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:08.500]   It means the great majority of the Gentiles.
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:13.740]   It means the great majority of the Gentile nations.
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:17.900]   It doesn't mean that every single Gentile who's ever lived is going to be saved.
[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:18.900]   No, no.
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:25.900]   It doesn't mean that all the Gentiles who will be alive at a given point in the future
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.140]   are all going to be saved.
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.300]   It doesn't mean that.
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:34.900]   This word fullness means the Gentiles regarded as a whole.
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:40.100]   As the fullness of the Jews means the Jews as a nation as a whole, so the fullness of
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.620]   the Gentiles means exactly the same thing.
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:52.100]   The Gentiles in general, the Gentile world as it were, will have come in.
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:57.780]   And it is when that has happened that this is going to happen to the Jews.
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:02.100]   Very well then, there is the meaning of the expression the fullness of the Gentiles.
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:11.500]   And then I must notice this phrase "become in" which is again most interesting.
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:17.820]   It's a very definite term this and it's almost a technical term.
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:22.460]   It doesn't mean merely that a given number of Gentiles will have decided throughout the
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:28.700]   centuries to come in or that the great bulk of them will decide at some future date.
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:32.820]   No, the term is much too technical for that.
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:39.540]   It carries with it this whole notion of being introduced into the kingdom, being introduced
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:47.540]   or engrafted into the divine life, beginning to partake of the divine glory.
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:52.780]   It almost carries with it this idea of being gathered in.
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:57.860]   In other words, you can't escape it, the very term that the apostle used carries this
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:03.580]   very definite idea that God has this great eternal plan.
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:06.940]   He knows the number of the redeemed.
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:10.940]   There is a compliment to come in from the Gentiles.
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:15.220]   And the apostle is saying they will be brought in.
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:20.700]   And when that compliment has been brought in, God will then do this other thing with
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.980]   regard to the Jews.
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:30.780]   I once remember an old preacher using an illustration like this, not preaching on this text but
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:34.020]   it was the same kind of idea.
[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:39.300]   He talked about a shepherd looking after so many thousands of sheep and he'd got a number
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.540]   of dogs.
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:47.340]   And the shepherd was always careful to gather in the whole of his flock at given times in
[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:51.660]   order that he might count them and examine them and so on.
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:55.860]   And the point the old preacher was making was that the shepherd kept on sending out
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:56.860]   dog after dog.
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.140]   There were still some missing.
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.700]   The full compliment hadn't come in.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:04.420]   Some were grazing over there, some over there, and some over there.
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.380]   And he sent these dogs in different directions.
[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:12.860]   And the shepherd isn't satisfied until they've all been gathered in, safely gathered in.
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:16.660]   That's the idea that's here in this entering in.
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:24.140]   This compliment from amongst the Gentiles that God is purposing and determined to bring
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:25.140]   unto salvation.
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:30.820]   Now then, very well, there are the terms of the second half of verse 25.
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:36.260]   Let's have a look at the beginning of verse 26.
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:43.740]   And so, says the apostle, all Israel shall be saved.
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.660]   Now what does he mean by "and so"?
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:53.660]   Well I'm suggesting that he means after the above, after what I've just been saying.
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:57.740]   After the "until" is ended.
[00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:04.820]   This blindness has happened temporarily to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.380]   has been brought in.
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:13.860]   But when that happens, then all Israel shall be saved.
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:18.100]   Now there are those who say that we have no right to translate it like that, that the
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:26.020]   apostle says "and so", not "and then".
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:30.300]   But that I am interpreting it as "and then" instead of "and so".
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:34.540]   They say he's not so much referring to time as to God's method.
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:36.980]   I'm in entire agreement.
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:42.620]   But I would argue that the method and the time are both worked together.
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:48.420]   What the apostle, you see, ultimately is saying is this.
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:59.500]   It is that when this fullness of the Gentiles has come in, the Jews will be aroused to jealousy,
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.500]   as he's told us at the end of chapter 11.
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:05.780]   And in that way, they will be brought in.
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:10.300]   So "and so" means the time and the method.
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:13.180]   I believe we must include both of them.
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:18.220]   And indeed, he makes this quite plain in verse 31.
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:25.780]   He says, I'll take 30 with 31, "as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:32.380]   mercy through their unbelief, even so have these also now not believed that through your
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:35.260]   mercy they also may obtain mercy."
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.260]   That's it.
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:40.980]   He's saying, in other words, this is God's way of doing it.
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:46.620]   The blindness is going to continue with them until this full complement of Gentiles is
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:47.620]   in.
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:52.020]   Then that is the thing that God will use to arouse them to jealousy and bring them in.
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:54.300]   He's brought you in through their defection.
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:57.980]   He's now going to bring them in through what they will see in you.
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:05.700]   And so, it means the time and the method both operating together.
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:12.180]   But this brings us to the crucial statement which is about the meaning of "all Israel."
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:21.460]   Now then, here is the thing above all others about which there has been argumentation.
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:26.580]   And there are three main views with regard to this.
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:33.140]   The first is this one, that all Israel means the total number of the elect, both Jews and
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:36.140]   Gentiles.
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:42.340]   All Israel means all the same Jews, all the same Gentiles.
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:43.740]   That's all Israel.
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:51.860]   That was the view taught by Saint Augustine, John Calvin, Martin Luther.
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.620]   And yet I make bold to reject it.
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:55.620]   Why do I do so?
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:59.460]   Well, let me give you my reasons.
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:04.300]   That interpretation means this, that the word Israel has a different meaning here in verse
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:09.460]   26 from what it had in verse 25.
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:17.340]   Obviously in verse 25 it's referring to the nation of the Jews.
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:20.900]   What right have you therefore in the one and the same statement suddenly to turn its meaning
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:26.320]   into including saved Gentiles as well as saved Jews?
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.980]   That alone it seems to me is enough to put it out.
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.100]   Why did the great reformers teach that?
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:36.500]   They did it undoubtedly because they were reacting rather violently against very wild
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:41.180]   teaching about the millennium that became current in their day and generation.
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:45.700]   And it's always a dangerous thing that if you're correcting an excess, the danger is
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.940]   that you go to an opposite excess yourself.
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:51.940]   I believe the great reformers were guilty of that very thing.
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:58.220]   But not only do they make Israel have a different meaning in verse 26 from verse 25, it makes
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:03.540]   the statement run counter to the whole argument of the entire chapter.
[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:07.660]   What Paul is dealing with in this chapter, as I've had to go on repeating and still
[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:14.180]   must repeat, is the case of the bulk of the nation of the Jews.
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:17.860]   That's what he's dealing with here, and he's still dealing with it.
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.900]   Verse 28 really proves this to the very hilt.
[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:25.540]   He says, "As concerning the gospel, they are enemies."
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:26.540]   Who are they?
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:31.420]   Well, it's the Israel about which he's speaking, and that is the nation of Israel
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:32.420]   as a whole.
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:38.980]   "As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes, but as touching the election,
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.940]   they are beloved for the Father's sakes."
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:44.780]   That doesn't include the Gentiles, that's Jews only.
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:51.660]   Indeed, it is not the total of the elect, both Jews and Gentiles.
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:56.740]   I think those three reasons are more than sufficient to exclude that interpretation
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:57.740]   altogether.
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:01.060]   Let's look at the second interpretation.
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:06.100]   Some say that it means the total number of elect Jews.
[00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.540]   They say, "So all Israel shall be saved."
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.540]   Well, like this.
[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:15.640]   The apostles already told us that even at the very beginning, he was a saved Jew.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:19.340]   There was a remnant according to the election of grace, all right, and on it's gone ever
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:24.780]   since a number of Jews, not many unfortunately, but a number of Jews have been saved from
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:31.180]   decade to decade and century to century, and they say this will go on right until the end
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:38.780]   of time, so that by when you come to the end, you will have a total number of saved Jews.
[00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:45.740]   All Israel is the sum total, the aggregate of all the individual Jews who have been saved
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:48.180]   throughout the running centuries.
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:49.460]   Who has advocated this?
[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:53.860]   Well, the great interpreter, Bengel, he took this view.
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:38:01.060]   A great Dutch theologian, Herman Bavink, contemporary of Abram Kuyper, he taught this.
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:07.220]   Professor Halesby, whose books you've read, many of you, Why I Am a Christian and so on,
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:13.540]   a Lutheran theologian in Norway, taught this, and a modern Lutheran American commentator
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.500]   of the name of Lenski teaches this.
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.220]   Now again, I'm going to reject this interpretation.
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:20.220]   Why?
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:23.100]   Well, for this reason.
[00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:27.620]   If that is all it means, well then I say it isn't a mystery.
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.980]   But the apostle tells us he's telling us a mystery.
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:35.780]   I would not have you ignorant, brethren, of this mystery.
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.380]   This is a great mystery.
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.140]   This is prophetic utterance.
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:41.700]   This is something that has been revealed to him.
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:46.060]   Well, if it's just a question of a number of Jews, are Jews now and again being converted
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:49.420]   and added to the church and that eventually there'll be a sum total of them?
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:51.100]   Well, there's no mystery about that.
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.340]   We all know that.
[00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.260]   We don't need to be told that.
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.900]   That's something we can deduce for ourselves.
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:01.660]   So the whole element of mystery has completely gone.
[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:05.140]   And that enough is enough in and of itself to exclude that interpretation.
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:09.500]   But let me give you some further reasons for excluding it.
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:15.100]   That interpretation doesn't seem to me to allow for the difference between the now and
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:20.020]   the then that the apostle has been putting before us right away through.
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:22.660]   Look at it in verse 12.
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:26.580]   Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches
[00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:30.060]   of the Gentiles, how much more their fullness?
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:32.740]   If it's like this now, what will it be like then?
[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.140]   Verse 15, same thing.
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:38.740]   If the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:40.540]   them be but life from the dead?
[00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:43.020]   Now and then.
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:46.260]   You've got the same thing in verses 23 and 24.
[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:51.980]   He says they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in.
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:55.460]   He's talking about something that's going to happen, not something that is happening
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:56.860]   the whole time.
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:40:00.140]   He's contrasting the present with something that may take place.
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.420]   It's possible, he says in verse 23.
[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:05.740]   In verse 24, it's probable because God has got the power.
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:12.620]   How much more shall these which be the natural benches be grafted in?
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:14.020]   It's not something continuous.
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:18.980]   It is a distinct event carrying with it the contrast between now and then.
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:25.420]   But I have an argument here which simply demolishes this interpretation completely.
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.940]   And it's got to be driven right out of court.
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:28.940]   What is it?
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:29.940]   It's this.
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:38.140]   That it completely fails to account for the argument of verses 12 and 15, and especially
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:41.140]   that great statement at the end of verse 15.
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.140]   Listen again.
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:49.820]   "If the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches
[00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:56.060]   of the Gentiles, how much more their fullness?
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:41:00.860]   If the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:04.660]   them be but life from the dead?"
[00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:10.980]   You remember we interpreted this great hyperbole, which is going to be so phenomenal, so amazing,
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:16.700]   it'll be literally like life from the dead, the most astounding thing that's ever happened.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:20.420]   But this interpretation doesn't allow for that at all.
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:28.660]   An odd Jew converted today, another one tomorrow, and by the end of time there'll be a certain
[00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:29.660]   sum total.
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:30.660]   But where's the phenomenon?
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:34.220]   Where's the life from the dead?
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:37.260]   You see, it doesn't account for it at all.
[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:43.820]   We've got to have an interpretation which gives us an understanding of this amazing,
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:49.260]   staggering phenomenon which is going to be comparable to life from the dead.
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:56.380]   So I reject both those interpretations and suggest to you that the only valid and consistent
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:42:01.580]   interpretation is the one I've been suggesting to you all along, which is this, that he is
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:07.460]   referring here to something that is going to happen to the bulk of the nation of the
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:08.460]   Jews.
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:13.340]   The Israel of verse 26 is the same Israel as in verse 29.
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:16.780]   It means the bulk of the Jews, the Jews as a whole.
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:19.820]   It doesn't mean every single Jew, remember, at a given point.
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.380]   It doesn't mean that at all.
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:24.380]   But it does mean this.
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:31.500]   It doesn't mean every pure-blooded Jew, but it does mean that those who have Jewish ancestors
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:39.780]   and those who cling persistently to the Jewish religion will as a whole have their eyes opened.
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:45.740]   The hardness will be removed and they will believe and enter the Christian church.
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:55.660]   All Israel, as we saw in verse 12, where it's put as fullness, means the bulk of the Jewish
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:56.660]   race.
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:02.380]   It means not all those, I say, who have pure Jewish blood in them.
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.380]   Indeed, you can't trace that at the present time.
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:06.420]   There's been so much intermarriage and so on.
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:07.660]   The thing is impossible.
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:08.900]   But it does mean this.
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:13.500]   The Jews who still separate themselves and worship after the tradition of the fathers
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:20.020]   and reject the gospel, they as a whole will become believers and they'll come in.
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:27.220]   And its effect upon the whole church will be comparable to life from the dead.
[00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:28.220]   Very well.
[00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:30.260]   We must leave it at that this evening.
[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:35.540]   But still, we are dealing with the mechanics of interpretation.
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:41.540]   Then we'll consider how he spots it with his prophetic quotations from the Old Testament
[00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:45.060]   and then his argumentation to prove it.
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:50.500]   Then we shall be in a position to look at the statement as a whole.
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:51.500]   Let us pray.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:44:00.860]   O Lord, our God, we come again into thy holy presence and we come with a sense of amazement
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:01.860]   and astonishment.
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:08.860]   O Lord, thy ways are beyond searching.
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:14.940]   O the depth of the wisdom.
[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:18.980]   O what can we say unto thee, O Lord?
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:25.700]   We are conscious that we are treading on holy ground and that are looking at things that
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:30.900]   leave our natural minds baffled and stunned.
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:37.500]   And yet, O Lord, we thank thee for the glory that comes through to us from it all as we
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:46.660]   see that beyond, behind everything is thy great and eternal plan and purpose.
[00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:54.500]   So that we say with the apostles that from him and through him and to him are all things
[00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:58.140]   who is over all God blessed forever.
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:04.420]   O God, receive our unworthy praise and thanksgiving.
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:10.380]   And now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:17.300]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night throughout
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:25.460]   the remainder of this hour's short uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore.
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:26.460]   Amen.
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:30.380]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
