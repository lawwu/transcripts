[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.240]   Paul's epistle to the Colossians, the second chapter and the eighth verse.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.040]   The eighth verse in the second chapter of Paul's epistle to the Colossians, "Beware
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:25.880]   lest any men spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men,
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.840]   to the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ."
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:42.160]   Now here we come face to face with yet another cause of what we are describing in this series
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.440]   of Sunday morning sermons as spiritual depression.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.400]   There is nothing which is quite so clear and must be obvious to us all by now as this fact
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.200]   that there is almost literally no end to the ways in which the enemy and adversary of our
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:13.760]   souls attacks us and prepares the particular teaching or idea or point of view which he
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.920]   knows is most likely to succeed in our particular case.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:25.520]   Here then we are face to face with yet another cause of trouble.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.240]   The apostle makes it quite plain that he writes this letter to the church at Colossae for
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.680]   that one reason only, that he is very concerned about them.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.880]   He says in the first verse in this chapter, "I would that he knew what great conflict
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:49.560]   I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.880]   the flesh."
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.080]   The church at Colossae had not come into being as the result of the preaching of the apostle
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.840]   Paul.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.160]   It was as the result of the preaching of one of his followers and disciples called Epaphras.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160]   But the apostle felt responsibility.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.520]   He had sent Epaphras out preaching, and as the result of his preaching in this place
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.080]   a number of people had been converted and a church had been formed.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.760]   And they had at first rejoiced greatly in their Christian salvation, but again, exactly
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:33.060]   as we saw last week in the case of the Galatians, after that first beginning certain other teachers
[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:40.460]   had visited the church and the district, and they had presented another doctrine.
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.560]   And the result of that was that a number of these people had been shaken in their faith
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.500]   and divisions had been caused.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.180]   That is why Paul says in the second verse that his concern is that their hearts might
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:00.660]   be comforted being knit together in love and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.580]   to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God and of the Father and of Christ.
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.180]   And later on he uses the same sort of expression.
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.060]   He prays that they may be rooted and built up in Christ and established in the faith
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.500]   as he had been taught and abounding therein.
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.140]   He wants them to maintain the rank, to stand solidly.
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.820]   And all that, of course, he offers as his prayer because the effect of this other teaching
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:35.620]   was that many of these people had been disturbed, they had become unhappy, there were divisions
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.980]   amongst them, they were spending their time in arguments about these various things, and
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.860]   in the meantime they had lost their Christian joy.
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:52.140]   So the apostle takes up this whole matter, and that is the central theme of this great
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.820]   and mighty epistle to the Colossians.
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.580]   In other words, if you like, we can say that its business is to treat of what is described
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.820]   as the Colossian heresy.
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.220]   Now what was that?
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:13.020]   Well, let's describe it in its actual terms first of all, before we begin to apply it.
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:20.420]   It is given the rather imposing name and title of Gnosticism, which means that it boasted
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:26.500]   of a certain type of learning and knowledge and understanding.
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.140]   It was really a mixture.
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.460]   It was an accretion of a number of different points of view.
[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.620]   The technical term sometimes used for this is syncretism, a bringing together of various
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:49.260]   things, a sort of eclectic religion which they had worked up, borrowing from various
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.780]   other schools of thought.
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.360]   But in its essence, these were its main characteristics.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:04.140]   It was characterized first and foremost by intellectual speculation—speculation concerning
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:12.620]   truth—coupled with that there was a tendency to go back to Jewish legalism, to circumcision
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.700]   and so on.
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.780]   And in addition, there were certain ascetic practices.
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.780]   You notice the apostle refers to them at the end.
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.040]   They prohibited people to eat meats and to drink various things.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.460]   They were very rigorous in the kind of ascetic practices which they taught—touch not, taste
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.660]   not, handle not, observation of particular days, and so on.
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:43.180]   Now, it's very difficult to define it accurately, but those were at any rate the main elements
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.580]   in this Gnosticism, in this particular heresy.
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.800]   It was a sort of religion that was a kind of amalgam of those various things—the speculation,
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:01.220]   this tendency to observe certain Jewish practices, and then this strict humbling of the body
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:08.700]   and denying of the body, and sacrifice, as it were, of the body and its natural desires
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.220]   in various respects.
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.860]   With regard to their speculation, the main themes that they were interested in were these.
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:25.720]   The origin of the world, the origin of evil, and the belief that matter itself is essentially
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.620]   evil.
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.860]   Those were the things about which they speculated.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.940]   What was the origin of the world?
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.500]   Where did it come from?
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.060]   Where was the origin of evil?
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.380]   They recognized there was evil in the world, but the question is, where did it come from?
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.120]   And it is at that point, you see, that they introduced these angels.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.900]   You notice that in this second chapter the Apostle talks about worshipping of angels.
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.320]   Well, that was a part of their theory, their speculation, to explain the origin of evil.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.740]   They said that first of all there was God, and then he'd created a number of angels,
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:04.180]   and they went down a scale in importance until you came across an angel who was evil, and
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.460]   he introduced evil.
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:12.660]   So they had all these gradations of angels between men and God.
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:18.740]   In other words, there can be very little doubt but that this kind of new religion that was
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:26.140]   tending to become popular in the church at Colossae was a curious mixture of the old
[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:33.180]   Jewish religion and the various so-called mystery religions that were very popular in
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.940]   the ancient world.
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.320]   A country like Greece had many of them.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.980]   You remember the temples to the various gods?
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:46.740]   It was partly a sort of paganism and the worshipping of gods and of idols, but with many elaborate
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:52.460]   practices and sacrifices they're generally called mystery religions with a strong mystical
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.460]   element.
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:59.620]   Well, now all that I say was joined up to that ancient Judaism and with this extreme
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:04.900]   rigorism and asceticism in the way in which they lived.
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:09.140]   They certainly on the surface seemed to be very good and very devout people.
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:15.140]   They were very strict in their diet and in many of their practices, and they looked at
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.700]   first sight as if they were unusually holy people.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:25.740]   And yet you notice that the Apostle Paul is alarmed about the whole situation, and he
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:32.140]   writes his letter in order to save the church at Colossae from this terrible disaster that
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:39.260]   would overcome them if they once became subjected to this kind of teaching.
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:45.020]   Now it is very interesting to observe, isn't it, how the devil, when he counterfeits the
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:54.100]   Christian faith, always does it as nearly and as exactly as is possible and conceivable
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.620]   to the gospel itself.
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.460]   It is there we see the real subtlety of the devil.
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:04.700]   His counterfeit, the thing which he brings along in order to beguile us and to delude
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.860]   us, on the surface looks amazingly like the real gospel.
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:14.220]   The gospel of Jesus Christ, as we've had occasion to emphasize many times, is something that
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.260]   takes up the whole man.
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.700]   It applies to the mind, it applies to the heart, and it applies to the will.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:25.300]   You remember that great statement of Paul's in the sixth chapter of the Epistle to the
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.460]   Romans in the seventeenth verse.
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:32.580]   He says, "But God be thanked that he were the servants of sin, but he have obeyed"—there's
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.540]   the will—"from the heart"—there's the heart—"the form of sound words delivered
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.540]   to you."
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.780]   That's the doctrine that came to the mind.
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:44.380]   Well, now then, you see how the devil counterfeits that.
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:49.940]   He forms this new religion, yes, and there is an intellectual element in its speculation.
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.900]   It isn't the same as this, but it's like it.
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:57.340]   He also has a sort of vague sentimentalism, which you'll always find in this kind of
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.420]   religion, to appeal to the heart.
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:07.100]   And you see, he has this strict ethical practice, this moral rigorism, in order that he may
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.540]   make his appeal also to the will.
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.800]   You see, he doesn't do it with one truth that takes up the whole man.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:20.260]   He has to have this amalgam, this mixture, this gathering, this syncretism, this eclectic
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:27.860]   idea, in order that he may try to simulate and to repeat the true gospel.
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:33.380]   Well, now, let us look at this particular problem.
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:40.140]   This is, in particular, the danger that confronts the more intellectual kind of person.
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.480]   Here again is a point which is well worth observing.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:49.780]   The devil, in his cleverness and in his subtlety, doesn't approach all people with the same
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.820]   thing.
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:56.660]   He has his divisions and his classifications of people, and there is nothing that he is
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:01.420]   quite so careful to observe as the difference between people who are intellectual by nature
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.260]   and those who are not very intellectual by nature.
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.460]   Now, last Sunday morning we were looking at the Galatians.
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.780]   They were not very intellectual.
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:15.260]   They were a simpler people, more emotional.
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.460]   So he doesn't take the Colossian heresy to the Galatians, no.
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:23.100]   What he does with them is he introduces something like that question of circumcision with which
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.340]   we are dealing.
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:28.100]   What he does with them is to take out one matter and to put it at the center where it
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.980]   shouldn't be—a thing which may be quite all right in itself but should never be put
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:32.980]   in the center.
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:37.100]   Christ alone isn't enough; there must be something else in addition.
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:45.100]   There, the danger was to make, as essential, something that is not essential—a fairly
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.380]   simple kind of heresy.
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.940]   But here in the case of the Colossians, you see, it isn't that.
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:59.780]   This is the peculiar heresy that is invented and designed for people who like to think
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:05.780]   and people who read a lot and people who really are concerned for the best and the highest
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:10.580]   in every branch and every department of life.
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:17.740]   And therefore, a man who once wrote a book on this epistle to the Colossians was, I think,
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:24.700]   very right when he gave it this title, "Paul Amongst the Intellectuals," and that is most
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.660]   certainly the position of the church at Colossae.
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.020]   But it wasn't confined to this church.
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:37.940]   There is very definite evidence that the same thing obtained partly in the church at Corinth.
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.660]   Because in the eighth chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians, Paul says something
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.660]   like this.
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.060]   He says, "Knowledge puffeth up, charity edifieth."
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:50.500]   Obviously, the Corinthians were a bit subject to it.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:57.020]   And it's quite clear that in some of the churches which were under the care of Timothy,
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:03.140]   the same thing was true, because there Paul refers to certain people who have made shipwreck
[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:09.620]   of their faith because of science, knowledge, falsely so called.
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:16.740]   In other words, you can't read your New Testament without observing that there was a great fight
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:25.220]   going on in the early church with these various false teachings that came in from various
[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.860]   directions to harass Christ's people.
[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:35.060]   Indeed, the New Testament is a very argumentative book as the result of that.
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.440]   It's a book that's full of polemic.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:44.460]   If you think of the early church as just an idyllic condition of a Christian people without
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:49.880]   any troubles or difficulties whatsoever, well, you've never read your New Testament truly.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:55.580]   The Christian faith in the very first years had to fight for its very life.
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:14:01.420]   The church was besieged by these false teachings from every conceivable direction, and all
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:08.100]   these epistles were rarely written in order to meet with and to counteract such activities.
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.040]   We can sum it up really by putting it like this.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:17.220]   The first difficulty Christianity had to meet with was the attack that came from Judaism,
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.140]   the old Jewish religion.
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.620]   That's the Galatian trouble.
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:26.380]   That was the trouble with the Hebrew Christians, very naturally.
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:33.180]   But when the fight was won as over against the Jews and Judaism, another terrible fight
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:40.660]   began which was even more dangerous, and it continued for a number of centuries, and that
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:45.600]   was the fight against Greek philosophy.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.660]   You see, the gospel came to Europe, it came to Greece, and there it met at once Greek
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.700]   philosophy, marvelous thought about life.
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.580]   And at once there was a danger and a tendency on the part of people to absorb a certain
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.980]   amount of that philosophy.
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.500]   They did it quite innocently, but they didn't always realize that in doing that they were
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.100]   denying their own faith.
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:11.460]   Now it was something like that, I say, that was taking place in Colossae.
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:16.740]   The Christian church had to fight Greek philosophy for three or four centuries.
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:21.620]   Some of the great early councils of the Christian church had to meet specifically to deal with
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.820]   these very difficulties.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:30.540]   Speculation, human thought, imposing itself upon the gospel and thereby ruining the gospel
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:31.540]   very frequently.
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:36.820]   Now then, that is the kind of thing with which we are confronted.
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:42.740]   The Christian faith there in the ancient world was fighting on all fronts.
[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:48.840]   Greek philosophy, these mystery religions, these forms of mysticism, that ancient tendency
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:54.260]   to absorb a certain amount of Judaism, and here she is fighting in the midst of it.
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.820]   And in a sense this fight has continued ever since.
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:02.500]   It was a great fight in the Middle Ages, a fight that was very largely lost, for there
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.420]   is no question about it the Roman Catholic Church is just a big and a great example of
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.060]   this very thing.
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:12.740]   She absorbed a great deal of paganism and the philosophical teachings, and it's a curious
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.700]   sort of mixture.
[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:18.700]   It's the only true way really to understand the Roman Catholic Church, with her various
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:23.700]   departments and her various sides, highly intellectual, highly emotional, with a great
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.900]   deal of ceremony and ritual, with a rigorism in certain departments.
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:33.820]   It's just a great amalgam and collection and mixture of various types of religions
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.140]   and of philosophies.
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:40.380]   But it isn't only confined to that.
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:46.500]   Wherever you get a tendency to mysticism, this danger always comes in.
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:51.100]   So you'll see it in quite a number of the Protestant mystics as well as the Roman Catholic
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.100]   mystics.
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.300]   But to come right up to date, you find it in the modern world.
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:01.020]   It's right round and about us in the cults.
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.220]   The various cults, I needn't mention them, I needn't name them, you're all familiar
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.220]   with them.
[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:09.580]   They're there, and they have their so-called churches, and they often use the very Christian
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:11.820]   name itself.
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.020]   These other religions, these cults, they appeal to people.
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.500]   They seem to have so much to offer.
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:22.780]   And you'll find still the same characteristics, speculation, human thought, with a kind of
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:30.620]   strictness in living and a kind of sentimentalism, the same old mixture, using different labels
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.500]   and different terms.
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:40.580]   But for me to make my description quite complete, while in the main this problem is one that
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:48.020]   we have to confront in terms of the various cults that are being taught today, let us
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:53.700]   be quite frank and honest and admit that it is a danger that can afflict those of us who
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.540]   are actually within the church.
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:01.660]   The danger to speculation is always with us.
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:08.940]   Speculations about the second coming, speculations about life after death, does it go on forever
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:15.100]   or doesn't it, conditional immortality, is there such a thing as eternal punishment,
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.340]   speculations about these things.
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:22.700]   Now that, I suggest to you, can, unless we are very careful, have the same effect of
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:28.700]   drying up our spiritual lives, robbing us of our joy, in exactly the same way as these
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:36.220]   actual false religions and cults and modern substitutes for Christianity can do to us.
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:41.920]   Very well, there then is a picture of the position by which we are confronted as the
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.900]   early church was confronted.
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:48.300]   You see, my friends, these things don't change.
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.940]   The spiritual life remains always the same.
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:55.300]   The first Christians had the same truth as you and I have.
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:59.060]   They had to fight precisely the same things as we are fighting today.
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:02.060]   They had different names attached, but it was the same thing.
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.100]   Very well, how do we meet all this?
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:08.820]   Well, it seems to me the first thing is to examine the position.
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:15.100]   "How can I know," says someone, "whether I am in danger of falling into this Colossian
[00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.100]   heresy?"
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:21.420]   Well, the first thing is to notice certain general characteristics of the persons who
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:27.380]   do take up these things, because there are certain things that always characterize them,
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.660]   and here are some of them.
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:37.780]   They always have a tendency to be what the Scripture calls "puffed up" and "superior."
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:42.540]   Did you notice it in verse 18, "Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:48.100]   humility and worshiping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen,
[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:51.380]   vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind."
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:57.740]   I have already quoted to you what Paul says in the eighth chapter of the first epistle
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:04.900]   to the Corinthians, "Knowledge," he says, "puffeth out, charity edifieth," which
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.860]   means "builds up."
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:11.980]   It's the difference, if you like, between a balloon and a building.
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:18.180]   This kind of knowledge always puffs a man up, but the true faith builds a man up solidly
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:22.460]   and establishes him in the faith.
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:28.540]   In other words, the followers of these cults and false religions always give the impression
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.580]   of a kind of superiority.
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:35.980]   There is something, to use again the technical term, esoteric about them.
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:40.660]   They have attained unto a knowledge that the vast majority of people lack.
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:45.780]   There is, as a result of this, an element of self-satisfaction and of pride.
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.900]   You will find it invariably.
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:52.260]   They are the people, they have arrived, they have the knowledge, they know, and there is
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:57.820]   no question about it, they are full of self-confidence and of self-satisfaction.
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.860]   Indeed there is another very striking characteristic of such persons.
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:08.660]   They are always zealous and they are always most enthusiastic.
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:15.800]   Now it's a very interesting experiment to work this out in practice.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:21.280]   Think of people whom you know who belong to these various cults and false religions.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.820]   Don't they always give you the impression that they are much more zealous and enthusiastic
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:25.820]   than you are?
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:29.660]   They are always talking about it, always advocating it, always trying to get you to go to their
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:30.660]   meetings.
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:34.500]   There is tremendous enthusiasm and zeal and activity.
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:39.380]   Now the Scriptures teach us that that is always a characteristic of such people.
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.300]   It is one of the great errors, of course, that the devil always makes.
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.620]   He always overdoes what he is trying to do.
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:50.160]   And he produces, therefore, this carnal, excitable zeal.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.780]   The apostle, of course, doesn't hesitate to use a term like delusion.
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:22:00.540]   "I say this," he says, "lest any man should beguile you with enticing words."
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.540]   Yes, it is a beguiling.
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.060]   It is a form of delusion.
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:13.540]   And the result of such a delusion always is that you get this excess, this over-plus.
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.860]   It is always overdone somewhat.
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.620]   But let's be clear about these things.
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:24.660]   Oftentimes, this very enthusiasm is the thing that attracts innocent Christian people.
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.260]   They say, "But look at those people, they can't be wrong.
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.540]   Look at their zeal, look what they have prepared to sacrifice.
[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.060]   Look at the time they give to it."
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:34.460]   You will see them standing on the streets, holding up posters, giving out tracts, visiting
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:35.900]   from door to door.
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:36.980]   Christian people don't seem to do that.
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:37.980]   But look at them.
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:38.980]   Look at their zeal and their enthusiasm.
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:43.540]   "This must be right," says the innocent Christian.
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.780]   The New Testament has a great deal to say about that particular thing.
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.020]   They are carried away.
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:53.220]   They have itching ears to start with, and then they are carried away by this false zeal.
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:57.740]   Well, there, I say, are some of the general characteristics.
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:02.980]   Self-satisfied, puffed up with this knowledge that they have, this enlightenment that they
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:09.620]   have received, and this tremendous enthusiasm and zeal.
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:15.260]   But having looked at it in general, let us try to test the teaching.
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:21.100]   What are the tests that we should apply to any teaching that offers itself to us?
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:27.220]   Now they come, I say, and they appeal to our minds, our understanding, they appeal to our
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:31.380]   desire to live a full and a joyful and a happy Christian life.
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:36.780]   And they come to us with all this plausibility, with all this subtlety, with all this beguiling,
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.180]   with all these enticing words that the apostle speaks of.
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.540]   Now, how do we test them?
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.220]   What standards have we of judgment to apply to them?
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.860]   Well, here are some that are suggested here.
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.420]   The great question to ask always is this.
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:55.700]   What is the teaching based upon?
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:02.940]   Listen to verse 8, "Beware lest any men spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:11.700]   the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ."
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.900]   That's the first test.
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:19.460]   Listen to the teaching, read the books, and then you say, "Well now, where does all this
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.460]   come from?
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.740]   Where does it derive?
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.820]   What is it based upon?
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:28.740]   Is it something that is based directly upon the New Testament teaching?
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:33.260]   Is it based upon the revelation of the Word of God?
[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:39.060]   Can I see that it's derived at every point from scriptural teaching?
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:45.180]   Or is it just something that men have evolved, something that men think, a kind of philosophy,
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:49.900]   the working out of men's ideas and men's understanding?"
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:54.740]   Now that is an absolutely fundamental test.
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:59.460]   You can apply it to any cult in the modern world or to any form of religion or religious
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.780]   teaching that offers itself to you.
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:06.780]   And I think you will find in every single case that there's very little scripture about
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:07.780]   it.
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:11.060]   There is very little of the teaching of Christ.
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.700]   Christ isn't in the center, he isn't essential.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.900]   The whole thing seems to be there without him.
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:20.980]   They may vaguely link themselves onto him, but it isn't all derived from him.
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:26.300]   Now the characteristic of the faith, says Paul, is this, that we hold the head from
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:32.340]   which the body, by joints and bends having nourishment, ministered, and knit together,
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:35.900]   increases with the increase of God.
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:40.580]   The characteristic of the Christian church and Christian teaching is that it is always
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:46.620]   in intimate and direct connection with the head, which is Christ himself.
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:50.860]   There is nothing there without him, so if you can have your religion without Christ,
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:54.140]   if you say your religion leads to Christ, it's a denial of Christ.
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:57.660]   The Christian religion starts and ends with Christ.
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.060]   He's the head, he's the heart, he's the center.
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.540]   Without him there is nothing.
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:07.220]   So let's be very careful with this preliminary first test.
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:11.980]   Are we holding the head, or is it the teachings of men?
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:13.820]   Is it after men?
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.760]   Is it after the tradition of men?
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:21.320]   Is it these enticing words of some fleshly mind that has worked out its theory and its
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.320]   idea?
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:27.580]   Oh, what a vital test this is.
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:31.080]   And let's never forget, I say again, that it's got to be applied not only with things
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:37.920]   that are outside the church, but even with regard to teachings within the church.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:38.920]   Am I going too far?
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:44.040]   I wonder when I say this from this pulpit, that the great trouble in the church for the
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:51.640]   last hundred years has been that philosophy has taken the place of theology.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:56.040]   What I mean by that is this theology is something that comes out of the Bible.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.080]   It's extracting doctrines from the Bible.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.080]   That's theology.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.080]   What's the other?
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:05.020]   Well, the other is men putting down on paper their thoughts about God, what he's like and
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.560]   what he ought to do, and about the Lord Jesus Christ, and trying to make the Scriptures
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.080]   fit into their theory.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.800]   That's philosophy.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.840]   That's human speculation.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.840]   So even though they may use Biblical terms, let's make certain that the terms are coming
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:25.720]   out of the Bible, and not that they're imposing their ideas upon the Bible.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.600]   That's the first test.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:33.040]   But a second test, and a very good one, is this.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:39.200]   Does this other religion or teaching give us the impression that it's very much simpler
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.440]   than the New Testament?
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.200]   What I mean by that is this.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:49.640]   That you will find invariably that these cults and other teachings are always in some shape
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:53.520]   or form a shortcut.
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.120]   And that's why they make their appeal.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.560]   They give you the impression that you can arrive at perfection very quickly, in one
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.560]   action.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.880]   You've only got to do this, and all is well.
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.600]   The Biblical method, on the other hand, seems so slow.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:12.080]   You're born a babe in Christ, and you have your spiritual growing pains, and you seem
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:17.160]   to go wrong, and you have to struggle with these Scriptures, and try to understand them,
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.240]   and try to put them into practice.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.840]   It's a slow process, apparently.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:25.160]   And these other things, it's so simple, it can be done at once, a shortcut to the very
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.160]   thing you wanted.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.800]   Happiness, joy, peace, and all the rest of it.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:29.800]   So simple.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:33.880]   It's a kind of shortcut.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:39.480]   That is undoubtedly another very valuable and a very subtle test.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:45.440]   The devil always, in some shape or form, gives himself and his system away.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:49.120]   It's too good to be true, my friends.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:54.000]   There is in the Christian life, as depicted in the New Testament, this kind of warfare,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   this struggle.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:02.520]   The old and the new, the law within my members, sin within me, and the new men struggling
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.520]   and fighting.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.400]   But all these others seem to do away with it.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.520]   They can put you right so quickly.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:13.960]   A shortcut, and hence its appeal, I say, to the unsuspecting, hence the reason why it
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:19.760]   so easily entices and beguiles the young Christian, one who is new in the faith.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.760]   Cut and dried.
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:21.760]   Shortcut.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:22.760]   Such a quick result.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.840]   It's a characteristic of the counterfeit, invariably.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:31.000]   Or I can put that, perhaps, in a slightly different form in my third test, which I put
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.720]   like this.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.560]   Let us always ask this question.
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:46.160]   Does the blessing promised and offered come from the adoption of some system or some method?
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:50.280]   That is, again, another characteristic of these false religions and these cults.
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.920]   It's perfectly clear in the case of these Colossians.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.360]   They were being told, you see, that all they had to do was this.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:02.160]   They had to accept the speculation, and then they had to refrain from eating certain types
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:06.360]   of foods, and then they had to adopt certain practices.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.640]   And all was perfect.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.240]   Now it's always a characteristic of these teachings.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:15.560]   In the case of mysticism, you see, you begin to travel along the mystic way.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:16.960]   And that's all you've got to do.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.160]   You follow these rules.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:23.200]   You do what this manual of devotion tells you, and you'll get your result.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.520]   You do this, that happens.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.640]   The method is the thing, the system.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:35.000]   And I say, therefore, that if we find in any teaching that its blessing is always based
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:42.240]   upon the adoption of a method or a system, we can be perfectly sure that it isn't New
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.220]   Testament Christianity.
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.520]   New Testament Christianity doesn't work like that.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.420]   It hasn't these shortcuts.
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:54.720]   It hasn't this kind of patent remedy atmosphere concerning it.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:00.560]   It is rather this amazing process of growth in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:05.680]   as the result of the working of the Holy Spirit within us.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:10.480]   But I end again with the test with which I began.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:18.360]   You not only ask, I say, whether it is derived entirely from the Scripture, you again ask
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:23.120]   at the end, is Christ the head?
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.760]   Does it glorify him?
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.880]   And does it make it quite plain and clear that apart from him, there is nothing?
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:36.240]   Very well, there are some of the tests that we apply.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:40.880]   Well now then, let me come to the practical application.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:45.040]   How are we to avoid these things?
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:54.040]   What can we do to safeguard ourselves against these subtle, attractive, enticing teachings
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:59.640]   which are offering themselves to us today as they did to the first Christians?
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.920]   Now there are a number of people who seem to me at this point to go sadly astray.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:10.480]   They say there's only one thing to do, that is refuse to think, and especially refuse
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.480]   to read.
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.840]   They say reading is dangerous.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:17.000]   If you start reading, you begin to speculate, and then you lose everything.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.800]   So they say don't read.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:23.120]   The idea of being a simple Christian is that you read nothing but tracts, or something
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.120]   like that.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.120]   You never read a book, you know.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:28.800]   The dangerous thing to do this is to think, and knowledge is the dangerous thing.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:34.920]   So you keep to that sort of simplicity, in a negative sense.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:39.360]   My dear friends, that isn't the New Testament answer.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:43.120]   That isn't the answer of the Apostle Paul in this mighty epistle to the Colossians.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.120]   What is it?
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.120]   It's this.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:50.760]   "What you need," says Paul, "is not less knowledge and understanding, it's more knowledge
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.760]   and understanding."
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.680]   Listen to him.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:59.760]   "His prayer is that their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love and
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:09.680]   unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:14.480]   and of the Father and of Christ."
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:21.560]   In other words, the Apostle's prescription in this epistle is, "What you need," he says,
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.560]   "is more knowledge."
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.320]   He says, "These people are offering you some supposed knowledge.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.600]   It isn't true knowledge.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.600]   It's knowledge falsely so-called.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.960]   It's after the rudiments of men.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.600]   It's a fleshly kind of knowledge.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.200]   You're interested in mystery," says Paul.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.920]   "You've been rather attracted by the fact that these have got a mysterious and a mystical
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:39.920]   element."
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:44.520]   "Very well," says the Apostle, "if that's what you want, I can give it to you, because
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:48.720]   in Christ are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.040]   It's all in him.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.720]   You needn't go anywhere else.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:58.280]   In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily."
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:03.720]   And therefore the thing to do, says Paul, is to covet this greater knowledge, this true
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.280]   knowledge of Christ.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.800]   You needn't go outside Christ.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.340]   He says, "It's all in Christ.
[00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:17.120]   Every intellectual advancement you need, all intellectual stimulation, it's all here, which
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:22.200]   being applied I can put you in this form."
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:27.640]   Are you attracted by these philosophies about the origin of evil and about the origin of
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:30.880]   the world and about all these things?
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.760]   Do those questions agitate your mind?
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.040]   "Well, my friend, you need do nothing but read your Bible.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.600]   It's all here.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:41.760]   The origin of the world, the origin of man, yes, as far as it can be understood, the origin
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:47.600]   of evil itself, and all the other branches of knowledge that you desire.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:53.080]   Is there somebody here feeling the need of a little intellectual exercise?
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.320]   I can tell you exactly what you have to do.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.960]   Go home and study the Epistle to the Colossians.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:02.720]   It will keep you going for many months, and when you're finished with that, turn to the
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.600]   Ephesians and some of the others."
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:11.400]   Intellectual understanding, the full apprehension and comprehension of God's truth.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.800]   It's more knowledge we need, not less.
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.440]   It is people who are ignorant who are always beguiled by false teachings.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:22.240]   A man who really knows the full content of this, he rejects all others.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.720]   He says, "I have it all here.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.620]   I don't need that.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:26.620]   This is complete.
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:30.160]   I am complete in Christ."
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:34.400]   But very well, let me reduce that to a number of particular statements.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:40.080]   How are we to safeguard ourselves against these things?
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:50.280]   Well, here are the rules, which I try to apply to myself, and which I say to the glory of
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.280]   God and of Christ.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:58.420]   They have not only helped me, but have kept me for thirty years.
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:03.100]   When I have read things which are enticing and attractive on the surface, and have been
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:11.500]   told with enthusiasm about them by other people who are anxious to help, here are the tests.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:17.640]   Keep Christ and your relationship to him central.
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:21.780]   The way to test any teaching or any view of life, finally, is this.
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:25.060]   Does it make you think better of Christ?
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:27.220]   Does it magnify him?
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:30.140]   Does it exalt him?
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:35.340]   You'll find with all these other things, my friends, that they don't do that.
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:38.300]   You'll be praising that teaching.
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:39.820]   They'll turn you upon yourself.
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:42.980]   You'll be talking about what's happened to you, and how much better you are, and how
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.780]   you've not done this and that for a number of years, and so on.
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:52.780]   You'll be exalting yourself and the movement in some shape or form, not Christ.
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:58.900]   This is the fundamental test, the first test, the last test.
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:05.660]   Any teaching that fails me to magnify his grace more than I've ever done is not of
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:06.660]   him.
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:10.420]   Every teaching by the Holy Spirit leads to Christ.
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.040]   Let me put it even like this.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:15.980]   The teaching of the Holy Spirit doesn't even stop at the Holy Spirit.
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:22.060]   "He shall glorify me," said Jesus Christ, and he always does.
[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:26.740]   So if you find yourself stopping even at the Holy Spirit and his gifts, you can be sure
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.640]   that you are in danger of being deluded, my friends.
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:34.380]   The true work of the Holy Spirit is to lead us to him, to reveal him, to make us worship
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.740]   him the more, and magnify him the more.
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:41.720]   Oh, if your love for Christ isn't increasing by the teaching that you've espoused and
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:46.840]   are following, begin to doubt it, for here Christ is central, he's the all and in all.
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.720]   It is all in Christ.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:55.000]   In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and you're more and more amazed
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   at him.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:03.360]   You're closer to the head and ever more dependent upon him.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:13.960]   So the second thing I say is this, watch your heart, watch your spirit.
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:18.060]   Are we tending to become proud and exalted?
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:22.800]   Are we tending to develop a spirit of superiority and of self-satisfaction?
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.660]   Do we tend to despise others?
[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:29.780]   If so, it's nothing to do with Christ.
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:34.100]   What a terrible danger this is.
[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:38.100]   God knows any man who's privileged to stand in a pulpit as I am Sunday by Sunday knows
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:39.580]   this danger.
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:46.700]   Knowledge of any type, unless we are careful, always has a tendency to puff up.
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:52.780]   And a man who reads and thinks and meditates and speaks is in this great danger.
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:57.620]   There's only one thing that I know of that is more dangerous than being a preacher in
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:01.900]   the sense that I am, and that is to be a lay preacher.
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:06.460]   Oh, how often have I seen it.
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:15.100]   Men who've been converted and who are living a beautiful Christian life, they start preaching.
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.740]   I'm saying this merely by way of illustration.
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:19.980]   They start preaching.
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.820]   And I notice a subtle change in them.
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:26.320]   They come to me and immediately I'm conscious of the fact that they're talking to me as
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:32.860]   one great preacher to another.
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:38.300]   Men were simple and loving, but you see, they've been preparing.
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.580]   And this is what I said in my sermon, they tell me.
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:43.420]   And I listen.
[00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.260]   How subtle it all is.
[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:49.100]   Knowledge puffeth up.
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:51.420]   So let's watch our hearts, my friend.
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:55.500]   Let us keep a careful eye upon our spirits.
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:02.420]   If there is any tendency whatsoever, I say, to become puffed up, crucify it at once.
[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:03.420]   You're being led astray.
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:07.200]   You're being beguiled, some or another, by the devil.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:11.400]   So it is essential we should keep a careful eye upon the heart and upon the spirit.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:17.020]   Then another thing which I regard as of supreme importance is this.
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:21.460]   Beware of the lusts of the mind.
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:25.060]   I'm not talking about the lusts of the flesh this morning.
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:27.460]   The lusts of the mind.
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:32.500]   You notice Paul, in writing to the Ephesians, talks about the lusts of the flesh and of
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:34.220]   the mind.
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:38.940]   And in this particular connection, it is the lust of the mind that is extremely dangerous.
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:39.940]   What do I mean by that?
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:40.940]   I mean this.
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:54.140]   The mind of men, as the result of sin and the foe, has a lust to understand everything.
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:57.060]   That is why philosophy is always dangerous.
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:00.760]   That is why the last sin is pride of intellect.
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.400]   The human mind wants to be like God.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.100]   That was how the devil tempted him in the garden, wasn't it?
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.660]   He shall be as God's.
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:10.420]   If you only do what I tell you, then you'll know as much as God.
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:13.220]   And we want to understand everything.
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:19.180]   This lust after full understanding, beware of it.
[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:24.740]   Beware of this lust after knowledge, quae knowledge.
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:32.940]   Beware of the tendency to speculate and to ask questions that should never be asked.
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:37.220]   I think we all know what I mean by that.
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:40.740]   There are so many Christian people I've known to be unhappy simply because they've tried
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:42.340]   to understand the origin of evil.
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:44.100]   They say, "I don't understand this.
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:46.920]   If God is perfect and God made the world, where does evil come from?"
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.140]   And then they lose their joy.
[00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:52.700]   They've been speculating about something that they're never meant to understand.
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.820]   We are not meant to know that.
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:42:00.380]   And then they begin speculating about life after death.
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:05.180]   And you see, instead of taking the scriptural statements which talk about everlasting destruction
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:09.580]   and eternal death, they say, "Now it's inconceivable that a God of love should allow that."
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:12.220]   At that moment, they're speculating.
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:16.380]   They put the scripture aside, they say, "I can't believe that God, the God I believe
[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:20.980]   in" - the moment you speak like that, you're speculating, that's philosophy.
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:23.380]   And it all arises from this lust of the mind.
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:28.740]   We want to understand and to comprehend everything with our pygmy, sinful little minds, and it
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:30.620]   can't be done, my friends.
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:31.620]   Beware of speculation.
[00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:36.740]   Beware of the lusts of the mind.
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:44.720]   In other words, we must learn to rest in faith, and to realize that in this life we walk by
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:48.180]   faith not by sight.
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:53.380]   The older I get, the more I am defining faith like this.
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:43:02.380]   Faith means that I am content with what I'm told in the Bible, and that I have ceased
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:05.940]   to desire to know what I'm not told in the Bible.
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:09.940]   And that ultimately leads to this, that I have stopped asking questions which I know
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:14.900]   are not answered in the Bible.
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:18.980]   God has chosen to reveal certain things to us.
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:24.620]   He has chosen, equally, not to reveal certain other things to us.
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:29.620]   And I say, therefore, that faith means this, that I am content with the revelation, I don't
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:33.580]   want to know what is not revealed, I stop asking questions about things that are not
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:34.580]   revealed.
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:38.860]   So give up arguing about the origin of evil, you'll never get at the answer.
[00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:41.940]   You'll know it in eternity, you'll never know it in this world.
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:47.700]   You will never know the ultimate truth about the final destiny of souls in the next world,
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:48.700]   in this life.
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:52.460]   It's no use talking about the Greek, and what the Greek says, and eternal and so on.
[00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:55.060]   My dear friends, the scholars are on both sides.
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.780]   Stop speculating.
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:59.680]   And the same about the second coming.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:04.100]   There are certain details which we do not know, we are not meant to know, well therefore
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:05.500]   why speculate about them?
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:10.180]   If the scripture tells me not to be concerned about the times and seasons, why should I
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:17.180]   be trying to work out a timetable and an order of chronology from my morning newspaper?
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:20.620]   It's unscriptural, it's speculation.
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:25.540]   So whatever the form of teaching, I say, let us learn to be content with faith, let us
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:30.100]   be humble, let us say I don't know, don't be ashamed to say you don't know.
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:33.660]   There are many things we don't know, let's say so.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:40.660]   We are not meant to understand everything as Christians, and we certainly do not understand.
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:48.460]   And my final word of advice is a very, very practical one.
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:53.180]   Balance your reading.
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:59.140]   We have heard a great deal in recent years about a balanced diet, and it's very important.
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:07.020]   Proteins, fats, carbohydrates, get the right balance, quite right.
[00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:10.220]   It's essential to physical health.
[00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:15.020]   It is equally essential in the realm of the mind and the intellect.
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:18.220]   Balance your reading.
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:23.420]   If I may give a personal word, I'd put it like this.
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:33.300]   When I'm trying to read a book on pure theology or on philosophy, I always read at the same
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:39.940]   time the biography of a saint.
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:40.940]   You see what I do?
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:44.140]   I read my philosophy, my theology in the morning.
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:49.020]   It's intellectual, and it has this fatal tendency to puff up.
[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:55.740]   So I read in the afternoon or in the evening the simple account of the life of some saint
[00:45:55.740 --> 00:46:07.100]   of God with his humility, his love, his sympathy, his understanding, his holiness, his reproduction
[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:12.620]   of the life of his blessed Lord and Master.
[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:15.940]   And it counteracts the other danger.
[00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:16.940]   Balance your reading.
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:22.620]   Don't read always along the same line, "Oh, I've seen it spoil the life of many a Christian.
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:24.580]   I've seen people lose their joy.
[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:27.900]   Men who have become Christian and who have natural intellect and understanding, they
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:32.940]   read along one line only, and they go astray, they become puffed up, heady and high-minded,
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:36.460]   and they lose the vital thing."
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:40.280]   They haven't been balancing their reading.
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:46.920]   We must get to know ourselves and treat ourselves, and we must give ourselves the right type
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:51.860]   of intellectual diet.
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:54.340]   Balance your reading and balance your thought.
[00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:57.940]   Very well, it all comes back to this.
[00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:03.660]   What is your relationship to your blessed Lord?
[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:07.900]   Do you feel that you're more his debtor than ever?
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:13.940]   Are you more than ever conscious of your sinfulness, your unworthiness, your weakness, your smallness?
[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:26.700]   True teaching always brings us to that, none of self ultimately and all of him.
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:28.100]   Amen.
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:32.020]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
