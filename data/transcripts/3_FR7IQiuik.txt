[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800]   How do we win the war against lust?
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.480]   That was the question Pastor John addressed in his sermon, "Battling the Unbelief of
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.080]   Lust," a sermon he preached 25 years ago on 1 Thessalonians 4, verses 1-8.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.560]   Here's how he ended the message.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:25.400]   I close with an illustration of a man who was in bondage to lust for 10 years in the
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.880]   most gross forms short of adultery, but who got victory.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.720]   He wrote his story in an unsigned article in Leadership Magazine, which any of you can
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.440]   read in our library, Fall 1982.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:49.320]   He was a religious man, and the story he tells is one of great tragedy until something happens.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.740]   And I want to just tell you from the key paragraph what happened in his life.
[00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.900]   He discovered a book by Francois Mariac, a Catholic French novelist, who wrote a book
[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.160]   called "What I Believe."
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.540]   In that book he had a chapter on sexuality and lust in particular, in which he described
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.400]   his own war against it as a little Catholic young man.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.520]   He says that all of the guilt that he experienced and all of the shame did not conquer lust
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.600]   in his life.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.400]   Rather, he came to discover that one great power exists that can conquer lust, and that's
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.960]   the power described in the Beatitude, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.960]   God."
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.600]   And the man who was writing this and reading that book wrote this paragraph, which describes
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.000]   his own discovery.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.720]   "The thought hit me like a bell, rung in a dark, silent hall.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.320]   So far, none of the scary negative arguments against lust had succeeded in keeping me from
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.320]   it.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.340]   But here was a description of what I was missing by continuing to harbor lust.
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.420]   I was limiting my own intimacy with God.
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.520]   The love he offers is so transcendent and possessing that it requires our faculties
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.400]   to be purified and cleansed before we can experience or can possibly contain all of
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.680]   it.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.320]   Could he, in fact, substitute another thirst and another hunger for the one I had never
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.760]   filled?
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.280]   Would living water somehow quench lust?
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.540]   That was the gamble of faith."
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.760]   And I wrote down here, "It was no gamble."
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:56.840]   The way to fight lust is by feeding faith with the knowledge of an irresistibly glorious
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.320]   God.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:06.580]   The way to fight lust is by feeding faith with the knowledge of an irresistibly glorious
[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.160]   God.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.480]   Do you know God?
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:20.720]   Are you engaged in week by week growth in knowing God?
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.360]   Do you meditate on God's Word day and night?
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:33.560]   Do you spend time focusing in on the snapshots of the image of God in his Son in the Gospels?
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:42.920]   Do you read great solid books that describe the character and the ways of God?
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:51.280]   Do you associate with people who are God besotted and God saturated?
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.120]   Are you praying daily, sometimes with fasting, that God would so waken and quicken your heart
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:05.280]   that you would have the capacity to be ravished by the irresistible glory of God with emotion
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.840]   and a movement and a joy overpowering all the passions that can go out towards pornography?
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.880]   Are you engaged in the warfare at that level?
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:25.080]   If not, I invite you to make those commitments, to resolve in your heart if this is right,
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.120]   if knowing God in all his irresistible glory is the way to push this junk out of my life,
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.940]   I want God, I want to be greedy for God, I want more of God than I've ever known if that's
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.160]   the way out of this bondage.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.160]   Beautiful.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.280]   That's what we're all about, a desiring God, relishing in God to find a love and security
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.600]   and a delight that trumps the empty lies of sin.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   Sins like lust.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.640]   And if you want to fuel a sin-killing delight in God, I cannot recommend to you more highly
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.140]   a little book Pastor John wrote titled, "Seeing and Savoring Jesus Christ."
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.340]   You can download it for free and start reading it right now.
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.840]   Go to desiringgod.org, click on the books tab and you'll find it, "Seeing and Savoring
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.840]   Jesus Christ."
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.000]   Well, you may have heard that David Platt became the new president of the SBC's International
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.120]   Mission Board.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.560]   It was huge news and in light of this move, what's the future of international world missions?
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.440]   I'll ask Pastor John that tomorrow.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.440]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.440]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
