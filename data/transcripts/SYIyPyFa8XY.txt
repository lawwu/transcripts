[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Good Monday morning. You may remember last year Pastor John and I recorded five podcast episodes in Nashville, Tennessee,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   at the Sing Global 2022 Getty Music Conference. We recorded live before a couple thousand of you who were there.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   A lot of church leaders and worship leaders and musicians were in the house. It was a great experience and very engaged, as you're going to hear.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Today we feature one of those recordings on getting the Sunday morning worship vibe right. Here it is.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   [Applause]
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Let's get more specific into the music worship and how you begin a Sunday morning gathering.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Let's talk about the call to worship for a moment. Stephen is a listener to the podcast and he writes in with a question about the call to worship.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Hello Pastor John and thank you for asking Pastor John. It has helped me think through a lot of pastoral issues over the years.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   I don't exactly remember where I heard it, but I remember you saying that Paul's claim that Christians are sorrowful yet always rejoicing,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   2 Corinthians 6.10, that dual claim informed how you framed your welcome and call to worship in the opening moments of the Sunday morning gathering.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   You believed it was your calling to set the tenor of the corporate gathering in such a way that whether people were coming from a glorious wedding feast last night,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   or whether they just arrived from the hospital with a dying spouse in the ICU, that this moment of worship together should feel relevant to both groups.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Can you expand on how your call to worship did this on Sunday morning?
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Whether my call to worship did it, others will have to judge, but that certainly was my aspiration.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   It starts like this. The leader, let's just say the pastor, who's going to welcome people into this event right now called corporate worship.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   At that moment, he's setting the tone for what he thinks should take place here.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   He ought to be profoundly aware that to be a human being, a consciousness in a universe created by, governed by, upheld by, guided by a person, God, three in one, is an awesome thing.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   To be a person is an awesome thing. To be a human being is a staggering reality.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   So you start there. You say, "I'm alive. I exist in that kind of personal universe created in the image of the one who made and upheld everything."
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   You just let it sink in. "You exist, pastor. This is awesome."
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Then add to that, God exists, Christ exists, the Holy Spirit exists, the incarnation, unspeakable, happened.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   The Son of God lived. He died. God died for sinners. He rose again. He reigns in heaven today.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   The Holy Spirit inhabits his people. Faith connects us with God.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   There's a hell to which people are going. There's a heaven and eternal joy to which we're going.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   These are staggeringly glorious realities, all of them, beyond imagination, beyond speaking.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   He should be utterly overwhelmed with the weight of glory.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   That's where you start.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And if you start there, you don't welcome people with slapstick.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   You don't.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   I mean, I find it incomprehensible.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   What we're dealing with onâ€”and we just get an hour a week, basically.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   We're dealing with the greatest and most glorious and weighty things in the world.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   People have been saturated with television, saturated with movies, saturated with social media all week long.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I find it incomprehensible that pastors would think, "Well, now what we need to do is sound more like that entertainment."
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   That's just the opposite. That's just the opposite of the way I think.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I'm desperately pleading to God for words and a demeanor that would communicate another world of joy than that.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   I have the suspicion that most people today, younger than me, younger than 76, have grown up mainly in a world of entertainment.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   And they are shot through with the whole world of this world, and happiness and joy and gladness and pleasure and well-being are all in those categories.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   So that if I try to present an alternative to that, it will only sound like morose, dismal, glum, boring.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   They have no categories for an alternative.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Like if you say, "Not that. Not that chipper, superficial, chatty, slapstick, casual. Not that. Not that talk show host demeanor."
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   The only thing they can think of is, "Hmm."
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   That's tragic. That's tragic.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   As if there were no such thing as 2 Corinthians 6.10, "Sorrowful yet always rejoicing."
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   So that's one way to come at it.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Namely, it is a mysterious and glorious thing to be a human being.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And the realities of the Bible are the greatest realities in the world.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   And the emotions that correspond to them are infinite in joy, infinite in horror as we contemplate hell, and they're not trivial.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   The other way I came at it was this.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   I tried to keep my finger on the pulse of the tragedies of the world.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   So my people have heard this week, and if they haven't, they're watching the wrong newscasts,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   that Pakistan today is one-third underwater, some of it 10 feet deep.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   A thousand people have been killed, three million are displaced, and it is desperate.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   One-third of America would be the East Coast to the Mississippi underwater.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   This is what I'd be saying to my people.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   I'd be saying, "Folks, as we gather, we know that this is happening."
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And I would just say, "That's the world, folks. That's this morning's world."
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   And if you don't have a theology that can turn that to serious joy, you don't have the right theology.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Because if knowing about Pakistan can only ruin your day, all your days will be ruined.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   There's always a Pakistan.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   It's just one of a dozen horrors that are going on right now.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   So that's a piece.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Then lastly, I'll just say I tried to keep my finger on the pulse of this people right now in this room and what they're dealing with.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   For example, I can remember this one.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   So our fighter verse was Psalm 34, "He will keep all your bones. Not one of them is broken."
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   We always recited our fighter verse. I tried to weave it into our welcome.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Well, there's a boy sitting in the third row with a cast on his arm.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   He's probably nine years old.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   And I'm saying, coming out of my mouth from the Word of God, "He keeps all your bones. Not one of them is broken."
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   What are you going to do about that?
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Ignore it?
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Now, I hadn't seen him till I got down there.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   I didn't have this plan.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   But I spotted that cast.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   And how easy it would have been to joke.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   I don't know how you would turn it into a joke with a Psalm, but somebody would.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   And I walked back to him.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I said, "Whoa, I think I knew his name. I can't remember right now.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   What happened?"
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   This is in the welcome to worship.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   And then I said, let's call him Timmy.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   I said, "Timmy, you know what I think the Psalm means?"
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   You got to decide for yourself what that Psalm means.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   There's Psalm 91 and Psalm 34. They say things like that.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   I said, "I think that means one of your bones will never be broken.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   He will never let your bone be broken unless he's got something amazing planned
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   that he wants to do through that broken bone.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   So watch out for it." Something like that.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Now, that was serious.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   It was light in the sense that I wasn't--he's a nine-year-old.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   I'm not going to, you know, sound real heavy.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   But it was a powerful moment for me and for our church.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   So God is--human being is big. God is big.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   The world is horrible. Pain is in your church.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   How can you be chipper?
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   How can you create silliness as the modus operandi of welcome to worship?
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Yes, so good. Love the live feedback as we recorded.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   That was from our recording in Nashville, Tennessee,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   the fourth episode that we've released so far,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   which also includes APJs 1861, 1877, and 1882.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Those are the three others that are out, episodes 1861, 1877, and 1882.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   And we have one more to come, APJ 1887, on fighting off despondency.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   That's coming up on Friday, APJ 1877.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Well, how do we push the glorious truths that we understand with our minds
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   deep into the affections of our hearts?
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   That is a vital discipline that turns our daily Bible reading
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   into daily Bible worship.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   And early in the new year is a good time for a refresher on how that works.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   And it's up next. I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
