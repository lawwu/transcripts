[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080]   Hello everyone, welcome to the new year and before we uncork 2020 on the podcast
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.520]   I have a favor to ask of you
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.160]   we love to serve you on this podcast and we want to serve you even better in the year ahead and beyond and
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.240]   To serve you better means we need to know you a little bit better and to that end
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.580]   We put together a brief survey that takes just a few minutes to fill out
[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.640]   It will be up until the end of January if you're willing to help us out go to desiringgod.org/survey
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.000]   That's desiringgod.org/survey
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.680]   And I'll mention that address again at the end of our first episode of 2020 which starts right now
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:44.580]   Pastor John some Christians believe in New Year's resolutions
[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.200]   Other Christians mock resolutions and most Christians just simply avoid resolutions altogether
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.680]   But we are getting a number of email questions on this from both resolution setters and resolution haters
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.380]   So the question for you is this for the Christian are New Year's resolutions helpful
[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.840]   Are they harmful or are they just a setup for eventual failure? How should we think biblically about resolutions?
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.520]   Well as always Tony it depends on what you mean by resolutions if you mean
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.440]   Declarations of what you intend to do by dint of willpower
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.280]   Then that will not only probably fail
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.840]   If it doesn't fail, it's not Christian either. So if it fails it fails and if it succeeds it fails
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.080]   Because that's not what the Christian life is
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.920]   It's not lived that way not at the beginning of a year not at the beginning of a day or beginning of an hour
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.920]   You don't screw up your willpower to obey a command
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.860]   And resolve to do a thing by virtue of strong resolution and call that Christianity
[00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.080]   It's it's not the mystery of holiness is
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.720]   That we live our lives in the strength of another
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.720]   That is we walk by the Spirit
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.040]   We walk by faith in the power of another we depend on
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.560]   Another namely the Holy Spirit to do in us and through us what needs to be done
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.900]   So that another namely God will get the glory the principle
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.040]   Whether it's new year new morning new hour is
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.920]   first Peter 4 11 let him who serves
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.960]   Serve in the strengths that God supplies
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.320]   So you can paraphrase it let him who resolves to do a thing or not do a thing
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.120]   Resolve in the strength that God supplies so that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ to him be glory forever
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.880]   So yes, go ahead resolve Paul put it like this by the grace of God
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.480]   I am what I am and his grace toward me was not in vain on the contrary. I
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.680]   Worked harder than any of them so he gets up in the morning and he says what do I have to do today?
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.780]   Well, I have to travel to Philippi. I have to make three tents tonight have to prepare a message for tomorrow morning
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.680]   I resolve to do those things and then he says though it was not I but the grace of God
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.480]   That was with me first Corinthians 15 10 or he says in Romans 15 8
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.880]   I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.880]   Through me to bring obedience to the Gentiles. So he says we're going to Spain. Let's go. I resolve to go to Spain
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.160]   I've got this ambition to preach the gospel where Christ has not been named. Let's go and then he writes
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.720]   I'm not going to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me. So his
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.840]   Resolutions are empowered by sustained by
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.200]   worked through the grace of Christ which is
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.120]   Right at the heart of what it means to live the Christian life not just make resolutions
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.440]   Philippians 1 12 work out your salvation with fear and trembling for God is the one who is at work in you which could be
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.720]   paraphrased
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.840]   Resolve make a resolution with fear and trembling for God is the one who's the making the resolution in you
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.600]   That's the way to live the Christian life. So my answer is yes, we should make
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.400]   resolves
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.260]   Lots of times not just at the beginning of a year whenever we feel
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:31.000]   Whenever we see something that we should be doing that we're not doing we should resolve do it
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.360]   Whenever we're not doing something that we should be doing and we recognize that we're not doing it
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.360]   We should resolve don't do it or did I say that backwards?
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.960]   You know what? I mean? We got it
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:49.160]   Resolve not to do what you shouldn't do and resolve to do what you should do whenever you see that you're not doing it
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.640]   Or that you're doing it. God doesn't like for our hearts to be
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.080]   Irresolute the opposite of resolving is to be irresolute
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.140]   Decisive and here's what Elijah said about that
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:08.400]   How long will you go limping between two different opinions if the Lord is God follow him if bailed as God follow him?
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.760]   So resolve this day who you're gonna serve get off the fence and and follow your Lord
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.560]   and I think there are a lot of Christians who are afraid of
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.680]   Resolutions and and the opposite of resolution is not this wonderful freedom of dependence on God to empower them
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.180]   It's sitting on a fence and not making any
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:32.360]   Commitments to be or do a certain certain thing Paul said this has been really important in my understanding
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:40.080]   Tony of tough decisions. He said in Romans 14 5 one man esteems one day of another
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:47.760]   Another just seems everyday esteems everyday alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.920]   That's amazing
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.880]   In other words, whether you go with saying all days are alike or whether you go with the steaming one day above another
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.320]   Don't be wishy-washy
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.880]   Don't waffle don't sit on the fence. God doesn't like
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.960]   Irresolute hearts make up your mind decide resolve act
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:14.520]   So David says to the counselors of Solomon set your mind and heart to seek the Lord
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.360]   What is that but resolve set your mind and heart or about rea bowen?
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:26.560]   The Bible says he did evil for he did not set his heart to seek the Lord. He didn't resolve to seek the Lord
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.120]   He just coasted in his life
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.880]   So here's here's a theology of resolution in a verse Tony. This is the most important
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:42.800]   Two verses in the Bible on New Year's resolutions. So everybody should just go get their Bible study these two verses
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.000]   They'll have a theology of resolution second Thessalonians 1 11 and 12 to this end
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.800]   We always pray for you that our God may make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.720]   May God fulfill
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.720]   every resolve
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.720]   for good and every work of faith
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.520]   by his power
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:10.120]   That the name of the Lord Jesus may be glorified. Everything is there. So here here they are
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.200]   You should resolve for good resolve good things in your life second
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.320]   This is pursued by faith so that it's a work of faith third
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:27.620]   God acts through that faith by his power fourth thus God fulfills the good resolve fifth thus Jesus gets glory
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.920]   That's the theology of resolution in in two verses second Thessalonians 1
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.400]   11 to 12 so my answer is
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.960]   Not just at New Year's but all the time whenever we see we're falling short
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:46.760]   Resolve not to fall short and whenever we see something that needs to be done
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:53.320]   Resolved to do it. So good. Thank you pastor John for that robust defense of resolutions
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.960]   Well, if this is my first read through the Bible
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.120]   What should I expect to see?
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:05.120]   so many great Bible reading questions arrive to us at the start of a new year like this one from a listener named Mike and
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:12.560]   Pastor John will adjust the expectations for first-time Bible readers next time on Friday when we return and until then if you're willing to help us
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:20.000]   Out go to our online survey go to desiringgod.org/survey. That's desiringgod.org/survey
