[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Episode number 1000 today. It is incredible.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   It should be a little out of the norm, of course, and it is.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Today we tackle a surprisingly common phenomenon made super convenient by the technology of the smartphone.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Of course, we're talking about sending nude selfies.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   This is part of a growing conversation in our culture.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   I recently met with the assistant principal of a large public high school here in the suburbs of Minneapolis to talk about smartphones and teens.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   This is what she said to me. I wrote it down so I could share it here.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Quote, "In the last year, I've been shocked at how many kids, kids that you would never suspect, have naked pictures on their phones,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   private pictures sent between them and a boyfriend or a girlfriend.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   In my job, I look through a lot of phones, and when I come across those pictures, I'm simply stunned.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   To me, when it comes to high school students and their smartphones, this is the most surprising trend I now see."
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   End quote.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   But this is part of a much larger phenomenon happening among males specifically,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   who will send unsolicited nude pictures of themselves to girls out of the blue.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   It's a disturbing new practice now well-documented by journalist Nancy Jo Sales in her eye-opening book,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   American Girls, Social Media and the Secret Lives of Teenagers.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   It's a troubling book too, and a wake-up call for any parent with a daughter who has a smartphone.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   I say all of this to introduce today's question, which comes to us from a 20-something listener named Lily.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Lily writes in to ask this, "Dear Pastor John, I'm currently in a long-distance dating relationship with a fellow Christian.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Lately, he has requested that I send pictures of myself nude, which I obliged.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   I now regret this decision.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   What would you say to young, unmarried Christians who are tempted to make this same mistake?"
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   I think I have good biblical authority in saying on behalf of God to every one of his children, male and female,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   don't ever ask to see anyone naked except your spouse, and don't ever offer to show yourself to someone naked
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   for erotic or sexual reasons, not medical reasons, except to your spouse.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   And I mean don't do it in person and don't do it in pictures.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   And I'll give you seven reasons for why I think I have God's authority in saying that,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   and I hope none of you hearing me will ever do it or ever do it again.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Number one, when God created man and woman, it says in Genesis 2.25,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   That guilt-free, shame-free existence came to an end when Adam and Eve sinned.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   And their first experience after that sin was guilt and blame and shame.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   And so in Genesis 3.7, it says, "Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Then God had mercy on them."
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   In Genesis 3.21, it says, "The Lord made for Adam and his wife garments of skin and clothed them."
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   God's plan for the lifting of that shame is the sacred relationship of marriage,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   just like marriage is the reversal of numerous elements of the curse.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   The freedom that we are to discover is not on stage.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Let's take our clothes off in movies and on stage.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   It's not in a striptease joint.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   It's not in front of boyfriends or girlfriends.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   It's not in front of our phone.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   It's the profound respect and love and security of a covenant relationship called marriage.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   That's where people of the most ordinary looks can be free from shame.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   That's what love does.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Outside of that relationship, God treats nakedness as one of the most vivid forms of divine judgment.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Isaiah 47.3, "Your nakedness shall be uncovered, and your disgrace shall be seen.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I will take vengeance, and I will spare no one."
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Or Lamentations 1.8, "Jerusalem sinned grievously.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Therefore, she became filthy.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   All who honored her despise her, and they have seen her nakedness.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   She herself grooms and turns her face away."
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Ezekiel 16.37, "Behold, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   all those you loved and all those you hated.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I will gather them against you from every side and will uncover your nakedness to them,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   that they may see all your nakedness."
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   In other words, nakedness in the covenant bed of marriage is a beautiful and thrilling thing for God's children.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   But nakedness outside that relationship is a manifestation of divine judgment.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Even though we have been taught as a nation by the media, by the movie industry,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   and by certain notorious stars to regard nudity as a form of power and distinction and fame,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   they glory in their shame, the Bible says.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   That's number one.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Number two, it follows from this, this understanding of nakedness and clothing,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   that the Apostle Paul would say, "Women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   with modesty and self-control, with what is proper for women who profess godliness."
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Now, all three of those words, "cosmeo," respectable, "idus," modesty, "sophrasunes," self-control,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   all of those three words, interestingly, have the connotation of thoughtful, serious use of a woman's mind
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   as to how to make her clothing speak about her godliness.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Every woman should ask that question.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   How is what I wear and not wear speaking about my godliness?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Her reverence for God and her own body as a gift of God, intended to be used to show his value to her.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Clothing is not a matter of indifference in God's economy.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   It speaks about a woman's and a man's view of God and her own commitments to God and joy in God
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   and her freedom from the manipulative maneuvers of men to get what they want.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   That's number two.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Number three, Paul assumes in 1 Corinthians 12.23 that we take special care in covering the most intimate parts of our body.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   He says, "On those parts of the body that we think less honorable, we bestow greater honor,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty, which our more presentable parts do not require."
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   That's part of the way God has helped us live with the consequences of the fall in this sinful world.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Number four, Paul tells Timothy, and by implication other young men,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   "Do not rebuke an older man, but encourage him as you would a father.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Younger men as brothers. Treat younger men as brothers. Older women as mothers."
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   And here's the key one, "Treat younger women as sisters in all purity."
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Now, what does that mean, "Treat younger women as sisters in all purity"?
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   It means until a man is married, he should let his proper treatment of his sister, his real sister,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   dictate the purity of his behavior with his girlfriend.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Another way to put it would be this, "View the temptation to ask for nude pictures
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   the same way you would view the temptation of incest."
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Number five, if a man asks an unmarried woman to show him her body,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   by definition, he is unworthy of her, unworthy of her trust, her affection, and her covenant.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   That request that he's making in itself should be enough for the woman to say, "Goodbye."
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   I really mean this, come on, women.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   If any woman thinks that is normal male Christian behavior, it's not. It's sick.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   It means he's clueless as to godliness.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   It means that when he gets tired of you before or after marriage,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   he will feel free to ask someone else to take off her clothes.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   And if he can't get it in person, he'll get it from the internet,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   and you will have told him it's okay because you cooperated before marriage, not just in marriage.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   So just settle it. If he asks, he's unworthy, period. It's over.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Number six, in the Song of Solomon, which exalts in nudity between a married man and woman,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   it says more than once, "I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or the does of the field,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   that you not stir up or awaken love until it pleases."
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   That's exactly what sexually erotic pictures do that we're not supposed to do.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   They stir up desire that cannot be lawfully satisfied,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   which means they will lead to masturbation or to fornication.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   I don't know what goes on inside a woman's head,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   but I can only think that it is a deformed sense of sexuality
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   if a woman gets pleasure out of helping a man act like a 13-year-old boy with his masturbation.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Is that really the kind of man she wants?
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   And finally, number seven, the least important reason,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   it's the least important reason and maybe the most compelling.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   To take such pictures is virtually certain that they will go public sooner or later,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   and you will discover what God meant by bringing judgment on yourself.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   So with God's authority, I think I can say to both men and women,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   don't ask and don't give such pictures.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you, Lily, for being willing to share this with us
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   to spark a conversation on a topic that we need to have.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   1,000 episodes. We've made it to 1,000 episodes, and that's because of your support.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   So thank you for your prayers.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Thank you for making this podcast a part of your routine each week.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   And thank you, of course, for the generous financial donations
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   that support our work on this podcast and everything that we do at DesiringGod.org.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   If you would like to financially partner with us in these gospel labors,

[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   1,000 episodes means we also have 1,000 questions now in our archive.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   You can make use of them, and you'll find them all at our online home at DesiringGod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Well, on Friday we're going to return to talk about pets.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Are pets a distraction from the Christian life? It's a good question.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Episode number 1001, coming up on Friday on pets.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening.
