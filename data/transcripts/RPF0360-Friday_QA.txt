[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   It's Friday, that means live Q&A.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.920]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.920]   This is the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.000]   you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   in ten years or less.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.160]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host and on Fridays we do live Q&A.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.000]   This is where the audience gets to call in, or certain members of the patrons of the audience
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.320]   get to call in and ask their questions and tell me their thoughts about anything they
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:52.840]   want to talk about.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.600]   I love answering questions from all of you in the audience and those questions can happen
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.600]   in a number of different ways.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.800]   I get lots of emails from you and I have too many emails, I'll never be able to answer
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.800]   all the emails.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.080]   So I do have a list of them and I keep them there and from time to time I'll pull the
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.080]   emails into a show.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.040]   But if you would like to get my opinion directly on a subject at the moment, these Friday Q&A
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.160]   calls are your best opportunity.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.600]   So if you'd like to participate in them in the future, feel free to sign up to become
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.760]   a patron of the show.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.880]   I think it's at seven bucks a month and you get access to these Q&A calls.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.400]   So feel free to check that out.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.840]   We've got, let's see, one, two, three, four, five people sitting on the line right now.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.440]   So we're going to start.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.400]   Let's go to Matt in North Carolina.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.400]   I know you said you had to go.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.400]   So let's go to you.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.400]   Tell me what your question is and let's see how we can work together today.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.400]   Thanks, Joshua.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.920]   I sure appreciate it.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:48.080]   I guess my question today relates to the need for bonds or not having bonds in a long-term
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.160]   retirement portfolio.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.920]   Essentially with interest rates so low right now, I have concern about the capital value
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.360]   of the bonds in the event that rates go up.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.360]   Also, stocks in general have better expected returns from a mutual fund standpoint.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.000]   And so from an allocation standpoint, I'm pretty comfortable in long-term investments
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.960]   at like 90% stock funds and 10% cash.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.560]   And then, you know, with an interest long-term and just having my home paid off and that
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.320]   kind of having a bond-like effect in my portfolio.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.400]   And I know that that's pretty heterodox from an allocation standpoint.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.120]   And I guess I have some understanding of the academic literature on that, but wondered,
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.160]   you know, do you see any – what are your thoughts on that kind of strategy?
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.680]   The big distinction here is with the academic literature, it's almost always primarily
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.600]   focused around a portfolio from a scientific basis, meaning we have this portfolio and
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.320]   this portfolio is trying to produce certain investment outcome returns for us.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.760]   So what's the best way that we can manage just this portfolio in order for us to accomplish
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.480]   the investment outcome?
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.660]   So the way bonds work in a portfolio is as you put in more bonds, you smooth the volatility
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.440]   of the returns in general.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.880]   To some degree, stocks and bonds are supposed to be non-correlating assets.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.240]   They're not a perfect non-correlation, but they are supposed to be and generally are
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.120]   somewhat non-correlating.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.280]   When stocks' values rise, in general bond values are not supposed to rise on the same
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.920]   exact trajectory.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.080]   When bond values rise, in general stock values are not supposed to rise on the same trajectory.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.800]   And so you can plot this out on what they call the efficient frontier and the curve
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.320]   of expected returns and expected risk.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.760]   And the way it works is very interesting.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.960]   If you plot a portfolio – and I don't have any numbers in front of me, so we're
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.840]   just going to keep this very big picture and listeners can go and dig into it more.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.680]   But numbers big picture, your highest expected return will come from a portfolio that's
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.960]   100% stocks.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.160]   So if you're just going to go for highest expected return, 100% stock portfolio is the
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.800]   way to go.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.280]   But if you start sprinkling a few bonds and you start plotting the curve, and let's
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.160]   say you come back to a 20% bonds and 80% stock portfolio, you get a little bit lower of
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.520]   an expected return, but you get a much lower variability of returns, much lower risk profile
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.040]   for that portfolio.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:27.760]   So by bringing in a little bit of bonds into the portfolio, you get a much lower risk reduction.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.840]   And that's where – and there's a kind of a sweet spot probably around that 80%
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.560]   stocks number where you've only given up a little return, but you've gotten a lot
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.000]   of stability.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.560]   Now how do you bring that over and apply it to real world?
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.320]   Well if you are trying to run a scientifically managed portfolio and allocation such as we're
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.240]   sitting down and you say, "Joshua, Mr. Financial Planner, you've got a million dollars here.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.160]   I need to make this million dollars last over the course of a retirement of this amount
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.520]   of time.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.440]   Here's my personal risk profile and I can go ahead and I can manage this much risk and
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.240]   I can have this variability of returns," well, then the computer will spit out a model
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.320]   and you're always trying to decrease risk.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.120]   Now that's just a little bit of the academic background to cut straight to your question
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.120]   now.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.880]   If you can prove – and any risk profile questionnaire with any financial advisor,
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.560]   if you cheat the questionnaire by being very aggressive, it's going to spit out for you
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.640]   a portfolio that's basically 100% stocks on the back end.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.880]   That's what's so interesting is that's the primary way that investment allocation
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.120]   is delivered is based upon your personal risk profile.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.760]   It's not that the profiles, the recommended portfolios won't come out as 100% stock.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.920]   It's just that most people can't handle the risk of 100% stocks.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.080]   For me, I look at that and say, "Well, is there a way that I can learn as an investor
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.000]   to be comfortable with a very volatile portfolio?"
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.080]   That's what you've described there.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.320]   If you can be comfortable as an investor with a very volatile portfolio, recognizing that
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.240]   the market value of your shares can wander around tremendously when you have an all-stock
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:15.320]   portfolio, then there's no reason necessarily why you can't go and establish a 100% stock
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.800]   portfolio.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.480]   But most people aren't going to be able to build and maintain that level of comfort.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.760]   I think that the things that you've said can offset it.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.840]   If you establish a large amount of cash and you keep a large amount of cash, if you have
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.160]   a paid-off house, something like that which lowers your need for money, those things can
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.240]   offset it.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.160]   When you're in an accumulation period, I think that's different than if you're in a distribution
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.800]   period.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.520]   To give advice on asset allocation, Matt specifically would go past the bounds of what I can do
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.880]   without getting in trouble with the regulatory authorities here in the United States.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:58.640]   I can just tell you that when I owned publicly traded companies, my allocation was 100% stock
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:06.120]   because I said I can handle the volatility of it by doing good financial planning.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:13.200]   I don't buy the concept that the only way to invest successfully is to approach it from
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.800]   a pension fund perspective, which is the way that most of the research is done.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.240]   How do we make this pension fund produce this outcome?
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.280]   I think it's every bit as acceptable.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.720]   Don't tell me that I'm not in a safe position if I own 10 individual stocks from high-quality
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.920]   companies and I'm living on the dividends.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.000]   Yes, my portfolio is 100% stock, but if I understand what I own, just because the portfolio
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.080]   values wander around doesn't mean that I necessarily have a problem.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.400]   That's just normal investing.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.360]   I wouldn't be scared of doing it if I understood all of the risks.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.360]   The caveat is most people cannot handle what you're talking about, so you've got to be
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.080]   triple sure that you could actually handle it.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.080]   What do you think about that answer, Matt?
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.080]   Do you want to ask a follow-up question?
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.080]   Is that helpful enough?
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.520]   No, I think that's right on point.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.720]   I just was looking for your thoughts on that.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.760]   I've been a stock investor forever.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.760]   I've never sold out on a downturn.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.160]   I think that that has served us well.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:13.320]   I think also just the notion that the only way to control volatility is to reduce the
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.840]   volatility of your portfolio, but sometimes it's easier and more effective to reduce the
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:25.040]   volatility of your monthly outflows and maximize your potential for return in the portfolio.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:30.680]   I guess I just appreciate your professional opinion on that approach.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.680]   I agree with you.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.680]   I do want to make one comment when you were talking about bond values and concern about
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.360]   bond values.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:42.120]   I think and I'm convinced that good financial planning, which is the term I use it, meaning
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:47.520]   controlling the variability of your outflows, setting aside cash in a bank account, training
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.800]   yourself, that's what I call good financial planning.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.800]   I think that's more powerful than just trying to do everything in the portfolio because
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:59.640]   if you were to go to a professional portfolio manager and you're going to say to him, "Hey,
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:06.080]   listen, I'm willing to accept a wide range of variability.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.520]   I'm willing to accept a very high potential on the one side, but also I'm willing to accept
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.880]   some years where we can't pull income off of it."
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:19.280]   If you take the shackles of having to deliver a consistent income on a consistent time off
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:26.360]   of a portfolio manager, their total return, I think, is going to be much bigger over time
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:31.520]   because if they can dry down the outflows a little bit during rough times, they can
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.240]   sit through the difficult times.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.800]   The higher you put, and I can prove this with software.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.560]   If I had financial planning software at my fingertips, the higher you put the must, the
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:48.800]   mandated flows off a portfolio in retirement planning software, then the less risk you
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.440]   can take because you've got to meet that need.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.240]   There's a good financial answer to you.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:01.680]   One thing on bonds though, when interest rates rise, bond values will fall.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.800]   However, it's not a catastrophic fall.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:11.760]   Many people, it's difficult to calculate for yourself the impact of what would a rise of
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.040]   interest rates of say 40 basis points due to my bond portfolio.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.320]   It's difficult for the average layperson to calculate that.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.520]   You can go and calculate that from an expected return perspective.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:29.200]   It does make a difference, but it's not a catastrophic, necessarily a catastrophic impact.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.360]   It's not as though your bond portfolio is going to plummet from a value of $100,000
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:40.320]   to $20,000 overnight just simply because the interest rates increased by a few basis points.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.080]   I don't necessarily accept the narrative also on the other side to say, "Well, interest
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.720]   rates are at an all-time low, so when interest rates rise, the value of my bonds will plummet."
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:52.520]   That's not factually true, and you should do an actual calculation on your portfolio.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.000]   All right, next caller.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.720]   Let's go to Haleshia in Denver, Colorado.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.720]   Welcome to the call.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.720]   Let me know how I can serve you today, please.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:06.840]   I have a question about if a person has a 401(k), is there really that much value in
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:16.480]   also having a Roth IRA, or do you just put all the extra savings into funding the 401(k)?
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.080]   Is there really a difference in having both?
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.480]   Is this scenario that ... First, let's ask financially qualified.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:30.400]   Are you financially qualified to contribute to a Roth IRA, and do you have access to a
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.440]   401(k) at your work?
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.440]   Mm-hmm.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.440]   Okay.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.800]   Second, do you have an employer match on your 401(k)?
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.840]   Yeah, and I've already met that.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.840]   Great.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.840]   Now you've got some additional room in the 401(k), and you're considering, "Should I
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.200]   put more money in the 401(k) or into the Roth?"
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:52.440]   I haven't opened a Roth IRA yet, so I was thinking if I should open one.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.440]   I don't know.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.440]   Okay.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.720]   So, Matt, there's a couple answers.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:02.400]   Mathematically, yes, if you can use these retirement accounts and your goals for your
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.920]   investment are going to fit within the construct of those accounts, you should come out substantially
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.960]   ahead by using those accounts.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.680]   The most important one in the 401(k) is to first take advantage of an employer match,
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:19.040]   and then you can ask the question of, "Should I take the tax deduction now, or should I
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.420]   take the tax deduction in the future?"
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:27.000]   If you can max out both of them, you're going to come out ahead using a maxed out 401(k)
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.720]   and a Roth IRA versus a taxable investment account.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.680]   You're going to come out ahead of both of them.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.840]   So do you have enough money that you could max out both of them?
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:42.080]   So the 401(k) maxed out is like $18,000 a year, right?
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.080]   Right.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.080]   Yeah, no.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.080]   Okay.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.080]   Not.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.640]   So then you're trying to decide...
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.140]   So then your basic question is you're trying to decide, "I want to invest a little bit
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.320]   more money, and should I put it into a 401(k) or into a Roth IRA?"
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.880]   Is that accurate?
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:56.880]   Yes.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.880]   Okay.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.200]   If you invest the money, what type of things would you invest it in?
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.080]   Mainstream mutual funds, or would you want to do something else with it?
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.600]   Probably mainstream mutual funds.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.720]   And if you were going to use the money, when would you use the money, and what would you
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.520]   use it for?
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.500]   Probably retirement, so like 40 years from now.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.080]   Do you expect...
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.680]   What's your household income right now?
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.220]   It's around...
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.740]   I think it'll be like 90 this year.
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.740]   Do you expect your income to increase substantially in the future?
[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:27.740]   Yeah.
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.740]   Okay.
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:34.420]   That complicates my answer.
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.680]   So the accounts are different.
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.900]   One of the great benefits of the Roth, one of the things that I love about the Roth is
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:49.260]   that you can put in the money, and you can take out the contributions without any tax
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.260]   penalties.
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:56.180]   And so I really like that from the perspective of access to money.
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.220]   My fear with many people when they're contributing to a 401(k) is they put all the money in the
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:04.140]   401(k), and there are a couple of wrinkles with 401(k) plans.
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:08.680]   Number one, you need to be sure of the quality of the investments that you have.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:13.400]   Some 401(k) plans offer excellent investments, very low cost, well managed.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:18.980]   Some 401(k) plans don't offer very good investments, very expensive, very poorly managed.
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:23.820]   So if you said, "I have a 401(k) that's very poorly managed," well, then I would tend towards
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.980]   go ahead and do the Roth IRA because you can choose any company out there, you can choose
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:31.320]   a low-cost investment provider, and you'll be better off.
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.820]   So you've got to consider that.
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.500]   Number two is you've got to consider who has control over the money.
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.540]   In a 401(k), you do not have control over the money.
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:46.660]   And this is because the way that a 401(k) plan works is it's technically considered
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.220]   to be a profit-sharing plan.
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:54.380]   It's provided to you out of the goodwill and the good grace of your company and your employer.
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:15:00.460]   It is a profit-sharing plan that has 401(k) provisions on it.
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.260]   Now this is different than the way that most people think of their accounts.
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.020]   Most people think of the 401(k) as my money.
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.260]   I have the right to it.
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.260]   Well, if you think that to be the case, go to your 401(k) provider with the job that
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:14.500]   you're currently at and ask for a $100,000 distribution.
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.720]   You can't get it.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.360]   And the reason you can't get it is because it's not considered to be your money.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:24.660]   It's considered to be a profit-sharing plan that the company is allowing you to make a
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.520]   contribution into.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.540]   So this is a big difference, and it's a big frustration for many people when they look
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:34.900]   at their 401(k) and say, "How do I get my 401(k) out of a plan that has bad investment
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.380]   options and get it into something else?"
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.620]   Well, you can't because it's not your money.
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:39.900]   It's your employer's money.
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:45.500]   Now when you leave employment with that employer, then you can have access to the money.
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.500]   And if you're at the employer, there might be some options where your plan might allow
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.620]   some kind of in-service distribution.
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:55.180]   Your plan might allow you to take a loan against the account.
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:59.460]   There are some options that your plan provider can do, but it is important to recognize that
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.620]   it's not your money.
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:06.220]   So if people are putting all of their baskets in the 401(k) and you don't have other savings,
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.060]   you don't have other investment accounts, I get nervous about that.
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.740]   I'd like you to have access to more money.
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.340]   And that's one of the benefits of the Roth.
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:19.220]   If you put, say, $5,000 this year, $5,000 the next year into the Roth, and then all
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.980]   of a sudden you have a need for money and you need $10,000, you can go ahead and take
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:30.500]   that $10,000 back out of the account and you could take the money back out of the account
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.500]   and use it.
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.380]   So it gives you a little bit more flexibility.
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:40.000]   If you instead put that $5,000 into the 401(k) and you needed money two years from now, well,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.500]   you're going to be putting the money on a credit card or rating some other kind of asset.
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.740]   So you need to consider that within the context of your planning.
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:50.700]   In general, I think at this point and with one of the other callers, I'm actually going
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:55.780]   to go to Rick next, we're going to talk about the question of what comes out ahead.
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:17:02.180]   I'm convinced that I probably think there's more value in using the 401(k) and paying
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:07.960]   the income taxes in the future than going ahead and opt and using Roth IRAs first from
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.960]   a tax perspective.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.980]   Now, this is a hotly debated subject.
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:19.300]   Many people disagree with me and I understand the arguments, but I'm convinced that, number
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:23.980]   one, I don't expect tax rates to change all that much in general because I don't think
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.980]   the population politically is going to accept them.
[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:32.140]   I think that when you look at retirement and you look at taking funds out of a 401(k),
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.860]   it's really tough for you to be at the highest marginal tax bracket that you're going to
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.820]   be at during your working years.
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:45.500]   So I would say my answer to you, Haleshia, would be, number one, if you don't have other
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:51.360]   money available to you, consider prioritizing the Roth for the sake of the flexibility.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:56.060]   If you do have other money to you, consider prioritizing the 401(k) and accumulating the
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.260]   assets there along the way, and you can do some of each.
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.060]   Is that helpful or too confusing?
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.060]   No, that's helpful.
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.420]   Okay, you had a second part of your question.
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.260]   Go ahead with the second part of your question, please.
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.260]   I do.
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:15.100]   So I'm thinking about quitting my job in about 2018 to go do some long-term travel.
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:22.340]   And I was wondering about how I should plan out ahead so that I don't completely come
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.380]   back to the US and then have nothing.
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:29.420]   So I was looking at what that should look like.
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:30.460]   Okay, perfect.
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:37.320]   So given that detail, you should definitely consider doing the 401(k), and then you should
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:42.580]   do what is called a Roth conversion during the time that you're traveling.
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:47.540]   And so what that means is you contribute to the 401(k), and then when your income is low
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:53.140]   because right now you're going to be at your higher marginal tax rate, when your income
[00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:58.660]   is low, convert some of the 401(k) to the Roth, pick up that income on that year's tax
[00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:03.500]   return, pay the tax at the low rate, and then you can go ahead and have the money accumulated
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.500]   in a Roth.
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:10.300]   So with that additional detail, that makes my advice with regard to 401(k) or Roth relatively
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.300]   straightforward.
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.580]   That's what I would do if I were in your shoes.
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:16.900]   Now is your concern running out of money while you're traveling and not having any money
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.300]   to come back home?
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.980]   What's your specific concern?
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:25.540]   No, I'm pretty sure I planned well enough to have money abroad.
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:31.140]   It's just more so I was wondering if there were any things I was overlooking when you
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:37.220]   go through a period of maybe a year without any income as to what to consider other than
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.380]   having cash on hand.
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:44.700]   So you're going to pay for your travel with savings that you've accumulated?
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.700]   Mm-hmm.
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:46.700]   Okay.
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:47.860]   I would just do a couple of things.
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.920]   So doing something like that is an opportunity.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:55.260]   Do you plan to continue in the same career when you get back from your trip?
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.420]   I think so.
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.220]   Doing something like a year traveling can be very, very simple.
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.740]   If you're going to just go and be in the same career when you come back, all you need to
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:09.740]   do is make sure that you have savings to pay for the trip and then make sure that you reserve
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:14.060]   enough money to get established when you get home.
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:18.620]   You don't want to come home to an empty bank account and not have anything to pay first,
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:23.420]   last, and security in a new apartment or not have anything to buy, an improved suit to
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:24.940]   go to your job interview.
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.780]   If you can line up your employment and have something set up in advance, that makes it
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:32.180]   even simpler to transition whether that's with the same company or with a different
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:36.780]   company, then those are good opportunities.
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:42.020]   When you cut your income, it opens up an opportunity for you to use some of the strategies we talk
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:47.700]   about here to use some of the strategies for tax planning.
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.480]   Specifically, the biggest one for you is going to be to do that Roth conversion, but it also
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:55.500]   opens up the opportunity for you if there's any programs or things that you need to have
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.820]   a low income for to take advantage of, do it in that year.
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:06.180]   So if you had kids and you were trying to send your kids to college, well, line up the
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:11.180]   travel in the year that that lower income can be reported on the FAFSA.
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:16.140]   If you need to do anything with income-based applications for any aid or anything like
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:21.080]   that, line that up so that you are doing that in the year that you're reporting the travel
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.180]   where you basically don't have any income.
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:28.340]   So I mean, those are your biggest opportunities.
[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:35.460]   And my recommendation would also be keep some kind of nice record of the trip so that with
[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:41.740]   the job hunt process, it's nice if you can just point somebody towards your blog or your
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.220]   Instagram profile or something where they can kind of see what you've been doing.
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:50.460]   A lot of people have the fear that if they're out of the workforce for a year or two that
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:53.340]   they're going to fall behind.
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:57.320]   And then take advantage of the time that you're gone and don't lose contact with your industry.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.900]   That would be if you want to do something while you're on the road, that would be a
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.260]   good time to make some moves in your industry.
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:07.340]   Set up an industry-focused website, post some articles, things like that.
[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:10.820]   Use that downtime if you want to do any work.
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:14.480]   People don't want to do any work, but use that downtime to really adjust yourself and
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.780]   establish yourself from a career perspective.
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.580]   Those would be just some generalized thoughts.
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.380]   Any of that spark a train?
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.380]   Anyone ask any follow-up questions?
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:25.860]   - No, that was, you gave me a couple of things to think about.
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.380]   - Yeah, it's a real opportunity.
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:32.660]   If you have had any thoughts of changing careers, I don't know if you've already had your trip
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:39.880]   totally planned out, you're a few years out from it, but doing a trip can be a tremendous
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.420]   way to also change careers.
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.860]   If you put a theme around your trip, so for example, you're changing from industry A to
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:52.260]   industry B, and you use, while traveling, you use your travel experiences to investigate
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.620]   the industry B that you want to get into.
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:59.500]   If you want to become a farrier, shooing horses, and you travel all around the world and you
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:05.500]   document farriers, how they shoo horses in every country and in every culture, and you
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:11.300]   use this to establish a presence online, this can catapult you into a new career.
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:15.420]   You can use this time to reeducate yourself and to establish a new presence.
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:19.740]   It's a really great transition that you can participate in.
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:24.500]   Think about how you can use the fun of the travel and integrate it with any other life
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.060]   goals that you have.
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:27.840]   It can be a really great way.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.960]   We don't often get a lot of opportunities to do those long-term projects, and so taking
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.300]   a gap year can be a really cool way to do it.
[00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:39.020]   All right, Rick, I know you said you had a meeting, but I want you to weigh in on this
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:44.660]   question that we're talking about of which account to go with.
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:52.060]   Quick background, Rick, on a show where I talked about Roth IRA versus traditional IRA,
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:58.060]   and I said if anybody wants to do the calculations, I can't do the exact calculations, but I think
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:01.740]   the benefit of the Roth is generally oversold for retirees.
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.940]   Rick went through the work of doing some of those calculations.
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.260]   Fill us in on what you learned, please, Rick.
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:13.580]   Yeah, actually the tax side of it is the challenge is solving for that.
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:20.780]   What I did was want to solve for what the retirement income would be on an after-tax
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.980]   basis at retirement age.
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:27.540]   Some of the assumptions that you gave us was that this is someone that would contribute
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:33.100]   $15,000 a year, 7% a year growth.
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:38.260]   I can't remember if that was your assumption or mine on those contributions.
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:45.540]   And then also with that, I went ahead and added in some assumed Social Security income
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:46.540]   as well.
[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:52.460]   Essentially, the bottom line on this is that at retirement, which we said was going to
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:25:02.100]   be age five, the Roth account produced an after-tax income of $59,893.
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:08.140]   And again, why this is important as an after-tax income, obviously the Roth is already after-tax.
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.220]   However, Social Security is not.
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:17.380]   So doing that total evaluation on the taxation, Social Security taxed totally different than
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:18.620]   other income.
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:26.020]   So they had a total take-home income of $59,893, whereas the person that contributed to the
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:32.820]   deductible IRA or 401(k) had an after-tax income of $60,031.
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.980]   So basically it's a wash.
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:41.900]   What is it, a little actually like $60 difference between the two.
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.340]   So it really didn't matter.
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:52.060]   Another assumption that I made is that this splash deductible scenario was able to save
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:26:01.500]   an additional $3,750 a year because they received tax savings through their traditional splash
[00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.900]   deductible contributions.
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:09.580]   And I did that in order to equalize the net spendable income during the accumulation years.
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:19.420]   In other words, it wouldn't be fair to say, in other words, I tried to smooth out the
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:25.180]   income in both scenarios for those years in order to make it fair.
[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:30.500]   Otherwise, one guy would be living on more money during accumulation than the other guy.
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.500]   Right.
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:36.300]   Yeah, so basically it came out, let me give a little quick more background and then we'll
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:40.860]   talk about what you think is the best move then, Rick.
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.540]   So real quick on a little bit of additional background if people weren't able to follow
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:45.780]   that.
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:51.580]   One thing that's important to recognize and very big picture is that if you pay taxes
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:58.080]   up front at the same tax rate as you pay taxes on the back end, the amount of money that
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.980]   you get to spend is identical.
[00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:10.900]   So if you pay taxes at 15% on a Roth IRA up front and then you pay taxes at 15% on a 401k
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:14.500]   at the back end, the actual amount of spendable money is the same whether you pay them up
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.460]   front or down the road.
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:20.860]   So many people don't realize that and they think that they're getting a better deal by
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.340]   contributing to a Roth IRA.
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.800]   Now there are other factors that need to be counted in, which we're not going to go into
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:31.540]   in detail here, factors such as what Rick said, he said he needed to equalize the spending.
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:37.860]   Well if you don't have to pay taxes up front, you can contribute more to a traditional IRA
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:44.340]   or traditional 401k than you can if you have to pay taxes up front in a Roth scenario.
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:49.180]   So it can be easier to get more money into a 401k because you're not having to pay the
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.660]   taxes up front.
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:54.200]   But if you could pay the taxes up front and get more money into a Roth, then you can come
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.260]   out ahead because you're actually saving more money.
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:59.660]   But it's not because of the tax savings of the Roth, it's because you're saving more
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.660]   money.
[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:06.100]   Now the big picture thing that I look at is when are you having the highest income.
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:10.780]   Recognizing that you're going to be paying taxes and we always calculate tax deductions
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:17.420]   and at the highest marginal rate, I look at it and say it's very simple that most people
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:21.660]   are going to have more income during their working years than during their retirement
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.660]   years.
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:27.300]   It would be an unusual circumstance to be in where you're earning substantially more
[00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.860]   in retirement than you are during your working years.
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:36.860]   So it's probably going to be better to take the deductions during your highest earning
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:43.220]   years which are going to be your working years than in your retirement years which is during
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:44.700]   your non-working years.
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:48.340]   Now there are so many ways that this can be changed.
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.820]   You can't answer it on a general basis.
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:55.300]   But the reason why it's so difficult of a nut financially to calculate is because you
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:59.540]   have to calculate, okay, what are the credits, what are the social security income.
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:03.220]   You have to project all these things out and then figure out which come out.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:07.700]   So that's what Rick did and basically the results of the calculation and I'll link to
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:08.700]   it.
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:15.020]   It's in episode 332 was his comment, radicalpersonalfinance.com/332 if you want to see all the numbers and he came
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.620]   out and said the difference is relatively inconsequential.
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:19.100]   So Rick, I know you're a financial planner.
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:27.300]   Did this surprise you doing the math or was this about what you expected?
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:32.060]   It's pretty much what I expected just because the math, well in some ways it surprised me,
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.660]   in some ways it's what I expected.
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:41.540]   So it's what I expected because I totally agree with your first comment that the Roth
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:48.500]   contribution versus traditional is not a question of increasing your wealth.
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:55.060]   It's just this whole idea of pay the tax on the seed versus the harvest is just kind of
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:30:01.660]   a case that doesn't really accurately portray the situation of what's going on.
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.700]   So I always have viewed it as kind of a wash.
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:09.260]   However, with that said, in retirement there are more nuances, particularly the taxation
[00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:14.380]   of social security and then also RMDs as well.
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:21.420]   And so it's really, as anything in personal finance, a case-by-case situation because
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:25.420]   if you have a traditional account, presumably you're going to have a higher balance and
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.540]   therefore a higher RMD.
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:32.140]   And if you don't want or need that high of a withdrawal rate, then you could be bumping
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:38.420]   your bracket by having that higher RMD and also bumping the taxation of your social security
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.700]   and potentially bumping the cost of your Medicare.
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:49.300]   So all of that is to say that I think there can be a compelling story for Roth in the
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.300]   future.
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:56.180]   However, for most people, I totally agree with you that for most people, go ahead, take
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:03.340]   the tax deduction today and then you have some flexibility in retirement and before
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:08.660]   retirement to do some conversions if it makes sense.
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:14.100]   The only other way I would say go Roth as far as a clear answer is someone says, "Hey,
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.020]   I want to contribute $5,000.
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.020]   I'm going to do it.
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:22.260]   I've got $5,000 tax refund or inheritance or extra money, whatever.
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:23.460]   Should I do Roth or traditional?"
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:27.540]   Well, if they do Roth, obviously it's the equivalent of just adding more money at that
[00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:28.540]   point.
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:35.060]   So in that case, it's more of a behavioral finance rather than a numbers question.
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:39.700]   I think there's a lot of value of having – when you get to retirement, there's a lot of
[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:43.580]   value of having multiple accounts so that you can manipulate a little bit where the
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:47.500]   funds come from and you can manipulate a little bit, "Okay, the Medicare cost, let's see.
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:51.020]   Can we fit it under a bracket and figure out how this goes?"
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:56.700]   The only kind of clear takeaway I would take from this is I don't think – a lot of people
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:01.220]   get – because they mistake that – you phrased it very well.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.740]   Should I tax the seed or tax the harvest?
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:09.180]   That's one of those things that seems intuitively better to tax the seed, but the math demonstrates
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.700]   that it doesn't matter.
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.340]   The tax is the tax.
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:21.260]   So I would discourage people from jumping to the Roth 401(k) for the bulk of their investing.
[00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:23.620]   That's the thing that I see that I'm concerned about.
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:29.460]   Many people now are having the option to participate in a traditional 401(k) or a Roth 401(k),
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:30.940]   and they say, "Well, I know that Roth is better.
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:34.620]   I know I'm going to have less money in the end, so I'm going to go to a Roth 401(k).
[00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.140]   I think that's a bad move."
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:37.500]   But if you can – go ahead.
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:41.980]   Now, I'll push back with you a little bit on that, just to add a little more nuance.
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:46.300]   I have some 401(k) plans that I manage, and some of the employees – actually, a lot
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:51.860]   of them are in non-profit education at the lower income level, basically preschool, day
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:53.580]   school kind of thing.
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:58.580]   And anyways, a lot of them, I counsel, "Hey, go ahead and go for the Roth.
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:03.380]   You're probably paying little, if any, tax right now on your tax bracket.
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:04.380]   Go for the Roth.
[00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:09.880]   And oh, by the way, you're automatically diversifying your taxes because the employer contribution
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.960]   is traditional.
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:16.020]   They never put employer into the Roth, so you'll automatically end up with both accounts
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:17.020]   in that scenario."
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:22.660]   So I think there is sort of a missed opportunity where some people, and quite a few people
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:27.620]   who aren't high-income earners, whether it be just a lower-income area or a second wage
[00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:33.900]   or whatever, second earner, whatever the case may be, they're taking a deduction automatically
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:38.020]   in their traditional 401(k), and they haven't really looked at the tax and seeing, "Oh,
[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:43.340]   wait, I'm a net recipient due to the earned income tax credit and everything else that's
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:50.620]   going on, so therefore I'm basically wasting a tax-free scenario here."
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:52.820]   Yeah, that's a great point.
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.700]   100% agree with you.
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:34:00.260]   If you're at a low tax bracket, if you can look forward and imagine your life and see
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:05.900]   that in the future you reasonably expect to be earning substantially higher, then use
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.820]   the Roth now, especially if you're at those bottom brackets.
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:16.580]   Use the Roth to get the money out of the taxation world and wait on the 401(k) or traditional
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.100]   structure until you're in a higher earning.
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:23.260]   I think just some of the other factors that you've got to look at, I love the flexibility
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:27.700]   of the Roth for what we went over earlier in the call, to take the contributions out
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:28.700]   if you need them.
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:30.420]   I like the ability to choose investments.
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:36.620]   I think ultimately most people are going to wind up having both, and both being the plan,
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.340]   but use some of this data to calculate.
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:41.300]   So Rick, I appreciate you doing those calculations.
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.300]   Thank you very much.
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.300]   My pleasure.
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.300]   Thanks, Joshua.
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:45.300]   For sure.
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:46.300]   I've got two more callers online.
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:47.300]   I've got Sean and Jay.
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:48.300]   Sean, let's go to you.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.300]   Sean in Chicago.
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.300]   What's your question?
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.300]   How can I serve you today?
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.860]   Thank you, Joshua.
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:58.260]   My wife has recently been able to be hired to work for a nonprofit, which she founded
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.260]   and loves dearly.
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:04.420]   Currently, she's the only employee and likely will be for the next few years.
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:08.340]   They're considering setting up benefit plans and are in the process of setting up a retirement
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:10.140]   plan.
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:15.220]   She wants to present a plan that's both as appealing to our circumstances as possible,
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:19.860]   but also to the nonprofit since she'd never sacrificed its good given that she's found
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.380]   it and it's her life's work.
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:29.060]   So currently, we max out 403B, mine's 403B, her simple IRA, backdoor Roth, and have some
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:32.140]   in taxable investments.
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:37.460]   If she were to max out a 403B, we'd still have some for the taxable investments.
[00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:40.860]   That's important to us because we both kind of think we may start our own business in
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:41.860]   the future.
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:48.860]   So my question to you is, are there any considerations for setting up a retirement plan for a small
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:54.700]   business or nonprofit like this that you think people may often overlook when they're concerned
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:36:00.460]   not just about the employee side, but also the employer side, that it's a mutually beneficial
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.460]   setup?
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:08.140]   I don't know if it matters, but we do file our taxes, merit filing, separately since
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:12.540]   she qualifies for public service loan forgiveness given her salary.
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:17.220]   Okay, that does matter, but let's come back to that in a moment.
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:21.460]   Is the nonprofit well capitalized?
[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:23.580]   They're pretty well.
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:31.900]   They're on a good trajectory and in a strong but small position.
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:38.380]   It's an interesting question and I'm not sure that I can remember my details clear enough
[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:42.220]   to answer it as well as I would like.
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:45.540]   I'm making a note of it and if I can dig into it a little bit more, I'll need to check a
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.940]   couple of books.
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:55.820]   So just recognize that it's such a nuanced question that I wish I could give a better
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:56.820]   answer off the top of my head.
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.540]   I'm not that good.
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:04.260]   So the reason I say merit filing separately does matter is because merit filing separately
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:09.620]   hurts you with a couple of, I think is it IRA contributions?
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:10.620]   Or is it?
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:13.180]   Yeah, it's IRA contributions.
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:21.580]   That if you're using an IRA, the limit for a deductible IRA is like, I need a tax table
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:22.580]   at my hands.
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:27.180]   It's like 5,000 bucks, something like that is your income if you're married filing separately.
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:31.100]   It doesn't sound like that's appropriate to you, but there are a couple places where the
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:35.300]   IRS really doesn't like people who are married filing separately, especially when it comes
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:39.500]   to retirement accounts.
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:43.820]   But if you're using the public loan forgiveness program, then that's probably compelling enough
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:51.940]   that I wouldn't necessarily just say you need to change it.
[00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:57.380]   With regard to the reason I asked if they were capitalized, she's expecting more employees
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:00.500]   in the future and things like that.
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:05.700]   So you're probably not going to want to try, you're not trying to structure this in just
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.140]   a way that's just going to benefit her.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:14.300]   You need a plan that's going to be consistent across all of the employees in the future.
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:19.140]   And so that's going to send you in the direction of just some of the normal plans.
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:25.020]   The first thought I had was, and I'm not sure that you can do it, but I need to research
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.020]   it.
[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:29.620]   But the first thought I had was, could you set up a 457 plan?
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:34.420]   I think, I wish I had read my book recently.
[00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:46.100]   If you could set up a 457 plan at a nonprofit, then that could give you some flexibility
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:48.020]   with your other accounts.
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:52.620]   Because you already have the Simple IRA, you already have the 403(b), you have your Roths
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.160]   and you have your taxable.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:39:02.360]   If you could set up a 457 plan, then that would give you some options where you can
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:09.400]   contribute money, have the tax deferred, but not have to pay the tax right now.
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.120]   And it's a little bit of an arcane area.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.740]   I just found an article on it here.
[00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:19.160]   And it's one of those things I'd have to check into and get back to you.
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.920]   So I'll just leave it at that for a moment.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:27.760]   Otherwise, just the normal options would apply.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:32.040]   I can't pull the answer out of my head right at the moment, so we'll leave it at that.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.040]   I apologize.
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:37.000]   I'll make a note and we'll see if I can get back and answer the question for you properly.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.080]   So I'm kind of failing you on this one.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:43.880]   Any follow-up clarification or things that I might be able to help with?
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:48.880]   No, I mean, I think that's it.
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:53.120]   Any thoughts you find or if anything comes along, that'd be great.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.560]   But thanks for mentioning that 457 plan.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:58.080]   We'll look into that a little further.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.080]   Okay.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:05.840]   So just one article here as I was desperately trying to pull through my notes and through
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.840]   the internet.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:11.220]   "Non-governmental plans can be established by qualified 501(c)(3) organizations that
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:17.240]   also offer 403(b) plans, but they can only be offered to highly compensated workers,
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:21.200]   although the exact level of income for qualifying employees is not stated precisely.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:25.400]   However, it must meet some sort of ascertainable standard set by the employer.
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:29.160]   These plans have therefore been given the nickname of 'top hat plans.'"
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:37.040]   So with a 501(c)(3) organization, if the board were to set up a 403(b) and then were to offer
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:42.400]   a 457 plan, if they could jump through the hoops and you need to work with a consultant,
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:47.920]   with a qualified plan consultant on this to get it right, you might be able to set something
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.480]   like that up.
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:56.080]   And yeah, you might be able to set something like that up.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.480]   That's the best idea I've got for you right now.
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.780]   If I can find a couple of these articles that are helpful, I'll also link them in the show
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:03.800]   notes for today's show.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.160]   All right.
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.480]   Next I've got Jay, New York City.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.480]   Jay, go ahead with your question.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:12.480]   I don't know how I can serve you today.
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.480]   Hello?
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.480]   Yep.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.480]   Go ahead.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:16.480]   I can hear you.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.480]   Hey, Josh.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.480]   Oh, great.
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.480]   Hey, Josh.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.480]   First thing, great show.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.480]   I've been listening to you for a long time.
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.720]   Pretty honored to just be able to talk to you now.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:29.480]   So regarding my question, 2008 impacted a lot of people, including myself and my family.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:34.680]   We ended up, story short, I ended up filing Chapter 13.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:38.000]   We're in the process right now that we're actually exiting Chapter 13.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   Great.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.600]   And I would like to be able to kind of move forward in a better path in terms of my financial
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:49.120]   lifestyle or my financial life and how do you see or what suggestions you may have in
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:54.240]   terms of kind of reengaging the financial system now that we've spent so many years
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:59.920]   on our own, living off the dollar that we make and nothing else, which I'm happy to
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:00.920]   continue to do so.
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:03.520]   And we're fine with it and we're pretty stable.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:09.800]   But we do want to be able to in the future recreate or reestablish credit and be able
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.560]   to move forward in different avenues.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:19.600]   So just wanted to get your opinion on how is best to kind of exit this type of situation.
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:23.200]   Describe the circumstances that led to the Chapter 13.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.520]   What was it that put you in the hole so bad?
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.040]   Sure.
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:31.880]   I was, it was 2007, 2008.
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:37.640]   So when the market crashed, I was in the middle of a construction program for my home.
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:40.480]   So my primary home, we were building a second story home.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:45.240]   We had a construction loan, an equity loan on the house.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:51.040]   And I had probably in personal savings of about 50 grand that I was also going to use
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.040]   in the home.
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:56.160]   Unfortunately, because of what was happening with the market after demolition, so I already
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:02.880]   had no roof over us and we were already in the process of construction, the loans that
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:09.440]   had committed for the construction, the HELOC, as well as construction loan, I had two different
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:16.080]   loans, were frozen, which led me to pretty much fund the entire $100,000 to build construction.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:22.800]   A lot of which I trimmed down by doing a lot of the work myself with my family, but also
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:30.080]   fund the entire cost pretty much out of my pocket and through credit cards, which was
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.760]   not what I wanted to do.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:38.440]   Those ended up being frozen too, so my credit just went to crap.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:44.320]   And we were kind of in the spiral of the market, where we ourselves put ourselves in, but unbeknownst
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.560]   to what was going to happen.
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:50.920]   So unfortunately, we had to proceed with the construction, which was already demoed.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:55.760]   Trimmed down a lot, but we still had to proceed and then kind of had to deal with the impact
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.760]   afterwards.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:57.760]   Sure.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:04.600]   So basically, it was one big house deal that went bad, and then all of the associated construction
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:08.520]   costs that got put on credit cards, that was what put you under ultimately?
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:12.160]   Did you have a lot of other credit card debt or a lot of other car payments, a lot of other
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:17.080]   debt outside of the construction debt before that that also hurt you, or was it just construction
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.080]   debt?
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.520]   No, it was pretty much all associated with this.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:28.920]   I was probably utilizing credit cards at 20% or less of availability, but I did have a
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:36.720]   lot of credit cards available to me at the time, because they were coming in pretty easily.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:40.640]   So I had a certain amount of costs that I couldn't put into the credit card, which I
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:41.960]   ended up doing.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:49.480]   And as cards and banks started freezing accounts or cutting accounts, that was kind of just
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:54.160]   turning in and reducing my availability of funding, which kind of destroyed my credit.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:59.120]   And then I tried to re-engage the system and negotiate some things.
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.800]   I couldn't do it.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:05.440]   Suggestions came into trying to do the HAMP program, which kind of just destroyed me even
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:06.440]   more.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.960]   I ended up not doing that and choosing not to do that.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:13.240]   But after that, by the time I decided, I already had months that I was not paying on my home
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:16.840]   because of the suggestions to get in order to get into the HAMP program, I had to not
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.640]   pay my bills, even though I was paying my bills.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:25.300]   So it definitely was a year plus journey that put me in that position.
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:29.680]   But it all started on the fact that I was on the construction when the market crashed
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:34.920]   and all my loans I had for the construction were taken out.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:35.920]   Right, right.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.720]   So a couple of thoughts for you.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:44.040]   First, I would recommend that you, if you haven't done it already, I'm sure you've learned
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:45.040]   a lot of lessons.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:48.560]   I would recommend that you sit down and write some of them down.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:53.200]   Just kind of make a list of the things that you've learned from this nightmare.
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:59.400]   Because we all go through difficult circumstances and the biggest waste is to go through a disaster
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.880]   and not learn anything from it.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:04.240]   If you go through a disaster and you learn something from it, then at least you could
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:05.520]   gain some value out of it.
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:12.600]   If you don't learn anything from it, then it can have some major problems.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.600]   And I appreciate it.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:18.920]   I heard in your statement, I heard you correct yourself and take responsibility for the things
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:21.480]   that you could take responsibility for.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:25.480]   And you corrected a couple of times when you were talking, you corrected and used responsible
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:26.480]   language.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.480]   I chose this.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.480]   I made these choices.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:32.520]   To me, I commend you for that because that's a very important starting point.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:37.280]   A lot of people say, "Well, the market crashed and I couldn't do anything about it."
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:43.720]   Well, no, you can't do anything about a market crash, but you can foresee and consider that
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:44.720]   things might happen.
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:50.600]   Now, if you were considering, say, a 30 or 40% decrease in value or decrease of credit
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:56.240]   lines or things like that and they cut it by 75%, sure, that's a little harder to perceive.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:00.320]   But you're a little wiser now and you can plan and count on those things.
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:05.240]   And I think it's an instructive story for all of us who are listening to it that sometimes
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:08.840]   things that seem so great, "I've got these lines of credit, everything's going to be
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:11.880]   good to go," sometimes things change.
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:16.660]   And that's where you need to understand the terms of your agreements.
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:19.520]   You need to read the terms of your loan agreements.
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:23.280]   If you're going to take out a construction loan, a home equity loan, etc., do they have
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.400]   the right to reduce those things?
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:26.520]   Many people had this happen.
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:32.520]   Many people had their lines of credit decreased and they didn't realize that that was possible.
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:37.920]   So I commend you for that and I encourage you to just learn from it.
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:41.320]   So you're already doing that, but just for the sake of the audience.
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.440]   At this point in time, do you live in the house?
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:45.440]   Do you love it?
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.440]   Have you sold it and moved on?
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:48.560]   What are you doing with the house?
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:51.920]   It's still ours.
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:52.920]   We love the neighborhood.
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:53.920]   We love the town.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:59.320]   And the house is exactly what we need in terms of what we ended up doing with it.
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:00.840]   I ended up part of the situation.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:05.680]   I ended up needing to house the two-family home, but I ended up also needing to house
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:09.000]   my in-laws full-time at my expense.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.320]   So that's kind of also hampered my ability to move forward with some of the financial
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:17.360]   constraints due to financial constraints.
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:20.880]   But yeah, we're happy with our current situation.
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:24.960]   I wouldn't change anything because you learn more from your hardships than you do from
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:27.040]   your wins many times.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.560]   And we have a happy family.
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:30.560]   We're doing well.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:31.560]   We are...
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:35.640]   I could potentially, part of my progress moving forward, I could potentially...
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:40.720]   I'm probably still owed about $350 plus on the home.
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:45.400]   It's pretty high rent or cost of living in this area.
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:50.280]   But I could potentially put a plan together that I see myself within 10 years paying that
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.960]   off completely.
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:58.080]   So we are financially stable now and in a better position where it's more about what
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:59.080]   do we tackle.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:04.520]   Now, I never wanted to get into some type of bankruptcy, but now that I'm out of it,
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:10.280]   I'm glad that I was able to keep my home, keep the roof over my head to my family and
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:16.440]   my in-laws and still be able to kind of figure out ways to feed us.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:17.440]   We're doing fine now.
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:19.320]   It's just how do we move forward?
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:24.440]   And I should financially be able within 10 years to pay off the entire house if I move
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.640]   forward that way or look at other ways.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:32.720]   But I just kind of just want to pick your brain as well, how would you envision best
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:36.320]   way to kind of emerge out of this type of situation.
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.880]   So two lines of thought that we should go down.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:41.240]   One is how to move forward and build wealth.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:44.480]   And the second is how to improve your credit.
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:50.520]   Those are two separate things because your credit is not necessarily indicative of your
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:51.660]   wealth.
[00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:53.920]   They don't necessarily correspond.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:58.000]   So between the two, if you have to choose between building wealth and having a great
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.360]   credit score, obviously you're going to choose building wealth.
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.240]   That's what actually matters.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:05.600]   But the credit score is important.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:08.780]   It's going to make a difference in your life, a dramatic difference.
[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:13.400]   It's going to make a difference in the terms at which you have many things from your car
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:16.120]   insurance to some of your banking opportunities.
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.120]   It will make a difference.
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:19.480]   So you do want to deal with the credit score.
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:21.680]   So first, building wealth.
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:26.200]   The great thing is in Chapter 13 when you come out of it on the back end here, you will
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.280]   have paid and satisfied your debts.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:32.160]   You'll have satisfied all your creditors and you'll be coming out with basically a clean
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.400]   slate.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:36.800]   You don't have anything else that you owe and you're coming out with a clean slate.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:40.800]   You're coming out with years of building some new habits of living just on the income and
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.920]   making that big Harry Chapter 13 payment.
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:48.160]   And so when that thing is gone, you're going to feel like you're rolling in money.
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.920]   The difference of building wealth is no different than it was before.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:54.240]   It's a matter of saying there's no difference for somebody who's coming out of bankruptcy
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.440]   than it is for someone who's not coming out of bankruptcy.
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:58.000]   I need to save money.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.440]   I need to establish my financial goals, figure out what's the clear path towards those goals.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:07.020]   So how does paying off this house help me get those goals?
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:08.320]   Can we pay it off in 10 years?
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:11.160]   What are the numbers going to be to get there?
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:15.160]   What's going to be the primary financial engine of our plan?
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:16.160]   How's my income doing?
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:20.320]   Do I need to, now that I'm getting rid of this big Harry payment, do I need to invest
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:22.240]   in something that's going to help me earn more money?
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:24.640]   Is there something that's associated with your business?
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:28.520]   So you start to build an investment plan and you build a financial plan that's going to
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:32.440]   have your income coming in, keep your expenses under control.
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:35.560]   You're going to have those debts cleared and then you're going to focus on what's the investment
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:39.520]   plan and you're going to start working towards that investment plan.
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:45.760]   And so all of the investment plans, any investment plan is open to you coming out of Chapter
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:48.260]   13 as is open to anybody else.
[00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:54.180]   So if you are going to invest using stocks within a 401(k) at your job, that doesn't
[00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:56.320]   matter whether you've come in or out of bankruptcy.
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:59.680]   If you're going to invest in real estate, you can do that whether or not you've been
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:00.680]   out of bankruptcy.
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:07.240]   I have a couple of guys here locally who 2007, 2008 put them into bankruptcy and they just
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:11.160]   kept right on going right through it and worked their way through and came out the other end
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:13.840]   millionaires.
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:15.680]   And they never gave up their real estate plans.
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:18.520]   Being in business isn't going to be affected by bankruptcy.
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:23.320]   So your wealth plan is not affected by your bankruptcy.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:26.160]   When you have this thing paid off, you'll have satisfied all your creditors, you've
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:30.080]   done the honorable thing, you've paid your debts and you'll be starting with a clear
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.080]   slate.
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:36.080]   So your wealth plan is everything is not connected to the bankruptcy.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:40.920]   You're just simply working your way through exactly like we talk about every other day,
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:47.560]   increasing your income, decreasing your expenses, investing wisely, avoiding catastrophe, optimizing
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:49.040]   your lifestyle.
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:53.120]   Now given what you've learned, the only thing that's going to be impacted on your wealth
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:57.800]   plan by your bankruptcy is that some lines of credit that other people might count on
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.600]   are not available to you.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:06.680]   So you can't have a small emergency fund and a credit card as your emergency plan.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.800]   You've got to have a big emergency fund.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:12.840]   You can't plan on a home equity line of credit being your backup.
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.280]   You've got to have a bunch of savings.
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:18.240]   And so you've got to be more conservative than other people, recognizing that you can't
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:22.980]   necessarily rely on the things that other people rely on for some of their plans.
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:23.980]   But that's okay.
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:25.640]   You've learned a lesson.
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:29.640]   And just because it takes you a little bit longer and you've got to save $50,000 instead
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.600]   of $15,000, that's okay.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:34.760]   You'll feel better with the $50,000 in the bank.
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:39.480]   Now with regard to the credit score, that process is relatively simple.
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:44.080]   Go and get a good book from the bookstore on building a credit score.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.800]   And there are a couple of things that are associated with it.
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:49.760]   Number one, the biggest thing that's going to drive your credit score is paying your
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:52.680]   bills on time and paying the debts on time.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:57.520]   So after this is discharged, yes, the bankruptcy is there, but you'll still be able to work
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:02.000]   your way through and pay your bills on time and that will start to build a stronger credit
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   history.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.480]   And then that bankruptcy will fall off.
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:06.600]   Was it 10 years for bankruptcy to fall off the credit report?
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:07.600]   Is that right?
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.680]   I believe that's what I was told.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:12.040]   Yeah, that's what I think it is.
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:18.980]   So you don't have to wait 10 years to have access to credit after a bankruptcy.
[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:23.440]   But you're not going to have access to credit immediately after bankruptcy.
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:27.860]   Do you foresee at this point in time that you need credit for something in your financial
[00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:30.060]   life in the coming years?
[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:34.380]   Not directly.
[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:39.120]   I'm building my emergency fund, so that's fine.
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:45.300]   My kids will be heading off to college starting in two years.
[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:47.020]   So that's probably going to be more of a constraint.
[00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:49.220]   But they already know that they have skin in the game.
[00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:52.300]   I'm going to provide for half and they got to provide for the other.
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:56.620]   And I have avenues to provide for my part, so I don't think that's going to be too
[00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:59.700]   insane for me, for us personally.
[00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:03.380]   So I mean, everything else we've been for six years, we've been off our own dollar.
[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:05.380]   We're fine with that.
[00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:10.220]   We'll probably need a car here and there to replace the existing old cars that we've
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:12.220]   been running down for a while.
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:13.220]   Sure.
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:16.060]   But I could probably fund those directly.
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:17.060]   Yeah.
[00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:22.380]   I don't see really any use for credit except for houses.
[00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:24.220]   Houses and maybe businesses.
[00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:27.460]   Other than that, I don't see the point of borrowing money.
[00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:31.860]   So the credit score game is just simply a game because so many things are based upon
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:32.860]   the credit score.
[00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:35.780]   It's useful to build a high credit score.
[00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:39.300]   And if you have a high credit score, it can be useful for some of the games, the travel
[00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:42.760]   hacking and the mileage games and all that, to travel for free.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:43.760]   You can do that.
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:46.240]   I've seen people that do that very successfully.
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:50.480]   But in terms of building wealth, the only time that you need credit is basically for
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:55.340]   mortgages and possibly for businesses.
[00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:59.480]   I don't think there's any reason to ever borrow on anything except one of those things that's
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:01.080]   going to go up in value.
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:06.640]   So the path to improving the credit score is pay the mortgage payment after you come
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:09.660]   out of the Chapter 13 and you'll have paid the Chapter 13 payments.
[00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:15.020]   Pay the mortgage payment on time and make sure that that's set up and it's always paid
[00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:16.020]   on time.
[00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:23.180]   Next, you'll go and establish a secured credit card with a local bank, credit union, et cetera.
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:26.460]   Secured credit card is where you give them $1,000 and they give you a credit card with
[00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:29.980]   a $1,000 limit and it's backed by the money in the account.
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:34.540]   You take that, use that for just your normal expenses, paying it on time, consistently
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:42.180]   over time and you work your way forward with that for a while.
[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:47.980]   Then after a while, you go ahead and you apply for another credit card and you pay that one
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:49.220]   on time.
[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:53.420]   You can borrow money for a car but really I don't see the point of it.
[00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:59.860]   If you want to get a small car loan to establish another car loan and a credit history, you
[00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:00.860]   can do that.
[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:08.700]   But I don't see the point of it because when you borrow on things that go down in value,
[00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:12.360]   that's a recipe for poverty and you don't want to do that.
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:15.860]   So yes, getting a secured credit card to start to have just that plus your mortgage, that
[00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:18.580]   should be enough with a history of payments.
[00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:22.700]   When you're getting the credit cards, the keys to the score is one of the four parts,
[00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:27.940]   the utilization of credit, your payment history, the type and nature of accounts that are open
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:29.620]   to you, et cetera.
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:31.020]   I would do is I would keep it simple.
[00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:35.860]   I would just simply pay cash for everything except the mortgage, pay the mortgage consistently
[00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:42.220]   over time and I would get one secured credit card and then after I've had the secured credit
[00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:44.540]   card for a while, I'd probably get one or two more.
[00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:48.060]   Keep the balances on them, pay it off, pay them on time every time.
[00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:53.460]   You need to use them and so from time to time, you should carry a balance through to the
[00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:55.860]   end of the statement date.
[00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:59.700]   You need to have that there as demonstrated that these are being used.
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:01.140]   Don't just pay them immediately.
[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:07.500]   Let them go through to their statement date and that over time will raise the credit score,
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:09.820]   just that consistent period of payment.
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:13.740]   From talking with people who come out of bankruptcy, if you needed to borrow money and buy a house
[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:19.820]   a few years after bankruptcy, you could do that again if you needed to switch.
[00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:21.580]   So all those options are there for you.
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:26.020]   The big thing is to pay a little bit of attention to the credit score, get a book, do that,
[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:30.340]   but focus primarily on the wealth plan and recognize that it's not connected to your
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.340]   credit score.
[00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:32.340]   It's a separate deal.
[00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:33.340]   That's great.
[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:34.340]   Thank you.
[00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:35.340]   You're welcome.
[00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:40.860]   I'm glad you're coming out of it, man, and I'm glad you've learned some lessons.
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:46.180]   Analyze what puts you there and then resolve in the future, as I'm sure you have.
[00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:50.620]   I tell you, I have made some huge business decisions, business mistakes in the past that
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:54.740]   have cost me a lot of money, and I am very sensitive to making those mistakes again.
[00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:58.100]   So it's a good teacher to learn the hard way.
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:58:59.420]   Yes, sir.
[00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:00.420]   All right.
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:01.420]   I think that's it for callers.
[00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:05.540]   I've got one more email here that I'm going to take before we wrap up, and this was from
[00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:06.540]   Megan.
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:09.540]   She wrote me this and said to Joshua, "I was going to call in on the Q&A today, but I'll
[00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:12.940]   be at work, so hopefully this reaches you in time because I can't call in.
[00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:16.860]   I'm in my last year of grad school and I saved up just about enough money to pay for it out
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:21.540]   of pocket and still have a four to six month emergency fund left over.
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:23.580]   But beyond that, it will wipe me out.
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:29.180]   I was approved for loans covering over 100% of my tuition cost based on need, and I already
[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:32.180]   have about $35,000 in student loan debt.
[00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:37.720]   My question, should I use the loans for school and increase my debt so I can open an investment
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:41.780]   account with the money I have saved up so I have it as capital for a future business
[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:43.220]   or real estate endeavor?
[00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:46.780]   I'm employed full time, but I plan to start a side business.
[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:51.180]   When I finish my degree next year as an integral part of my plan for financial independence.
[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:54.260]   I'm typically very debt averse.
[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:56.500]   I live mortgage and car payment free.
[00:59:56.500 --> 01:00:00.980]   I pay off my credit card every month, and I've only accrued $30,000 in loans in a degree
[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:05.280]   program where many of my peers came out six figures underwater.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:09.540]   So my initial plan was to use my savings and not increase my loans at all.
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:13.580]   Since listening to your show and further research of my own about financial independence and
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:17.980]   how debt leverage can be a powerful tool when used properly, I started to wonder if taking
[01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:22.420]   the loans so my capital could be put to use doing something else is a better option.
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:27.660]   My conclusion so far is that if I can earn equal to or more than my interest rate, I
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:29.020]   should take the loans.
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:35.500]   My current loans range from 3% to 7% interest, so I'm planning on the high end of a 7% interest
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:36.500]   rate.
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:39.940]   I don't have time to actively manage an investment account right now.
[01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:44.140]   So if I go this route, I plan to open a Vanguard account and invest in the Total Stock Market
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:50.500]   Index Fund (I'm also a Jim Collins fan) which tracks that market at approximately 8% to
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:54.500]   12% average returns depending on the economy and just leave the money there until I need
[01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.380]   to invest in a business.
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:01:01.240]   At the low end of 8%, I'm still coming out slightly ahead of my loan interest accrual,
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.660]   so it seems like a good deal.
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:06.180]   I am aware, of course, that that is not a guaranteed return and the market could tank
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:10.380]   the day after I invest and lose everything, but since that money is not a part of my everyday
[01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:14.580]   survival, I could afford to lose a portion or all of it and ride out the stock market
[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:15.980]   ups and downs as necessary.
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:19.180]   I'm curious about your opinion on this as well as if there are other factors I should
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:24.780]   consider apart from the interest rate vs. investment return disparity and legalities.
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:28.300]   Legalities as in you cannot use student loans to fund endeavors beside school so the loans
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:31.620]   will only go to school expenses.
[01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:34.340]   Even though I was approved for more than I need, I will only take what I calculated my
[01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:38.700]   school expenses to be this year and use those funds appropriately.
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:45.660]   So Megan, two aspects to the answer.
[01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:47.140]   I see two questions here.
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:53.620]   The first question is should I take out student loans and keep this extra money aside for
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:02:01.280]   a capital as investment capital or should and then the second question is if I'm going
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:11.300]   to keep the money aside as capital, should I invest the money in stocks or not?
[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:12.860]   So there's two questions.
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:15.300]   Let's handle them separately.
[01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:21.020]   First you have enough money to pay out of pocket for that schooling and still have a
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:25.980]   four to six month emergency fund left over but beyond that it'll wipe me out.
[01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:34.540]   In general, how to answer this, in general I think minimizing student loans is the right
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:35.880]   idea.
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:40.480]   Minimizing student loans is the optimal path.
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:46.600]   I can't stand student loans and minimizing them I think is fantastic.
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:53.740]   Being completely debt free is ideal, is fantastic and I think that forcing yourself to pay the
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:59.800]   money and avoid those student loans has a lot of benefit to it.
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:03.040]   It'll make you feel proud of having the loans gone.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:06.060]   It'll have a tremendous amount of benefit.
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:08.560]   So in general I love that plan.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:14.040]   I especially love it when it forces you to adjust expenses.
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:19.360]   When I was in college, my first year of school I didn't borrow any money on student loans.
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.800]   I did four years of college.
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:23.280]   My first year I didn't borrow any money on student loans.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:28.600]   I worked three jobs concurrently and I worked hard and I was able to come out the other
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:31.420]   side without any student loans.
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:35.720]   My second year of college I decided I had been working too hard and during that year
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:40.680]   that I was working too hard I decided to stop working at a job for income and I decided
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.840]   to start using student loans.
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:47.360]   So I used student loans to pay for my expenses and for my living expenses.
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:52.220]   So my class expenses and for my living expenses and I started accruing student loans.
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:57.200]   During that process, my second year I learned less and I got worse grades than I had my
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.200]   first year.
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:02.280]   My third year was a little bit unique because I studied abroad the first semester then I
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:05.920]   came back, dropped out of school and I went back in the summer.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.600]   So set that aside for a moment.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:11.520]   My senior year was when I decided to get out of debt and I wanted to get out of debt before
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:12.760]   I graduated.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:18.080]   So I set my entire focus on paying off the student loans just as quickly as I could.
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:22.200]   During that process, I worked like crazy.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:28.400]   I took 18 hours of class, worked 40 hours a week and it was the hardest year of my life.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:33.480]   But the amazing thing was I came out the end and I had the student loans paid off completely
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:36.160]   and I had gotten straight A's.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:42.560]   I got better grades that year that I was working 40 hours a week, taking 19 hours of class
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:43.560]   and saving like crazy.
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:48.240]   I got better grades and not only did I get better grades, but I learned more because
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.920]   I was intense about it, because I was focused.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:57.720]   I was putting in much more effort into my studies and I was putting in much more effort
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:01.920]   into being prepared for class and all of a sudden, the same teachers who a few years
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:06.600]   previously I had been quite negative about saying, "I don't know what they're talking
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:07.600]   about."
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.560]   All of a sudden, the same teachers became much more knowledgeable.
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:12.400]   It wasn't that they changed, it was that I changed.
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:19.680]   So I learned that when you put the screws to yourself with a clear, focused goal, you
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:22.200]   can make some great stuff happen.
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:29.760]   I regret that decision I had made that second year where by starting to borrow money on
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:34.180]   student loans, I became lazy, I didn't work, I didn't do well in school, I didn't work
[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:36.000]   very hard and I suffered for it.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.920]   I started to spend more money.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:43.320]   When you have a clear goal of, "Hey, I'm getting out of grad school," and you're paying out
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:47.100]   of cash, cash out of pocket, you're going to spend less money.
[01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:51.460]   When you're paying cash for things, you have less of an incentive to spend money and that's
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:55.860]   one of the reasons why you want to avoid debt like crazy, because when you're using debt,
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:59.340]   it's so easy to just go ahead and buy the thing.
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:02.280]   It's so easy to say, "Well, this is my last year of grad school, so I'm going to go ahead
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:05.880]   and spend all this extra money on A, B, C, D."
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.560]   It doesn't matter what it is.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:12.480]   So that'd be one of my big concerns, that if you don't pay cash, you'll wind up spending
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:13.480]   more money.
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:18.200]   Now, is it possible that you're a robot and these emotions don't affect you and that you
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.400]   can just spend exactly the same amount?
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.720]   I guess it's possible.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:25.600]   I mean, I don't think you're a robot, but perhaps you have that financial outlook.
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.640]   I think there are people that can do that.
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:34.000]   I would tend towards saying, "Pay cash for that year of school."
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.400]   Now what's the argument on the other side?
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:43.400]   If you have a clear goal for that future business and real estate endeavor and you want to have
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:52.240]   that capital, and if that were going to start right after grad school, then I couldn't argue
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.200]   that you would need to have that capital available to you.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:58.800]   If you were in grad school and coming out the backside, you had to say, "I have this
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:06:59.800]   business.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:05.400]   I need $15,000 of startup capital available for that," and by keeping this money aside,
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:09.880]   you're going to have that available to you and that's a clear plan, not just a vague,
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:13.840]   fuzzy wish, but that's a clear plan.
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:15.880]   Given that wrinkle, I think I would do what you're saying.
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:19.400]   I would take the money on the student loans and I would keep the capital aside, but you've
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:26.480]   got to figure out a way to cover yourself, to keep yourself focused on not spending the
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:28.880]   money and not wasting it.
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:33.960]   Given if you had a clear goal and a clear action plan, clear business, clear real estate,
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:38.200]   etc., I would do that because I think that if you were to invest the money in something
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:43.800]   like that and if it were to work, you could come out substantially ahead.
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:44.960]   Think of it like this.
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:50.600]   You mentioned real estate here, so let's say you could perform one successful real estate
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:55.600]   transaction that had a very high profit or a decent profit out of it.
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:08:01.500]   It's possible that by having the capital to put down on the property, bring it in, fix
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:06.200]   it up, flip it, and secure profit, you could with a deal or a couple of deals, you could
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:10.120]   make enough money to pay off these student loans completely.
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:16.440]   Capital is so valuable that if you've accrued it and you have a clear plan, I would probably
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:17.440]   do that.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:21.720]   I would probably keep it aside, but only you know how clear that goal is.
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:24.000]   Now, you're almost done with grad school.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.320]   What I question, and this is where it's hard to answer from an email, I wanted to get to
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:30.480]   it because you said you were going to call in, but my question is, why are you going
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:35.400]   to grad school if you're trying to pursue this business or real estate?
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:38.680]   Grad school is usually related to a job.
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:42.720]   If you're planning to go into a job and out of grad school you're going to keep working
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:46.600]   this job and let's say you're hoping to make more and it's going to be a few years.
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:50.480]   Well, if it's going to be a few years and you're going to be working the job and this
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:53.920]   business or real estate idea is not clear, it's not something you're going to be focusing
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:09:00.120]   on, then I would say pay off the debt and make it a focus of first clearing the debt
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:05.000]   so you can build from that simple perspective.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.120]   Hope that's a useful answer to question one.
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:10.520]   It's hard for me to know which one of those is correct.
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.200]   So there's both sides and you'll have to choose.
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:13.800]   Your money, you're responsible for it.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:16.480]   Now, question two, would I invest the money?
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:20.120]   Let's say I chose, if I were in your shoes and I chose to have the money and I were going
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:24.040]   to take out student loans to cover my tuition for that final year and we're going to keep
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:28.120]   that money in cash, would I put the money into stocks?
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.120]   Absolutely not.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.720]   I would not do that.
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.080]   I would not do that for a couple of reasons.
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:38.160]   Number one, if you're saying I'm going to put the money in stocks until someday I might
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:44.160]   do something with it, then that would prove that my answer to question one is that you
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.840]   should just simply pay the money down in student loans.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:48.280]   You don't have a clear plan.
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:51.920]   You don't have a clear goal that I'm going to open six months from when I graduate, I'm
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:55.280]   going to open this retail store for this product that's very needed.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.800]   You're just kind of generally starting to think about that.
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:01.480]   Well, in that case, paying off debt is the right solution because paying off debt will
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:05.320]   free you up, it'll minimize risk, and it'll save you money on these interest rates.
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.400]   That's the first reason.
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:13.240]   The second reason, student loan interest rate at 7% and stock returns at 8% average returns
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:15.720]   are not the same thing at all.
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:21.120]   If you adjust for the volatility of the stock market and you adjust for the risk factor,
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.160]   there's a substantial difference there.
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:27.200]   I would not borrow money at 7% to invest it for 8%.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:30.680]   Now, I know that you were saying 3% to 7%, 8% to 12%.
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:34.640]   I wouldn't borrow money at 3% to invest at 10%.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:39.720]   When you adjust for the risk of the volatility of returns of a stock portfolio and you adjust
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:44.880]   for the risk of the student loans, which is a consistent interest, those numbers are far
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:46.920]   closer than it might appear.
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:52.540]   I haven't done the mathematical formula, but those numbers are closer, and especially the
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:57.240]   risk in your own life because what happens is you're not counting on things happening
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:01.640]   in your own life, and those student loan payments are going to be there every single month.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:06.280]   Now, you're not planning to spend the money in the stocks, but in that situation, I would
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:11.880]   still keep the capital aside, and I would just keep it in cash, in a savings account,
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.280]   in a CD, something short term.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:18.960]   The other big thing to recognize is that when you're in this short range, you didn't give
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.420]   me a time of range.
[01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:24.620]   If you said, "I have student loans that are 20% 20 years long, and I've got this investment
[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:27.760]   account over here, and I'm not going to touch it for maybe 30 years," well, now we're out
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:32.320]   to a time range that maybe we could start to figure out.
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:37.520]   But I'm seeing in your question here just a range of a few years, and the standard rule
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:41.760]   with stock investing is when you get under five years of time horizon, you want to make
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:45.360]   sure that you're adjusting your asset allocation and selling your investments.
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:49.000]   If I've got a financial goal that I'm going to be using to fund with stocks, and it's
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:55.960]   coming up in about five years, I'm going to be looking very closely at my portfolio and
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:12:04.440]   probably starting to transition out of stocks into cash, if not completely, partially, during
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:11.160]   times that the market is high, during opportune times, because you've got to be prepared in
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:16.880]   stocks that in any random year, your portfolio debt will be down 14%.
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:20.940]   One out of three years, your portfolio will be down by a third, and it's very possible
[01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:26.120]   and likely that a couple or a few times in your investment lifespan, your portfolio will
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:28.580]   be down by 50%.
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:33.360]   So you've got to hedge that when you've got a clear need for the money, then you've got
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:34.480]   to hedge that.
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:39.040]   So when I put these two answers together, my answer to you is given the fact that the
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:44.440]   second part of your discussion shows that you don't have a clear, specific goal, because
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.600]   if you did, you wouldn't be putting it into stocks.
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.920]   You'd just be keeping it in cash and saying, "I'm going to open this store six months from
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:53.560]   when I graduate," or "I'm going to do this real estate deal over here, and I've already
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:56.420]   found the property, and I'm just waiting to make it happen."
[01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:59.160]   Because you're thinking about, "Oh, I'll just put the money in the stock market and it'll
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:04.960]   return," then my answer is a very clear, "Pay off the student loans, pay cash for your senior
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:09.960]   year of college, and make it a goal that one year out of college, you've got the rest of
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:11.140]   them gone.
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:15.720]   Then save up the money and put it into something else."
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:16.720]   Hope that's useful.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:17.720]   Hope that's helpful.
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:21.200]   It's always hard to ask these questions or answer these questions, but hopefully that
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:25.180]   at least gives you a couple of ways to think about it.
[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:27.920]   Thank you to all of the callers who called in for today's show.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:30.440]   Thank you to Megan for writing in your question.
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.880]   I don't intend to take written questions on these shows.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:37.080]   I just wanted to do it for her today, because she emailed me at 12.03 PM, right before the
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.080]   call started.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.020]   So thank you for the questions.
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:43.760]   If you would like me to answer your questions on a show like this, I would love to do that.
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:44.760]   I do my best.
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:48.960]   Some of them, like the one on the retirement plan for a non-profit, I'm not good enough
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:53.760]   to pull that stuff off the top of my head, but I do my best.
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.520]   I'll at least try to point you in the right direction.
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:00.380]   To do that, become a patron of the show at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:01.800]   Thank you to those of you who do that.
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.680]   I really, really appreciate it.
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:04.680]   I love talking to you.
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:05.680]   I love these phone calls.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:07.040]   I really enjoy them.
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:10.000]   So join and ask a question there.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:16.280]   If you have additional resources or thoughts for this show, for the listeners, or you have
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:20.560]   an answer to a question, please come by the blog at radicalpersonalfinance.com and answer
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:23.080]   that question on the blog post for today's episode.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:27.640]   In the past, the blog posts were being delayed from the website by a few days.
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:32.120]   I did that for a few reasons, because it really helped me with my production workflow.
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:35.080]   But at this point in time, we've tried to speed that up, because one of the things that
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:39.040]   was happening was when it would show up in your RSS feed on your phone, but then it wouldn't
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:42.920]   show up on the blog until a few days later, there wasn't a good place for comments.
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:48.320]   So I was getting all these emails from you guys saying, "Hey, we've got this comment
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:49.320]   and it's coming in via email."
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.320]   Well, I don't need it by email.
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.840]   I need it on the blog page.
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:52.840]   So we fixed that.
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:57.760]   So now when the shows go out, they go up on the website basically a couple hours later,
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.760]   very, very quickly.
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:03.040]   You'll always get the fastest delivery of the show by subscribing, subscribing in iTunes
