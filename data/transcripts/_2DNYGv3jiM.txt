[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   The Weights & Biases platform has evolved into so much more than just experiment tracking.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.560]   And using all of our tools together makes the ML workflow even more seamless.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.440]   What's nice about Weights & Biases is no matter what your workflow, we integrate with all of the popular
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.640]   cloud providers, hardware vendors, and ML frameworks and libraries.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.120]   As ML projects grow beyond just a few people, that's where the true power of Weights & Biases can be felt.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:34.320]   Weights & Biases helps teams improve collaboration and productivity by being the central system of record across an organization.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.080]   Okay, so let me show you some of the other things that you can do at Weights & Biases beyond just experiment tracking.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:48.160]   Once you've started tracking your experiments in a centralized location, the next step is often to optimize model performance.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.320]   And we have a tool called Sweeps that does just that.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.200]   It provides lightweight automated hyperparameter optimization in a fully scalable and customizable way.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:07.080]   As you can see from this parallel coordinates chart, you can quickly draw insights into what parameter combinations are leading to the best models.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.200]   And if I drill down into any of these hyperparameters even further, you'll see that the data changes to reflect that.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.680]   The platform also allows you to easily visualize your data in various charts and tables here too.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.160]   Here you'll see a Weights & Biases table.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:32.440]   This interactive data visualization tool allows teams to easily visualize, analyze and debug models collaboratively.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:40.320]   With tables, you can combine rich media like images, video and audio alongside performance metrics for analysis.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.280]   It's really easy to manipulate a Weights & Biases table and derive some valuable insights.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.920]   In this case, I'm using the table to create a new plot.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.640]   To explore my model predictions, debug issues and simply understand how my data sets, models and outputs are related.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:07.760]   I can explore tables by dynamically filtering, grouping by classes or creating new columns to tell me when my model predictions were incorrect.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:18.920]   To sum it up, Weights & Biases makes tracking, visualizing and sharing your work easy because we offer tools like experiment tracking, sweeps and tables all in one unified platform.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.720]   If you need to capture the data you're using and producing during experimentation, our next tool Artifacts can help.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.440]   Artifacts tracks your data lineage throughout a project's lifecycle.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.880]   It allows you to version, organize and compare data and model assets over time.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.920]   Built on top of Artifacts is Weights & Biases and Models.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.040]   Here you can store models together with the experiments that produce them.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:53.400]   This allows all work throughout the entire model development process to be easily reproducible and discoverable by anyone on the team.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.480]   It's great for onboarding and offboarding team members as work is never lost.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:06.360]   Now that you have a better understanding of your experiments and what worked and what didn't, it's time for you to share your results with your team.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.520]   I'm going to navigate to reports and here you can see a list of reports from this team's project.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.600]   And I'm going to select the published report image classification live dashboard.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:29.600]   You can effectively share key project metrics and analysis with both technical and non-technical stakeholders without having to take screenshots or clean up any unorganized notes.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:39.480]   These dashboards are all live so if I do any more work this will automatically update so that the rest of my team or my manager can see my latest progress.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:49.880]   With reports I can show how my model works, show graphs and visualizations of how the model versions improved over time, discuss bugs and demonstrate progress towards key milestones.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.320]   You can even share your reports externally if an outside audience needs to consume the results as well.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.360]   And that's all for this short video series but don't let that stop you on your learning journey.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.320]   Here are some useful links for you to dive deeper into what we covered in this video.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.400]   You can check out our documentation.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.720]   If you're having any issues you can go to our support forum.
