[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720]   Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:14.960]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.660]   Today we're discussing the vagus nerve.
[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.140]   The vagus nerve, or what neuroanatomists call cranial nerve 10, is an extremely interesting nerve
[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.680]   because when we hear the word nerve, we often think of a small, you know, connection between one thing and another,
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.720]   the wires of the nerve, which of course we call axons.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.360]   If you didn't know that, now you know they're called axons.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.260]   But actually, the cranial nerve is an extensive pathway.
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.440]   It's a whole set of connections that link the brain and body.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.760]   In fact, in many respects, it looks kind of like its own nervous system
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.460]   within the traditional nervous system of the brain and the spinal cord,
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.000]   the connections between spinal cord and muscle.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.280]   The vagus nerve is so vast.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.780]   It spreads out through so much of the body.
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.500]   And as you'll learn today, it's connected to so many interesting different brain areas
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.500]   and has so many interesting different functions that it deserves,
[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.780]   well, an entire episode of this podcast.
[00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.140]   The other great thing about the vagus nerve is it is highly actionable,
[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.280]   meaning what you will learn today,
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.840]   if you already know something about the vagus nerve,
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.960]   is going to change what you know and believe about the vagus nerve.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.040]   What you hear today will also,
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.060]   if you don't know or you're not familiar with the vagus nerve,
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.220]   is going to educate you on the latest about the vagus nerve.
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.060]   We've learned a lot about the vagus nerve
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.580]   and ways to control the vagus nerve in the last few years.
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.220]   And finally, and perhaps most importantly,
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.300]   the information that you're going to learn today
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.140]   includes actionable tools that will, for instance,
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.640]   allow you to make yourself more alert when you want to,
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.200]   without the use of pharmacology.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.200]   It will allow you to calm yourself down quickly when you want to,
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.720]   on demand and quickly,
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.740]   without the use of pharmacology or devices.
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.200]   And it will also allow you to alter your mood for the better
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.120]   and indeed to improve your ability to learn.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.080]   The vagus nerve is that important.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.000]   It's involved in that many different things.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.880]   And the pathways of the vagus nerve,
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.460]   as I mentioned,
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.080]   have been charted in more detail in recent years.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.920]   And the ways that we can get into the vagus nerve
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.440]   and stimulate its actions in specific ways
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.960]   to achieve those endpoints of improved mood,
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.340]   deeper relaxation,
[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.680]   fast relaxation,
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.280]   elevated levels of alertness,
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.680]   and on and on are now very well understood.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.520]   So as you can probably tell,
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.560]   I'm extremely excited about today's episode
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.700]   because the vagus nerve
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.760]   is just one of the most fascinating aspects
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.780]   to our nervous system.
[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.900]   You have one,
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.920]   I have one.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.620]   So let's figure out how they work
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.780]   and how to put it to work for the better.
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.960]   Before we begin,
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.600]   I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.820]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.960]   It is, however,
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.200]   part of my desire and effort
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.360]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.240]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.420]   to the general public.
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.800]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.040]   today's episode does include sponsors.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.180]   Our first sponsor is Element.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.060]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.240]   that has everything you need
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.220]   and nothing you don't.
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.680]   That means the electrolytes,
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.360]   sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.320]   in the correct amounts,
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.240]   but no sugar.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.700]   Proper hydration is critical
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.680]   for optimal brain and body function.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.740]   Even a slight degree of dehydration
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.020]   can diminish cognitive and physical performance.
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.320]   It's also important
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.740]   that you get adequate electrolytes.
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.580]   The electrolytes,
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.200]   sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.700]   are vital for functioning
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.080]   of all the cells in your body,
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.420]   especially your neurons
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.420]   or your nerve cells.
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.300]   Drinking Element dissolved in water
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.120]   makes it very easy
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.060]   to ensure that you're getting
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.980]   adequate hydration
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.740]   and adequate electrolytes.
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.840]   To make sure that I'm getting
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.960]   proper amounts of hydration
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.960]   and electrolytes,
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.740]   I dissolve one packet of Element
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.820]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.060]   when I first wake up in the morning,
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.440]   and I drink that basically
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.460]   first thing in the morning.
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.560]   I'll also drink Element dissolved in water
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.100]   during any kind of physical exercise
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.740]   that I'm doing,
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.140]   especially on hot days
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.000]   when I'm sweating a lot
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.820]   and losing water and electrolytes.
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.920]   Element has a bunch
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.020]   of great tasting flavors.
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.400]   I love the raspberry.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.540]   I love the citrus flavor.
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.420]   Right now, Element
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.460]   has a limited edition lemonade flavor
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.940]   that is absolutely delicious.
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.560]   I hate to say that I love one
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.460]   more than all the others,
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.980]   but this lemonade flavor
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:07.640]   is right up there
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.800]   with my favorite other one,
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.420]   which is raspberry or watermelon.
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.140]   Again, I can't pick just one flavor.
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.880]   I love them all.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.480]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.300]   you can go to

[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.520]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Juve.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.340]   Juve makes medical-grade
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.680]   red light therapy devices.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.080]   Now, if there's one thing
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.440]   that I have consistently emphasized
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.260]   on this podcast,
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.100]   it is the incredible impact
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.920]   that light can have on our biology.
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.320]   Now, in addition to sunlight,
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.440]   red light and near-infrared light sources
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.420]   have been shown to have positive effects
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.000]   on improving numerous aspects
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.340]   of cellular and organ health,
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.160]   including faster muscle recovery,
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.180]   improved skin health and wound healing,
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.740]   improvements in acne,
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.420]   reduced pain and inflammation,
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.900]   even mitochondrial function,
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.660]   and improving vision itself.
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.160]   What sets Juve lights apart
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.200]   and why they're my preferred
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.360]   red light therapy device
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.460]   is that they use
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.760]   clinically proven wavelengths,
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.460]   meaning specific wavelengths
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.080]   of red light and near-infrared light
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.860]   in combination
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.720]   to trigger
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.500]   the optimal seller adaptations.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.480]   Personally,
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.160]   I use the Juve whole body panel
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.600]   about three to four times a week,
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.640]   and I use the Juve handheld light
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.280]   both at home
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.180]   and when I travel.
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.880]   If you'd like to try Juve,
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.020]   you can go to Juve,

[00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.420]   Okay, let's get familiar
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.680]   with the vagus nerve.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.980]   The vagus nerve
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.480]   is cranial nerve 10.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.740]   The vagus nerve
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.580]   is very different
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.720]   than the other cranial nerves
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.660]   because whereas
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.760]   it does have connections
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.500]   with areas
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.620]   on the face,
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.220]   head,
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.900]   and neck,
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.040]   and deep
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.940]   to those areas too,
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:57.520]   so throat,
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.980]   et cetera,
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.620]   it also has connections
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.420]   or I should say
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.500]   it receives
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.360]   and provides connections
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.360]   to areas
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.580]   within the body.
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.040]   In fact,
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.700]   it has connections
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.620]   with the head area,
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.080]   the neck area,
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.580]   the chest area,
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.720]   the abdomen,
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.060]   and even a bit lower
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.360]   into the lower intestines.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.260]   So the vagus nerve
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.860]   is super extensive
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.260]   in terms of its outputs
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.920]   and its inputs.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.720]   And I'll explain
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.600]   what I mean by outputs
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.040]   and inputs
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.780]   in just a moment.
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.220]   But what's very useful
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.040]   to understand
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.580]   and visualize
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.500]   in your mind a bit
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.520]   anytime we're talking
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.360]   about the vagus nerve
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.400]   is we're talking
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.040]   about a nerve
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.220]   of many,
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.180]   many different pathways
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.020]   that both receives
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.820]   and provides information
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:37.720]   from essentially
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.120]   all areas of the body
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.980]   down to the base
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:40.660]   of your pelvis.
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.840]   And that stands
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.800]   in stark contrast
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.080]   from the other cranial nerves
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.920]   which tend
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.000]   to receive information
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   from restricted areas
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.660]   of the body,
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:49.320]   most typically
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.400]   the head
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.520]   and neck area,
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.140]   and that tend
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.540]   to provide connections
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.700]   to the head
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.540]   and neck area.
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.880]   The word vagus
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.920]   actually translates
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.420]   more or less
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:00.380]   to vagabond,
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.320]   which means wandering.
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.040]   So early neuroanatomists
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.080]   saw that this nerve
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:04.960]   cranial nerve 10
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.300]   had connections
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.640]   to large areas
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.200]   of the body
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:08.720]   and head
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.260]   and neck
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.180]   and received inputs
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.600]   from lots of areas
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.140]   of the body
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.240]   and decided to call it
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.660]   essentially
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:14.880]   the vagabond nerve
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.200]   or the vagus nerve.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.980]   Now, even though
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:17.940]   the word vagabond
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.460]   means essentially wandering
[00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.880]   and the word wandering
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.260]   kind of suggests random,
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.780]   there is nothing random
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:24.660]   about the wiring
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:25.700]   of the vagus nerve.
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.840]   The vagus nerve
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.520]   is incredibly precise
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.640]   in terms of
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.840]   where it receives
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.760]   information from
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.940]   and where it provides
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:33.920]   information to.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.440]   Now, I want to be very clear
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.060]   what I mean about
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.640]   information, okay?
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.800]   If you're a biologist,
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.840]   you'll probably understand
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.400]   some of this.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.460]   If you're not,
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.680]   and I have to assume
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.600]   most of you are not,
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.340]   it's still very important
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.120]   that you understand
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.140]   and it's very easy
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:47.780]   to understand
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.160]   that your nervous system,
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.700]   your brain,
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.520]   spinal cord,
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.560]   and of course,
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.120]   your nervous system
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:52.720]   includes all these
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.300]   cranial nerves,
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.340]   including the vagus nerve,
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.940]   are carrying different
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:56.840]   types of information
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.940]   along different pathways,
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:58.860]   different neurons
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.000]   or different nerve cells
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.200]   within the vagus nerve,
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:01.740]   for instance,
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.460]   are receiving
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.940]   or giving different types
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:05.520]   of information
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.460]   for different purposes.
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.200]   For instance,
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.700]   there is sensory information
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.780]   carried by neurons,
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:12.460]   nerve cells,
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.360]   in your nervous system.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.120]   Sensory information
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.200]   is the kind of information
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:16.960]   that, for instance,
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.880]   converts light
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.880]   into electrical signals
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.100]   at the level of your eyes.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:22.980]   Then your eyes
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:23.960]   are providing information
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.620]   to the brain
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.260]   about what's out
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.040]   in the visual world.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.780]   That's sensory information.
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.500]   The same could be said
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.020]   for sound waves.
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.640]   That's sensory information
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.900]   that your auditory system
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.580]   converts to basically
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.140]   your understanding
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:36.740]   of speech
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:37.240]   and sound
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:37.720]   and music,
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.200]   et cetera.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.540]   Other neurons
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.000]   control motor functions,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.580]   literally,
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.100]   the movement of your limbs
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.400]   by controlling contraction
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.100]   of your muscles
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.140]   or the movement
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:46.780]   of your lips
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:47.860]   or the closing
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.200]   or opening
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.000]   of your airways,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.840]   for instance.
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.760]   So motor information
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.420]   of course can be seen
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.380]   on the surface of the body.
[00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.360]   I'm moving my hands now.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.080]   I'm moving my mouth.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:58.660]   You don't even need
[00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.320]   to see me do that
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.380]   to know that I'm doing that.
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.740]   But within our body,
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:03.440]   we have organs
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.600]   that also need
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.640]   motor control.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.740]   For instance,
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:07.980]   our gut.
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.280]   Our gut is not just
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.320]   a passive tube
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.600]   through which food moves.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.020]   The gut is contracting
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:13.880]   and relaxing.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.360]   It's moving food through
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.160]   from one end
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:16.660]   to the other.
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:17.300]   Okay.
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.580]   We have our pancreas.
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:20.500]   We have our liver.
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.560]   We have our spleen
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.160]   and you might think,
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:22.500]   oh, well,
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.040]   those are sort of
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:23.860]   vegetative organs.
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:24.840]   They just kind of sit there.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.240]   Maybe the cells do stuff,
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.100]   but they don't move much.
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:27.940]   But actually,
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.000]   your spleen
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.660]   even has a contractile ability
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.760]   so it can contract
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.000]   to release red blood cells
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.840]   or immune cells
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.840]   into circulation
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.980]   and so on and so forth.
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.980]   Different organs,
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.080]   including your muscles,
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.460]   but other organs as well,
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.860]   need instructions
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.200]   as to when they should move,
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.240]   when they should contract,
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.220]   when they should relax.
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.860]   So we have sensory information
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:48.720]   that's carried by
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.280]   essentially one set
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:50.720]   of neurons
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.620]   in our nervous system.
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.620]   So carrying light information
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.740]   or sound information,
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:55.660]   or as you'll see
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.180]   in a few minutes,
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.220]   chemical information
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.420]   about the acidity
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:58.960]   of the gut,
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.980]   for instance.
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.060]   And we have neurons
[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.000]   that are considered
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.080]   motor neurons.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.840]   They control
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.980]   the contraction of muscles
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:06.740]   or the contraction
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:07.800]   of these different organs
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.220]   or the encouragement
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.060]   for different aspects
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.040]   of the digestive tract
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:12.700]   to contract
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:13.300]   or relax
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.420]   to move food along.
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:14.940]   Okay,
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.300]   so we've got sensory neurons
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.500]   and we have motor neurons.
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.160]   And then there are
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:18.940]   a lot of other neurons
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:19.440]   as well
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:19.960]   that we call
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.020]   modulatory neurons
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.140]   that kind of adjust
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:22.840]   the balance
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.140]   between the sensory information
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.140]   and motor information.
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:25.640]   We aren't going
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.520]   to talk so much today
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.060]   about modulatory neurons,
[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:28.760]   but they are
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.160]   an important third category
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:30.740]   of neuron
[00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:31.620]   in the nervous system.
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.400]   Now,
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.120]   why am I telling you
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:33.500]   all this stuff
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.500]   about sensory and motor?
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.300]   Because the vagus nerve
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.360]   is also unique
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.160]   in that it is
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.780]   both a sensory pathway
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.880]   and a motor pathway.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.180]   And this is something
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:44.360]   that most discussions
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.280]   about the vagus nerve,
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:45.660]   in fact,
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.280]   I would say
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.880]   99% of discussions
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:49.740]   about the vagus nerve
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:50.780]   that you see online
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.100]   or when you hear about,
[00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.880]   forgive me,
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.920]   in your yoga classes,
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.360]   by the way,
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.160]   I'm going to touch on
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.100]   how yoga
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.000]   and ancient yogic practices
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.040]   actually managed
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:10:59.640]   to tease apart
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.980]   some very important functions
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:01.700]   of the vagus nerve
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.220]   without knowing
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.560]   any of the underlying mechanisms.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.880]   But it is the case
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.880]   that most of the time
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.340]   when you hear
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.220]   about the vagus nerve
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:07.780]   out there
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.240]   in the general world
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:09.900]   or in the media,
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.260]   it's about the vagus nerve
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.860]   being a calming pathway
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:13.980]   that's involved
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.320]   in transmitting information
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.900]   about the sensory milieu
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.920]   of the body.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.280]   So,
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:18.720]   you know,
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.560]   heart rate,
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.340]   acidity of the gut,
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:22.100]   you know,
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:22.620]   how comfortable
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.640]   we are in our body
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.480]   to our brain.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.540]   And people will say
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:26.420]   you want to activate
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.260]   the vagus nerve
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.200]   because you want
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   to calm down.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:29.920]   Well,
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.260]   that is true,
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:31.960]   but that is just
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.320]   one small fraction
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:33.920]   of the functions
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:34.680]   of the vagus nerve.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.500]   Why?
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.720]   Because the vagus nerve
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.400]   includes both
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.020]   sensory
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.680]   and motor neurons
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.260]   within it.
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.420]   And while it is true
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.240]   that a ton
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.200]   of sensory information
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.160]   is coursing up
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:45.800]   from the organs
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.400]   of the body
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.420]   into the brain
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.400]   through what we call
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.320]   the vagus nerve,
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.640]   there's also
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.660]   motor information
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.120]   coming from the brain
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.260]   to the body.
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.440]   So if we are going
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.340]   to have an accurate,
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.020]   meaningful,
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.360]   actionable conversation
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.260]   about the vagus nerve,
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.380]   it's very important
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:00.920]   that you know
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.700]   that the vagus nerve
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.340]   contains sensory neurons
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.280]   as well as
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.160]   motor neurons.
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.260]   And I want to be clear
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:06.840]   that I'm not just
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.680]   telling you about sensory
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.640]   versus motor neurons
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.420]   in the vagus nerve
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.780]   to just overload you
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.640]   with nomenclature.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.760]   It turns out
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.340]   that if you want
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:13.800]   to access
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.180]   the calming aspects
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.260]   of vagus nerve activation
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260]   versus the energizing effects
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.880]   of vagus nerve activation
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.520]   versus the immune-enhancing effects
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.860]   of vagus nerve activation
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.220]   versus the ways
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.100]   that you can improve
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.440]   learning using vagus nerve activation,
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.740]   you need to know
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:32.300]   whether or not
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.540]   you're trying to activate
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:34.820]   a sensory pathway
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.420]   or a motor pathway
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.820]   within this vast set
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:38.300]   of connections
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:38.900]   that we call
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:39.760]   the vagus nerve.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.520]   Okay,
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.540]   so I want to just briefly
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.300]   describe the sensory pathways
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.460]   within the vagus nerve.
[00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.980]   And by the way,
[00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.440]   if you're a yoga teacher,
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.160]   if you are a therapist,
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.300]   if you are a teacher,
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.720]   if you are a human being
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.320]   on earth,
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.560]   this information
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.060]   is going to be
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:54.980]   very useful to you
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.040]   because this is
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:56.620]   the information
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.480]   that will allow you
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.100]   to understand
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.040]   why it is
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.500]   that when your body
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.260]   is in a certain
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:01.820]   comfortable
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.360]   or uncomfortable state,
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.520]   it has a particular effect
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.560]   on your mind
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.300]   and your brain
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.040]   to feel,
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:08.520]   well,
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.100]   in general,
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:09.820]   comfortable
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.740]   or uncomfortable.
[00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.440]   Your vagus nerve
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.640]   includes very interesting
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.960]   and kind of unusually
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.940]   shaped neurons.
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:16.580]   Okay,
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.420]   the neurons
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.260]   of the vagus nerve
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.500]   are not like the ones
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:19.980]   that you see
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.880]   in the typical picture
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.500]   if you were
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.860]   to look up neuron online.
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:23.180]   If you were
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.500]   to look up neuron online,
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.200]   what you would find
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.380]   is you'd see a picture
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.020]   of what's called
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:27.740]   a cell body
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.420]   where the nucleus,
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:29.260]   the DNA is.
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:29.980]   You'd see
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:30.360]   what are called
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:30.980]   dendrites,
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:31.620]   which typically
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.160]   are the area
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:32.820]   where neurons
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:33.760]   receive input.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:34.500]   And then you'd
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.600]   see the wire-like
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.040]   extension
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:36.460]   that we call
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.200]   the axon
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.800]   out to the area
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.480]   that that neuron
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.360]   communicates with.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.060]   And then you might
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:41.680]   see a little picture
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.080]   of some little blobs
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:43.660]   or what we call
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.020]   vesicles being released
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:45.460]   at the end
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.180]   of that axon.
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.340]   That is not
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.120]   at all
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.440]   what vagal nerve
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.660]   neurons look like.
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:51.840]   Some of them do,
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.160]   but the vast majority,
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.500]   about 85%
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.520]   of the neurons
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.480]   in the vagus nerve,
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.040]   have a cell body
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:58.920]   with that DNA
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.140]   with the nucleus in it
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.540]   sitting in an area
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.620]   kind of near your neck
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.520]   and back of your head,
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.460]   sort of what we call
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:07.160]   the brainstem.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.200]   And it's called
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.700]   the nodose ganglion.
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:10.160]   Now,
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:10.900]   the nodose ganglion
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:11.660]   is a collection
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.760]   of cell bodies
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.400]   of neurons.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.260]   So you can think of it
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.160]   kind of like a cluster
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:15.760]   of grapes.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.720]   and they do indeed
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.860]   have an axon
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:19.600]   extending from them,
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.080]   a wire
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.360]   that goes out
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.260]   to the body.
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.100]   That wire
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.440]   looks for all the world
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.300]   like the axons
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.320]   on any other neurons.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.800]   And that little axon
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.640]   can be very short
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.800]   if it terminates,
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.340]   as we say,
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.920]   in an area of the neck.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.260]   It can be slightly longer
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:34.900]   if it terminates
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:35.820]   in the chest area
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:36.960]   and even longer
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.520]   if it goes
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.280]   to what we call
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:38.960]   our viscera,
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.220]   our lungs,
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.440]   our pancreas,
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.520]   our liver,
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.620]   down to any number
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:45.600]   of different organs
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.020]   within our major
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.580]   abdominal body compartment.
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.200]   Okay?
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:49.860]   You also see
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:50.720]   an axon,
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.380]   a little wire
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.880]   from a vagal sensory neuron
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.020]   out to the spleen.
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:55.700]   Now,
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:56.500]   what I just described,
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.260]   a cell body
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.940]   with an axon
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:14:59.760]   extending from it
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.780]   out to the organs
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:01.360]   of the body,
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.380]   different organs
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:02.840]   of the body
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.080]   tend to be innervated
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.540]   by different neurons.
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.280]   Not always,
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:07.940]   but in general.
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.860]   But here's what's different
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.700]   about these vagal neurons.
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.140]   These vagal neurons
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.160]   have another axon
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.560]   that goes from the cell body.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.220]   So they're what we call
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:18.200]   a bipolar neuron.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.320]   They have another axon
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.340]   that extends up
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.880]   into the brainstem
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.200]   and terminates
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.080]   in generally
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.200]   one of three different
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:25.740]   what we call
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:26.920]   brainstem nuclei,
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.820]   which are just areas
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:28.500]   of the brainstem.
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.680]   So this is very important
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:30.860]   to embed in your mind,
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.180]   right?
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.740]   Because in reality,
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.360]   embedded in your head
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:34.860]   and neck
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:35.660]   or in your brain
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.220]   and neck
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.420]   are these neurons
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:37.880]   which are kind of
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.900]   like a cluster of grapes
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:39.440]   that have,
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.560]   each one is going
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.680]   to have two branches,
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.680]   one that goes out
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.320]   to a particular organ
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:44.920]   of the body
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.360]   and another branch
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:46.980]   that goes up
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:47.880]   into your brainstem.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.800]   Now,
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.460]   this visual understanding,
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:50.940]   which hopefully
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:51.720]   is starting
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.340]   to take place
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:52.880]   in your mind
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.340]   is extremely important
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.060]   to understand
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.580]   how 85%
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.800]   of the vagus nerve works.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   85%
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.940]   of the vagus nerve works
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.040]   by having these neurons
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.040]   that have axons
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.200]   in say the spleen
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.760]   or around the lungs
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.460]   or that innervate the heart
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:08.380]   or that innervate
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:08.920]   any number
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:09.700]   of different organs
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.340]   in your body
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.020]   and they collect
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.260]   sensory information
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.240]   about what's going on
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.040]   in each
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:17.480]   and every one
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.200]   of those organs.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.540]   That information
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.020]   goes up the axon.
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:21.800]   Remember,
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:22.700]   there's a cell bodies
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:23.720]   in the nodos ganglion
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.520]   and then it goes
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.640]   further up
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.700]   past the cell body
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:27.860]   into the brainstem.
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:28.540]   Okay,
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.380]   so when people talk
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.360]   about the vagus nerve,
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.360]   cranial nerve 10
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.900]   as being a sensory pathway,
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.260]   it is mostly
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.280]   a sensory pathway.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.720]   It's collecting information
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.620]   through these axons.
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.900]   Why is that weird?
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:40.740]   Well,
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.500]   it's not weird
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.100]   but it's different
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:42.560]   than the way
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.360]   we normally talk
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:43.800]   about neurons
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:44.500]   where the axon
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.440]   is the output end,
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:45.800]   right,
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.780]   where it's dumping stuff
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:47.580]   onto the next neuron
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:48.360]   to make things happen.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.140]   The neurons
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.360]   in the nodos ganglion
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.140]   of the vagus nerve,
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:52.760]   I know that's a lot
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.140]   of language
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.180]   but these neurons
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.500]   that send an axon branch
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.700]   out to the organs
[00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:58.220]   of the body
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.000]   are collecting information
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.860]   about what's happening,
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.080]   what sensory information
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:03.980]   is occurring
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.440]   out at those organs
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.720]   and that information
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.060]   goes up those wires
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.500]   past the cell body
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.920]   and into the brainstem
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.760]   and then that's
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.160]   communicated to the brain.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.280]   So basically,
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.980]   we can think of 85%
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.220]   of the vagus nerve,
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.780]   this huge superhighway
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:20.680]   from the body
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.320]   to the brain
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.600]   as being sensory
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.200]   and when we talk
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:24.940]   about sensory,
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:25.680]   it's important
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.340]   that you understand
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.380]   that two types
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.280]   of sensory information
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.140]   are coming in
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.440]   through these wires,
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.420]   through these axons
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.740]   and that are delivered
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.400]   to the brain
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.480]   and in response
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.720]   to that sensory information,
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.760]   as you'll soon learn,
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.080]   your brain will change
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.120]   its levels of alertness.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.200]   Sometimes it gets more alert,
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.400]   sometimes it gets calmer,
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.440]   sometimes it primes you
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.120]   to learn better,
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.680]   sometimes it will turn
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.520]   on a fever,
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.680]   it will literally
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.880]   heat up your entire body
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.720]   based on what those axons
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.360]   are sensing
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.120]   out in the periphery,
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.720]   the periphery of course
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.640]   being the organs
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.060]   and tissues
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:57.620]   of your body
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:58.640]   outside your brain
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.440]   and spinal cord.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.240]   So I realize
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.500]   that's a bit of neuroanatomy
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.000]   for those of you
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:02.580]   that aren't familiar
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.300]   with neuroanatomy,
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:03.980]   it might seem like
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:05.120]   an overwhelming amount
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:05.760]   of neuroanatomy,
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.160]   but it's extremely important
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.000]   to have that idea
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:08.460]   in your mind
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:09.360]   of sensory information
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.200]   flowing up
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.500]   into the brain
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.760]   from your organs
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.540]   because anatomically speaking
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.460]   and functionally speaking,
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.180]   it runs exactly opposite
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.020]   to how we typically
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.440]   see neurons
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.120]   when they're drawn
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.120]   in diagrams for us
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:22.780]   and how we talk
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:23.200]   about neurons
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.320]   as just putting stuff
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:24.980]   out at the level
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:25.640]   of the axon
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.180]   at the end
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:26.900]   of those wires.
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.020]   Information's coming
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.040]   up those wires
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.160]   in the case of the vagus.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:30.700]   Okay,
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.260]   so whereas
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.580]   for the visual system
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.200]   or the auditory system
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.080]   or for the smell system
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.060]   or the taste system,
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.980]   typically we have
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.140]   one type of sensory
[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.120]   information coming in.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:41.800]   So for instance,
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.780]   in the visual system,
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.080]   light photons of energy
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:45.720]   are converted
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.820]   into electrical signals
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:47.460]   that the rest
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.740]   of the visual system
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:49.680]   unpacks
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.120]   to give you
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:50.940]   visual perceptions
[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:51.520]   to control
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.520]   your circadian rhythms
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.300]   or in the case
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.160]   of the auditory system,
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.080]   you have sound waves
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.860]   which are transduced
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.720]   by this beautiful mechanism
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.660]   of your inner ear
[00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.460]   that then gets converted
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.400]   into your understanding
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.060]   of speech
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:03.620]   or music,
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:04.080]   et cetera.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.280]   In the case
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.180]   of the vagus nerve,
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.980]   the sensory information
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.860]   coming from your organs,
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:10.840]   from your lungs,
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.120]   from your gut
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:12.760]   and by the way,
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:13.280]   your gut,
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:13.940]   when I say that,
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:14.780]   I don't just mean
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:15.460]   your stomach,
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:15.980]   I also mean
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.100]   the large and small intestine
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:17.680]   and all the stuff
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.480]   above your stomach
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:18.960]   as well.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.580]   The sensory information
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:22.100]   that's coming
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:22.760]   from the body
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.740]   includes both
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:24.980]   chemical information
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.440]   and mechanical information.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.260]   Now,
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.220]   the mechanical information
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:29.980]   is pretty straightforward
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:30.680]   to understand.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.840]   If your gut
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.800]   is full of food
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.420]   or air
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:33.960]   or water
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:34.980]   and it's very distended,
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:36.500]   you can feel that.
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.880]   The reason you can feel that
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.560]   is because you have
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.940]   mechanoreceptors
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.760]   that sense stretch
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.880]   in the lining
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.460]   of the gut
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.400]   and send that information
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.340]   by way of those axons
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:47.760]   up
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.600]   to and past
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.460]   the nodo's ganglion.
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.300]   There's some processing
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:51.960]   of that information
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.720]   in the nodo's ganglion,
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.200]   but then it goes
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:53.760]   up
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.320]   and into your brainstem.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.120]   Okay?
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:56.680]   Now,
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.820]   also within the gut
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:58.920]   you have
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.000]   chemical information.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.840]   There's information
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.180]   about,
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:01.760]   for instance,
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:02.220]   and we'll talk
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:02.980]   more about this later,
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.580]   how much serotonin
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:05.280]   is in the gut.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.280]   You may have heard
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.160]   that 90%
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:07.980]   of the serotonin
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:08.660]   in your body
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:09.560]   is manufactured
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.260]   in the gut
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.140]   and indeed
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:11.880]   it's manufactured
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.500]   in your gut.
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.340]   It plays an important
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.760]   role in gut motility
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.260]   and gut health.
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.960]   The serotonin
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.500]   in your gut
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.280]   is distinct
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.320]   from the serotonin
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.180]   released in your brain.
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:21.580]   Later,
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:22.120]   we'll talk about
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:22.780]   how the levels
[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:23.420]   of serotonin
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:24.020]   in your gut
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.380]   are conveyed
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.300]   to the brain
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.060]   by way of,
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:27.800]   you guessed it,
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.740]   the vagus nerve
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.820]   and your brain
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:30.260]   in turn
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:31.960]   makes different levels
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:32.880]   of serotonin
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.040]   to impact your mood.
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.140]   Super interesting,
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.360]   super important pathway
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:36.920]   has relevance
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.520]   for depression
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.480]   and just for everyday
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.420]   mood and well-being.
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.140]   We'll talk about it.
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.460]   It's a highly actionable pathway.
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.260]   Super cool.
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.040]   So you have mechanical information
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.020]   and you have chemical information
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:47.900]   coming from,
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:48.400]   for instance,
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:48.940]   your gut
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.420]   up through the sensory
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.520]   in the technical nomenclature.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.640]   It's called afference.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.340]   Afference is a technical language.
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:56.320]   Feel free to ignore this,
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:56.960]   but for those of you
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:57.460]   that want to know,
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.120]   you aficionados already know this,
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.020]   the afference
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.660]   are the inputs to a structure.
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.380]   Efference are the inputs
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.420]   from a structure.
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.520]   But what we've got
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.240]   in the case of the gut
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.220]   is mechanical
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.480]   and chemical information
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.560]   being sensed
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.960]   by different neurons
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:12.920]   with different receptors
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.760]   that pay attention
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.180]   to different things,
[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:16.640]   meaning those receptors
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.340]   are activated
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.780]   by either mechanical stretch
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:19.720]   or by the presence
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.220]   or absence
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.320]   of particular chemicals
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:21.860]   in the gut,
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.600]   how acidic the gut is,
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.000]   and that information goes up,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:25.960]   processed a bit
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:26.740]   in the nodo's ganglion
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:27.720]   and then relayed up
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.440]   to the brainstem.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.500]   And we'll talk in a moment
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:30.220]   about what happens
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:30.940]   to that information
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.380]   after it lands
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:33.040]   in the brainstem.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:33.900]   Now,
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.960]   chemical and mechanical information
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.080]   is also being conveyed
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.160]   from other structures
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:38.740]   in the body.
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.040]   You can probably imagine
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:40.900]   what some of these are,
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:41.760]   and we don't have to go
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.500]   through each and every one,
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.100]   but as one additional example
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:44.600]   to the gut,
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:45.100]   I'll just use,
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:45.480]   for instance,
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.080]   the lungs.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.280]   When your lungs
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.320]   expand
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.680]   and contract
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.860]   as you breathe,
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.240]   that information
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.180]   is relayed up
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.540]   through and past
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:56.440]   the nodo's ganglion
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.840]   and up into the brainstem.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.340]   And as you can imagine,
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:21:59.860]   your lungs,
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.540]   because you're inhaling oxygen
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:02.140]   and you're also
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.340]   offloading carbon dioxide,
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.640]   your lungs are expanding
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.460]   and contracting.
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.860]   Your lungs are also
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.160]   communicating mechanical
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.680]   and chemical oxygen-carbon dioxide
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.620]   ratio information
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:13.740]   up to the brain.
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:14.160]   Now,
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:14.680]   if we wanted to,
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.280]   we could explore
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:15.680]   and discuss
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.440]   every single organ
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:16.980]   of your body
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.800]   that gets axon input
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:19.720]   from the vagus nerve
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.200]   and therefore
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.940]   can carry sensory information
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:22.780]   up the vagus.
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:23.720]   And again,
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.740]   there's going to be information
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.620]   about the chemical environment
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.780]   and the mechanical status
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:29.920]   of each of those organs
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.360]   carried up to your brainstem.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.440]   We're not going to do that now
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.240]   for sake of time,
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.740]   but it's very important
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.400]   that you now take a step back
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.080]   and you realize,
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:37.480]   hmm,
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.920]   I understand what sensory information is.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:40.920]   I understand that it's different
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:41.860]   than motor information.
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.300]   It's carried by different neurons
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.060]   in the nervous system.
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:44.960]   The vagus nerve
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.380]   has both sensory
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.020]   and motor neurons.
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.220]   the sensory neurons
[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.400]   are collecting information
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.780]   from all these bodily organs.
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:52.420]   And by the way,
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.380]   those bodily organs
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:54.120]   don't just stop
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.080]   at the level of the lungs.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.160]   It includes the heart.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.280]   It includes some stuff
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.520]   that's happening in the neck,
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.940]   some of the muscles
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:00.760]   that are controlling
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.180]   the constriction of the airways.
[00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.040]   We'll get into this
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:03.480]   a little bit more
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.020]   in a few minutes,
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.600]   but you now also know
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.280]   that when we talk
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.000]   about collecting sensory information
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.660]   from the body
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.860]   and sending it to the brain
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.700]   by these vagal pathways,
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.140]   that the types
[00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:15.020]   of sensory information
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.460]   include both chemical
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.140]   and mechanical information.
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.940]   And the reason that's important
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.000]   is not just academic
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:21.700]   and intellectual.
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:22.680]   It's not just to fill
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.000]   the airspace with nomenclature.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.240]   It's because
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.220]   if you're going to think
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.400]   about ways
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.240]   to change the activity
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.400]   of the vagus system,
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.760]   the ways to,
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.460]   for instance,
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.480]   calm down
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.120]   or the ways
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:34.820]   to improve
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:35.940]   your immune system function
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.180]   or to improve your mood
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.460]   in the short and long term,
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.000]   you need to ask yourself,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.120]   am I going to do that
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.220]   through a mechanical change
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.780]   or am I going to do that
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:45.980]   by making a change
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.100]   to the chemical milieu
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:48.140]   of a given organ
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:48.980]   or set of organs?
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.120]   So to drive the point
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:50.820]   I just made home,
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.080]   let's take an example
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.300]   that we see a lot out there,
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.940]   which is that
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.220]   if you want to increase
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:56.700]   the activity
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.640]   of your vagus nerve,
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.160]   you want to calm down.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.280]   Why am I saying calm down?
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.760]   I neglected to say earlier
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.640]   that, by the way,
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.460]   every medical student
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.140]   and pre-med student
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:04.600]   should know,
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.580]   which is that cranial nerve 10,
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.280]   the vagus nerve
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:07.880]   is classified
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.920]   as a parasympathetic nerve.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.060]   Parasympathetic
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:12.640]   refers to one branch
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.200]   of the so-called
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.460]   autonomic nervous system.
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.880]   The autonomic nervous system
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.720]   controls your levels
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.280]   of alertness
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.360]   and your levels of calm.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.960]   It has two major branches.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:20.820]   One branch is called
[00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.260]   the sympathetic nervous system.
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.140]   It has nothing to do
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.060]   with emotional sympathy.
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.880]   The sympathetic nervous system
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.660]   is generally responsible
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.300]   for increasing
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.460]   our levels of alertness.
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:31.840]   Everything from being alert
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:32.720]   like I am now
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.940]   all the way up
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.160]   to full-blown panic attack,
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:35.820]   which fortunately,
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.040]   I'm not right now.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.980]   The parasympathetic nervous system
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.280]   is often referred to
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.120]   as the rest and digest system.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.020]   And indeed,
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.020]   it has roles
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.240]   in rest and digestion,
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:45.940]   but it controls
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.280]   a lot more than just that.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.760]   The parasympathetic branch
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:49.980]   of the autonomic nervous system
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:50.820]   controls,
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:51.520]   for instance,
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.900]   digestion.
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.080]   It controls
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:54.640]   our ability
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.780]   to fall asleep at night.
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.540]   If the parasympathetic nervous system
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.880]   is overly activated,
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.240]   it can make us sleepy
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.040]   when we don't want
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:01.600]   to be sleepy.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.920]   It can make us pass out
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.640]   when we don't want
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.300]   to pass out.
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.660]   It can be responsible
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.740]   for putting people
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:07.620]   into a state of coma.
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:08.720]   So it's not good
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.140]   to think about
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.280]   the sympathetic nervous system
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.780]   simply as fight or flight,
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:12.960]   how it's often referred to,
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.060]   because it's also responsible
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.820]   for generating healthy,
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:16.760]   wakeful,
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.520]   non-anxious,
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.440]   non-stress levels
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:18.940]   of alertness,
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.720]   as well as stressed out,
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.620]   panic states.
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.580]   And the parasympathetic nervous system
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:24.120]   is responsible
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:24.960]   for putting us
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.140]   into a calm
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:26.980]   and relaxed state
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.040]   or a deep sleep state
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.100]   or a coma state
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:31.600]   if it were
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.680]   to be hyperactivated.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.120]   The autonomic nervous system
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:34.860]   is a seesaw
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.280]   where the levels
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.220]   of alertness
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:37.660]   and calm
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:38.280]   that we experience
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.060]   in any one moment
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.900]   reflect the relative balance
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.120]   of sympathetic nervous system
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.500]   and parasympathetic nervous system
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.020]   activity.
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:44.620]   They're sort of
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:45.380]   in a push-pull
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.000]   with one another.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.740]   Increase the parasympathetic
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:48.580]   nervous system activity
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:48.960]   a little bit,
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.780]   you get a bit calmer.
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:50.840]   Increase the sympathetic
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:51.880]   nervous system activity
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.360]   a little bit,
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.480]   you get a bit more alert,
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.400]   but they're always
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.340]   both active.
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:56.560]   The vagus nerve
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.300]   is classified
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.900]   as a parasympathetic nerve.
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:00.480]   However,
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.700]   it's a bit
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:02.920]   of a misnomer
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.800]   because as you'll soon realize,
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.720]   there are pathways
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.900]   within the vagus nerve
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.200]   that were you
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:08.800]   to activate
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.400]   these pathways
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.440]   within the vagus nerve,
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.400]   you would become
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.420]   more alert,
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:13.680]   not less alert.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.160]   This is one of the things
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:15.700]   that I'm hoping
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:16.280]   to dispel
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:16.820]   through the course
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:17.520]   of this episode,
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.000]   which is this very
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.160]   common myth out there.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.260]   It's almost pervasive
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.160]   that when you activate
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:23.920]   the vagus nerve,
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.120]   you're going to calm down.
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.060]   It is simply not true.
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:27.800]   Okay.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.560]   There are instances
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.540]   where that is true.
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:30.600]   There are instances
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.560]   where the opposite
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.040]   is true
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.540]   depending on which branch
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.840]   of the vagus nerve
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:35.940]   you happen to activate
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:36.760]   or suppress.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.060]   One example,
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:38.480]   however,
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.580]   where activating
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.760]   a particular branch
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:41.580]   of the vagus nerve
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:42.620]   does indeed lead
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:43.480]   to more relaxation
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.660]   is the branch
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:46.560]   of the vagus nerve
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:47.660]   that again
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:48.440]   is sensory.
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:48.820]   Okay.
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:49.860]   So it's taking information
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.480]   about mechanical phenomenon,
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.060]   in this case,
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.240]   pressure or touch
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.680]   and it's sending
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.440]   that information
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.820]   down into
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:58.840]   the brainstem areas
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:26:59.500]   that are going
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.060]   to interpret
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:00.840]   that information.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.780]   This branch
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:03.780]   of the vagus nerve
[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.360]   that is carrying
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.280]   sensory information
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.180]   doesn't come
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.120]   from the viscera
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.060]   or the neck.
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.040]   It comes from the head
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:09.980]   and it's the branch
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:10.740]   of the vagus nerve
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.120]   that essentially
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.180]   goes behind the ear
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:14.820]   and in some
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.540]   of the deeper components
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:16.960]   of the ear.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.200]   Remember,
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:17.580]   they tell you
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.100]   don't put anything
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:18.560]   into your ear
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:18.880]   that's,
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.920]   you know,
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.580]   smaller than your elbow.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:22.380]   well,
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.280]   I'm breaking
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:23.980]   that rule right now
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:24.280]   and I'm putting
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.080]   my index finger
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:25.900]   into my ear
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.020]   and rubbing
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:27.840]   in a circular way
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.220]   that kind of
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.220]   the area right
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.580]   outside the hole
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.060]   of the ear.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:31.840]   There's a branch
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.660]   of the vagus nerve
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:32.920]   there.
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.440]   There's also,
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:33.900]   as I mentioned,
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:34.260]   a branch
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:34.920]   of the vagus nerve
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:35.620]   behind the ear
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:36.800]   and were you to rub
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:37.460]   behind the ear
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.380]   just gently
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:38.780]   or,
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:39.180]   you know,
[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:39.720]   with a little bit
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.220]   of pressure.
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:40.840]   Indeed,
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:41.140]   you're going
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:41.640]   to activate
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.220]   that branch
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.000]   of the vagus nerve.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:43.980]   That branch
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:44.560]   of the vagus nerve
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:44.880]   is carrying
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.860]   sensory information
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:46.720]   so that mechanical
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.140]   pressure
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.020]   is being conveyed
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.040]   into the brainstem
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:49.860]   and indeed
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:50.680]   that pathway
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.780]   satisfies all the criteria
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.600]   of being a parasympathetic
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.300]   or calming
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.260]   inducing pathway.
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.020]   Now,
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:57.500]   you can find
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:58.200]   all over the internet
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:58.580]   that,
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:27:58.840]   you know,
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:59.940]   rubbing behind the ears
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:00.660]   is really going
[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:01.680]   to calm us down
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.620]   and really bring
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:03.120]   our level
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:03.760]   of overall
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.720]   autonomic arousal
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.040]   way,
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:05.560]   way down.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.660]   In reality,
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:07.320]   it doesn't bring
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.160]   our overall level
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.140]   of autonomic arousal
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:09.480]   way,
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.000]   way down.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:10.860]   it brings
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:11.280]   our level
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:11.880]   of autonomic
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.300]   arousal
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.280]   down a bit
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.180]   depending on
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.580]   how active
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.780]   our sympathetic
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:17.480]   nervous system
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.240]   happens to be.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.540]   Why do I tell you this?
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:19.680]   Well,
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.060]   I'm not trying
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:20.760]   to rain
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.580]   on any parties
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:22.080]   out there,
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.180]   but the truth
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.220]   is if you're
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.240]   super stressed,
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:25.620]   if you're
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:26.140]   in a panic
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:26.560]   attack,
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:27.380]   rubbing behind
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:27.700]   your ears
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:28.120]   might help
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:28.740]   a little bit,
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:29.500]   but it's not
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.140]   going to suddenly
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:30.520]   bring you
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.020]   into a state
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:31.460]   of calm.
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:31.940]   Soon,
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:32.240]   we're going
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:32.520]   to talk
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:32.900]   about things
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:33.380]   that can bring
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:33.660]   you into
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:33.960]   a state
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.320]   of calm
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.280]   very fast
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:35.600]   and I will
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.400]   explain exactly
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.020]   how they work
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:37.740]   and why they work
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:38.580]   so quickly
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.300]   and why they are
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:39.940]   so robust.
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:40.620]   I don't want
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.360]   to be disparaging
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:41.920]   of the area
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:42.660]   behind the ear
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:43.160]   or the area
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:43.720]   within their ear.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:44.100]   Some people
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:44.560]   really like
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.280]   their ears rubbed.
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:45.840]   I certainly
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.380]   like the area
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.000]   behind my ears
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:47.560]   rubbed like I'm
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:47.980]   doing now
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:48.360]   or the areas
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.080]   within my ears
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:49.840]   gently rubbed.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:50.400]   Who doesn't
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:50.840]   like that?
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:51.380]   And indeed,
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:51.960]   it's calming,
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.620]   but it's one
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:54.540]   minor branch
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:55.780]   of the vagus nerve
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:56.460]   carrying sensory
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.040]   information.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.260]   It's not going
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:59.060]   to suddenly shift
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:28:59.660]   your autonomic
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:00.180]   nervous system.
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:00.640]   It's not going
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.340]   to suddenly tilt
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:01.940]   that seesaw
[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.080]   into parasympathetic
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:03.980]   dominance,
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:04.700]   as it were.
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:05.660]   To do that,
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:06.320]   you need to leverage
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.100]   some of the other
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.540]   more robust
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:09.280]   branches
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.240]   of the vagus nerve
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:10.880]   and I'll teach you
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:11.320]   how to do that
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:11.920]   in just a moment
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.160]   here.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.180]   The point
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.120]   is that
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.160]   the vagus nerve
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:15.960]   does carry
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.160]   sort of classic
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.060]   parasympathetic
[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:18.600]   information.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.680]   If you're asked
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.400]   on an exam,
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.000]   students,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:21.860]   med students,
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:22.360]   I don't want
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:22.880]   to be responsible
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:23.380]   for you getting
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:23.840]   this wrong.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.340]   I'd love to be
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:24.980]   responsible for you
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:25.480]   getting it right.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.320]   I teach neuroanatomy
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.040]   to medical students.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.460]   If you're asked,
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.420]   is cranial nerve 10,
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.280]   the vagus nerve,
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.100]   parasympathetic
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:33.600]   or sympathetic,
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.440]   you should answer
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.700]   parasympathetic.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.360]   If you're asked
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:36.940]   if it's sensory
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:37.400]   or motor,
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.080]   you should say
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:38.600]   it's mixed,
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.180]   it's both.
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.020]   So it's mixed
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:40.760]   parasympathetic.
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.300]   However,
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.800]   for everybody out there,
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.700]   med student or not,
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:44.620]   just understand
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:45.380]   that when you activate
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:46.020]   certain branches
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:46.980]   of the vagus nerve,
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:47.680]   you're either going
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.680]   to get an elevation
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:49.440]   in alertness,
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.500]   that is an increase
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:50.920]   in sympathetic
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:51.840]   nervous system activity
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.100]   or a decrease
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.060]   in alertness,
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.020]   that is an elevation
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.500]   in parasympathetic activity
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.880]   depending on which branch
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:58.340]   you activate
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.400]   and the context matters.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.200]   So if you want
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:02.680]   to relax,
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.200]   you can rub
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:03.840]   behind your ears,
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.320]   you can rub
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.380]   inside your ears.
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.240]   If you have permission,
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:06.800]   you can do that
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:07.520]   to the person next
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.320]   to you if they like it.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:12.360]   But it's not the case
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.080]   that activating
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.000]   any branch
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:14.920]   of the vagus nerve
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.200]   is going to calm us down.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.680]   That's simply not the case.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.420]   And in a moment,
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:19.300]   I'll tell you why.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.360]   I'd like to take
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:20.920]   a quick break
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.540]   and acknowledge
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:22.220]   our sponsor,
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.060]   AG1.
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.000]   AG1 is a vitamin,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:25.420]   mineral,
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:26.300]   probiotic drink
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.160]   that also includes
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.780]   prebiotics and adaptogens.
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.140]   As somebody who's
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:30.580]   been involved
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:31.340]   in research science
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:32.300]   for almost three decades
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.260]   and in health and fitness
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.340]   for equally as long,
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:35.580]   I'm constantly looking
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:36.340]   for the best tools
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.540]   to improve my mental health,
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:38.160]   physical health,
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:38.800]   and performance.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.580]   I discovered AG1
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:41.820]   back in 2012,
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:42.960]   long before I ever
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.540]   had a podcast,
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:44.980]   and I've been taking it
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:45.820]   every day since.
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:46.880]   I find it improves
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.040]   all aspects of my health,
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:48.640]   my energy,
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.300]   my focus,
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.220]   and I simply feel
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:50.840]   much better
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:51.620]   when I take it.
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:53.460]   AG1 uses the highest
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:54.280]   quality ingredients
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.340]   in the right combinations,
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.380]   and they're constantly
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:57.400]   improving their formulas
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.080]   without increasing the cost.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:30:59.900]   In fact,
[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:00.940]   AG1 just launched
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.320]   their latest formula upgrade.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.860]   This next-gen formula
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:04.860]   is based on exciting
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:05.400]   new research
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.740]   on the effects of probiotics
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.960]   on the gut microbiome,
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.040]   and it now includes
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.060]   several clinically studied
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.000]   probiotic strains
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.040]   shown to support
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.120]   both digestive health
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.360]   and immune system health,
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.460]   as well as to improve
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:16.400]   bowel regularity
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.440]   and to reduce bloating.
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.780]   Whenever I'm asked
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:19.360]   if I could take
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.300]   just one supplement,
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:21.100]   what that supplement
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:21.580]   would be,
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.380]   I always say AG1.
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:24.940]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:25.660]   you can go to

[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.220]   For a limited time,
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.220]   AG1 is giving away
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.420]   a free one-month supply
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:32.900]   of omega-3 fish oil

[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.480]   of vitamin D3 plus K2.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.640]   As I've highlighted
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.800]   before on this podcast,
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.020]   omega-3 fish oil
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.320]   and vitamin D3 K2
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.100]   have been shown
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:41.880]   to help with everything
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.100]   from mood and brain health
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:43.940]   to heart health
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:45.140]   to healthy hormone status
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.120]   and much more.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:46.820]   Again,
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:48.740]   that's drinkag1.com
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:49.580]   slash Huberman
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:50.500]   to get a free
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.240]   one-month supply
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.360]   of omega-3 fish oil
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.320]   plus a bottle
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.240]   of vitamin D3
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:54.960]   plus K2
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:55.900]   with your subscription.
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.200]   Today's episode
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.240]   is also brought to us
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:58.840]   by Roca.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:31:59.860]   I'm excited to share
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:00.580]   that Roca and I
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:01.460]   recently teamed up
[00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:02.480]   to create a new pair
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.840]   of red lens glasses.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.440]   These red lens glasses
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.140]   are meant to be worn
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:06.680]   in the evening
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.040]   after the sun goes down.
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.060]   They filter out
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.060]   short wavelength light
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:10.960]   that comes from screens
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.020]   and from LED lights,
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.480]   which are the most common
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.540]   indoor lighting nowadays.
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:15.780]   I want to emphasize
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:16.860]   Roca red lens glasses
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:17.860]   are not traditional
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:18.600]   blue blockers.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.040]   They do filter out
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:20.520]   blue light,
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.260]   but they filter out
[00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:21.840]   a lot more
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:22.640]   than just blue light.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.060]   In fact,
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:23.840]   they filter out
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:24.620]   the full range
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.760]   of short wavelength light
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:26.620]   that suppresses
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:27.700]   the hormone melatonin.
[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:28.200]   By the way,
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.540]   you want melatonin high
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:30.080]   in the evening
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:30.560]   and at night.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.280]   It makes it easy
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.380]   to fall and stay asleep.
[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:34.240]   And those short wavelengths
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.400]   trigger increases
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.100]   in cortisol.
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.640]   Increases in cortisol
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.860]   are great in the early
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:39.480]   part of the day,
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.560]   but you do not want
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.380]   increases in cortisol
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:42.120]   in the evening
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:42.720]   and at night.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.060]   These Roca red lens glasses
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:45.200]   ensure normal,
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.080]   healthy increases
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:46.840]   in melatonin
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.140]   and that your cortisol
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.160]   levels stay low,
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:49.880]   which is, again,
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.700]   what you want
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:51.220]   in the evening
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:51.860]   and at night.
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:53.040]   In doing so,
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.340]   these Roca red lens glasses
[00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:55.660]   really help you calm down
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:56.980]   and improve your transition
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:57.680]   to sleep.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.940]   Roca red lens glasses
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:32:59.820]   also look great.
[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:00.340]   They have a ton
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:00.980]   of different frames
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:01.700]   to select from
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:02.640]   and you can wear them
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:03.220]   out to dinner
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:03.960]   or concerts
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.160]   and you can still see things.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:05.700]   I don't recommend
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.740]   you wear them while driving
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:07.820]   just for safety purposes,
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.320]   but if you're out to dinner,
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:09.940]   you're at a concert,
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:10.780]   you're at a friend's house
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:11.760]   or you're just at home,
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.320]   pop those Roca red lens glasses
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.460]   on and you'll really notice
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:15.260]   the difference in terms
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.400]   of your levels of calm
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.500]   and all the sleep stuff
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:18.320]   I mentioned earlier.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.760]   So it really is possible
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.880]   to support your biology,
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.460]   be scientific about it
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:23.640]   and remain social
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:24.640]   at the same time
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.300]   if you like.
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.860]   If you'd like to try Roca,
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.540]   go to roca.com.
[00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.440]   That's R-O-C-A.com
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.700]   and enter the code Huberman

[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:33.920]   your first order.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:34.620]   Again,
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:35.800]   that's roca.com
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.140]   and enter the code Huberman
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:37.800]   at checkout.
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:38.500]   Okay,
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.520]   so we've talked about
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.060]   all the sensory information
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.600]   coming in from behind the ear,
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.140]   from deep in the ear,
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:44.980]   from the body,
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.520]   coursing up past
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.260]   no-dose ganglion
[00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:48.920]   into the brainstem.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.820]   I told you earlier
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:51.920]   and it's still true now
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.340]   that 85%
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.560]   of the vagus nerve pathways
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.700]   are sensory in nature,
[00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:58.540]   carrying chemical
[00:33:58.540 --> 00:33:59.540]   and mechanical information.
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:00.240]   So what about
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.740]   this other 15%
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:02.600]   of the vagus nerve
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.980]   that is not carrying
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:04.860]   sensory information
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.500]   from the body,
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:07.520]   from the head
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.200]   into these brainstem nuclei?
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.460]   By the way,
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.800]   when I say brainstem nuclei,
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.440]   I don't mean nuclei
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.680]   in the context of one neuron.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:16.800]   This can be a little bit confusing,
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:17.600]   but when we hear
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.380]   about the nucleus of a neuron,
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.240]   we mean the area
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.380]   that generally contains
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:22.380]   the DNA
[00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.700]   and we're distinguishing it
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:25.420]   from the axon
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.160]   and the other parts.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:26.820]   When we hear
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:27.560]   about a nucleus
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:28.240]   in the brain,
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.640]   these neuroanatomists
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.420]   should have been more creative,
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:31.340]   but when we're hearing
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:31.940]   about a nucleus
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:32.560]   in the brain,
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.100]   it means a collection
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:35.040]   of different neurons,
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.980]   so a big group of neurons.
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:37.540]   So when I say
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:38.600]   brainstem nuclei,
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:39.700]   I mean a lot of neurons,
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:40.840]   thousands of neurons
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.160]   in little clumps there
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:43.080]   that we call nuclei.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.720]   So the vagus nerve
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:47.260]   includes different nuclei,
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.300]   different collections
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.460]   of neurons,
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:50.800]   and these neurons
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.720]   have what we call
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:52.320]   efferents,
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.980]   outputs to,
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.660]   as you might have guessed,
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:56.520]   the body,
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:58.640]   back to the various
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.600]   organs of the body.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.800]   They also have connections
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.700]   to things
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:02.960]   within the head
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.020]   and face area,
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.520]   but for the time being,
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.220]   I'm mostly going
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:06.820]   to talk about
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.560]   the motor outputs
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.520]   of the vagus nerve
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.100]   that come from
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.180]   these brainstem nuclei.
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:12.900]   So these motor outputs
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.720]   are not themselves
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.480]   paying attention
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.300]   to mechanical
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.940]   or chemical information.
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:18.640]   They are going
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:19.540]   to control
[00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:20.480]   the organs
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.100]   of the body.
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:22.880]   This is extremely
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:23.380]   important
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.120]   if you want
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:24.400]   to be able
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:24.960]   to understand
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.620]   and leverage
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:26.360]   your vagus nerve
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.120]   for health
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:27.600]   and well-being,
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.120]   mental health,
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:28.700]   physical health,
[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:29.220]   performance,
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.140]   and even
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.980]   for accelerated learning.
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.600]   I guess that would fall
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.340]   under performance
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.420]   or for recovery
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:35.280]   from different diseases.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.400]   There are really nice papers
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.180]   starting to emerge
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:38.640]   that if you can selectively
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.080]   activate these motor pathways,
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.620]   you can accelerate
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:43.080]   and increase
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:43.660]   the recovery
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:44.360]   from stroke.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.240]   So this is
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.680]   of serious significance.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.100]   But for those of us
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:48.840]   that fortunately
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.620]   don't have strokes,
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:51.180]   it's still of serious significance.
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:51.980]   And in fact,
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:52.360]   right now,
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.000]   I'm going to tell you
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.080]   about an actionable tool
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.360]   whereby you can leverage
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.500]   one of these motor pathways
[00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.240]   to a very specific
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.720]   endpoint anytime you want.
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.820]   So let's talk about
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:01.580]   how you can leverage
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:02.520]   these motor pathways
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:03.180]   of the vagus
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:04.380]   in order to what's
[00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.480]   called auto-regulate.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.660]   Auto-regulation
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:07.300]   is not just
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.260]   a fancy word
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:09.360]   for calming down.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.240]   We are going
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:10.800]   to talk about
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.660]   calming down.
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:12.860]   But auto-regulation
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:13.340]   is the way
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.480]   in which your vagus nerve
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.220]   makes sure
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.560]   that that seesaw
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.020]   of sympathetic nervous system
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.220]   to parasympathetic
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:20.260]   nervous system balance
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.520]   doesn't get tilted
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.540]   too far
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:23.680]   to the side
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.700]   of sympathetic
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:25.960]   nervous system activation.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:26.680]   That your levels
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.380]   of alertness,
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.380]   your heart rate,
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.320]   your breathing rate,
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:29.800]   et cetera,
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.480]   don't get too high.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.300]   And the reason
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.600]   it's called auto-regulation
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.180]   and not just
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:34.940]   calming down
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:36.000]   is that auto-regulation
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:36.400]   is something
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.520]   that's always happening
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.240]   in the background
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.280]   as you're going
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.360]   about your daily activities.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:40.740]   In fact,
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:41.680]   it's also happening
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:42.940]   while you sleep.
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:43.840]   In fact,
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:44.260]   now we're going
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:44.760]   to talk about
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:45.200]   things that you
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.080]   can do deliberately
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.440]   to indeed calm down,
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.000]   but to also increase
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:50.360]   the amount
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.220]   of auto-regulation
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:51.840]   that occurs
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.240]   during your entire day
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.180]   when you're not focusing
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:54.760]   on doing these
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:55.680]   particular protocols
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.260]   as well as during sleep
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:58.300]   and that will result
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:36:58.980]   in elevated
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:00.720]   what's called HRV
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.320]   or heart rate variability.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:02.900]   Now,
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:03.600]   I realize that's
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.220]   a tall order,
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.200]   but what we're going
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:05.840]   to do is we're going
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.800]   to step through this
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.100]   first by focusing
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:08.900]   on the protocol
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:09.700]   and then now
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:10.300]   that you're familiar
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:11.180]   with all the business
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.580]   about sensory and motor
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:13.320]   and parasympathetic,
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.740]   now that you have
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:15.420]   all that science
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:16.480]   and nomenclature in mind,
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.340]   it will all make
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.120]   perfect sense
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.120]   as I describe
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:19.720]   this protocol
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:20.700]   for auto-regulation
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.900]   and improving HRV
[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:23.220]   and all the protocols
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:23.760]   that follow.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:24.360]   Okay,
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:24.960]   so embedded
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.000]   in your brain
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.140]   and in your vagal nerve
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:27.700]   pathways
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.160]   and in your body,
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.100]   you have an incredible
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:31.920]   neural circuit.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.020]   This neural circuit
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:33.620]   is one that you
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:34.420]   are born with
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:35.280]   and it's one
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.140]   that you will have
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.160]   your entire life.
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.400]   This is also a pathway
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:38.820]   that you'll want
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:39.760]   to keep tuned up,
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:40.260]   that is,
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:41.140]   that you'll want
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:41.820]   to make sure
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:42.480]   is activated
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.820]   on a pretty frequent basis,
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:44.940]   super easy to do
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:45.620]   as you'll soon see,
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.240]   so that the pathway
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.820]   does not deteriorate.
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:50.480]   This is a pathway
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.600]   that originates
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.140]   in an area
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:52.620]   of your brain
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:53.840]   called the dorsolateral
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:54.800]   prefrontal cortex.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:55.100]   Now,
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:55.700]   the dorsolateral
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:56.600]   prefrontal cortex,
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.800]   and by the way,
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.680]   it's the left
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:37:59.920]   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:00.500]   in particular,
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:03.360]   sort of on the left upper
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.760]   part of the front
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.420]   of your skull.
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:06.080]   If you were
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:06.620]   to go deep
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:07.320]   to that area,
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.080]   you would be
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.200]   on the left
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.600]   dorsal top
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.940]   lateral side
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.500]   prefrontal cortex
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:14.360]   kind of toward the front
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.400]   right behind your forehead.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:15.740]   Okay,
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:16.860]   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:17.620]   sits deep
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:18.300]   to that area.
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.220]   The dorsolateral
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:20.980]   prefrontal cortex
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:21.740]   has outputs
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:22.220]   to a couple
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:23.160]   of other brain areas
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.140]   called the cingulate,
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:25.040]   called the insula.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:25.740]   You don't have to worry
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:26.360]   about those names
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:26.920]   unless you're really
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.580]   interested in them.
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:28.780]   Those areas
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:30.020]   have communication
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.320]   with one of the
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.020]   brainstem nuclei,
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:34.320]   one of those brainstem areas
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.320]   that gets input
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.240]   from the sensory
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.920]   pathways from the body,
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.920]   from the head
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.360]   of the vagus,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.040]   and that also
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.260]   contains neurons
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.960]   that have motor output
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.180]   to particular areas
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:47.820]   of your body.
[00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.240]   And that brain area,
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:49.760]   and you're going
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.260]   to love this,
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:50.760]   is called
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.220]   nucleus ambiguous.
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:53.680]   I kid you not,
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:54.260]   it's called
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:55.560]   nucleus ambiguous.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:56.820]   Nucleus ambiguous
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:58.740]  器 contains some neurons
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.000]   that project
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.500]   down to what's called
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.880]   the sinoatrial node
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:03.620]   of the heart.
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:05.360]   And those neurons
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.100]   are responsible
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.540]   for deceleration
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:08.660]   of heart rate.
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.180]   And it turns out
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:11.120]   that you can selectively
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.060]   activate those neurons
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:13.180]   in no small part
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.020]   because they receive input,
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.700]   albeit several synapses away,
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:17.940]   from the left
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:19.540]   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.140]   because the prefrontal cortex
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:21.800]   is involved
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.240]   in deliberate action,
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.280]   in planning
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.820]   and execution of action.
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:26.880]   It doesn't do it alone.
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:27.860]   It does it through communication
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:29.100]   with some other brain structures.
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.100]   But if you,
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:30.460]   for instance,
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.900]   decide that you're going
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:32.400]   to activate
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.820]   this deceleration pathway,
[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:34.820]   you can do it.
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.280]   The beautiful thing is
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:36.820]   these neurons
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:37.660]   that also control
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:39.060]   deceleration of heart rate
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.600]   are active in the background.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.120]   they're under autonomic control,
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.720]   but you can take control of them.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:44.780]   When does that happen?
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:45.200]   Well,
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.060]   for instance,
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:46.820]   in sleep,
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:47.660]   if your heart rate
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:48.640]   starts to increase,
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.620]   these decelerating neurons,
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:51.280]   which are neurons
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.200]   of the vagus nerve,
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.520]   they're motor output neurons,
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.660]   they release acetylcholine
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.600]   and they act
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.780]   on the sinoatrial node,
[00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:57.960]   which is a node
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:58.600]   within the heart
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.600]   that controls heart rate
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.540]   to slow your heart rate down.
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:02.200]   Okay?
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.040]   This is the way
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.040]   in which your heart rate
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.420]   never gets too high.
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.180]   The seesaw
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.120]   that is the autonomic
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:07.740]   nervous system
[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:09.400]   is kind of weighted
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.080]   to the sympathetic
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.120]   nervous system side.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:11.940]   A simple example
[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:12.480]   of this is
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.720]   if you have
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.460]   to stay awake,
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:16.060]   you can probably do it.
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:16.500]   At some point,
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.240]   you'll fall asleep,
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.760]   but if you really
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:19.540]   want to fall asleep,
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:20.060]   it's harder
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:20.960]   to make yourself
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:21.600]   fall asleep.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.940]   The sympathetic nervous
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:23.600]   system is one
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.460]   that we can more
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:25.320]   easily leverage
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.300]   in order to push
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:26.940]   through things,
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:27.540]   deadlines,
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:28.660]   stay up to take care
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:29.980]   of a sick relative,
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:30.400]   you know,
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.580]   push ourselves
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:32.540]   to migrate out
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:33.080]   from a dangerous
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:33.500]   place
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:34.520]   or away from a famine.
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.320]   Another example
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.080]   of a dangerous place,
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:36.360]   I guess.
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.680]   The idea here
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:38.500]   is that the sympathetic
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:39.300]   nervous system
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:40.840]   has kind of a bias
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:41.640]   towards activity.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:42.240]   And in fact,
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.000]   your heart rate
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.440]   is driven
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.060]   by the sympathetic
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:45.780]   nervous system
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:46.660]   and that heart rate
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:47.360]   would continue
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.120]   to accelerate
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.300]   unless there was
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:50.260]   this deceleration
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:51.400]   pathway that every
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:51.800]   once in a while
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:52.960]   would pump the brake
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:53.980]   on heart rate.
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:54.680]   And that's what
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:55.680]   this vagal pathway
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.400]   from nucleus ambiguous
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.620]   down to the sinoatrial
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:40:59.700]   node is doing.
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:00.860]   And by the way,
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:02.040]   this deceleration
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:02.800]   of heart rate
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.700]   that goes from
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:04.920]   the vagus motor pathway
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:06.740]   to the sinoatrial node
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:07.860]   is the basis
[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:09.620]   of what's called HRV
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:10.760]   or heart rate variability.
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.220]   We hear a lot nowadays
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.440]   about heart rate variability.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.360]   For those of you
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.060]   that have heard of it
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:15.760]   and for those of you
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.300]   that haven't,
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.140]   having a higher HRV
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:19.440]   or heart rate variability
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.460]   is a good thing, right?
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:21.880]   Normally,
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:22.400]   if you hear something
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.300]   like heart rate variability,
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.200]   sounds like a bad thing.
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.460]   Turns out it's a great thing.
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:26.500]   Heart rate variability
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:27.700]   is essentially
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:28.960]   the distance
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:29.960]   or the time rather
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.220]   between beats of the heart.
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:32.460]   So you might think
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:33.020]   that it's great
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:33.480]   to have a really
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:34.280]   consistent heart rate.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:34.680]   Boom,
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.440]   doom.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.840]   Or actually,
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:37.420]   in reality,
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:37.880]   it's more like
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:38.220]   doom,
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:38.880]   doom,
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:39.080]   doom.
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:39.820]   And I'm missing
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:41.040]   some of the beats
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:41.680]   within the waveform,
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:42.780]   but you get the idea.
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:43.620]   But actually,
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:44.680]   it's well known
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.260]   to be correlated
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:46.200]   with a number
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.520]   of positive health outcomes,
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:48.960]   including things
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:49.780]   related to brain
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:50.460]   and body
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:51.260]   and longevity
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.340]   and performance
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:53.160]   to have high
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.240]   heart rate variability.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.540]   Heart rate variability
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:57.240]   is going to lead
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:57.740]   to a pattern
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:58.260]   of heartbeats
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:41:59.120]   that is more like
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:41:59.620]   doom,
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:41:59.820]   doom,
[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:00.000]   doom,
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.540]   doom,
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:00.820]   doom,
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:01.400]   doom,
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:01.720]   doom,
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:01.760]   doom,
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:02.300]   doom,
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:02.780]   doom,
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:03.400]   doom,
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:03.680]   doom,
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:03.920]   doom,
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:04.280]   doom,
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:04.840]   doom,
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:05.380]   doom.
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:05.660]   Now,
[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:06.440]   you might say
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.600]   that's arrhythmia.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.180]   Ah, but there are cases
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:10.000]   of arrhythmia
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:10.840]   that are good
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:11.680]   and there are cases
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:12.360]   of arrhythmia
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:13.200]   that are bad.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.360]   Higher HRV in general
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.840]   is a good thing.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.280]   You want it during sleep
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.060]   and you want it
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:20.220]   during wakeful states.
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:20.980]   In sleep,
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:22.160]   heart rate variability
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:22.920]   comes about
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.400]   because this vagal pathway
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.660]   from nucleus ambiguous,
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:26.920]   so the cell bodies,
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.160]   the nuclei,
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.160]   literally the DNA
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.000]   within those nuclei
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:30.500]   of those neurons
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:31.900]   reside in nucleus ambiguous
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:32.780]   and they project
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:33.840]   to the sinoatrial node
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:35.120]   and every once in a while
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.580]   they'll just pump the brake
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:37.220]   on heart rate
[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:38.520]   and slow heart rate down
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:39.220]   and then they'll come off
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:39.600]   that brake.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:40.700]   Slow down,
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:41.680]   come off heart rate.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:42.760]   And here's the really
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:43.460]   beautiful part
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.620]   and the way that you get
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:45.500]   actionable leverage
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:46.260]   over the system.
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:49.160]   The control by the vagus nerve
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.360]   of the sinoatrial node
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.380]   and heart rate
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:52.940]   is coordinated
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:54.280]   with your breathing.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.340]   Now,
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:56.280]   as I tell you this,
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.380]   it'll make perfect sense,
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:58.420]   but I just want you
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:42:58.880]   to step back
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.460]   from it a second
[00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:00.400]   and realize that
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.020]   these systems of the body
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.940]   are so elegantly coordinated
[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:05.180]   and here's how it works
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:06.180]   with respect to heart rate
[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:06.720]   and breathing.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.700]   When you inhale air,
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:09.460]   of course,
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:10.420]   your lungs expand.
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:11.720]   You have a muscle
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.320]   that sits below your lungs
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.340]   called the diaphragm.
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.720]   As you inhale air,
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.480]   of course,
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.020]   that diaphragm moves down.
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:18.800]   Now,
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.320]   as your diaphragm moves down
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.480]   and your lungs expand,
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.300]   your heart literally
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.500]   has a bit more space
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:25.560]   in the thoracic cavity
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.520]   to expand.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.040]   Okay,
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.580]   it's not going to swell massively,
[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:30.680]   but it's going to expand.
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:31.720]   Now,
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:32.340]   as a consequence
[00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:33.200]   of that expansion,
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.460]   the blood that's moving
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:35.220]   through your heart
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:36.420]   is going to move
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:37.740]   a little bit more slowly
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:39.140]   per unit volume.
[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:40.300]   That is sensed
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:41.260]   by a particular group
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:42.320]   of neurons in your heart
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.040]   and that sends a signal
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.500]   to your sympathetic nervous system
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.620]   to speed your heart rate up.
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:49.160]   Put differently,
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:52.160]   inhaling speeds your heart rate up.
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.360]   Now,
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:54.740]   the converse is also true.
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:55.980]   When you exhale,
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:57.120]   your lungs deflate,
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:58.580]   your diaphragm moves up
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:43:59.800]   and as a consequence,
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.080]   there's slightly less space
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:01.580]   for the heart.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:02.260]   So,
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:04.260]   the heart shrinks a little bit,
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:05.500]   not a ton,
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:06.680]   but it shrinks a little bit
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.820]   and it's enough
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.360]   such that whatever blood
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:10.220]   is in the heart
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:12.320]   moves through more quickly
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.440]   per unit volume.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.160]   That faster movement
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.360]   is sensed by neurons
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:17.000]   within the heart,
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.660]   sends a signal to the brain
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.200]   and the brain activates
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:20.880]   those neurons
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.000]   within nucleus ambiguous
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.360]   and very quickly
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.100]   sends a signal
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:25.740]   to the sinoatrial node
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.780]   to slow your heart rate down.
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:29.400]   Put differently,
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.200]   exhale,
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.740]   slow your heart rate down
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:32.640]   and they do so
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.060]   by way of vagal control
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:35.540]   over the sinoatrial node.
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.780]   This is the deceleration pathway
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:38.900]   over heart rate.
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:39.660]   So,
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:40.100]   as I mentioned,
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:40.660]   this is happening
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:41.940]   all the time during sleep.
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.520]   You don't have to be consciously aware
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:44.220]   for this to happen.
[00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:46.360]   It's a fortunate consequence of nature
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:47.800]   that the neurons
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:48.580]   within your brainstem
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:49.440]   that control breathing
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.140]   and the neurons
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:50.920]   within your brainstem
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:51.840]   that control heart rate
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.060]   and the other neurons
[00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:54.140]   within the heart itself
[00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:54.960]   that control heart rate,
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:55.960]   the pacemaker cells,
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.300]   all can function
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.580]   without you having to think about it.
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:44:59.620]   That's a wonderful thing
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:00.580]   for obvious reasons.
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:01.980]   It's also the case
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:02.640]   that because
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.020]   we have this input
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:04.740]   from the left
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:06.340]   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:07.320]   down through a couple
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:07.940]   of other structures
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:08.660]   like the cingulate
[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:09.300]   and the insula
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:10.620]   and that converge
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:11.520]   on nucleus ambiguous.
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:12.880]   If you decide
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.400]   to slow your heart rate down,
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.440]   you can do it
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.620]   and you do so
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:18.940]   by doing a deliberate exhale
[00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:20.260]   and or
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:21.600]   by increasing
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:22.540]   the intensity
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:23.500]   or the duration
[00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:24.620]   of your exhale.
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:24.980]   So,
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:26.040]   you can do that right now.
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.420]   If you want to slow
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:28.360]   your heart rate down,
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:28.940]   that is,
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:30.080]   if you want to increase
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.780]   parasympathetic nervous system activity
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:33.380]   and you want to calm down fast,
[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:34.700]   you can literally just
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:39.500]   exhales slow your heart rate down
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:41.940]   and exhales tilt that seesaw
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.360]   that is the autonomic nervous system
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.960]   more toward the parasympathetic side.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:46.680]   Now,
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:47.860]   I've talked before on this podcast
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:49.160]   and all over social media
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.420]   about the so-called physiological sigh,
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:53.080]   a naturally occurring form of breathing
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.320]   that occurs in sleep
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:55.500]   and that we can deliberately do
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.340]   anytime we want to calm down fast.
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:59.400]   And the physiological sigh consists of,
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.180]   as many of you know,
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:02.240]   two inhales through the nose
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:03.980]   followed by a long
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:05.540]   to lungs empty exhale
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:06.240]   through the mouth.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:06.880]   Typically,
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.540]   the first inhale is longer.
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:08.860]   Again,
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:09.640]   it's done through the nose.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:10.860]   The second inhale is shorter,
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:12.120]   kind of a sharp inhale
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.840]   to make sure you maximally inflate
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:14.620]   all the little sacks
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:15.260]   within your lungs.
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:16.300]   And then the exhale
[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:17.180]   is a long,
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:18.160]   slow exhale
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.740]   that dumps all your air.
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:22.100]   I'll just demonstrate
[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:23.360]   the physiological sigh for you
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:23.840]   for those of you
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:24.520]   that haven't seen it.
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:25.860]   You, again,
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:27.800]   big inhale through the nose,
[00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:28.900]   second sharp inhale
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:29.420]   through the nose
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:29.760]   to make sure
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.100]   you maximally inflate the lungs
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:32.340]   and then long exhale
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.460]   to lungs empty.
[00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:34.300]   It goes like this.
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:51.180]   Okay.
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:52.100]   Lungs are empty.
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:53.880]   That is indeed
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:54.980]   the fastest way
[00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:55.760]   to activate
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.240]   the parasympathetic nervous system
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:59.020]   and to tilt that seesaw
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:46:59.840]   from levels
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.240]   of high sympathetic
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.400]   nervous system activation
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.660]   to lower levels
[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:04.140]   of sympathetic
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:05.260]   nervous system activation.
[00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:05.580]   In fact,
[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:07.060]   I immediately feel calmer.
[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:08.100]   Maybe you can even hear it
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:08.600]   in my voice.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:09.260]   So when you do
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:10.300]   a physiological effect,
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:10.900]   you're getting both
[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:12.220]   a chemical signal
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:13.160]   into the brain.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:14.260]   That is the adjustment
[00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:15.420]   of that carbon dioxide
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.320]   oxygen ratio.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.600]   It's mainly due
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:18.660]   to the offloading
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:19.480]   of carbon dioxide.
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:21.360]   That lower level
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:21.980]   of carbon dioxide
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:22.600]   is registered
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:23.140]   by the brain
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:23.800]   very quickly
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:24.620]   and leads
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:25.260]   to an increase
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:25.800]   in calm.
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:26.680]   The deceleration
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:27.480]   of heart rate
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:28.660]   driven by the exhale
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:29.960]   is also registered
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:30.440]   by the brain
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:30.980]   very quickly,
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:32.180]   leads to an increase
[00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:32.780]   in calm.
[00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:33.800]   When you just
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:35.040]   emphasize an exhale,
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.380]   meaning you extend it
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:36.900]   or you make it
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:37.540]   more intense
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:38.520]   and you don't do
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:39.620]   the two inhales first,
[00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:40.620]   that is you don't
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:41.860]   do the physiological sigh,
[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:42.700]   well,
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:44.200]   you get the mechanical signal
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:44.800]   but you don't get
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.720]   the chemical signal,
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:46.840]   at least not to the same
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:47.340]   degree you do
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:48.520]   with the physiological sigh.
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:49.640]   Put simply,
[00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:50.580]   if you want
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:51.660]   to calm down fast,
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:52.980]   ideally you do
[00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:54.240]   the physiological sigh.
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:54.880]   However,
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:55.460]   it turns out
[00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:56.360]   that one of the best ways
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.520]   to improve your HRV,
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:58.800]   both in sleep
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:47:59.920]   and in wakeful states,
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:00.880]   which takes
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:01.940]   a very minimum
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:02.480]   of effort
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:03.320]   and is rarely
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:04.200]   if ever discussed,
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.240]   is simply
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:06.160]   throughout the day,
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.420]   I would say 10,
[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:07.840]   15,
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:08.780]   maybe even 20 times
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:09.180]   per day,
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:10.520]   anytime it occurs
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:10.900]   to you
[00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:12.160]   to just deliberately
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.200]   extend your exhale,
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.120]   that is to pump
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:14.520]   the brake
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.320]   on your heart rate
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:16.460]   through the vagus nerve
[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:16.780]   pathway
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:17.600]   that I've been describing,
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:17.940]   just
[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:20.560]   just exhale,
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:22.120]   slow your heart rate down
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:22.700]   and then get
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:23.700]   about your normal routine.
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:24.640]   You can do that
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:25.560]   essentially anytime
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.460]   you remember to.
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:27.680]   This is literally
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:28.580]   going to increase
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:29.280]   your HRV.
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:30.060]   You now know
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:30.540]   the mechanism
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:31.540]   by which it does that
[00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:32.660]   and get this,
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:33.960]   it will also increase
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:34.620]   your HRV
[00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:35.880]   in sleep at night
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:36.720]   and the reason
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:37.720]   is this pathway
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:38.700]   that originates
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:39.180]   with the left
[00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:39.760]   dorsolateral
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.700]   prefrontal cortex
[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:41.520]   and goes down
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.280]   to nucleus ambiguous
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:42.900]   and then to the
[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:43.680]   sinoatrial node
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:44.120]   of the heart
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:44.840]   because it's
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:45.860]   under conscious control
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:47.940]   and because
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:48.660]   it's subject
[00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:49.280]   to what we call
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.060]   plasticity,
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:50.900]   to strengthening
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:52.200]   and to weakening.
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:52.800]   That is,
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:53.720]   if you use it
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:54.600]   deliberately,
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.460]   it gets strengthened.
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:56.540]   If you don't use it
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:56.880]   deliberately,
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:57.780]   it gets weakened.
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.080]   Well,
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.200]   that's a great thing
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:00.800]   because it means
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:01.340]   that if you just
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:02.240]   simply remember
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.180]   to do some
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:04.000]   extended exhales
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:04.740]   throughout the day,
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:05.920]   you're going
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:06.500]   to strengthen
[00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:07.120]   this pathway
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:07.820]   such that it
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:08.500]   operates in the
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:08.940]   background
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:10.080]   through auto-regulation
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.120]   without you ever
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:11.900]   having to think
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:12.320]   about it.
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:12.840]   Now,
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:13.100]   of course,
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:14.220]   that effect wears off
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:14.780]   over time
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:15.520]   if you don't
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.280]   occasionally remember
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:16.780]   to just do
[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:18.620]   some longer exhales.
[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:19.560]   But this is a
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:20.340]   wonderful protocol
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:20.940]   in my opinion
[00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:22.660]   because it capitalizes
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.540]   on an inborn circuit,
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:24.920]   right?
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:25.500]   A circuit that you
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:26.160]   were born with
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.560]   that is already
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:28.140]   installed
[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.120]   that you can use
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:29.780]   at any point.
[00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:30.340]   It doesn't take
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:31.020]   any learning
[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:31.760]   but that if you
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:32.320]   just ping
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:33.180]   every once in a while
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:34.060]   with some extended
[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:35.120]   exhales throughout the day,
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:35.860]   it takes essentially
[00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:36.580]   no time.
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.220]   You get the benefit
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:38.000]   of feeling a little bit
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:38.320]   calmer,
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:39.220]   slowing your heart rate down
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:40.120]   and your HRV
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:40.760]   which is correlated
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:41.620]   with a host
[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:42.380]   of positive health
[00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:42.780]   outcomes
[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:43.740]   in the short
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:44.640]   and long term
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:45.760]   will increase.
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.000]   Two interesting things
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:47.820]   everyone should be aware
[00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:48.580]   of is that
[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:49.700]   as we age,
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:50.360]   of course,
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:50.900]   a number of things
[00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:51.240]   happen,
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.260]   memory gets
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.320]   slightly to much
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:53.680]   poorer,
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.220]   all right?
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:54.540]   There are ways
[00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:55.280]   to offset that.
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:57.300]   Heart rate variability
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.660]   gets much worse.
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:49:59.760]   Now,
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.880]   an interesting finding
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.040]   from Nolan Williams'
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:02.740]   lab at Stanford
[00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:03.840]   is that if you
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:04.500]   activate
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:05.680]   dorsolateral prefrontal
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:06.020]   cortex
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:07.440]   using what's called
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:08.440]   transcranial magnetic
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:09.020]   stimulation,
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.020]   this is a procedure
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:10.500]   where you take
[00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:11.180]   a stimulator
[00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:12.940]   and you non-invasively
[00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:14.240]   place it on the skull
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.840]   outside and just above
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:17.140]   dorsolateral prefrontal
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:17.400]   cortex
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.280]   and you stimulate
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.100]   through the skull
[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:20.120]   dorsolateral prefrontal
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:20.480]   cortex,
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.200]   you observe,
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.660]   as you would expect,
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:24.380]   a deceleration
[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:25.140]   of heart rate
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:26.160]   and it's known
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:26.780]   to be carried
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:27.660]   through this vagal
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:28.400]   pathway to the
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.280]   sinoatrial node.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.420]   Even after the
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:32.500]   stimulation is removed,
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:34.100]   you find that
[00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:34.920]   heart rate variability
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:36.220]   increases because
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:36.880]   this pathway
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.100]   has been stimulated
[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:40.060]   into neuroplasticity.
[00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:40.980]   It's strengthened.
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:41.900]   The other way
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:42.260]   to strengthen
[00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:42.840]   this pathway
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:43.660]   is to do exactly
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:44.460]   what I just described,
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:45.220]   to deliberately
[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:46.320]   engage this long
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:47.200]   exhale mechanism
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.220]   various times
[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:48.860]   throughout the day.
[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:49.340]   Now,
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:50.040]   if you miss a day,
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:50.560]   is the pathway
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:51.220]   going to atrophy?
[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:51.760]   No.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.320]   If you do it 50 times a day,
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.140]   is it going to strengthen
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:54.980]   more than if you do it
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:55.700]   one time per day?
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:56.260]   Yes.
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:56.900]   Do we know
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:57.960]   the exact thresholds
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:58.880]   of how many times per day
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:50:59.400]   you should be doing
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.260]   these deliberate exhales
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:01.060]   in order to keep
[00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:01.940]   this pathway robust?
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:02.580]   No.
[00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:03.120]   Unfortunately,
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:04.080]   we do not.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:04.800]   However,
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.020]   we do know
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.280]   that in human patients
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.700]   that suffer atrophy
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:09.460]   of the dorsolateral
[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:10.380]   prefrontal cortex
[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:11.200]   that's associated
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:12.100]   with normal aging
[00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:13.980]   or with accelerated
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:15.300]   atrophy of dorsolateral
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:16.020]   prefrontal cortex
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:17.340]   or lesions of dorsolateral
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:18.140]   prefrontal cortex
[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:18.980]   that tend to occur
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:20.080]   in older people
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:20.840]   who get strokes
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:22.340]   or just associated
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:23.620]   with the normal aging process,
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:25.000]   heart rate variability
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.860]   declines with age.
[00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:28.360]   And it is now thought
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.800]   that heart rate variability
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:30.900]   declines with age,
[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:31.480]   of course,
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:32.120]   in part through
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:32.700]   lower levels
[00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:33.640]   of physical activity
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:34.340]   because there are,
[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:34.700]   of course,
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:35.300]   certain forms
[00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:36.160]   of physical activity
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.400]   like high intensity
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:38.280]   interval training
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:39.660]   to keep that
[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:40.640]   heart rate variability
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.720]   elevated over time
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:42.620]   using exercise.
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:44.340]   But it's also true
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:45.820]   that if this pathway
[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:46.520]   degenerates,
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:47.300]   you see a decrease
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:48.180]   in heart rate variability.
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:48.880]   If you keep
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:50.180]   this pathway engaged
[00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.220]   by behaviorally,
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:51.840]   deliberately
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:53.500]   doing these long exhales
[00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:54.820]   or if you take
[00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:55.860]   the more robust approach
[00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:56.940]   of transcranial magnetic
[00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:57.440]   stimulation,
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.500]   something that most people
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:51:59.320]   unfortunately won't have
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:00.460]   the opportunity to do,
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:01.500]   although maybe in the future
[00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:02.060]   there will be
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:02.720]   commercial devices
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:03.340]   that will allow us
[00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:03.780]   to do this,
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:05.260]   you can keep
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:06.140]   heart rate variability
[00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:08.200]   higher as you age,
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:08.880]   which,
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:09.980]   as I mentioned before,
[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:10.540]   is correlated
[00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:11.460]   with a number
[00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:11.860]   of different
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:12.960]   positive health outcomes.
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.220]   So these pathways
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:15.220]   by which we can tap
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:16.860]   into deliberate activation
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:18.280]   of this vagal control
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.780]   over the sinoatrial node
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:21.480]   are not just incidental.
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.160]   They turn out
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:22.700]   to be central
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:23.820]   to the aging process.
[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:24.700]   They turn out
[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:25.460]   to be central
[00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:26.300]   to countering
[00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:27.120]   the aging process.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.300]   And you now know
[00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:29.240]   you have some agency
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:29.880]   and control
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:30.580]   over them.
[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.000]   So earlier I was
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:32.940]   talking about how
[00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:33.940]   despite the fact
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:34.560]   the vagus nerve
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:35.180]   is classified
[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:36.980]   as a parasympathetic nerve,
[00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:38.800]   that it also
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.400]   can be alerting.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.560]   It can increase
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:42.520]   levels of sympathetic
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:43.680]   nervous system activity.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:44.840]   And that runs
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:46.020]   counter to the concept
[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:47.280]   of parasympathetic,
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.600]   which is always
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.080]   labeled as rest
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:50.520]   and digest.
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:52.480]   I'm now going
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:52.840]   to tell you
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:53.920]   a tool that you can use
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:54.940]   when you're feeling
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:56.180]   less than energized,
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:57.720]   less than motivated,
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:59.700]   and when you need
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:00.200]   to exercise
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.120]   and you don't feel
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:01.900]   like doing it.
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:03.220]   And when you want
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:04.400]   to leverage exercise
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.120]   as a way to improve
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:06.880]   brain function
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:07.840]   and plasticity.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:09.740]   It all involves
[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:10.460]   the vagus nerve
[00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:11.540]   and it involves
[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:12.740]   an aspect of the vagus nerve
[00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:14.200]   that very few people
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:14.820]   are aware of,
[00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:15.860]   but in my opinion
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:17.460]   is one of the coolest
[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:18.820]   aspects of the vagus nerve.
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:20.300]   It's at least as cool
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:21.420]   as vagal control
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:22.580]   over heart rate variability
[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:23.620]   and auto-regulation.
[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:25.240]   And it goes like this.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:27.400]   There's a beautiful
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:28.180]   set of findings
[00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:29.320]   from a guy named
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:30.060]   Peter Strick
[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:30.720]   at the University
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:31.200]   of Pittsburgh
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.300]   who used these
[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:33.080]   really cool methods
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:34.240]   for tracing connections
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:34.920]   between the brain
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:35.380]   and body
[00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:36.800]   to ask the question,
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:38.620]   what areas of the brain
[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:39.560]   are communicating
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.080]   with our adrenal glands?
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.440]   Our adrenal glands
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:43.160]   are two glands
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:44.120]   that sit atop
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.200]   your two different kidneys.
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:45.960]   So one atop
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:46.540]   each kidney
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:47.740]   and release
[00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:48.580]   as the name suggests.
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:49.800]   Adrenaline.
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:50.700]   Adrenaline is also
[00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:51.660]   called epinephrine.
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:52.840]   Your adrenal glands
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:54.020]   also release cortisol.
[00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:55.420]   But for sake
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:56.040]   of this discussion,
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:56.620]   let's just think
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:57.420]   about adrenaline
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:58.760]   released from your adrenals.
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:00.660]   What he found
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:01.660]   through a bunch
[00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:02.220]   of experiments
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:03.520]   done in non-human primates
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:04.320]   and that seem
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:05.320]   to correspond very well
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.080]   to what we observe
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:07.100]   in humans as well
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:08.320]   is that there are
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:09.420]   three general groups
[00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:10.260]   of brain areas.
[00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:12.380]   Motor activation areas,
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:12.860]   so what we call
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:13.860]   upper motor neurons.
[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:14.960]   So these are the neurons
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:15.440]   in the brain
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:15.880]   that control
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:16.760]   the lower motor neurons
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:17.480]   in the spinal cord
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:17.900]   that control
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:18.960]   the muscles of the body
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.780]   as well as neurons
[00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:21.480]   within our brain
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:21.960]   that are involved
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:22.600]   in cognition
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:23.380]   and planning
[00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:24.940]   and areas of the brain
[00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:25.460]   that are involved
[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:26.080]   in emotion
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.920]   that can communicate
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:28.780]   with the adrenals
[00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:29.620]   and cause them
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:30.760]   to release adrenaline.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:32.380]   Now that's great,
[00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:33.140]   but it sort of points
[00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:34.080]   to a pathway whereby,
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:35.080]   okay,
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:37.140]   you know you should exercise,
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:37.840]   you tell yourself
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:38.800]   you should exercise,
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:40.020]   you're emotional about it
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:41.420]   and your adrenals
[00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:42.120]   release adrenaline
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:43.280]   and you exercise.
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.100]   Now that's interesting,
[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:46.260]   but what's perhaps
[00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:47.480]   far more interesting
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:49.840]   is that the data
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:50.700]   from Strick Lab
[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:51.740]   and other labs as well
[00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:53.000]   shows that
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.180]   when we move
[00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:55.000]   the large muscles
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:55.820]   of our body,
[00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:57.380]   the adrenals
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:58.300]   release adrenaline,
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:54:59.280]   epinephrine.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:01.020]   Now epinephrine
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:02.340]   has an activating
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:04.100]   sympathetic nervous system
[00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:05.220]   stimulatory effect,
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:05.420]   right?
[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:06.040]   It tends to make
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.300]   the tissues of the body
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:07.940]   that are associated
[00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:08.660]   with movement
[00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:09.600]   and with so-called
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:10.400]   fight or flight,
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:11.500]   although again,
[00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:11.940]   fight or flight
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:13.200]   is kind of an extreme example.
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:15.700]   It tends to activate
[00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:16.820]   the organs of the body
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:18.180]   and make them more likely
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:18.960]   to be active.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:20.640]   It increases the probability
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:21.920]   that movement will occur,
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:23.680]   overall body movement.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:25.160]   So when we move
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:25.820]   the large muscles
[00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:26.340]   of our body,
[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:26.860]   our legs
[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:27.400]   and in particular
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.220]   our trunk muscles,
[00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:29.580]   we release adrenaline.
[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:31.880]   That adrenaline activates
[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:32.900]   the organs of our body
[00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:34.660]   and further makes it likely
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:35.600]   that we're going to move
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:36.660]   our musculature more
[00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:38.280]   but get this,
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:39.780]   adrenaline, epinephrine
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:40.580]   doesn't cross
[00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:41.520]   the blood-brain barrier.
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:43.380]   So how does it increase
[00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:44.260]   our level of alertness
[00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:45.500]   in our brain, right?
[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:46.240]   You don't want your body
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:47.080]   to be super active
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:47.500]   and your brain
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:48.300]   to be kind of sleepy.
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:49.440]   That's not good.
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:50.580]   That's not adaptive.
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:51.980]   It turns out
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:53.700]   that when the adrenals
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:54.500]   release adrenaline,
[00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.160]   it binds to receptors
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:58.120]   on the vagus nerve itself,
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:59.960]   those sensory axons
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.200]   that extend into the body.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:02.340]   There are receptors
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:03.880]   on those wires, right?
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:04.560]   Not all the receptors
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:05.220]   are at one end
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:05.640]   or the other.
[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:07.340]   They're also on those axons.
[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:09.200]   The adrenaline binds
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:09.680]   to the receptors
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:10.540]   on those axons
[00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:11.920]   and the vagus nerve
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:15.160]   in turn releases glutamate,
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:16.980]   an excitatory neurotransmitter
[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:18.260]   in a structure in the brain
[00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:20.980]   called the nucleus tractus solitaris.
[00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:21.880]   The neurons in what
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:22.580]   I'm just going to call
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:23.820]   the NTS for simplicity
[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:26.860]   in turn activate neurons
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:27.720]   in a brain structure
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:29.480]   called the locus coeruleus.
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:31.080]   The locus coeruleus
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:31.840]   contains neurons
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:32.360]   that release
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:32.360]   that release
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:32.780]   what's called
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:33.860]   norepinephrine
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:35.480]   and the neurons
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:36.380]   of locus coeruleus
[00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:37.440]   send their axons
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:38.500]   out very extensively
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:39.440]   across the brain
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:41.100]   in kind of a sprinkler system
[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:42.000]   like organization
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.280]   such that
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:44.440]   when you move
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:45.320]   the large musculature
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:45.980]   of your body,
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:47.260]   you release adrenaline.
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:49.160]   That adrenaline activates
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.120]   the tissues of your body,
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.380]   makes them more likely to move,
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:52.640]   also binds to receptors
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:53.360]   on the vagus.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.460]   The vagus nerve
[00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:55.920]   in turn releases glutamate,
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:57.420]   an excitatory neurotransmitter
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:58.180]   in the NTS.
[00:56:58.180 --> 00:56:59.120]   The NTS
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:00.660]   then passes off
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:01.620]   that excitatory signal
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:02.680]   like a bucket brigade
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:04.560]   off to the locus coeruleus.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:05.640]   The locus coeruleus
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:06.580]   dumps a bunch
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:07.400]   of norepinephrine
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.220]   into the brain
[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:08.880]   and increases
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:10.140]   your levels of alertness.
[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:11.440]   What this means
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:12.720]   is that the vagus nerve
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:13.700]   is central
[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:14.440]   to the process
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:15.980]   of using physical activity
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:17.540]   to make your brain
[00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:18.380]   more alert.
[00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:18.960]   And we know
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:19.640]   that activation
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:20.720]   of locus coeruleus
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:22.500]   makes the brain areas
[00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:23.440]   that are involved
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:24.120]   in motivation
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:25.200]   and the propensity
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:26.240]   to move more
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:28.440]   higher in levels
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:29.020]   of activity.
[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:29.680]   In other words,
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:30.580]   if you're not feeling
[00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:31.960]   motivated to exercise
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:33.340]   or you're not feeling
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:34.080]   alert enough,
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:35.720]   movement of the body
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:36.260]   that includes
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:37.200]   especially the legs,
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:37.880]   the large muscles
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:38.440]   of the legs,
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.120]   the quadriceps,
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:39.540]   hamstrings,
[00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:40.000]   et cetera,
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.240]   as well as the trunk
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:42.100]   muscles of the body
[00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:43.900]   stimulate this pathway
[00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:44.500]   in a kind of
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:45.940]   dominoing effect
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:46.900]   that makes
[00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:47.960]   the likelihood
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:49.500]   and believe it or not
[00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:50.840]   the desire to move
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.480]   much more likely.
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:54.360]   This I've personally
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:55.680]   found to be an immensely
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.640]   useful piece of information
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.140]   because sure,
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:00.340]   I knew that sometimes
[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:01.320]   I would go to the gym
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:02.580]   or I'd head out on a run
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:03.260]   and I wasn't feeling
[00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:03.760]   motivated
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:05.220]   or I'd sit down
[00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:05.760]   to do some work
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.800]   and I'd feel kind of sleepy
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:07.560]   despite the fact
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:08.340]   that I'd slept pretty well
[00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:08.920]   the night before
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:10.040]   and eaten just fine
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:10.380]   and the room
[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:11.080]   wasn't too warm,
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:11.520]   et cetera.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:13.140]   And I feel kind of lethargic
[00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:13.540]   and I was like,
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:14.400]   what's going on here?
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.580]   And yes,
[00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:17.560]   I had the experience
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:18.220]   of sometimes,
[00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:18.580]   you know,
[00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:19.840]   doing a bit of a warmup,
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:21.180]   maybe some light calisthenics,
[00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:22.640]   maybe a few warmup sets
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:23.720]   or jogging for a little while
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:24.160]   and then finding
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:24.680]   that my levels
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:25.700]   of alertness increased.
[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:27.140]   But I've also had
[00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:27.800]   just as often
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:28.480]   the experience
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.140]   of not feeling
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:31.160]   that motivation
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.540]   for physical activity
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:34.200]   or for cognitive activity
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:34.880]   come online,
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:35.880]   especially if I wasn't
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:36.740]   extremely interested
[00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:37.560]   in that activity
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:38.680]   or that thing
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:39.200]   that I was supposed
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:39.640]   to learn.
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:40.040]   You know,
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:40.620]   it's very easy
[00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:41.400]   to be excited
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.020]   when we want
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:42.700]   to do the activity
[00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:43.620]   or we want to learn
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:43.860]   the thing
[00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:44.300]   that we're supposed
[00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:45.140]   to be learning
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:45.840]   at a given moment
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:46.220]   or reading
[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:46.960]   at a given moment.
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.080]   This pathway
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:49.580]   is immensely useful
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:50.320]   to understand
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:51.140]   because it explains
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:51.780]   why it is
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:52.560]   that even when
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:53.180]   you're not feeling
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:53.640]   motivated,
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:54.820]   if you do some activity
[00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:55.660]   that, yes,
[00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:56.560]   is preceded
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:57.580]   by a bit of a warmup,
[00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:57.960]   so maybe,
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:58.360]   I don't know,
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:58:59.500]   you do some light calisthenics
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:00.220]   or you go on the treadmill
[00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:00.900]   for a few minutes,
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:01.300]   walking,
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:02.280]   then maybe a little bit faster,
[00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:03.860]   that it can increase
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:04.280]   your levels
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:04.900]   of alertness
[00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:05.500]   and motivation.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:08.260]   but it especially
[00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:08.980]   explains how
[00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:10.100]   if you put
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:10.860]   in some effort
[00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:11.720]   that at the moment
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:12.420]   feels like
[00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:13.440]   a big exertion,
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:15.480]   your entire body
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:16.240]   and brain state
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:17.520]   shifts in a way
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:17.980]   that levels
[00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:18.560]   of motivation
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:19.400]   and energy
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:20.940]   to do more physical work
[00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:22.220]   or more cognitive work
[00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:22.760]   or both
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:24.360]   increases dramatically
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:25.180]   and these are not
[00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:25.780]   small effects
[00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:26.540]   when they've been measured.
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:27.380]   In fact,
[00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:28.940]   for all the talk
[00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:29.580]   that's out there
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:30.800]   in kind of pop psychology
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:33.040]   and in kind of pop neuroscience
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.820]   about the vagus
[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:36.060]   being a calming path
[00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:36.280]   pathway.
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:38.840]   All the neurophysiologists
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:39.340]   out there
[00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:39.660]   and I know
[00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:40.440]   there aren't very many
[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:41.320]   but I'm friends
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:41.660]   with a lot
[00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:42.560]   of neurophysiologists,
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:44.160]   they'll all tell you
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:45.240]   that if they're doing
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:45.740]   a surgery
[00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:47.020]   or they're doing
[00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:48.040]   some sort of brain recording
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:49.700]   and the animal
[00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:50.100]   or person
[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:50.540]   that they're doing
[00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:51.160]   the brain recording
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:52.220]   from is starting
[00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:53.880]   to drop into a state
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:55.680]   of deep parasympathetic
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:56.120]   activity,
[00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:57.120]   they're falling asleep
[00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:57.580]   or they need
[00:59:57.580 --> 00:59:58.240]   to be more alert,
[00:59:58.240 --> 00:59:59.060]   what do they do?
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:00.680]   They stimulate the vagus.
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.260]   They stimulate the vagus nerve
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:03.240]   in order to wake up
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:03.620]   the brain.
[01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:04.000]   In fact,
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.080]   stimulating the vagus
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:05.800]   has been used
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:06.940]   to save people's lives
[01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:07.900]   when they are drifting
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:08.840]   too far down
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.180]   into deeper
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:10.920]   and deeper planes
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:11.620]   of anesthesia.
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:13.580]   So stimulating the vagus
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:14.840]   wakes up the brain
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:15.620]   and the way
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:16.560]   to stimulate the vagus
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.260]   is by way
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:18.080]   of these receptors
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.400]   on the vagus nerve itself
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:19.860]   and the way
[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:20.340]   to do that
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:21.320]   without an electrical
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.300]   stimulator, right?
[01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:22.820]   Because we're not talking
[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:23.880]   about clinical conditions here
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.340]   in order to increase levels
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:26.240]   of motivation,
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:26.920]   alertness,
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:27.400]   and focus
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.400]   for physical activity
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.460]   or cognitive activity
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:29.960]   and learning,
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:30.400]   et cetera,
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:31.920]   or simply to overcome
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.180]   lethargy and brain fog
[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:34.640]   is to do some sort
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.400]   of physical activity
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:35.900]   that includes
[01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:36.860]   the large musculature
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:37.340]   of your body.
[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:38.380]   These could be things
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:39.380]   like jumping.
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:40.480]   These could be things
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:42.400]   like actual resistance training.
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.340]   This could be running.
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.880]   This information really points
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:46.820]   to the idea of,
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:47.660]   of course,
[01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:48.600]   after a good warmup,
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:51.280]   doing more sprinting type activity,
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.520]   more strength type activity,
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:54.040]   you know,
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:54.980]   six repetitions
[01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:55.580]   or less
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:56.020]   where you're getting
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:56.720]   close to failure,
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:57.360]   this sort of thing
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.420]   to wake up the brain
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:00:58.840]   and body
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.120]   as opposed to doing
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.920]   long rhythmic activity
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.100]   that's below the threshold
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.060]   of what would activate
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:04.840]   a lot of adrenaline
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:05.740]   from the adrenals.
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:06.540]   So the idea
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:07.500]   is to get those adrenals
[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.480]   to release adrenaline
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:09.240]   into your system.
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:09.980]   It won't cross
[01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:10.740]   the blood-brain barrier
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:11.880]   but your vagus nerve
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.500]   provides this beautiful link
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:14.520]   between the body
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:14.840]   and brain
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:15.860]   to match levels
[01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:16.600]   of excitation
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.740]   from the body
[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:18.360]   to the brain
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.660]   and you can leverage that.
[01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:20.460]   In addition,
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:21.920]   there's also
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.120]   the well-described effects
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:23.480]   and I've done
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.200]   an entire episode
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:24.800]   about this
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.420]   of how exercise
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:28.060]   can improve brain plasticity
[01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:29.240]   and the ability to learn
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.320]   and while there are
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.260]   a host of mechanisms
[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:32.620]   involving long-term changes
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:33.240]   in things like
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.920]   brain-derived nootrophic factor
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.880]   and increases in lactate
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:37.760]   which might open the door
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:38.520]   to plasticity
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.580]   and so on and so forth,
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:40.840]   it does seem
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:43.400]   that one of the major ways
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.780]   that exercise improves
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:45.680]   our brain function
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:46.960]   and our ability to learn
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.760]   is simply by increasing
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.180]   our levels of alertness
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:50.900]   and I should say
[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:51.820]   the word simply
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:52.680]   placed in there
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.140]   is probably a bit unfair.
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:55.280]   There is absolutely
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.000]   nothing trivial
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.240]   about using exercise
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.220]   as a way to stimulate
[01:01:58.220 --> 01:01:59.320]   a sort of cascade
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:00.500]   of this neural circuit
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:01.220]   from the adrenals
[01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:01.840]   up the vagus
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.080]   and into locus coeruleus
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.620]   in order to wake up
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:05.380]   your brain networks
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:05.940]   that are involved
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:06.560]   in motivation,
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:07.800]   focus and learning.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.200]   As we'll talk about
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:09.780]   in a few minutes,
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:10.560]   many of us,
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.740]   most of us perhaps
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:13.000]   are used to using
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:13.780]   pharmacology
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:14.460]   like caffeine
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:15.280]   or other stimulants
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.100]   in order to try
[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:16.820]   and wake up levels
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:17.680]   of alertness in the brain
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:18.320]   and I'm not being
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:19.180]   disparaging of that.
[01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:20.900]   I am an avid consumer
[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:21.540]   of caffeine
[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:22.600]   in the form of yerba mate
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.400]   or coffee.
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:24.120]   I'll occasionally
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.880]   take an alpha GPC
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:27.040]   or an L-tyrosine
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:27.500]   as well.
[01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:27.700]   You know,
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:28.780]   I do all those things.
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:29.180]   However,
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:29.980]   in my opinion,
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:31.600]   it's far more powerful
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.720]   to be able to leverage,
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.080]   that is,
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:34.540]   to activate these levels
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:35.020]   of alertness
[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:35.520]   in your brain
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:35.980]   and body
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:36.580]   in a way
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:37.460]   that doesn't require
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:38.280]   any pharmacology
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:38.760]   if you don't have
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:39.560]   it available to you
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:40.000]   or you're trying
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.040]   to avoid pharmacology
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:41.620]   or working out
[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:42.180]   late at night
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:42.960]   or you want to focus
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:43.620]   later at night
[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:44.740]   and you don't want
[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:45.620]   to be kept awake
[01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:46.300]   by the caffeine
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:47.520]   or even if you consume
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:47.860]   caffeine
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:48.720]   or other stimulants.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.260]   Knowing the organization
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:51.240]   of these neural circuits
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:51.760]   from the body
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:52.220]   to the brain
[01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:52.840]   and how they match
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:53.620]   levels of alertness
[01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:54.820]   and leveraging them
[01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:56.100]   is so straightforward
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:57.260]   but most people
[01:02:57.260 --> 01:02:58.280]   don't actually get
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:02:58.760]   to the point
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:02:59.440]   where they're doing
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.580]   that high intensity work
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:01.800]   or they're doing
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:02.580]   the work that involves
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:03.360]   the large musculature
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:03.800]   of their body
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:04.420]   when they're feeling
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:05.520]   not motivated.
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:06.080]   In fact,
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:06.600]   they usually do
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:07.400]   the opposite thing.
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:07.620]   Now,
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:08.720]   sometimes you need rest days.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:09.660]   This is true, right?
[01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:10.220]   You need to rest
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:10.600]   and recover
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.320]   to make progress.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.020]   You don't want
[01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:12.660]   to exhaust yourself.
[01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:13.480]   You need to get sleep.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.180]   You need to take care
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:14.600]   of yourself.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.440]   However,
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.240]   the reason we're talking
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:16.640]   about this
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.600]   is it's a beautiful
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.120]   opportunity
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.100]   to A,
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:21.140]   explain that the vagus nerve
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:22.140]   is not just about
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:22.820]   calming down.
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:24.760]   It's actually actively used
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.000]   to wake up your brain
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.340]   when your body is active,
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:28.920]   when the large musculature
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:29.960]   of your body is active.
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:30.940]   And B,
[01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:32.460]   that like with
[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:33.620]   auto-regulation,
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:35.480]   this stuff is under
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:36.560]   conscious control.
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:37.860]   Yes,
[01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:38.560]   if you were to be
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:39.340]   frightened immediately,
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:40.860]   this is the same pathway
[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:41.920]   that would be reflexively
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:43.180]   activated by an intruder
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:43.620]   or by,
[01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:44.020]   you know,
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:44.760]   a big explosion
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:45.640]   or something of that sort,
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:46.660]   your body would wake up,
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:47.480]   release adrenaline,
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.240]   then that adrenaline
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.020]   would set up
[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:50.280]   along this cascade
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:50.900]   and your mind
[01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:51.480]   would be immediately
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.160]   alert as well.
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:52.800]   There's some parallel
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:53.800]   mechanisms too
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:54.360]   to make sure
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:54.900]   that your brain
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:55.500]   and your body
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:56.460]   are alert immediately.
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:58.100]   But when you start
[01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:58.660]   to understand
[01:03:58.660 --> 01:03:59.860]   what these pathways are
[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:00.460]   and that they are
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:01.240]   very specific
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.560]   and very powerful,
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:03.640]   potent inroads
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.940]   into activating
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:05.500]   these circuits,
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:06.560]   it does indeed
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:07.480]   give you a tremendous
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.460]   amount of agency,
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:10.400]   especially for those of you
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:10.960]   that might think
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.000]   you're not motivated
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:12.500]   to exercise
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:13.220]   or you're always
[01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:13.720]   lethargic
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:14.720]   or you have brain fog.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:15.260]   There might be
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:16.240]   other reasons for that
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:18.080]   but for many people,
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:18.860]   chances are
[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:19.860]   you're not getting
[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:20.860]   past that threshold
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:22.180]   whereby these circuits
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:22.980]   involving the vagus
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:23.700]   can be activated
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:24.860]   and now you know how.
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:26.100]   So activate them.
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:27.440]   I'd like to take
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.040]   a quick break
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:28.620]   and acknowledge
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:29.500]   one of our sponsors,
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:30.180]   Function.
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:31.320]   Last year,
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.400]   I became a Function member
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:33.020]   after searching
[01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:34.220]   for the most comprehensive
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:35.540]   approach to lab testing.
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:37.000]   Function provides
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.220]   over 100 advanced
[01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:38.800]   lab tests
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:39.660]   that give you
[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:40.460]   a key snapshot
[01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:42.140]   of your entire bodily health.
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:43.120]   This snapshot
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:43.700]   offers you
[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:44.160]   with insights
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.080]   on your heart health,
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:45.880]   hormone health,
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:46.960]   immune functioning,
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:48.000]   nutrient levels
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:48.780]   and much more.
[01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:50.060]   They've also recently
[01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:50.620]   added tests
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:51.240]   for toxins
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.560]   such as BPA exposure
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:53.700]   from harmful plastics
[01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:54.540]   and tests
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:55.420]   for PFASs
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:56.500]   or forever chemicals.
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:57.720]   Function not only
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:58.420]   provides testing
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:04:59.780]   of over 100 biomarkers
[01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:00.580]   key to your physical
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:01.360]   and mental health
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:02.860]   but it also analyzes
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:03.520]   these results
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:04.480]   and provides insights
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.560]   from top doctors
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.420]   who are expert
[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:07.560]   in the relevant areas.
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:08.480]   For example,
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:09.480]   in one of my first
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:10.220]   tests with Function,
[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:11.240]   I learned that I had
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:11.980]   elevated levels
[01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:13.100]   of mercury in my blood.
[01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:14.380]   Function not only
[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:15.260]   helped me detect that
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:16.400]   but offered insights
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.040]   into how best
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:18.480]   to reduce my mercury levels
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:19.380]   which included limiting
[01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:20.360]   my tuna consumption.
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:21.440]   I've been eating
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:22.000]   a lot of tuna
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.420]   while also making an effort
[01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:24.540]   to eat more leafy greens
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:25.280]   and supplementing
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:25.780]   with NAC
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:26.760]   and acetylcysteine
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:27.900]   both of which can support
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:28.880]   glutathione production
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:30.060]   and detoxification.
[01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:30.980]   And I should say
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:31.720]   by taking a second
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:32.400]   Function test,
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.800]   that approach worked.
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.140]   Comprehensive blood testing
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:36.400]   is vitally important.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.520]   There's so many things
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:38.300]   related to your mental
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:39.120]   and physical health
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:40.760]   that can only be detected
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:41.620]   in a blood test.
[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:42.660]   The problem is
[01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:43.140]   blood testing
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:43.640]   has always been
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:44.280]   very expensive
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.160]   and complicated.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.020]   In contrast,
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:47.100]   I've been super impressed
[01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:48.340]   by Function's simplicity
[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:50.340]   and at the level of cost.
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:51.380]   It is very affordable.
[01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:52.300]   As a consequence,
[01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:53.320]   I decided to join
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:54.700]   their scientific advisory board
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:55.560]   and I'm thrilled
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:56.240]   that they're sponsoring
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:56.740]   the podcast.
[01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:58.660]   If you'd like to try Function,
[01:05:58.660 --> 01:05:59.480]   you can go to
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:00.600]   functionhealth.com
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.420]   slash Huberman.
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:02.460]   Function currently
[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:03.080]   has a wait list
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:04.760]   of over 250,000 people
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.240]   but they're offering
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:06.960]   early access
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:08.460]   to Huberman podcast listeners.
[01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:09.080]   Again,
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.020]   that's functionhealth.com
[01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:11.820]   slash Huberman
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:13.000]   to get early access
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:13.700]   to function.
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:15.120]   I just got done telling you
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:15.860]   how you can increase
[01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:16.740]   your levels of alertness
[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:17.640]   by activating
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:18.680]   this vagal nerve pathway
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:19.300]   from the body
[01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:19.860]   to the brain
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:21.300]   and that increasing
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:22.340]   your level of alertness
[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:24.100]   allows for more opportunity
[01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:25.760]   to focus and to learn.
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:26.820]   But when we say focus
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:27.160]   and learn,
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:27.980]   what we're really talking
[01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:29.640]   about is neuroplasticity,
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:30.880]   this incredible feature
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.040]   of your nervous system
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.240]   to be able to change
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.300]   in response to experience
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:35.420]   in deliberate ways.
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:36.700]   The plasticity that you have
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:37.820]   when you are a child
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:38.900]   from the time you're born
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:40.680]   until about age 25
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:42.940]   typically can occur
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:44.800]   even in passive experience.
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:45.380]   That is,
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:46.420]   you're in class,
[01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:47.700]   the teacher's teaching you something,
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:48.660]   your brain is changing.
[01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:50.100]   Maybe you put a bit more effort
[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:50.700]   into something,
[01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:51.360]   you're focused,
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:52.880]   your brain will change.
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.700]   But as we get into adulthood,
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:56.700]   most of our neural maps
[01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:57.080]   in the brain,
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:58.240]   certainly our sensory maps
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:58.840]   and our cortex,
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.300]   our motor maps
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:01.260]   that allow us to move
[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:02.080]   in particular ways,
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:03.920]   those have been established.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.520]   You can still change them,
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.820]   but they've mostly
[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:07.560]   been established
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:08.400]   throughout childhood
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.640]   and into our early 20s.
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:10.800]   And if we want to modify
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:11.340]   those circuits
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:12.380]   with neuroplasticity,
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:13.240]   there are a couple
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.020]   of key requirements.
[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:14.400]   One,
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.440]   you need to be alert.
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.400]   You can't get neuroplasticity.
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:17.740]   That is,
[01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:19.680]   you can't trigger neuroplasticity
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:20.560]   unless you're alert.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.960]   You also have to be focused.
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:22.880]   This is critical
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:24.720]   and differentiates adult plasticity
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:25.800]   in a major way
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:26.740]   from plasticity
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:27.280]   when we're young
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:27.960]   where we can learn
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.300]   by passive exposure.
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:30.140]   Okay?
[01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:30.940]   When we're young,
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:31.260]   we can learn
[01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:32.140]   by passive exposure
[01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:33.320]   or even better
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:34.680]   by focused exposure.
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:35.920]   But when we are adults,
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:36.840]   we need alertness
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.100]   and we need focus.
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:40.060]   Just passively being exposed
[01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:41.220]   to, you know,
[01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:43.480]   music or to a motor pattern
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:44.600]   is not going to allow us
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:45.600]   to change our nervous system.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:46.120]   That's been shown
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:47.040]   over and over again.
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:47.800]   Fortunately,
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.040]   what also has been shown
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:49.940]   over and over again
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:51.900]   is that if we are alert
[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:52.760]   and we're focused
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:53.620]   and we are determined,
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:55.040]   especially if we undertake
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:55.400]   what's called
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:56.280]   incremental learning
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.980]   where we go after
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:07:59.840]   small bits of neuroplasticity
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.480]   repeatedly over time,
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:03.660]   we can get as much neuroplasticity
[01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:05.440]   as one observes in childhood.
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.820]   It just takes longer
[01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:07.600]   and you have to do it
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:08.660]   so-called incrementally.
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:11.400]   There's a lot to say about that,
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:13.080]   but for sake of today's discussion
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.160]   about the vagus nerve,
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.360]   I just want to tell you
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.780]   that there's a particular pathway
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:18.380]   in the brain
[01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:20.200]   that involves the molecule
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.220]   acetylcholine.
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:23.340]   Acetylcholine is used
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:24.540]   to contract the muscles.
[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:26.080]   It's released from motor neurons
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.060]   in the spinal cord
[01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:27.680]   onto muscles
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:28.580]   to contract the muscles.
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:30.360]   It's also used in the brain
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:31.620]   and elsewhere in the nervous system
[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:32.480]   and it does a lot
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.060]   of different things.
[01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:33.800]   It's actually involved
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:34.340]   in generating
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:35.660]   the rhythms of the heart,
[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:38.220]   but acetylcholine released
[01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:39.480]   from a particular nucleus
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:40.020]   in the brain
[01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:41.480]   called nucleus basalis.
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:43.100]   The acetylcholine released
[01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:44.120]   from nucleus basalis
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.440]   is what we call
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.360]   permissive for plasticity.
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:48.280]   In other words,
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:49.680]   if you have acetylcholine
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.020]   released from nucleus basalis
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:51.820]   into the brain,
[01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:54.340]   plasticity is much more likely
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:54.920]   to occur.
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:56.120]   And in fact,
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.580]   acetylcholine released
[01:08:57.580 --> 01:08:58.560]   from nucleus basalis
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.160]   is sort of like a gate
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:01.620]   whereby if you release
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.260]   acetylcholine,
[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:03.320]   the opportunity
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:04.500]   for neuroplasticity
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:04.980]   and learning
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:05.780]   is available
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:07.060]   for some period of time.
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.180]   So the question therefore
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:08.560]   becomes,
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:09.860]   how do you get acetylcholine
[01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:11.200]   released from nucleus basalis?
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:12.420]   There are these incredible
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:13.460]   experiments that have been done
[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:14.580]   by Mike Merzenich
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:15.120]   and colleagues
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:17.220]   showing that if you stimulate
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:18.020]   nucleus basalis
[01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.100]   to release acetylcholine
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.360]   and you expose an animal
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:20.940]   or a human
[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:22.680]   to a particular sensory stimulus,
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:25.240]   the brain remaps very fast
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.480]   according to that experience.
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:27.760]   Just enormous amounts
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:28.420]   of plasticity
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:29.660]   that you wouldn't observe otherwise.
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:31.500]   There are also fortunately
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:32.400]   experiments showing
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:33.940]   that if you pharmacologically
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:35.460]   increase acetylcholine
[01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:37.080]   that you can enhance
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:37.800]   the opportunity
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:38.940]   for neuroplasticity.
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:39.980]   You still need to do
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:40.700]   the learning.
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:41.540]   You still need to attempt
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:42.200]   to learn something.
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:42.920]   you still have to make
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:43.480]   it incremental
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:45.220]   but the amount of plasticity
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:46.880]   is significantly increased
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:48.300]   when there's acetylcholine
[01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:49.740]   released from nucleus basalis.
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:51.960]   So in the absence
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.140]   of deep brain stimulation
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:54.120]   using an electrode
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:55.380]   which most of you
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:56.720]   fortunately will not experience
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:57.560]   because it requires
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.140]   drilling down
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:09:58.680]   through the skull
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:09:59.600]   and placing an electrode
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:00.220]   in basalis
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:02.320]   and assuming that you're
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.300]   not taking anything
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:04.620]   to increase acetylcholine
[01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:05.640]   transmission to learn
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:06.560]   although there are ways
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.100]   to do that.
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:08.640]   I've talked about that before
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.580]   and I'll talk about that again
[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:10.580]   in a future podcast.
[01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:12.100]   Some of those ways include
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:13.300]   supplementing with things
[01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:14.260]   like alpha GPC
[01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:15.360]   which is a precursor
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.260]   to acetylcholine.
[01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:17.540]   There are some other
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:18.940]   precursors to acetylcholine
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:19.860]   or things that stimulate
[01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:21.040]   the release of acetylcholine
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.180]   such as huperzine
[01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:22.960]   and things like that
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.560]   that will open the opportunity
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.900]   for enhanced plasticity
[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:26.700]   for a few hours.
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:30.180]   And there is good old nicotine.
[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:31.500]   I know the word nicotine
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:32.700]   brings to mind
[01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:34.200]   things like lung cancer
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.760]   because for many, many years
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:36.760]   many, many people
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:37.420]   and still now
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:38.460]   smoked nicotine
[01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:39.360]   in the form of cigarettes
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.080]   or vaping
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:40.880]   both of which I think
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:41.820]   are absolutely terrible
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:43.180]   as is dipping and snuffing
[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:44.600]   because yes
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:45.600]   they increase levels
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:47.580]   of nicotinic acetylcholine
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:48.540]   receptor activation
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:50.380]   which is just fancy nerd speak
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:52.180]   for acetylcholine transmission
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:52.600]   in the brain
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:54.200]   is enhanced by nicotine
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.040]   but those delivery mechanisms
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:56.900]   also of course
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:58.000]   can give you cancer
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:58.880]   in the case of smoking
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.180]   dipping or snuffing
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:01.020]   and vaping
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:02.380]   despite what you hear out there
[01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:04.160]   is absolutely terrible
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.080]   for your health.
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.280]   I don't care what anybody says
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:07.740]   the evidence is starting
[01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:08.700]   starting to really pile up
[01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:10.080]   that vaping is bad for you.
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.800]   Now, is oral form nicotine
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:13.560]   bad for you
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:14.500]   in the form of gum
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:16.340]   or in the form of a pouch, etc.?
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:17.160]   I just want to say
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:17.860]   a couple of things.
[01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:20.480]   One, it's extremely habit forming.
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:23.660]   Two, it increases blood pressure
[01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:25.520]   and it's a vasoconstrictor.
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.380]   These drawbacks about nicotine
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:28.000]   are real
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.780]   and are critical to consider
[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:30.940]   if you're going to use nicotine
[01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:32.000]   as a focusing agent
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.540]   or a so-called nootropic.
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:34.920]   I don't really like that word
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:36.740]   but if you're using nicotine
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:37.260]   as a way
[01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:39.060]   to enhance cognition
[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:41.100]   and enhance neuroplasticity,
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:41.800]   you should know
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:43.340]   what the potential drawbacks are.
[01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:44.140]   Most notably,
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:45.220]   the habit forming
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:46.300]   and addicting properties
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:47.720]   which are very robust.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:48.940]   Now, with that said,
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:49.540]   there are ways
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:50.880]   to non-pharmacologically
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:51.640]   stimulate
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.140]   the nucleus basalis
[01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:54.280]   acetylcholine pathway
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.560]   to enhance the window
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:56.420]   for plasticity
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:57.720]   and the way to do that
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:58.980]   is, you guessed it,
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:00.340]   through the vagus nerve.
[01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:02.120]   Studies in healthy humans
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:02.740]   and humans
[01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:03.200]   who have had,
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.160]   for instance, stroke
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:05.720]   as well as animal studies
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:06.200]   have shown
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:07.220]   that if you stimulate
[01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:08.600]   the vagus nerve electrically,
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.240]   you increase the level
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:11.460]   of alertness in the brain
[01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:12.860]   and part of the mechanism
[01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:13.600]   by which you do that
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:14.320]   is the one I told you
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:15.220]   about a few minutes ago,
[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:16.600]   the adrenals,
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:17.140]   vagus,
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:18.100]   locus coeruleus
[01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.440]   but also there's
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:20.280]   a separate pathway
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:21.620]   from the NTS
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:22.960]   to nucleus basalis
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:23.980]   that stimulates
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:24.400]   the release
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:25.320]   of acetylcholine
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:26.500]   from nucleus basalis
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:27.320]   and opens up
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:28.000]   the opportunity
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.620]   for neuroplasticity.
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:31.460]   This, I should mention,
[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:33.340]   is not a small effect.
[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:35.880]   It is a rapid effect
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:36.640]   and it's one
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:37.280]   that has allowed
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:37.980]   stroke patients,
[01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:38.580]   for instance,
[01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:39.840]   to improve
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:40.840]   their motor capabilities
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:41.440]   very quickly
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:42.140]   as compared
[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:43.180]   to when the vagus nerve
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:44.480]   is not stimulated
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.000]   or when acetylcholine
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:46.400]   transmission
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:47.340]   is not enhanced
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:48.120]   pharmacologically
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:49.560]   and fortunately now
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:50.600]   there are studies
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:51.520]   starting to accumulate
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:52.660]   in animal models
[01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:54.040]   and some in humans.
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:55.480]   We need more
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:56.300]   but there are some
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:57.200]   showing that
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:58.760]   if you enhance alertness
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:00.360]   by way of activating
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:01.160]   the vagus nerve
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.480]   through the mechanism
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:03.420]   that I told you before
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:04.840]   which is good old-fashioned
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.200]   high-intensity exercise
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:08.160]   that in the several hours
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:09.480]   following that exercise
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.060]   there is an enhanced
[01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:11.680]   opportunity
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.120]   for neuroplasticity.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:14.240]   Now that enhanced
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:14.800]   opportunity
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:16.000]   for neuroplasticity
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:16.940]   comes by way
[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:18.220]   of two different pathways.
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:18.900]   You already heard
[01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:19.640]   about the first one
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:20.660]   which is the locus
[01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:21.180]   coeruleus
[01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:22.580]   release of norepinephrine.
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:23.740]   That's going to increase
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:24.520]   alertness
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:25.780]   which is a prerequisite
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:26.620]   for focus
[01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:27.840]   and it appears
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.380]   to be the case
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:29.020]   that the release
[01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:29.980]   of acetylcholine
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:31.060]   from nucleus basalis
[01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:32.600]   that's also triggered
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:34.340]   by this high-intensity exercise
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:35.920]   is what allows
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:37.080]   for that alertness
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.300]   to be converted
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:39.420]   into focus
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:40.640]   and those two things together
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:41.780]   alertness and focus
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:42.880]   are the triggers
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.760]   for adult neuroplasticity.
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:45.880]   If you think about this
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.080]   this is really exciting.
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:48.880]   For 25 years or more
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:49.360]   we've known
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.240]   that plasticity
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:50.880]   is possible
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:51.940]   in the adult human.
[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:53.580]   We knew you needed alertness
[01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:54.620]   and you needed focus.
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:55.760]   We also by the way
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:56.840]   know that you need
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.120]   to get great sleep
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:58.720]   that night
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:00.020]   and in subsequent nights
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:01.000]   in order to actually
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.100]   allow the plasticity
[01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:02.640]   to occur.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.360]   Plasticity is a process
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:05.200]   it's not just triggered
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.160]   when you go about
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:06.960]   trying to learn something
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:07.900]   it actually takes place
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:09.060]   in sleep
[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:10.880]   as well as sleep-like states
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.140]   like non-sleep deep rest
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:12.800]   and meditation
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:13.760]   but especially
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:14.920]   in deep sleep
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:16.160]   and rapid eye movement sleep.
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:16.820]   This is why
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:17.300]   you can attempt
[01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:17.980]   to learn something
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:19.340]   cognitively or behaviorally
[01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:21.000]   over and over and over.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.120]   You can't get those scales
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:22.860]   on the piano right.
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:24.060]   You can't get the
[01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:24.740]   you know
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:26.700]   the information dialed in
[01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:27.460]   from your class
[01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:28.380]   a language class
[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:29.520]   or from engineering
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:31.280]   or you're trying to figure out
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:32.080]   what this picture
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:33.020]   should be in your mind
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:33.760]   that you're going to paint
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:34.060]   etc.
[01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:35.760]   You work at it
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:36.380]   you work at it
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:37.620]   you sleep
[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:37.940]   you sleep
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:38.480]   and then one day
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:38.940]   you wake up
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:39.320]   and suddenly
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:40.100]   you have the skill
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:40.700]   it's because
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:42.220]   the actual rewiring
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:42.940]   of those circuits
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:44.160]   that we call neuroplasticity
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.140]   occurs during sleep
[01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:45.880]   but it's triggered
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:47.020]   in those moments
[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:48.520]   of incremental learning
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:49.460]   and really struggling
[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:50.140]   and keep in mind
[01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:50.760]   the struggle
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:51.600]   to learn something
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:52.240]   that friction
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:53.520]   is part of the
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:54.860]   neuroplasticity process
[01:14:54.860 --> 01:14:56.580]   and it's oh so clear
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:56.900]   now
[01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:58.980]   that alertness
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:14:59.560]   and focus
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.720]   are the prerequisites
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:01.540]   for plasticity
[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:02.520]   that alertness
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:02.980]   is coming
[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:04.380]   in large part
[01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:05.300]   by way of the release
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:05.920]   of norepinephrine
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:07.240]   from locus coeruleus
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:08.260]   that the focus
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:09.300]   is being augmented
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:10.340]   and perhaps
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:11.800]   it's even originating
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.100]   entirely from the release
[01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:13.820]   of acetylcholine
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:14.760]   and nucleus basalis
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:15.720]   that acts as sort of
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:16.300]   a spotlight
[01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:17.440]   on a particular set
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:18.340]   of things that are happening
[01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:19.660]   while we're trying to learn
[01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:20.860]   and then
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:21.640]   that triggers
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:22.740]   the plasticity process
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:23.900]   which takes place
[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:24.800]   during sleep
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:27.120]   so that beautiful picture
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.320]   of self-directed
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:29.360]   adaptive plasticity
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:29.840]   in adulthood
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:32.820]   is allowed to happen
[01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:33.700]   because
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:35.340]   the vagus nerve
[01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:36.080]   in part
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.780]   is triggering
[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:38.860]   NTS
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:39.640]   to say
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:39.980]   hey
[01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:41.100]   locus coeruleus
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:42.140]   nucleus basalis
[01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:42.780]   wake up
[01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:44.020]   release norepinephrine
[01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:45.500]   release acetylcholine
[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:46.500]   now is the time
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:46.920]   to learn
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:48.060]   so what this means
[01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:48.340]   is
[01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:49.440]   if you're struggling
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:49.940]   to learn
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:50.760]   if you want
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:51.180]   to continue
[01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:52.000]   to have robust
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:52.880]   neuroplasticity
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:53.940]   if you happen
[01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:54.540]   to have some
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:56.020]   damage to motor pathways
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:56.720]   or you're having
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:57.640]   trouble with focusing
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:58.460]   and brain fog
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:15:59.120]   keep in mind
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.160]   focus itself
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:01.460]   is served
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:02.220]   by a circuit
[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:03.000]   that is subject
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:03.800]   to plasticity
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:04.280]   you can actually
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:04.840]   get better
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:05.520]   at focusing
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:06.660]   by working
[01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:07.180]   on focus
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:07.840]   just the same
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:08.280]   way you would
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:09.340]   on any skill
[01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:10.420]   and so
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:11.220]   if you're struggling
[01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:11.760]   with focus
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:12.580]   I highly recommend
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:13.740]   finding a threshold
[01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:14.340]   of exercise
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:15.640]   that stimulates
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:16.580]   brain alertness
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:17.820]   that triggers
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:18.460]   these pathways
[01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:19.080]   that are now
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:20.240]   starting to be clear
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.540]   that they occur
[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:22.340]   from the literature
[01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:22.920]   in animals
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:23.560]   and humans
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:24.860]   and yes
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:25.780]   you might augment
[01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:26.300]   this with
[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:26.960]   something like
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:27.340]   caffeine
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:27.860]   which will
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:28.940]   further increase
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:29.960]   levels of norepinephrine
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:30.800]   you might even
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:31.960]   use low dose nicotine
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:32.720]   I'm not necessarily
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:33.460]   recommending that
[01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:33.920]   certainly not
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:34.680]   for young people
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:35.640]   and you do need
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:36.200]   to be aware
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:37.560]   of the habit forming
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:38.320]   aka addictive
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.380]   properties of nicotine
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:40.080]   you definitely
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:40.480]   don't want to
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:40.880]   consume it
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:41.560]   in any form
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:42.120]   that's going
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:42.700]   to cause you
[01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:43.620]   to increase
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:44.500]   your risk of cancer
[01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:45.460]   or popcorn lung
[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:46.120]   from vaping
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:47.300]   you could use
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:47.860]   pharmacology
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:48.500]   you could use
[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:49.260]   alpha gpc
[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:49.840]   you could use
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:50.400]   herpruzine
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.420]   in combination
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:52.380]   with exercise
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:53.020]   however
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:54.400]   I strongly
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.420]   strongly recommend
[01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:55.980]   that anyone
[01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:56.600]   who's interested
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:57.920]   in lifelong learning
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:58.820]   think about
[01:16:58.820 --> 01:16:59.580]   organizing your
[01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:00.300]   bouts of learning
[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:01.080]   especially cognitive
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:01.440]   learning
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:02.260]   to come
[01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:03.300]   in the two
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:04.080]   to three hours
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.140]   maybe even four hours
[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:05.560]   but certainly
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:06.040]   in the one
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:06.660]   to two hours
[01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:07.680]   after you do
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:08.520]   some sort of exercise
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:09.260]   that doesn't leave
[01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:10.120]   you exhausted
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.080]   but leaves you
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:12.160]   with elevated levels
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.480]   of energy
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:14.120]   in your body
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.000]   so you don't
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:15.700]   want to take
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:16.700]   this physical exercise
[01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:17.160]   that I'm talking
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:18.440]   about to exhaustion
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:19.420]   because that's
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:19.720]   going to leave
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:20.280]   you depleted
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:20.820]   that's going to
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:21.280]   cause a
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:21.940]   you know
[01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:22.740]   uptick in
[01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:24.000]   parasympathetic activity
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:24.680]   any of you
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:24.980]   that have done
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:25.880]   a hard leg
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:26.260]   workout
[01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:27.140]   and then you know
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:27.720]   two three hours
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:28.020]   later
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:28.660]   you're just like
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:29.640]   it's very clear
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:30.680]   brain oxygen levels
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:31.340]   are down
[01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:32.660]   parasympathetic activity
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:33.280]   is up
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:33.820]   you are tired
[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:34.760]   because you exhausted
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:35.480]   all that energy
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:36.080]   and exercise
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.180]   but if you can use
[01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:38.600]   exercise as a trigger
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:40.020]   to release adrenaline
[01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:40.740]   and stimulate
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:41.320]   these pathways
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:42.100]   within the brain
[01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:42.900]   that arrive
[01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:43.780]   via the signaling
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:44.540]   from the vagus
[01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:45.640]   you do indeed
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:46.800]   open up the opportunity
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.020]   for enhanced
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:49.180]   neuroplasticity
[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:50.100]   at any age
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:51.100]   and that is
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:51.920]   a non-trivial
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:52.300]   thing
[01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:53.180]   in fact
[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:53.780]   it's downright
[01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:54.200]   exciting
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:55.140]   because the search
[01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:55.820]   for adult
[01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:56.700]   neuroplasticity
[01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:57.060]   tools
[01:17:57.060 --> 01:17:57.680]   is one
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:58.240]   that's existed
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:58.960]   probably for
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:17:59.720]   thousands of years
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:00.140]   and that has
[01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:00.700]   been documented
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:01.200]   for hundreds
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:01.620]   of years
[01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:02.500]   and the thing
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:03.040]   that makes
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:03.420]   the nervous
[01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:04.180]   system of humans
[01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:05.040]   so special
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:05.720]   is that it
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:06.540]   is capable
[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:07.240]   of changing
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:07.700]   itself
[01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:08.400]   throughout the
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:08.760]   lifespan
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:09.760]   so now you
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:10.260]   know at least
[01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:10.760]   one method
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:11.180]   by which you
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:11.680]   can do that
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:12.580]   and it of course
[01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:13.080]   involves
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:13.820]   the vagus
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:14.740]   okay
[01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:15.360]   so one of
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:16.160]   the most
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:16.800]   incredible things
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:17.400]   about the vagus
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:17.660]   nerve
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:18.820]   that i myself
[01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:19.440]   have really
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:20.080]   not ever heard
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:20.560]   talked about
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:20.940]   out there
[01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:22.080]   is the way
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.040]   it communicates
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:23.860]   and coordinates
[01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:25.140]   levels of serotonin
[01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:25.880]   in the gut
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:26.960]   with levels
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:27.680]   of serotonin
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:28.420]   in the brain
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:30.180]   now a discussion
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:31.100]   about serotonin
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:32.280]   that's complete
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:32.840]   would take many
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:33.440]   many hours
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:34.540]   but suffice to say
[01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:35.580]   that serotonin
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:36.920]   is a neuromodulator
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:37.900]   much like dopamine
[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:38.780]   or acetylcholine
[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:39.540]   or norepinephrine
[01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:40.680]   in that it modulates
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:41.240]   the activity
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:42.060]   of other circuits
[01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:43.220]   it's critically
[01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:44.220]   important for mood
[01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:45.460]   in the gut
[01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:46.100]   it's critically
[01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:46.640]   important
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:48.060]   for gut motility
[01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:49.760]   for ease of digestion
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.000]   and for gut health
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.120]   in the brain
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:53.420]   we say serotonin
[01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:54.440]   is important for mood
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:55.420]   i don't want to give
[01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:55.880]   the impression
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:56.600]   that high levels
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:57.260]   of serotonin
[01:18:57.260 --> 01:18:57.580]   good
[01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:58.140]   low levels
[01:18:58.140 --> 01:18:58.780]   of serotonin
[01:18:58.780 --> 01:18:59.200]   bad
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.040]   serotonin
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:01.540]   needs to be
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:02.700]   at a particular level
[01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:03.720]   so neither too high
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:04.500]   nor too low
[01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:05.580]   as many of you know
[01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:06.420]   one of the major ways
[01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:06.960]   that depression
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:07.580]   has been treated
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:08.520]   over the last decades
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:09.160]   is through
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:10.120]   the administration
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:10.860]   of something called
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:11.560]   ssri
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:12.880]   selective serotonin
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:13.880]   reuptake inhibitors
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:14.700]   which have the net
[01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:15.720]   effect of increasing
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:16.760]   levels of serotonin
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:17.540]   at synapses
[01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:19.140]   ssris are somewhat
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:19.660]   controversial
[01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:20.960]   because in many people
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:21.800]   they do alleviate
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:22.860]   certain symptoms
[01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:23.420]   of depression
[01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:24.140]   but they often
[01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:25.280]   carry side effects
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.380]   because serotonin
[01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:27.540]   is used in multiple
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:28.200]   circuits throughout
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:28.680]   the brain
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:29.520]   i don't want
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.200]   to give the impression
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:31.440]   that ssris are
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:32.240]   always bad
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:33.060]   or always good
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:34.100]   it's highly dependent
[01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:34.820]   on the patient
[01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:35.860]   and a bunch
[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:36.440]   of other things
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:37.160]   that really
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:37.720]   unfortunately
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:38.960]   can only be explored
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:40.180]   through experimentation
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:40.860]   that's typically
[01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:41.580]   what psychiatrists
[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:41.880]   will do
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.100]   they'll prescribe
[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:43.800]   an ssri
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:44.500]   at a given dose
[01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:45.140]   see how a patient
[01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:45.600]   reacts
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:46.060]   maybe they'll
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:46.600]   take them off
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:47.640]   an ssri entirely
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:48.040]   give them
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:48.880]   a different type
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:49.620]   of antidepressant
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:49.900]   that works
[01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:50.360]   on a different
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:51.320]   set of neuromodulators
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:51.940]   like dopamine
[01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:52.740]   and norepinephrine
[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:53.740]   so wellbutrin
[01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:55.220]   would be a non-ssri
[01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:55.900]   antidepressant
[01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:56.540]   and there are a whole
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:57.040]   set of issues
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:57.780]   around ssris
[01:19:57.780 --> 01:19:58.620]   for instance
[01:19:58.620 --> 01:19:59.880]   they can be
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:00.560]   very beneficial
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.040]   for people
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:02.320]   with full clinical
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:02.940]   ocd
[01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:03.760]   obsessive compulsive
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:04.180]   disorder
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:05.100]   and then again
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:05.780]   other people
[01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:07.320]   suffer terrible
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:07.820]   side effects
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:08.460]   from ssris
[01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:08.960]   so
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:09.960]   i don't want
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:10.380]   to suggest
[01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:11.240]   that ssris
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.300]   are a solution
[01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:13.420]   i also don't
[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:14.060]   want to suggest
[01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:15.160]   that serotonin
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.200]   is the only
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:16.780]   problem with
[01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:17.200]   depression
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:18.640]   or is always
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:19.140]   a problem
[01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:19.780]   in cases of
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:20.120]   depression
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:20.700]   that itself
[01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:21.120]   is heavily
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:21.540]   debated
[01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:22.580]   what's emerging
[01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:23.140]   from the data
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:24.180]   is that elevating
[01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:25.240]   levels of serotonin
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.220]   in the brain
[01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:27.500]   can increase
[01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:28.460]   neuroplasticity
[01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:29.240]   which can allow
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:29.820]   people who have
[01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:30.620]   major depression
[01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:31.680]   to learn new
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:32.380]   contingencies
[01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:32.680]   you know
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:33.080]   these are people
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.480]   who at one
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:35.300]   point are thinking
[01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:35.560]   you know
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:36.080]   why would i ever
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:36.480]   try and get
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.120]   a new relationship
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:37.780]   or job
[01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:38.620]   like everything
[01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:39.300]   always turns out
[01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:39.640]   terribly
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:40.640]   these are hallmarks
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:41.200]   of depression
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:41.640]   you know
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:43.140]   lack of excitement
[01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:44.040]   about the future
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:45.360]   everything's a negative
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:46.320]   outcome in their mind
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:48.100]   through neuroplasticity
[01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:49.340]   it's clear that people
[01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:50.040]   can form new
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:50.620]   contingencies
[01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:51.160]   they can start
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:52.020]   to imagine life
[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:53.100]   as more positive
[01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:53.980]   and holding
[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:54.800]   more possibility
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.040]   and changing levels
[01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:56.740]   of serotonin
[01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:57.580]   is known to be
[01:20:57.580 --> 01:20:58.200]   much in the same
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:20:59.280]   way acetylcholine
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:20:59.860]   can increase
[01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:00.480]   plasticity
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:01.580]   permissive
[01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:02.760]   for neuroplasticity
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:03.340]   so that might be
[01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:03.840]   one way
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.040]   by which ssris
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:06.300]   actually can
[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:06.960]   provide help
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:07.700]   for certain
[01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:08.060]   people
[01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:09.420]   for depression
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:10.020]   however
[01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:10.640]   because of the
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:11.040]   side effects
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:11.640]   associated with
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:12.100]   ssris
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:12.600]   many people
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:12.920]   are leaning
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:13.700]   away from them
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:14.540]   and yet
[01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:15.740]   having adequate
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:16.740]   levels of serotonin
[01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:17.600]   is absolutely
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:18.540]   critical for people
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:19.440]   depressed
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:20.140]   as well as people
[01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:21.020]   who are not depressed
[01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:22.040]   to feel a sense
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:22.640]   of well-being
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:23.740]   just overall
[01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:24.460]   sense of well-being
[01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:25.360]   being okay
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:26.980]   with who they are
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:27.900]   and where life is at
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:28.580]   being able to lean
[01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:29.160]   into effort
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:29.780]   and all these things
[01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:30.500]   it's absolutely
[01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:31.200]   critical that we
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:32.100]   have adequate levels
[01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:32.800]   of serotonin
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:33.720]   in the brain
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:34.680]   now you may have
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:35.360]   heard and it is
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.340]   absolutely true
[01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:37.800]   that 90%
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:38.600]   of the serotonin
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:39.660]   manufactured in your
[01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:41.260]   body is in the gut
[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:42.980]   now what you don't
[01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:43.660]   often hear
[01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:45.140]   is that serotonin
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:46.560]   stays in the gut
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:47.540]   right we hear these
[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:48.340]   days oh you know
[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:49.800]   most of your serotonin
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:51.260]   is manufactured in your gut
[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:52.080]   which has given
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:53.060]   millions of people
[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:54.080]   the false impression
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:55.640]   that if you get your gut
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:56.580]   serotonin right
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:58.780]   somehow it's traveling
[01:21:58.780 --> 01:21:59.580]   up to your brain
[01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:00.800]   and performing
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:01.640]   all the important roles
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:02.480]   that serotonin plays
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:03.040]   in your brain
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:04.120]   that's not how it
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:04.740]   works at all
[01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:06.420]   fortunately however
[01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:07.600]   there are ways
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:08.760]   that you can modify
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:09.880]   the levels of serotonin
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:10.440]   in your gut
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:11.460]   and indeed
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:12.780]   the levels of serotonin
[01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:13.380]   in your gut
[01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:14.840]   powerfully impact
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:15.860]   the levels of serotonin
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:16.540]   in your brain
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:17.760]   and this occurs
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:18.820]   you guessed it
[01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:20.080]   by way of the vagus
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:21.080]   it's a super cool
[01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:21.500]   mechanism
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:22.080]   and it's one
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:22.880]   that you can exert
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:23.980]   some positive control
[01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:24.280]   over
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:25.520]   in order to
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:26.160]   for instance
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.280]   increase your
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:28.200]   baseline levels
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:28.660]   of mood
[01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:29.740]   in order
[01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:30.420]   to increase
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:31.440]   levels of serotonin
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.040]   if that's something
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:32.640]   that you seek
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:33.900]   here's the pathway
[01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:34.460]   and the mechanism
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:35.120]   and I'm going to
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:35.640]   provide this
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:36.580]   in kind of
[01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:37.640]   top contour form
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:38.120]   in the future
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:38.760]   I'll do an entire
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:39.980]   episode about serotonin
[01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:41.180]   but here's the idea
[01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:43.620]   in your gut
[01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:44.540]   you have cells
[01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:45.600]   including neurons
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:46.700]   but you also have
[01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:47.540]   a lot of other cells
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:48.680]   mostly other cells
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:49.060]   frankly
[01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:50.300]   and there's a
[01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:51.080]   particular category
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:51.680]   of cells
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:52.380]   called the
[01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:53.800]   enterochromafin cells
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:54.660]   you don't need
[01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:55.220]   to know that name
[01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:55.740]   but if you want
[01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:56.040]   they're the
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:57.040]   enterochromafin cells
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.480]   and they manufacture
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:22:59.540]   serotonin
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:00.520]   they do that
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:01.260]   through a beautiful
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:02.240]   pathway involving
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:03.700]   an enzymatic reaction
[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:04.280]   that converts
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:05.440]   tryptophan from the
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:05.960]   food you eat
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:06.560]   tryptophan's an
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:07.180]   amino acid
[01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:08.180]   gets converted
[01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:09.080]   eventually into
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:09.600]   serotonin
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:10.120]   there are a bunch
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:10.680]   of steps in there
[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:11.360]   in the biochemistry
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.220]   gets converted
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:13.000]   into serotonin
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.320]   that serotonin
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:15.700]   binds to
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:17.220]   the ends of neurons
[01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:18.480]   the axons of neurons
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:19.320]   in the vagus nerve
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:20.120]   that innervate
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:20.820]   your gut
[01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:21.900]   not just your stomach
[01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:22.560]   but your
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:23.820]   large intestine
[01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:25.040]   and your small intestine
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:25.780]   remember
[01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:26.760]   those sensory
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:27.220]   afferents
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:27.860]   those sensory
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:28.520]   axons
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:29.880]   that extend
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:30.640]   into the body
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:31.820]   have receptors
[01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:32.320]   on them
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:32.920]   right
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:34.720]   the serotonin
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:35.280]   in the gut
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:36.360]   assuming you're
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:36.800]   getting enough
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:37.440]   tryptophan
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:38.700]   and assuming
[01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:39.240]   the milieu
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:39.900]   of your gut
[01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:40.260]   is correct
[01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:40.580]   we'll talk
[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:40.980]   about what that
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:41.380]   means and how
[01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:41.840]   you can exert
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:42.560]   control over it
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:43.040]   get the milieu
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:43.560]   right
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:44.960]   that serotonin
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:45.520]   binds
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:46.760]   to the ends
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:47.480]   of those axons
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:48.000]   in the gut
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.420]   and stimulates
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:50.400]   a particular
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:51.340]   category of them
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:52.740]   that then
[01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:53.940]   relays the signal
[01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:55.160]   up and through
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:56.200]   nodos ganglion
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:56.700]   you know
[01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:57.100]   are familiar
[01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:57.760]   with these names
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.360]   up into the brain
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.420]   to the nucleus
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:02.720]   tractus solitaris
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:03.340]   okay
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:04.060]   that NTS
[01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:04.480]   again
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:06.080]   and then the nucleus
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:07.240]   tractus solitaris
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:08.760]   doesn't just communicate
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:09.760]   with locus coeruleus
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:10.240]   and with nucleus
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:10.660]   basalis
[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:11.720]   it also sends
[01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:12.660]   a powerful signal
[01:24:12.660 --> 01:24:13.400]   to what's called
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:14.980]   the dorsal raphe nucleus
[01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:16.460]   the dorsal raphe nucleus
[01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:17.280]   in your brain
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:18.600]   is responsible
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:19.640]   for the release
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:20.380]   of the majority
[01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:21.580]   of the serotonin
[01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:22.160]   in your brain
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.240]   so when you hear
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:23.660]   that most
[01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:24.360]   of the serotonin
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:25.060]   in your body
[01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:25.880]   is made
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:26.540]   in your gut
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:28.000]   that's true
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.060]   and it stays
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:29.660]   in your gut
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:30.600]   but the levels
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:31.320]   of serotonin
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:32.220]   are communicated
[01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:32.920]   to the brain
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:34.100]   by the vagus
[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:36.400]   and then stimulates
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:36.840]   the release
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:37.540]   of serotonin
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:39.140]   from the dorsal raphe nucleus
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:40.560]   so the question
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:41.520]   therefore becomes
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:42.860]   if we want
[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:43.680]   to increase levels
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:44.320]   of serotonin
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:44.880]   in the brain
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:45.780]   or simply
[01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:46.320]   to maintain
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.220]   healthy levels
[01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:47.940]   of serotonin
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:48.420]   in the brain
[01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:48.840]   for somebody
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:49.540]   who's not depressed
[01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:50.100]   or maybe somebody
[01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:50.960]   who's having low mood
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:51.720]   just to keep
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:52.460]   elevated levels
[01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:52.880]   of mood
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:53.980]   and proper levels
[01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:54.640]   of serotonin
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:55.080]   overall
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:55.840]   because it's involved
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:56.600]   in lots of things
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:57.300]   not just mood
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:59.520]   we need to make sure
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:00.000]   that we're getting
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.080]   adequate production
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:01.900]   of serotonin
[01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:02.520]   in the gut
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:03.480]   and again
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:04.520]   adequate production
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:05.120]   of serotonin
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:05.620]   in the gut
[01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:06.280]   has a bunch
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:06.900]   of other positive
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:07.240]   effects
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:07.780]   on the immune
[01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:08.180]   system
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:09.100]   on gut motility
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:09.580]   in fact
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:10.580]   having adequate
[01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:11.520]   levels of serotonin
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:11.980]   in the gut
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:12.620]   is powerfully
[01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:13.040]   associated
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:13.520]   with having
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:14.260]   a healthy gut
[01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:14.820]   and not having
[01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:15.720]   irritable gut
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:17.260]   irritable bowel syndrome
[01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:17.760]   is something
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:18.560]   that vexes
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:19.480]   many people
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:20.140]   you know
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:20.600]   it might sound
[01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:21.100]   kind of funny
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:21.560]   to those of you
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:21.920]   that don't have
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:22.280]   oh you have
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:23.000]   an irritable bowel
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:23.980]   people with
[01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:24.620]   IBS
[01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:25.700]   irritable bowel syndrome
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:26.260]   oftentimes
[01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:28.040]   suffer tremendously
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:28.840]   they can't go
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:29.320]   out to dinner
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:29.920]   they can't eat
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:30.500]   foods that other
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:31.960]   people offer them
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:32.420]   they'll eat
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:33.040]   a bunch of foods
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:33.460]   for a while
[01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:34.220]   and feel fine
[01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:34.760]   then they feel
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:35.200]   terrible
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:36.000]   it's not just
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:36.400]   about having
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:36.900]   diarrhea
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:37.960]   often they have
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:38.260]   a bunch
[01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:38.560]   of other
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:39.080]   gut issues
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:39.400]   and it's
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:39.820]   correlated with
[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:40.120]   a bunch
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:40.520]   of other
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:41.580]   major problems
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:42.960]   over time
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.200]   we're going to do
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:44.880]   an entire episode
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:45.640]   about gut health
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:46.180]   as it relates
[01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:46.760]   to IBS
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:47.880]   there are things
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:48.460]   that you can do
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:49.160]   to improve IBS
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:49.800]   one of them
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:50.400]   is to keep
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:50.620]   your
[01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:52.560]   or get your
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:53.420]   gut levels
[01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:54.100]   of serotonin
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:54.380]   right
[01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:55.300]   how do you do
[01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:55.620]   that
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:56.580]   well one way
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:57.140]   to do that
[01:25:57.140 --> 01:25:57.960]   is to make sure
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.040]   that the microbiota
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:25:59.600]   of your gut
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:00.300]   are healthy
[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:01.400]   and that they
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.060]   are diverse
[01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:02.760]   the best way
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:03.460]   to do that
[01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:04.780]   not using
[01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:05.160]   any kind
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:05.960]   of supplementation
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:06.600]   is to make
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:06.940]   sure that
[01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:07.560]   you're ingesting
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:08.860]   one to four
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:09.600]   servings of low
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:10.260]   sugar fermented
[01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:10.980]   foods per day
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:11.460]   I've talked about
[01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:11.880]   this before
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:12.380]   on the podcast
[01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:13.100]   this is based
[01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:14.120]   on beautiful data
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:14.640]   from my colleague
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:15.520]   Justin Sonnenberg
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:17.220]   and Christopher Gardner
[01:26:17.220 --> 01:26:17.940]   at Stanford
[01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:19.060]   showed that
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:19.520]   the ingestion
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:20.180]   of one to four
[01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:21.160]   servings of low
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:21.700]   sugar fermented
[01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:22.460]   foods per day
[01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:23.180]   so these would
[01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:23.980]   be things like
[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:24.820]   kimchi
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:25.900]   sauerkraut
[01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:26.760]   again low sugar
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:27.520]   look at the labels
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:28.380]   this is the stuff
[01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:29.100]   that would need
[01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:29.940]   to be refrigerated
[01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:30.480]   we're not talking
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:30.960]   about pickles
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:31.500]   kept on the
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:32.240]   non-refrigerated
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:33.160]   shelf
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:34.120]   the non-refrigerated
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:34.960]   section of the
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:35.400]   grocery store
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:35.820]   but rather
[01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:36.640]   the brine
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:37.200]   and the pickles
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:38.160]   that don't have
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:38.780]   a ton of sugar
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:40.160]   so the sour pickles
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:40.620]   that is
[01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:41.420]   that are kept
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:42.040]   in the refrigerator
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:43.120]   things like kimchi
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:45.480]   things like kombucha
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:46.500]   keep in mind
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:47.540]   some kombucha
[01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:48.100]   has alcohol
[01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:48.900]   so keep that in mind
[01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:49.260]   if you're giving
[01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:49.840]   this to kids
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:50.900]   who shouldn't
[01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:51.800]   be ingesting alcohol
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:52.840]   any adults
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:53.360]   probably shouldn't
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:54.240]   be ingesting alcohol
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.200]   kombucha has
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:55.940]   very little alcohol
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:56.340]   but if you're
[01:26:56.340 --> 01:26:56.800]   an alcoholic
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:57.080]   and you're
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:57.680]   completely avoiding
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:58.060]   alcohol
[01:26:58.060 --> 01:26:58.660]   you should know
[01:26:58.660 --> 01:26:58.980]   that
[01:26:58.980 --> 01:26:59.580]   kombucha
[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:00.160]   contains some
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:00.580]   alcohol
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:02.320]   things like
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:02.800]   kefir
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:05.020]   quality yogurts
[01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:05.900]   low sugar yogurts
[01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:06.820]   you can look up
[01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:07.240]   online
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:07.980]   what are different
[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:08.760]   low sugar fermented
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:09.060]   foods
[01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:09.560]   these things
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:10.340]   are going to
[01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:11.300]   improve the gut
[01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:11.960]   microbiota
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:12.780]   that in turn
[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:14.040]   promote the
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:14.900]   production of
[01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:15.620]   serotonin
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:17.020]   if and only
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:17.240]   if
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:17.880]   this is important
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:18.700]   if and only
[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:18.920]   if
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:19.580]   there's also
[01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:20.340]   sufficient levels
[01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:21.180]   of tryptophan
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:22.020]   in your dietary
[01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:22.520]   intake
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:23.280]   so you're going
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:23.580]   to want to
[01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:23.900]   take a look
[01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:24.200]   at what you're
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:24.480]   eating
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:25.400]   and just
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:25.960]   through a simple
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:26.600]   online search
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:27.020]   you can figure
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:28.020]   out whether
[01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:28.240]   or not
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:28.520]   you're getting
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:29.220]   sufficient levels
[01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:29.940]   of tryptophan
[01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:31.140]   many people
[01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:31.540]   are familiar
[01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:32.260]   with the idea
[01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:33.320]   because it's true
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:34.780]   that turkey contains
[01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:35.140]   high levels
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:35.840]   of tryptophan
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:37.400]   this is thought
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:38.000]   to be responsible
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:38.720]   for the post
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:39.440]   thanksgiving dinner
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:39.840]   effect
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:40.380]   although that's
[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:40.800]   probably due
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:41.500]   to just eating
[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:42.420]   a lot of food
[01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:43.200]   and when the gut
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:43.800]   is distended
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.680]   the distension of the gut
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:46.380]   is communicated
[01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:47.720]   by mechanosensors
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:49.140]   up the vagus nerve
[01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:49.920]   sensory neurons
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:51.940]   and set in motion
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:52.660]   the so-called
[01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:53.520]   rest and digest
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:54.740]   or I guess
[01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:55.320]   it would be like
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:56.680]   collapse and pass out
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:57.420]   in the case
[01:27:57.420 --> 01:27:58.200]   of thanksgiving
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:27:59.300]   collapse and pass out
[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:01.600]   effect of having
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:02.380]   a lot of food
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:02.780]   in your gut
[01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:03.160]   doesn't matter
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:03.620]   what the food
[01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:04.120]   is but you're
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:04.540]   going to want
[01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:04.860]   to make sure
[01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:05.080]   that you're
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:05.700]   ingesting foods
[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:06.480]   with sufficient
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:07.560]   levels of tryptophan
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:08.780]   so dairy products
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:09.380]   will do that
[01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:10.500]   white turkey meat
[01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:10.900]   will do that
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:11.360]   there are other
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:11.900]   foods that have
[01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:12.660]   tryptophan in them
[01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:13.400]   I'm not going
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:14.020]   to bother to list
[01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:14.480]   those off now
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:14.900]   you can simply
[01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:15.420]   look those up
[01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:15.800]   so make sure
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:16.080]   you're getting
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:16.760]   enough tryptophan
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:17.360]   in your diet
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:18.140]   make sure
[01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:18.380]   that you're
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:18.780]   getting enough
[01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:19.420]   low sugar
[01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:20.240]   fermented foods
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:21.060]   or if you're
[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:21.660]   not doing that
[01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:22.000]   and perhaps
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:22.500]   even if you
[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:23.080]   are you
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:23.460]   might think
[01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:24.660]   about supplementing
[01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:25.000]   your diet
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:25.860]   with probiotic
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:26.700]   on occasion
[01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:27.500]   right I'm not
[01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:28.020]   talking about
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:28.780]   constantly taking
[01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:29.580]   high doses
[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:30.400]   of probiotics
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:30.720]   I actually
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:31.300]   don't recommend
[01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:32.380]   that but
[01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:33.240]   for many people
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:33.820]   who are suffering
[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:34.400]   low mood
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:35.340]   supplementing
[01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:35.840]   with a quality
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:36.480]   probiotic
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:36.940]   can actually
[01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:37.780]   improve mood
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:38.800]   and the purported
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:39.600]   mechanism by which
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:40.200]   that happens
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:41.140]   is the increase
[01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:41.860]   in serotonin
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:43.180]   that is allowed
[01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:44.220]   by improving
[01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:45.200]   the gut microbiota
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:45.860]   and including
[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:46.520]   foods with enough
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:47.020]   tryptophan
[01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:47.460]   which is the
[01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:48.120]   precursor to
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:48.780]   serotonin
[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:49.680]   so what I've
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:50.020]   done here
[01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:50.300]   is I've
[01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:50.660]   created
[01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:51.740]   the real
[01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:52.620]   conceptual link
[01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:54.480]   the anatomical
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:54.720]   link
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:55.340]   and the chemical
[01:28:55.340 --> 01:28:55.920]   link between
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:56.400]   the production
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:57.060]   of serotonin
[01:28:57.060 --> 01:28:57.560]   in the gut
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:58.320]   and serotonin
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:28:58.920]   in the brain
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:28:59.780]   and I wouldn't
[01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:00.360]   be talking about
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:00.920]   this if there
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:01.800]   wasn't actually
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:02.620]   data on this
[01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:03.220]   I'll include
[01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:03.800]   links to a few
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:04.440]   papers about
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:05.800]   the and here
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:06.120]   I'm quoting
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:06.520]   the title
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:06.920]   of a great
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:07.340]   paper the
[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:07.840]   interaction
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:08.400]   of the vagus
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:08.760]   nerve and
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:09.300]   serotonin
[01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:09.740]   in the gut
[01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:10.500]   brain axis
[01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:11.600]   there's also
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:12.780]   been at least
[01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:13.440]   one clinical
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:14.220]   trial study
[01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:15.440]   exploring how
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:16.520]   taking probiotics
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:16.880]   and in this
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:17.280]   case it was
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:17.520]   actually
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:18.440]   probiotics
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:18.860]   plus
[01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:19.680]   magnesium
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:20.520]   it was
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:21.000]   magnesium
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:21.700]   orotate
[01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:22.700]   which is
[01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:23.060]   just one
[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:23.360]   form of
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:23.720]   magnesium
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:24.460]   as well
[01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:25.840]   as I would
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:26.200]   say a
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:27.540]   low-ish dose
[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:28.280]   of coenzyme
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:28.740]   Q10
[01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:29.940]   combining those
[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:30.480]   three things
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:31.620]   in this paper
[01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:32.020]   entitled
[01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:32.660]   probiotics
[01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:33.220]   and magnesium
[01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:34.020]   orotate
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:34.940]   it should have
[01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:35.780]   said probiotics
[01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:36.680]   and magnesium
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:37.220]   orotate
[01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:38.020]   and coenzyme
[01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:38.340]   Q10
[01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:38.880]   but the title
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:39.940]   is probiotics
[01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:40.500]   and magnesium
[01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:41.080]   orotate
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:41.600]   for the treatment
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:42.440]   of major
[01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:42.880]   depressive
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:43.320]   disorder
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:43.820]   a randomized
[01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:44.460]   double-blind
[01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:45.260]   control trial
[01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:46.080]   I want to
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:46.820]   emphasize that
[01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:47.840]   the results
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:48.500]   of this
[01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:49.320]   paper show
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:50.540]   that in the
[01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:51.180]   short term
[01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:52.160]   there's an
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:52.740]   improvement
[01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:54.100]   in symptoms
[01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:54.920]   of major
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:55.360]   depression
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:56.180]   that is
[01:29:56.180 --> 01:29:56.880]   symptoms of
[01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:57.540]   major depression
[01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:58.300]   were reduced
[01:29:58.300 --> 01:29:59.120]   through the
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:29:59.560]   administration
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:00.420]   of this
[01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:01.100]   combination
[01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:03.660]   of probiotics
[01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:04.600]   magnesium
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:05.180]   orotate
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:06.340]   and coenzyme
[01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:06.780]   Q10
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:08.520]   however it was
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:09.220]   a short-lived
[01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:09.660]   effect
[01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:10.280]   now it was
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:11.160]   also a short-lived
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:11.700]   treatment
[01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:12.980]   but it was a
[01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:13.740]   short-lived effect
[01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:13.780]   effect
[01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:14.280]   that showed
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:15.240]   up
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:15.820]   in the
[01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:16.740]   essentially
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:17.340]   starting
[01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:17.900]   about the
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:18.580]   four-week
[01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:19.380]   mark
[01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:19.920]   and then carried
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:20.580]   out to 10
[01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:21.100]   and 15
[01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:22.020]   weeks
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:22.480]   the effect
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:23.460]   disappeared
[01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:23.820]   now this is
[01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:24.300]   important
[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:24.980]   because
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:25.700]   what it suggests
[01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:26.500]   is that
[01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:27.300]   in the short-term
[01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:27.860]   if you're seeking
[01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:29.460]   to improve your mood
[01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:30.540]   or if you're suffering
[01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:31.460]   from major depression
[01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:32.180]   please seek help
[01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:32.980]   for major depression
[01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:33.700]   this of course
[01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:34.360]   wouldn't be the only
[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:34.720]   approach
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:35.820]   you don't want to
[01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:36.540]   you know
[01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:37.300]   start being your own
[01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:38.260]   psychiatrist
[01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:38.620]   you know this
[01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:39.500]   treatment very well
[01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:40.180]   could be combined
[01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:40.780]   with things
[01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:41.220]   and should be
[01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:41.580]   combined
[01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:42.260]   probably with things
[01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:43.060]   like exercise
[01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:43.540]   maybe with
[01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:44.100]   pharmacologic
[01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:44.420]   treatment
[01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:45.540]   with antidepressant
[01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:45.760]   drugs
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:46.360]   it really depends
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:47.060]   on the situation
[01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:48.220]   but if you're
[01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:48.860]   somebody who's
[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:49.360]   suffering from
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:49.980]   major depression
[01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:50.640]   or just mild
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:51.000]   depression
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:51.520]   or if you're
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:51.980]   just seeking
[01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:52.880]   to maintain
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:53.760]   healthy serotonin
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:54.080]   levels
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:55.080]   or improve
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:55.440]   your mood
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:55.840]   slightly
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:57.620]   the consumption
[01:30:57.620 --> 01:30:58.440]   of things
[01:30:58.440 --> 01:30:58.980]   that are going
[01:30:58.980 --> 01:30:59.560]   to improve
[01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:00.660]   your gut microbiome
[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:02.440]   absolutely is going
[01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:02.900]   to support
[01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:03.540]   that process
[01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:04.100]   this has been
[01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:04.560]   shown over
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:05.180]   and over again
[01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:05.800]   because the gut
[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:06.520]   microbiota
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:07.540]   create these
[01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:08.140]   short-chain
[01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:08.920]   fatty acids
[01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:09.480]   that are
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:10.580]   critically involved
[01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:11.140]   in this
[01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:12.020]   biochemical pathway
[01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:12.580]   that converts
[01:31:12.580 --> 01:31:13.200]   tryptophan
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:14.280]   into serotonin
[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:15.260]   I'm going to
[01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:15.660]   repeat that
[01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:16.020]   because it's
[01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:16.620]   very important
[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:17.840]   the microbiota
[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:18.280]   of the gut
[01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:18.920]   if they're diverse
[01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:19.320]   and you have
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:19.960]   enough of them
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:21.020]   are going to
[01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:21.480]   produce the
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:21.940]   short-chain
[01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:22.680]   fatty acids
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:23.200]   that are
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:24.180]   critically required
[01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:25.020]   for the conversion
[01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:25.900]   of tryptophan
[01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:26.400]   which again
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:26.780]   is going to
[01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:27.220]   come from your
[01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:27.540]   diet
[01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:28.440]   into the
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:28.960]   serotonin
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:29.520]   of your gut
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:30.180]   which in turn
[01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:30.900]   is going to be
[01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:31.660]   relayed
[01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:32.800]   and it's not
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:33.280]   the actual
[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:33.840]   serotonin
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:34.400]   that's relayed
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:34.720]   but the
[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:35.680]   presence of
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:36.280]   serotonin
[01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:37.220]   at sufficient
[01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:37.980]   levels in the gut
[01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:39.100]   is communicated
[01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:40.180]   by the vagus nerve
[01:31:40.180 --> 01:31:41.100]   up to the
[01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:42.140]   dorsal raphe nucleus
[01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:42.580]   remember there's
[01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:42.980]   some stations
[01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:43.440]   in between
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:43.840]   but it's
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:44.580]   communicated up
[01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:45.180]   to the dorsal
[01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:46.320]   raphe and your
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:47.240]   dorsal raphe then
[01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:48.420]   release a serotonin
[01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:48.960]   in the brain
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:50.180]   again a beautiful
[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:51.640]   coordination of
[01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:52.760]   the body and
[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:53.200]   the brain
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.320]   just as activity
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:55.520]   levels in the body
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:55.920]   and the brain
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:56.380]   are matched
[01:31:56.380 --> 01:31:57.040]   through the vagus
[01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:57.980]   or from the brain
[01:31:57.980 --> 01:31:58.500]   to the body
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:31:59.040]   depending on the
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:31:59.800]   direction of flow
[01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:00.420]   right alertness
[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:00.880]   in the brain
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:01.760]   body becomes alert
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:02.380]   alertness in the
[01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:03.060]   body brain
[01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:03.680]   becomes alert
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:04.800]   serotonin
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:05.800]   elevated in the gut
[01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:08.180]   serotonin elevated
[01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:08.800]   in the brain
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:09.640]   all of that
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:10.420]   happens by way
[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:11.580]   of vagal
[01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:12.020]   signaling
[01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:13.160]   okay so the
[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:14.040]   vagus is involved
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:15.080]   in lots and
[01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:15.700]   lots of things
[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:16.580]   it's not just
[01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:17.000]   for calming
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:17.400]   down
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:18.400]   it's also
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:19.560]   for slowing
[01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:20.120]   the heart rate
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:21.220]   which is related
[01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:21.620]   to calming
[01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:21.960]   down
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:22.680]   but it's
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:23.460]   critically required
[01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:23.920]   for this thing
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:24.320]   that we're calling
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:25.160]   auto-regulation
[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:26.120]   for increasing
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:26.700]   HRV
[01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:27.820]   it's also
[01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:28.460]   involved in
[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:29.160]   increasing levels
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:29.780]   of alertness
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:30.760]   and you can do
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:31.100]   that through
[01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:31.540]   exercise
[01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:32.460]   it's also
[01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:33.140]   involved in
[01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:33.840]   increasing levels
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:34.520]   of serotonin
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:35.020]   in the brain
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:35.680]   you just
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:36.140]   learned about
[01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:36.500]   that
[01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:37.360]   but there is
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:37.820]   as you've
[01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:38.260]   probably heard
[01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:38.620]   before
[01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:39.640]   also a role
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:39.940]   for the
[01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:40.520]   vagus nerve
[01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:41.740]   in calming
[01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:42.400]   down
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:43.600]   now the reason
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:44.180]   i saved this
[01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:44.980]   portion for last
[01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:45.460]   is because
[01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:46.280]   there's just
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:46.720]   so much
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:47.420]   information out
[01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:48.020]   there about
[01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:48.940]   how vagal
[01:32:48.940 --> 01:32:49.420]   activation
[01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:50.040]   calms us
[01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:50.320]   down
[01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:51.800]   and i felt
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:52.320]   it was important
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:53.180]   that i also
[01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:53.880]   focus on some
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:54.260]   of the ways
[01:32:54.260 --> 01:32:54.780]   that vagus
[01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:55.380]   does other
[01:32:55.380 --> 01:32:56.160]   things quite
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:56.840]   robustly
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:57.600]   including
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:58.940]   also enhancing
[01:32:58.940 --> 01:32:59.700]   learning and
[01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:00.380]   plasticity
[01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:02.020]   but i would be
[01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:02.500]   remiss
[01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:03.260]   if i didn't
[01:33:03.260 --> 01:33:03.760]   offer some
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:04.060]   of this
[01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:04.400]   science
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:04.720]   back
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:05.120]   tools
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:05.900]   for
[01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:06.940]   calming
[01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:07.300]   yourself
[01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:07.760]   down
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:08.540]   by engaging
[01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:09.160]   the vagus
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:09.840]   and when i say
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:10.800]   engaging the vagus
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:11.560]   i mean engaging
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:12.380]   very specific
[01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:13.160]   pathways
[01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:14.360]   within the vagus
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:14.880]   circuitry
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:16.180]   you now of course
[01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:16.740]   can appreciate
[01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:17.920]   that the vagus
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:18.200]   nerve
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:19.440]   is a super
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:19.840]   highway
[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:20.620]   bi-directional
[01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:21.300]   super highway
[01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:22.220]   of sensory
[01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:22.860]   and motor
[01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:23.420]   connections
[01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:24.320]   has a ton
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:25.280]   of specificity
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:26.120]   it's signaling
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:27.000]   mechanical and
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:27.720]   chemical information
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:28.320]   it's controlling
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:28.760]   the body
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:29.560]   and yet
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:30.280]   there are
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:31.080]   specific pathways
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:32.400]   that will
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:32.880]   indeed
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:33.760]   calm
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:34.220]   you
[01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:34.880]   down
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:35.920]   if you activate
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:36.180]   them
[01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:37.120]   these are the ones
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:37.640]   that you typically
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:38.680]   hear about at the end
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:39.640]   of yoga classes
[01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:40.600]   that you hear about
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:41.580]   often online
[01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:42.580]   and i don't want to be
[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:43.920]   disparaging of any of that
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:44.340]   in fact
[01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:45.920]   i love love love
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:46.340]   the book
[01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:47.340]   polyvagal theory
[01:33:47.340 --> 01:33:48.220]   by stephen porges
[01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:49.800]   i think it's a beautiful
[01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:50.300]   description
[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:51.900]   of our understanding
[01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:52.920]   about the vagus nerve
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:53.640]   circa
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:54.540]   i don't know
[01:33:54.540 --> 01:33:56.480]   maybe 10-15 years ago
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:57.420]   which is
[01:33:57.420 --> 01:33:58.600]   not disparaging
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:33:58.960]   at all
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:33:59.540]   i think he did
[01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:00.420]   an incredible
[01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:00.920]   job
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:01.660]   of talking
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:01.980]   about
[01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:03.080]   the dorsal
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:03.740]   motor nucleus
[01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:04.300]   of the vagus
[01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:04.700]   which i'll talk
[01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:05.160]   about in a few
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:05.480]   moments
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:06.920]   as a pathway
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:08.200]   for regulation
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:08.700]   of bodily
[01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:09.160]   state
[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:09.940]   for calming
[01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:10.280]   down
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:10.700]   about
[01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:11.740]   the role
[01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:12.680]   of parent-child
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:13.240]   relationships
[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:13.900]   in infancy
[01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:15.240]   and how the vagus
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:15.820]   nerve pathways
[01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:16.600]   are present
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:17.240]   and can be
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:17.840]   activated
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:18.780]   early in life
[01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:19.400]   without any
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:19.860]   learning or
[01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:20.460]   plasticity
[01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:20.940]   and how that's
[01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:21.460]   so critically
[01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:21.900]   important
[01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:23.560]   to the bond
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:24.200]   that's formed
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.140]   between caretaker
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:25.740]   and infant
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:26.280]   and there's just
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:27.240]   a beautiful
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:28.040]   set of studies
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:28.980]   and a beautiful
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:29.680]   set of clinical
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:30.200]   data that he
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:30.960]   describes in that
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:31.680]   book polyvagal
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:31.960]   theory
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:33.080]   as it relates
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:33.680]   to things like
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:34.800]   ptsd etc
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:36.500]   so hats off
[01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:36.920]   kudos
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:38.040]   and much
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:38.480]   respect
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:39.160]   and gratitude
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:40.040]   to stephen porges
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:40.620]   for writing
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:41.500]   polyvagal theory
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:42.920]   most of what i've
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:43.340]   talked about
[01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:43.980]   up until now
[01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:45.500]   are things that
[01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:46.500]   are either touched
[01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:47.280]   on just briefly
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:48.260]   or that are not
[01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:49.120]   included in his
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:49.900]   book on polyvagal
[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:50.140]   theory
[01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:50.780]   mostly because
[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:51.540]   they relate to
[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:51.740]   data
[01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:52.160]   that had been
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:52.700]   accumulated
[01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:53.440]   in the last

[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:54.380]   years
[01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:55.700]   and so there
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:56.060]   was no way
[01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:56.400]   it could be
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:56.940]   in that book
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:58.420]   the ways to
[01:34:58.420 --> 01:34:59.100]   calm down

[01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:03.180]   do indeed
[01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:04.720]   start to mimic
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:05.120]   some of the
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:05.660]   things that we
[01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:06.220]   hear about
[01:35:06.220 --> 01:35:07.380]   in or at

[01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:09.520]   or that we
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:10.220]   think of
[01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:10.680]   in terms

[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:14.160]   now
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:15.280]   this is coming

[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:17.120]   was talking
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:17.880]   about breath
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:18.120]   work
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:18.440]   right
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:18.880]   i was talking
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:19.200]   about

[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:23.280]   we tend
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:23.560]   to call

[01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:30.760]   they might call
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:31.120]   it something
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:31.460]   else
[01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:32.500]   for those of you
[01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:32.960]   that are familiar

[01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:33.620]   you know
[01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:34.620]   that i appreciate
[01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:35.800]   all the lenses
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:37.380]   into ways to be
[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:38.100]   healthier mentally
[01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:38.580]   physically
[01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:39.140]   and in
[01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:40.240]   two ways to
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:40.680]   improve our
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:41.180]   performance
[01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:42.100]   i just happen
[01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:42.500]   to take
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:43.440]   the biological
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:44.660]   typically the
[01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:45.440]   neurobiological
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:46.320]   and physiological
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:47.900]   perspective on
[01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:48.360]   these things
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:49.260]   because i like
[01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:49.680]   to think
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:50.120]   in fact
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:50.880]   i know
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:51.820]   that understanding
[01:35:51.820 --> 01:35:52.400]   mechanism
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:53.100]   gives us
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:53.960]   more agency
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:55.020]   over these
[01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:55.460]   protocols
[01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:56.160]   and practices
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:57.480]   so what i'm going
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:58.260]   to describe next
[01:35:58.260 --> 01:35:59.440]   is my view
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:00.980]   of the specific
[01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:01.520]   practices
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:02.260]   that yes
[01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:02.880]   absolutely
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:03.440]   exist
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:04.840]   in other territories
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:05.680]   related to yogic
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:06.180]   practices
[01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:06.780]   etc
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:08.260]   that have been
[01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:09.420]   purported to
[01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:10.580]   increase levels
[01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:11.580]   of parasympathetic
[01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:12.120]   activation
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:12.740]   by engaging
[01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:13.340]   the vagus
[01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:14.280]   the reason
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:14.840]   i selected
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:15.200]   the things
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:15.540]   i'm about
[01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:16.060]   to tell you
[01:36:16.060 --> 01:36:16.640]   is because
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:17.900]   i ran them
[01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:18.360]   by two
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:18.760]   colleagues
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:19.800]   one who is
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:20.940]   a neurologist
[01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:21.600]   and psychiatrist
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:22.600]   practicing
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:23.700]   the other
[01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:24.520]   who is
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:26.140]   a neurosurgeon
[01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:27.460]   and is very
[01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:28.340]   familiar with
[01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:28.920]   the vagus
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:30.400]   and what i did
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:30.780]   is i said
[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:31.360]   listen there's
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:31.780]   all this stuff
[01:36:31.780 --> 01:36:32.180]   out there
[01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:33.440]   you can hear
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:34.360]   all sorts of
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:35.020]   interesting things
[01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:35.460]   on youtube
[01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:35.880]   and elsewhere
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:36.560]   about ways to
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:36.920]   calm down
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:37.460]   by engaging
[01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:38.020]   the vagus
[01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:39.240]   which of these
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:40.620]   and i basically
[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:41.880]   described five
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:42.940]   which of these
[01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:44.200]   typical five
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:44.660]   practices
[01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:45.240]   do you think
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:46.480]   actually triggers
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:47.800]   activation
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:49.580]   of the specific
[01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:50.280]   nerve fibers
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:50.980]   that would trigger
[01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:51.900]   a parasympathetic
[01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:52.500]   response
[01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:53.700]   and what was
[01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:54.040]   interesting
[01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:54.960]   is that both
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:55.640]   of them said
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:56.900]   actually there are
[01:36:56.900 --> 01:36:57.660]   three of them
[01:36:57.660 --> 01:36:58.840]   that absolutely
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:36:59.780]   trigger activation
[01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:01.560]   of the parasympathetic
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:02.000]   response
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:02.500]   and we know
[01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:02.980]   because we've
[01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:03.880]   recorded from
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:04.380]   those neural
[01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:04.840]   pathways
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:05.740]   and so
[01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:06.740]   it's obvious
[01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:07.780]   that they work
[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:08.500]   so those are
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:08.760]   the three
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:09.180]   that i'm going
[01:37:09.180 --> 01:37:09.740]   to describe
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:11.300]   i want to
[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:11.680]   remind you
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:12.040]   that if
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:12.240]   you want
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:12.540]   to calm
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:12.760]   down
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:13.220]   fast
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:13.820]   the
[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:14.260]   physiological
[01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:14.700]   sigh
[01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:15.120]   is still
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:15.280]   going
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:15.600]   to be
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:15.880]   your
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:16.140]   best
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:16.460]   tool
[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:17.340]   if you want
[01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:17.980]   to improve
[01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:18.620]   hrv
[01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:19.180]   you want
[01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:19.340]   to get
[01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:19.580]   better
[01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:20.440]   auto-regulation
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:20.900]   and you want
[01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:21.340]   your hrv
[01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:21.780]   to improve
[01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:22.160]   in sleep
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:22.600]   as well
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:24.120]   the deliberate
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:24.660]   exhales
[01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:25.080]   from time
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:25.420]   to time
[01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:25.920]   spread throughout
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:26.340]   the day
[01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:27.000]   still going
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:27.340]   to be great
[01:37:27.340 --> 01:37:27.760]   still do
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:28.020]   your high
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:28.320]   intensity
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:28.640]   interval
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:28.940]   training
[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:29.220]   and other
[01:37:29.220 --> 01:37:29.400]   ways
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:29.520]   to
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:29.860]   increase
[01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:30.340]   hrv
[01:37:30.340 --> 01:37:31.100]   but
[01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:31.560]   if you
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:31.840]   want
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:32.280]   to use
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:32.780]   the vagal
[01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:33.200]   pathways
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:33.880]   to calm
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:34.160]   down
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:34.880]   here
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:35.080]   are
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:35.440]   the three
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:35.700]   best
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:36.020]   ways
[01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:36.500]   that
[01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:36.640]   are
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:37.160]   supported
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:37.620]   by the
[01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:38.300]   neurophysiology
[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:39.000]   in humans
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.180]   that I'm going
[01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:40.500]   to tell you
[01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:40.700]   about
[01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:41.340]   the first
[01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:42.000]   capitalizes
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:42.640]   on the fact
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:43.660]   that a major
[01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:44.400]   branch of the
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:44.820]   vagus
[01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:46.540]   that extends
[01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:47.100]   out of the
[01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:47.640]   brainstem
[01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:48.540]   and that
[01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:49.340]   includes a lot
[01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:49.640]   of those
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:50.680]   sensory afferents
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:51.620]   those axons
[01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:52.980]   coursing up
[01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:53.760]   from the body
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:54.780]   to the brainstem
[01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:56.660]   runs along
[01:37:56.660 --> 01:37:57.180]   a portion
[01:37:57.180 --> 01:37:57.740]   of the neck
[01:37:57.740 --> 01:37:58.420]   that's deep
[01:37:58.420 --> 01:37:58.860]   to the
[01:37:58.860 --> 01:37:59.580]   muscle
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:37:59.960]   that's going
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:00.280]   to stick
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:00.700]   out if you
[01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:01.140]   turn your
[01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:01.500]   head to
[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:02.240]   one side
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:02.780]   now I'm
[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:03.220]   specifically
[01:38:03.220 --> 01:38:03.680]   avoiding
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:04.740]   the muscle
[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:05.700]   and vasculature
[01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:06.320]   nomenclature
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:06.760]   right now
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:07.240]   because we've
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:07.680]   already had
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:07.980]   so many
[01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:08.320]   terms
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:08.960]   this episode
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:09.860]   and it's
[01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:10.180]   really not
[01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:10.540]   necessary
[01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:11.080]   to understand
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:11.320]   how to
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:11.660]   use these
[01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:12.060]   practices
[01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:12.640]   but
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:13.480]   were you
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:13.960]   to say
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:15.060]   lie down
[01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:15.640]   or even
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:16.160]   just sit
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:17.000]   at a
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:17.680]   table surface
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:18.200]   like I am
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:18.500]   now
[01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:18.940]   for those
[01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:19.080]   of you
[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:19.220]   that are
[01:38:19.220 --> 01:38:19.460]   listening
[01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:19.840]   I'm just
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:20.360]   seated
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:20.740]   in front
[01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:20.980]   of my
[01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:21.260]   desk
[01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:21.540]   I'm
[01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:21.680]   putting
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:21.940]   my
[01:38:21.940 --> 01:38:22.520]   hands
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:23.060]   palms
[01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:23.520]   down
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:24.560]   my
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:24.900]   elbows
[01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:25.240]   at the
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:25.460]   edge
[01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:25.660]   of the
[01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:25.940]   table
[01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:26.780]   and
[01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:27.140]   what I'm
[01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:27.260]   going
[01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:27.500]   to do
[01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:27.840]   next
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:28.320]   is I'm
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:28.520]   going
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:29.540]   to push
[01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:29.860]   my
[01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:30.320]   elbows
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:31.160]   down
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:32.400]   and away
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:32.940]   from my
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:33.320]   ears
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:34.980]   then I'm
[01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:35.280]   going to
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:35.780]   turn my
[01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:36.460]   head up
[01:38:36.460 --> 01:38:37.140]   and to
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:37.680]   the right
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:38.860]   and I'm
[01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:39.000]   going to
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:39.360]   talk while
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:39.620]   I'm doing
[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:39.840]   it but
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:40.140]   you wouldn't
[01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:40.600]   want to
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:42.440]   and when
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:42.960]   one does
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:43.520]   that you
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:44.600]   feel a
[01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:44.980]   kind of
[01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:46.040]   stretch
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:46.920]   both on
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:47.440]   the outside
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:47.960]   of the neck
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:48.460]   so that's
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:48.860]   on the
[01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:49.180]   left hand
[01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:49.660]   side as
[01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:50.000]   well as
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:50.620]   in particular
[01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:51.140]   on the
[01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:51.780]   right hand
[01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:52.200]   side
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:53.360]   okay
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:54.720]   and it's
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:55.100]   important to
[01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:55.400]   keep your
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:55.740]   elbows
[01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:56.460]   pushing down
[01:38:56.460 --> 01:38:56.800]   and you're
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:57.260]   looking up
[01:38:57.260 --> 01:38:57.520]   into the
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:57.660]   right
[01:38:57.660 --> 01:38:57.940]   and then you
[01:38:57.940 --> 01:38:58.140]   do it
[01:38:58.140 --> 01:38:58.320]   to the
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:38:58.480]   other
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:38:58.720]   side
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:38:58.980]   you go
[01:38:58.980 --> 01:38:59.180]   up
[01:38:59.180 --> 01:38:59.320]   and
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:38:59.360]   to
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:38:59.520]   the
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:38:59.780]   left
[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:00.380]   yes
[01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:00.800]   this is
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:01.060]   looking
[01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:01.520]   a lot
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:01.880]   like
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:02.360]   yoga
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:04.360]   but
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:05.140]   this is
[01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:05.860]   not
[01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:06.220]   yoga
[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:07.180]   this is
[01:39:07.180 --> 01:39:09.600]   a way
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:11.140]   of mechanically
[01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:11.880]   activating
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:13.100]   some of the
[01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:13.560]   fibers
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:14.720]   that course
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:15.400]   along the
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:16.080]   vasculature
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:16.520]   and the
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:17.000]   musculature
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:17.660]   at the side
[01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:18.160]   of the neck
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:19.420]   that is
[01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:20.120]   a major
[01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:20.520]   pathway
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:20.840]   of the
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:21.240]   vagus
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:21.820]   now I
[01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:22.180]   had to
[01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:22.740]   ask my
[01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:23.960]   neurosurgeon
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:24.560]   and
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:25.620]   neurophysiology
[01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:26.260]   friends
[01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:27.520]   does this
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:28.060]   actually
[01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:28.660]   activate
[01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:28.860]   the
[01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:29.180]   vagus
[01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:29.460]   nerve
[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:30.300]   and
[01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:30.440]   they
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:30.680]   said
[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:31.240]   yes
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:31.600]   to
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:31.880]   some
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:32.200]   degree
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:32.580]   it's
[01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:33.400]   mechanically
[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:33.800]   going to
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:34.160]   activate
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:34.680]   some of
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:34.940]   those
[01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:36.240]   fibers
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:36.680]   some of
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:37.360]   those axons
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.400]   is it going to
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:38.900]   activate the
[01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:39.600]   calming pathways
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:40.320]   of your vagus
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:41.620]   nerve as much as
[01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:42.220]   say electrical
[01:39:42.220 --> 01:39:43.060]   stimulation of your
[01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:43.520]   vagus nerve
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:44.980]   no it's not
[01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:46.460]   electrical stimulation
[01:39:46.460 --> 01:39:47.120]   of the vagus nerve
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:48.040]   is used for
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:48.700]   major depression
[01:39:48.700 --> 01:39:50.100]   it's also used
[01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:51.220]   using different
[01:39:51.220 --> 01:39:51.740]   patterns of
[01:39:51.740 --> 01:39:52.100]   stimulation
[01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:52.600]   frequency
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:53.300]   to calm people
[01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:54.060]   down it can be
[01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:54.900]   used for a number
[01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:55.400]   of different things
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:56.120]   depending on the way
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:57.260]   stimulation is done
[01:39:57.260 --> 01:39:58.780]   and where it's done
[01:39:58.780 --> 01:39:59.640]   along the vagus nerve
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:00.140]   pathways
[01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:01.180]   however
[01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:03.700]   this basically
[01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:04.880]   mechanical activation
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:06.220]   of this vagus nerve
[01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:06.700]   pathway
[01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:07.960]   it doesn't just feel
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:08.500]   good because you're
[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:09.240]   stretching your neck
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:09.480]   out
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:11.160]   it does indeed
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:12.300]   activate some of
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:13.520]   the sensory
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:14.280]   and probably some of
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:15.340]   the motor fibers as
[01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:16.060]   well that course
[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:16.900]   through the vagus
[01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:17.140]   nerve
[01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:18.080]   and keep in mind
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:18.720]   this is interesting
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:19.460]   that the majority
[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:20.520]   of the parasympathetic
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.360]   effect of mechanically
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:23.820]   activating those vagal
[01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:24.780]   nerve fibers is going
[01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:25.560]   to be on the right
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:26.220]   hand side
[01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:27.080]   i know this is
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:27.620]   starting to sound a
[01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:28.620]   little bit like yoga
[01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:29.640]   classes where they say
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:30.560]   hey you know breathing
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:31.160]   through your left
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:31.980]   nostril or your right
[01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:33.480]   nostril is going to
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:34.880]   reflect sympathetic
[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:35.920]   or parasympathetic
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:36.520]   activation
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:37.840]   guess what
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:38.580]   when we had
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:39.240]   noam sobel
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:40.080]   one of the world's
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:40.880]   foremost experts
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:41.620]   on olfaction
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:43.000]   and basically
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:43.760]   sniffing and
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:44.100]   breathing
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:45.100]   and its effects
[01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:45.600]   on the brain
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:46.440]   on the podcast
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:47.680]   he indeed told us
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:48.480]   that the switching
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:49.160]   back and forth
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:49.820]   between right
[01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:50.260]   and left
[01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:50.840]   nostril
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:51.280]   dominance
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:51.840]   is indeed
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:52.240]   governed
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:53.120]   by changes
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:54.600]   in that seesaw
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:55.340]   of the autonomic
[01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:55.860]   nervous system
[01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:56.540]   it switches over
[01:40:56.540 --> 01:40:57.280]   i believe once
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:58.560]   about every 90 minutes
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:40:59.560]   incredible right
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:00.420]   obviously impacted
[01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:01.340]   if you have a deviated
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:02.020]   septum etc
[01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:03.020]   so the stuff that
[01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:03.640]   comes from yogic
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:04.020]   tradition
[01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:04.700]   while it might not
[01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:06.060]   be mechanistically
[01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:06.580]   accurate
[01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:07.240]   and it sometimes
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:08.040]   includes other
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:08.840]   things that are
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:09.580]   unrelated to the
[01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:09.940]   mechanism
[01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:10.840]   oftentimes
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:11.780]   it's pretty
[01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:12.680]   spot on
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:14.320]   so if you want
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:14.980]   to calm down
[01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:15.460]   and you want to
[01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:15.900]   do that by
[01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:16.420]   activating your
[01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:16.700]   vagus
[01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:17.200]   you already know
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:17.820]   a bunch of ways
[01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:18.360]   you can do that
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:18.880]   we talked about
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:19.060]   it
[01:41:19.060 --> 01:41:20.580]   the ear thing
[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:21.440]   the exhale thing
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:21.740]   etc
[01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:23.060]   physiological size
[01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:25.460]   but this simple process
[01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:26.420]   of looking up
[01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:28.420]   and to the right
[01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:30.940]   and then up
[01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:31.420]   and to the left
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:31.780]   and the reason
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:32.200]   for doing it
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:32.600]   both sides
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:33.040]   is you'll feel
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:33.520]   a stretch
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:34.040]   on one side
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:34.700]   then a contraction
[01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:35.440]   on the other
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:36.460]   doing that a few
[01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:37.360]   times back and forth
[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:37.820]   indeed
[01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:38.840]   can lead to a
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:39.500]   calmer state
[01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:39.900]   following
[01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:41.220]   how robust
[01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:41.780]   that is
[01:41:41.780 --> 01:41:42.940]   it's going to
[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:43.900]   depend on a lot
[01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:44.440]   of factors
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:45.060]   frankly
[01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:46.000]   I don't think
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:46.920]   it's as robust
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:47.940]   as the physiological
[01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:48.840]   sigh or exhale
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:49.280]   emphasized
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:49.780]   breathing
[01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:50.580]   I don't think
[01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:51.280]   it's as fast
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:51.760]   but nonetheless
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:52.700]   it is supported
[01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:53.360]   by the anatomy
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:53.960]   it's supported
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:54.620]   by the function
[01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:55.520]   and a lot of people
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:56.720]   simply like to stretch
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:58.320]   so I'd be remiss
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:41:59.100]   if I didn't include
[01:41:59.100 --> 01:41:59.360]   that
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:00.340]   the other way
[01:42:00.340 --> 01:42:00.980]   that you can
[01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:01.700]   calm down
[01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:02.400]   by way of
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:03.040]   incorporating
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:03.720]   vagus nerve
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:04.220]   activation
[01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:04.820]   and you can do
[01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:05.880]   that non-invasively
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:06.840]   is the following
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:07.520]   all right
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:08.020]   this one
[01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:08.560]   again
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:09.760]   verified
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:10.500]   with
[01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:11.620]   people who are
[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:12.080]   expert
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:12.820]   in these
[01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:13.760]   specific pathways
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:14.540]   in humans
[01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:15.540]   and
[01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:16.540]   I know
[01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:16.980]   it might not
[01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:17.320]   sound
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:18.340]   neuroscientific
[01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:19.120]   but believe
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:19.620]   it or not
[01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:20.220]   there's stuff
[01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:20.940]   that you hear
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:22.120]   no pun intended
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:23.100]   about humming
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:24.540]   and activation
[01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:25.460]   of the vagus nerve
[01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:26.480]   and calming
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:27.220]   down by way
[01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:27.680]   of humming
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:28.340]   because of the way
[01:42:28.340 --> 01:42:28.780]   it impacts
[01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:29.500]   the vagus nerve
[01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:30.500]   turns out
[01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:31.440]   to be true
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:32.280]   however
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:33.480]   and get this
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:34.040]   you actually have
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:34.600]   to hum
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:35.480]   correctly
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:36.280]   now
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:37.100]   you might think
[01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:37.800]   humming is just
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:40.460]   that's not
[01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:41.100]   what we're talking
[01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:41.540]   about here
[01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:42.940]   what we're talking
[01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:43.440]   about here
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:44.260]   is
[01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:44.960]   again
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:45.680]   mechanically
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:46.560]   through vibration
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:47.360]   activating
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:47.820]   the branches
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:48.480]   of the vagus
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:49.600]   that innervate
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:50.300]   the larynx
[01:42:50.300 --> 01:42:50.720]   and now
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:51.300]   keep in mind
[01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:52.560]   some of the neurons
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:53.020]   in nucleus
[01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:53.400]   ambiguous
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:54.060]   that carry
[01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:54.540]   neurons
[01:42:54.540 --> 01:42:54.940]   that are
[01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:55.420]   officially
[01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:56.440]   members
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:57.100]   of the vagus
[01:42:57.100 --> 01:42:57.360]   nerve
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:58.560]   they travel
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:42:59.220]   with neurons
[01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:00.040]   that are not
[01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:00.520]   officially
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:01.060]   members of
[01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:01.440]   the vagus
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:02.040]   but they travel
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:02.520]   together
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:03.260]   from nucleus
[01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:03.640]   ambiguous
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:04.540]   to a lot
[01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:05.200]   of the speech
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:05.720]   machinery
[01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:07.280]   in your throat
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:08.180]   and in your mouth
[01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:09.300]   and with your tongue
[01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:09.980]   and your lips
[01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:10.260]   okay
[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:11.080]   that's a discussion
[01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:11.680]   for an entirely
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:12.460]   different podcast
[01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:13.640]   but it turns out
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:14.840]   if you view the hum
[01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:15.780]   through the perspective
[01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:17.860]   of that it's an h
[01:43:17.860 --> 01:43:18.820]   and an m
[01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:19.220]   right
[01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:19.800]   hmm
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:20.420]   right
[01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:22.700]   that if you want
[01:43:22.700 --> 01:43:23.240]   to activate
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:24.280]   this vagal pathway
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:25.560]   to calm down
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:26.880]   the way to hum
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:27.520]   correctly
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:28.620]   sounds wild
[01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:29.480]   but the way to hum
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:29.920]   correctly
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:30.540]   is actually
[01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:31.280]   to extend
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:32.360]   the h part
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:33.640]   not the m
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:34.500]   i talked to somebody
[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:35.120]   who's expert
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:35.940]   in speech
[01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:36.800]   neurophysiology
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:37.580]   and it's because
[01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:38.340]   the h part
[01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:38.620]   the
[01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:41.460]   is different
[01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:41.900]   than the
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:43.100]   part
[01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:43.300]   the
[01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:44.220]   is slightly
[01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:45.120]   higher frequency
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:46.080]   and actually
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:46.640]   if you notice
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:47.060]   if you do
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:48.040]   an extended
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:48.780]   h hum
[01:43:48.780 --> 01:43:49.400]   and then
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:50.080]   an m hum
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:50.480]   after
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:50.960]   you'll notice
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:51.620]   that it shifts
[01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:52.840]   from the back
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:53.340]   and deeper
[01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:54.280]   parts of your throat
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:55.180]   which is where
[01:43:55.180 --> 01:43:56.140]   the vagal activation
[01:43:56.140 --> 01:43:56.780]   comes from
[01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:58.380]   to sort of
[01:43:58.380 --> 01:43:59.000]   further up
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:43:59.740]   along your speech
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:00.060]   pathway
[01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:00.800]   toward your mouth
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:02.260]   and your lips
[01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:03.120]   so just give
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:03.660]   that a try
[01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:04.260]   for a second
[01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:04.780]   maybe you have
[01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:05.120]   to do this
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:05.540]   in private
[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:06.100]   because otherwise
[01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:06.480]   it'd be too
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:06.880]   embarrassing
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:07.300]   but you
[01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:08.780]   it's incredibly
[01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:09.160]   calming
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:09.920]   i did this earlier
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:10.880]   and i was really
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:12.300]   positively surprised
[01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:13.200]   how well it worked
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:14.480]   it's basically this
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:15.880]   you're trying to get
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:16.660]   the vibration
[01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:17.320]   to move
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:18.240]   from the back
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:18.920]   of your throat
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:20.180]   down your neck
[01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:21.180]   into your chest
[01:44:21.180 --> 01:44:22.140]   and even into your belly
[01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:22.900]   and diaphragm
[01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:23.920]   so it goes like this
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:31.780]   if you want to know
[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:32.460]   what it's like
[01:44:32.460 --> 01:44:33.360]   from a sensation
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:33.920]   perspective
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:35.420]   think about gargling
[01:44:35.420 --> 01:44:36.820]   this is getting
[01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:37.580]   crazier and crazier
[01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:38.020]   toward the end
[01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:38.540]   of this podcast
[01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:39.600]   but indeed
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:40.800]   if you look online
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:41.340]   gargling
[01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:42.080]   has been proposed
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:42.620]   as a way
[01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:43.280]   to activate
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:44.660]   the calming aspects
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:46.060]   so-called parasympathetic
[01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:46.440]   aspects
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:47.360]   of the vagus nerve
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:47.880]   and indeed
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:48.980]   when you gargle
[01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:49.660]   you're using
[01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:50.140]   the back
[01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:50.820]   of your throat
[01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:52.100]   that's the sensation
[01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:53.120]   it's this vibration
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:53.680]   at the back
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:54.100]   of your throat
[01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:54.860]   so when you hum
[01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:56.540]   emphasizing the h part
[01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:57.280]   of the hmm
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:58.800]   and leaving off
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:44:59.580]   the m part
[01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:00.000]   it's
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:05.160]   and you can actually
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:06.400]   move the vibration
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:07.620]   down into your chest
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:08.340]   i find it's easier
[01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:09.220]   if i'm lying down
[01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:11.060]   and when you do that
[01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:13.580]   it's quite remarkable
[01:45:13.580 --> 01:45:15.400]   how fast you calm down
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:16.440]   but give this a try
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:17.300]   i know it might seem
[01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:17.900]   a little silly
[01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:18.960]   but if you want
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:20.160]   to try and really
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:21.520]   deeply relax
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:23.300]   this extended humming
[01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:23.880]   that you're trying
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:24.720]   to move down
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:25.880]   further and further
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:27.640]   from say
[01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:28.280]   your lips
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:28.760]   to the back
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:29.300]   of your throat
[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:30.420]   to deeper
[01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:30.880]   in your throat
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:31.860]   near your adam's apple
[01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:32.920]   to your chest region
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:34.760]   even into your abdomen
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:36.220]   and your diaphragm
[01:45:36.220 --> 01:45:36.700]   you'll notice
[01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:37.540]   that it really
[01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:38.380]   really calms you down
[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:39.060]   this is also
[01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:40.120]   it turns out
[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:40.600]   because i talked
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:40.980]   to somebody
[01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:42.180]   who is a singer
[01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:42.900]   this is the way
[01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:43.820]   that singers
[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:44.620]   often will
[01:45:44.620 --> 01:45:45.660]   start to
[01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:46.600]   relax
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:47.400]   in order to get
[01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:47.760]   into some
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:48.220]   of the deeper
[01:45:48.220 --> 01:45:49.020]   frequency notes
[01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:49.440]   that they need
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:49.700]   to hit
[01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:50.340]   with their voice
[01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:51.480]   as you've probably
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:52.600]   observed high notes
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:53.300]   sort of bring people
[01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:54.820]   up into their head
[01:45:54.820 --> 01:45:55.680]   and up even if
[01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:55.980]   they're using
[01:45:55.980 --> 01:45:56.680]   their diaphragm
[01:45:56.680 --> 01:45:57.480]   higher and higher
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:57.940]   and higher
[01:45:57.940 --> 01:45:59.080]   whereas lower
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:00.000]   frequency sounds
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:00.980]   deeper and deeper
[01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:01.620]   and it's just
[01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:02.720]   mechanical activation
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:03.880]   of the particular
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:04.560]   branches of the
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:04.940]   vagus
[01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:06.360]   that are able
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:07.160]   to drive this
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:08.000]   parasympathetic
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:08.580]   response
[01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:09.680]   and if you
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:10.440]   notice
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:11.580]   the hum
[01:46:11.580 --> 01:46:12.540]   is like
[01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:13.340]   all speech
[01:46:13.340 --> 01:46:14.960]   and exhale
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:16.100]   it's a long
[01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:16.900]   slow exhale
[01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:17.860]   so this is the
[01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:18.280]   third part
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:18.780]   there's also
[01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:19.600]   a collateral
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:20.400]   activation
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:21.080]   which is just
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:22.420]   neuroscience speak
[01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:23.520]   for activation
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:24.800]   of that deceleration
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:25.520]   pathway
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:26.460]   when you do
[01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:27.020]   this humming
[01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:28.000]   at the back
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:28.480]   of your throat
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:28.880]   and down
[01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:29.560]   into your chest
[01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:30.320]   and into your belly
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:31.460]   you're also getting
[01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:32.160]   the same effect
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:32.620]   that you get
[01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:33.160]   with an exhale
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:34.080]   which is to slow
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:34.860]   the heart rate
[01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:35.440]   way
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:36.220]   way
[01:46:36.220 --> 01:46:37.440]   down
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:38.820]   so it turns out
[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:39.480]   the stuff they say
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:40.000]   at retreats
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:40.740]   in yoga classes
[01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:42.920]   is mechanistically
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:43.580]   supported
[01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:44.840]   at least some of it is
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:46.160]   and some of it
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:47.080]   perhaps isn't
[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:47.760]   and that doesn't
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:48.640]   really matter right now
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:49.480]   what we're talking about
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:50.940]   is the incredible
[01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:51.800]   pathway
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:52.840]   the incredible
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:53.660]   neural circuit
[01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:54.520]   that is
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:55.580]   the vagus nerve
[01:46:55.580 --> 01:46:56.400]   in fact calling it
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:57.220]   the vagus nerve
[01:46:57.220 --> 01:46:58.380]   you now realize
[01:46:58.380 --> 01:46:59.120]   as I talked about
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:46:59.420]   at the beginning
[01:46:59.420 --> 01:46:59.960]   of the episode
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:00.840]   is really not
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:01.200]   sufficient
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:02.320]   to encapsulate
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:04.060]   the incredible
[01:47:04.060 --> 01:47:05.600]   variety
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:06.040]   of different
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:06.520]   pathways
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:07.420]   the sensory
[01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:08.000]   stuff up
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:08.660]   from the body
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:09.220]   the motor
[01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:09.820]   stuff down
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:10.480]   from the brain
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:11.100]   the way you can
[01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:11.640]   calm down
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:12.220]   the way you can
[01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:13.560]   alert yourself
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:14.760]   the relationship
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:15.440]   and pairing
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:16.420]   of serotonin levels
[01:47:16.420 --> 01:47:17.060]   in the gut
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:18.200]   through the microbiome
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:19.020]   and what you eat
[01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:19.800]   and the tryptophan
[01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:20.720]   with serotonin levels
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:21.260]   in the brain
[01:47:21.260 --> 01:47:21.860]   and mood
[01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:23.680]   and neuroplasticity
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:24.160]   and learning
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:25.800]   and to be fair
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:27.280]   we didn't even
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:27.900]   cover everything
[01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:28.660]   that the vagus nerve
[01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:29.060]   does
[01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:29.680]   there's this whole
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:30.140]   landscape
[01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:31.300]   of electrical
[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:31.880]   stimulation
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:32.680]   of the vagus nerve
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:33.740]   transcranial magnetic
[01:47:33.740 --> 01:47:34.280]   stimulation
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:34.800]   of the parts
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:35.260]   of the brain
[01:47:35.260 --> 01:47:35.880]   like the dorsal
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:37.120]   lateral prefrontal
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:37.460]   cortex
[01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:38.820]   that allow you
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:39.640]   to engage
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:40.500]   more plasticity
[01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:40.920]   and control
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:42.000]   over autoregulation
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.280]   that stuff
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:43.900]   all requires
[01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:44.520]   devices
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:45.560]   and a physician
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:46.680]   or a laboratory
[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:47.380]   to deliver
[01:47:47.380 --> 01:47:48.060]   so I focused
[01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:48.560]   on the things
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:49.500]   that you can do
[01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:50.780]   to activate
[01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:51.340]   your vagus
[01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:51.840]   in the various
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:52.420]   ways that's
[01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:52.900]   going to serve
[01:47:52.900 --> 01:47:53.360]   you best
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:53.800]   in terms of
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:54.320]   mental health
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:54.980]   physical health
[01:47:54.980 --> 01:47:55.640]   and performance
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:56.620]   and I like
[01:47:56.620 --> 01:47:56.920]   to think
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:57.740]   that you also
[01:47:57.740 --> 01:47:58.540]   learned a lot
[01:47:58.540 --> 01:47:59.620]   about the vagus
[01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:00.380]   nerve biology
[01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:01.460]   both structurally
[01:48:01.460 --> 01:48:02.340]   and functionally
[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:03.020]   I personally
[01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:03.580]   find it to be
[01:48:03.580 --> 01:48:04.480]   one of the most
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:05.300]   incredible aspects
[01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:05.880]   of the nervous
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:06.220]   system
[01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:07.060]   it exists
[01:48:07.060 --> 01:48:07.960]   in all mammals
[01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:08.680]   it's also
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:10.200]   in non-mammalian
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:10.760]   vertebrates
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:12.600]   but it's definitely
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:14.200]   in us humans
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:15.460]   and it's absolutely
[01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:16.420]   active from the time
[01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:16.900]   we're born
[01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:18.740]   until the very last
[01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:19.420]   breath we take
[01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:20.460]   in hopefully
[01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:21.540]   late late age
[01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:22.720]   and it's just
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:23.840]   a miraculous pathway
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:24.840]   nature
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:26.580]   created this
[01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:27.300]   vagus nerve
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:27.640]   thing
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:29.180]   and you can
[01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:29.780]   control it
[01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:31.140]   and understanding
[01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:31.720]   the mechanisms
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:32.520]   by which you
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:33.180]   can control it
[01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:33.800]   I do believe
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:34.940]   is the best way
[01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:35.760]   to go about it
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:36.960]   so thank you
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:37.500]   for joining me
[01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:38.580]   on this mechanistic
[01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:39.580]   slash practical
[01:48:39.580 --> 01:48:39.980]   voyage
[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:41.060]   through the vagus
[01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:41.320]   nerve
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:42.440]   I'm enchanted
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:43.080]   by the vagus
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:43.340]   nerve
[01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:44.420]   and I like to
[01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:44.860]   think that
[01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:45.640]   you might be

[01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:20.500]   I do read

[01:49:21.260 --> 01:49:22.100]   for those of you
[01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:22.640]   that haven't heard
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:23.360]   I have a new book
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:23.840]   coming out
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:24.740]   it's my very first
[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:25.020]   book
[01:49:25.020 --> 01:49:26.120]   it's entitled
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:26.940]   Protocols
[01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:27.920]   an Operating Manual
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:28.940]   for the Human Body
[01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:29.540]   this is a book
[01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:30.120]   that I've been working
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:30.600]   on for more than
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:31.300]   five years
[01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:31.940]   and that's based
[01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:32.440]   on more than
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:33.240]   30 years
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:34.360]   of research
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:35.080]   and experience
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:35.880]   and it covers
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:36.380]   protocols
[01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:36.920]   for everything
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:37.740]   from sleep
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:39.020]   to exercise
[01:49:39.020 --> 01:49:40.540]   to stress control
[01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:41.300]   protocols
[01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:42.300]   related to focus
[01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:42.920]   and motivation
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:43.940]   and of course
[01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:44.580]   I provide
[01:49:44.580 --> 01:49:45.600]   the scientific
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:46.460]   substantiation
