[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.780]   All right.
[00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.680]   I think we have time for one more deep work question.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.840]   And this one comes from Michael1729.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.040]   I always like when people use their birth year
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.360]   as part of their name.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.520]   So it's good to see you here, Michael.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.320]   He asked about the importance of plan B
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.320]   rather than focusing all efforts on one career path.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.000]   There's a detailed elaboration here
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.400]   that I think is kind of important.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.440]   Let's get some context.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.560]   Michael is from South Africa.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.040]   He's an undergrad.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.880]   So he's studying mathematics at a quote unquote
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.440]   "little known university" with no option
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.000]   to do undergrad research or take advanced courses.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.960]   He loves pure maths.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.560]   I love how UK and other places, other English speaking places,
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.360]   it's maths, by the way, not math.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.960]   And I fantasize about doing research one day.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.480]   So he's identified a career path of being a maths professor
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.500]   at a research university to be their ideal pursuit.
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.580]   By the way, if you apply to an American university,
[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.880]   don't call it maths professor.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.800]   We don't use that terminology.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.200]   He has a lot of pressures on himself to get top grades.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.440]   But anyways, he's worried.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.240]   Here's the crux of his elaboration.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.880]   He's worried that this particular plan he's hatching
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.320]   for somehow escaping from this little known university
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.920]   in South Africa and making it to a top university
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.760]   and being a maths professor is not going to work out.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.920]   And he's saying, should I have a plan B?
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.040]   He feels that having a plan B might lead him to slack off
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.640]   his ambitious vision of being a maths professor.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.000]   But also he's very worried that that might not happen.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.720]   And then is he going to just be stuck?
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.360]   All right, and then he says at the end,
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.680]   your books have changed my life.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.560]   And you're the reason I got into my degree
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.720]   from failing in high school.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.760]   Thank you for everything you've done
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.440]   for students around the world.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.520]   So I just threw that in to make myself feel better.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.680]   All right, Michael, this is a good question.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.980]   And I think one way to approach it
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.960]   is to go back to my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You,
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.920]   and extract out of there the main framework I give
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.060]   for thinking about careers.
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.140]   Because the whole point about the framework I give
[00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.200]   in that book is to move you conceptually away
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.760]   from thinking in terms of specific jobs
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.480]   as the primary unit that you're dealing with in your planning.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.280]   This is how most people think about careers.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.400]   This is how you're thinking about career.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.000]   You're saying, OK, I'm looking at this option, which
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.480]   is being a maths professor at this type of school.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.520]   Is that the wrong option?
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.520]   Should I have a second option that I'm working on?
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.780]   The framework in my book says that's not the right way
[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.280]   to think about career satisfaction.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.680]   The things that make up career satisfaction,
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.920]   that meaning, passion for your work,
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.320]   that's going to come from elements of your job,
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.720]   attributes, things like autonomy and impact and mastery,
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.680]   connection to other people, impact on the world.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.320]   The exact mix of attributes that would
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.920]   make a particular career really meaningful for you
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.280]   could be quite specific to you.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.960]   But it's not specific to a particular job.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.520]   These are non-job-specific career attributes.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.040]   How do you get these attributes?
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.880]   Well, you have to think about them in a financial market
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.360]   metaphorical sense, that they are valuable attributes.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.520]   Lots of people want them in their job.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.600]   So you have to have something valuable to offer in return.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.220]   And so the idea I give in that book
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.880]   is that you want to acquire what I call career capital, which
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.040]   is my term for rare and valuable skills.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.280]   So as you develop skills that are valuable to the marketplace,
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.240]   you can then, in essence, exchange that career capital
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.480]   for attributes in your working life
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.900]   that make that working life something that resonates more,
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.160]   that makes it something that's more enjoyable and satisfying.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.720]   So the whole game in this framework
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.280]   is acquiring as much career capital as possible
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.040]   in strategic ways so it's as valuable as possible,
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.040]   and then having the courage and foresight
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.640]   to invest that capital to keep taking control of your career,
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.320]   moving it towards what resonates and away from what doesn't.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.920]   That's what you're focusing on.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.800]   Now, in that particular approach,
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.360]   the actual job you end up doing or how that unfolds
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.860]   could change.
[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.980]   Maybe this doesn't work out, that works out better,
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.240]   you see a better opportunity over here,
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.860]   and in some sense, that's not the point
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.440]   because your focus is on these are the attributes I
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.360]   want in my career.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.280]   And what is my current levels of career capital
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.320]   I can apply towards that?
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.340]   How do I get more?
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.840]   So when you think about it that way,
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.600]   what you're doing now at your university
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.960]   where you're trying to get top grades,
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.380]   you're trying to specialize and be
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.440]   a star student in your program, don't think about it
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.200]   as this is my swing to get this one particular job.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.400]   Think about it instead as I am trying
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.080]   to acquire as much career capital
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.440]   as I can at this early stage in my career.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.720]   Now, one of the things I might be able to invest this in
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.080]   is in getting a graduate student position at a really
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.100]   good university, and that's going to be, again,
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.080]   that's going to be interesting job.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.320]   It's going to be intellectually demanding of autonomy,
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.880]   and if I can really stand out there,
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.520]   then maybe I'll have enough capital to get a professor job.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.360]   But you know what?
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.020]   Maybe that doesn't happen, but then you
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.000]   can apply the capital you have towards something else that
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.520]   resonates and move away from things that don't.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.920]   You're going to have unpredictability
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.240]   on how this path unfolds, but if you keep coming at it
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.880]   from the perspective of I know what resonates with me
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.480]   and what I don't like, and I'm constantly
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.480]   trying to get more of the good stuff in my career
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.520]   and less of the stuff I don't like in my career.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.480]   If I hate the idea of having a boss telling me
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.480]   what to do and deadlines, then all of my focus
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.920]   is going to be on how do I build up skills that I can keep
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.520]   leveraging to get away from that environment.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.480]   Or maybe if what you want is high excitement
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.480]   and to be involved in big deals and to have high stakes
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.760]   money on the line, and you don't care about deadlines,
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.760]   you like that, then you're building up skills
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.080]   and applying them somewhere differently.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.080]   What type of job can I get with my current skills
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.040]   that gets me closer to that?
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.200]   How do I build up more skills there
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.800]   to move to something even better?
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.920]   But the key thing that unifies all these approaches
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.600]   is you're looking at the attributes you want,
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.440]   you're building up skills, you're leveraging the skills.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.720]   It's fine to have particular ideas in mind,
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.800]   like, well, why don't I aim in a professorship type direction?
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.320]   But then if that doesn't work, it's not a failure,
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.200]   you're building up capital.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.400]   Oh, that particular investment opportunity
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.600]   to invest it in a professorship career is no longer available,
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.760]   but I still have the capital, so why don't I
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.880]   take it to go over here and do a startup where we're
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.360]   doing whatever, I don't know, hedge fund analysis
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.000]   or something like that, and go live somewhere interesting
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.800]   and make a lot of money by the time I'm 27,
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.320]   and then open a surf shop.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.560]   You have all these different options.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.560]   And they will present themselves as you get better at things
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.400]   are valuable, and as you continue
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.320]   to reflect and be clear about what
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.160]   it is that resonates with you, what you actually
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.720]   want in your life, what attributes you really
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.400]   want in a job.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.480]   So don't be so specific about this is the job,
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.040]   and what if that job doesn't happen?
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.680]   Instead, be, these are the things I want in my life,
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.360]   what skills am I building now that might
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.440]   help me get closer to them?
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.080]   What next steps are open to me right now?
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.600]   Great, let me take the best one that's open to me right now.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.200]   Build more skills and repeat.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.680]   Build more skills, then repeat.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.200]   I can't tell you where you're going to be in 10 years
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.520]   specifically, but if you follow this path,
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.400]   I can be pretty confident that wherever it is,
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.880]   it'll be a place that's pretty cool.
