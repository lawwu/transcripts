[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.600]   Public school, private school, online school, homeschool.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.000]   What are the pros and the cons of each of these options, and how do we decide on the
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.080]   right option for our kids?
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.320]   The question today comes in from a listener named Lauren.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.320]   "Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.600]   I highly respect you.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.360]   I've searched for a while now to see if you've said anything about homeschool, and I can't
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.400]   seem to find anything.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.460]   So would you please tell me what you think?
[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.440]   Is homeschool now required for Christians in this age?
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.240]   Is it possible that public school be an option from God?
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.080]   Where are you at in considering local, public, local private, online Christian schools, homeschooling,
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.840]   and schools connected to a local church?
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.140]   Do you have any advice for how we would weigh each option and mix them together for each
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.800]   of the interests and needs of each child we are called to raise?"
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.800]   Wow.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.120]   Pastor John, what would you say to Lauren?
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.440]   I'm glad for the question, because the longer I live, the more concerned I become about
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.920]   how we train our kids.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.000]   So let me read four passages of scripture, and then draw out a principle, and then make
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.440]   some applications.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.880]   Deuteronomy 6-4, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.500]   soul, with all your might.
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.240]   And these words, which I command you today," that is a whole life love for God, "These
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.300]   commands that I give you today shall be on your heart.
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.060]   You shall teach them diligently to your children, and talk of them when you sit in your house,
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.260]   and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up."
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:37.940]   Psalm 78-5, "He established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed instruction in Israel,
[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.560]   which he commanded our fathers to teach to their children, that the next generation might
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.780]   know them, the children yet unborn, and arise and tell them to their children, so that they
[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.940]   should set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep His commandments."
[00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:00.580]   Proverbs 4-1, "Hear, O sons, a father's instruction, and be attentive, that you might gain insight.
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.660]   For I give you good precepts.
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.820]   Do not forsake my teaching.
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.700]   When I was a son with my father, tender, the only one in the sight of my mother, he taught
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.620]   me and said to me, 'Let your heart hold fast my words, keep my commandments, and live.'"
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.140]   Ephesians 6-4, "Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up, nurture
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.340]   them, bring them up, train them up in the discipline and the instruction of the Lord."
[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.540]   So here's the principle I'm going to draw out from those passages.
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.180]   God has designed families, and fathers in particular, to take responsibility for bringing
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.260]   up children in the knowledge and the skills they need to be mature and fruitful Christians
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.940]   in the home and the church and the world.
[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:47.940]   That's my conclusion.
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.860]   Now here's some implications that I see.
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:01.740]   One, this implies fathers and mothers will make educational choices that strengthen a
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:08.060]   child's true understanding of God, true understanding of human nature, manhood, womanhood, history,
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.700]   the church, the world physically and socially, with the necessary abilities to learn a useful
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.020]   skill and vocation.
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:23.780]   In other words, it is the parent's responsibility, not first the church, not first the government,
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.020]   to shape a child's worldview according to Bible-saturated, Christ-exalting, God-centered
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.020]   truth.
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:40.140]   Second implication, the more complex and technological and diverse and global the world
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:48.820]   becomes, the more parents will need to partner with others to fulfill their responsibilities
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.740]   for their own children.
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:58.580]   The children will need knowledge and skills that parents may not be able to give them.
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:05.580]   Third, as America becomes more pervasively secular with commitments, not just ideas,
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:12.820]   but commitments that are not neutral, but anti-Christian both in worldview and on numerous
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:20.500]   moral issues and numerous faith issues, partnering with public school teachers to accomplish
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.700]   biblical goals for our children becomes year by year less feasible and indeed, in many
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.260]   cases, unthinkable.
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:37.300]   Fourth, more and more parents and more and more pastors, therefore, should give very
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:45.680]   serious consideration to starting academically excellent and affordable Christian schools.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.740]   Money considerations is what makes public education popular with many Christians.
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.420]   It's free.
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:59.620]   If it cost as much to go to a public school as to an academically excellent Christian
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.940]   school, millions of Christian parents would choose excellent Christian schools.
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.620]   So, it's a money issue.
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:16.100]   Therefore, one implication of the biblical view of education is that teams of parents,
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:23.220]   together with their church leadership, should be creating thousands of excellent Christian
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:31.420]   schools along with creative alternatives like co-ops or online learning.
[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:38.780]   Fifth, parents and churches need to think deeply and wisely about the principle of "apart
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.420]   from the world for the sake of the world."
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.460]   Let me say it again.
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.460]   Apart from the world for the sake of the world.
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.980]   This principle has always been true.
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.140]   It's always been our duty to various degrees of cultural connectedness.
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:01.340]   Jesus said in John 15, 19, "If you were of the world, the world would love you as
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.260]   its own, but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.140]   the world hates you."
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.140]   Or John 17, 14, "They are not of the world, Father.
[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.260]   My disciples are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:23.940]   I do not ask you to take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one."
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.340]   In other words, in the world, but not of the world.
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:37.260]   And I don't think most Christians have awakened to the crisis of worldliness and weakness
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.680]   in the church.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.100]   But part of it is the education of our children.
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.100]   Education is not evangelization.
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:50.900]   In other words, we shouldn't justify where we send our kids because we think they should
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.460]   be evangelists when they're eight.
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:07:00.580]   God does not intend for Christian children to be taught by unbelievers and to be surrounded
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:06.340]   most of the day by intense, worldly peer pressure.
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.780]   That's not what childhood is for.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:16.140]   It's for being shaped and molded by wise, loving Christian adults.
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.540]   Now this is not escapism.
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:24.300]   Any more than West Point is escapism because the instructors are American soldiers, not
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.020]   ISIS soldiers.
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.420]   We prepare a pretty good military for engagement with the enemy, and we don't do it with the
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.860]   help of the enemy.
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:36.620]   We prepare for maximum faithfulness in the world, we Christians, prepare for maximum
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:42.820]   faithfulness in the world by coming out of the world for the education of our children.
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:51.500]   There will be time and ways for them to know the world and meet the world head on.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.900]   Remember our own kids when I thought this through in K through eight with our kids,
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:01.620]   we sent them all to Christian school and we lived in the real world.
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.620]   And we didn't even have a television.
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.340]   People said, "How are your kids going to even know the world?"
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.140]   I said, "Just go outside.
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:12.860]   Just go into the inner city and have your bike taken away from you or watch a man beat
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:18.620]   up another guy or rip the spout off the side of the house and smash a man in the head with
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.620]   it."
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.620]   There's the real world out there.
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.460]   You don't have to bring the world into your house to teach your kids about knowing the
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:25.540]   world.
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.540]   We have our hands full.
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.540]   I know this.
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.540]   We have our hands full.
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:35.700]   There are no guarantees, neither positive or negative, that our children might be mighty
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.660]   in the Lord if we educate them at home.
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.820]   No guarantee of that.
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.860]   Nor that they will become compromising nominal Christians if they go to public school.
[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.720]   No guarantee of that.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.740]   We may lose or gain them either way.
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.540]   God decides that ultimately.
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:58.900]   So we pray earnestly, desperately, and then we do the best we can with their education.
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:08:59.900]   Amen.
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.620]   There's a level of desperation in any choice ahead.
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.620]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:33.340]   We need to start planning for something far beyond the reach of our 401ks.
