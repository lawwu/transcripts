[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280]   >> Whenever we talk about the general topic of leadership questions are raised about political
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.080]   and government leadership.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.440]   And tonight we're going to address that issue by looking at the story of Moses and Pharaoh
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.760]   recorded in Exodus 1 through 14.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.380]   Yes, we are going to cover 14 chapters of Exodus tonight.
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:31.200]   It's the story of two men, leaders of their nations, involved in a high stakes dramatic
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.640]   series of confrontations with the fate of nations in the balance.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.200]   And before we do that, there's two aspects of political or government leadership that
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.520]   exist in tension that I think we have to address right away.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:56.800]   One is that government or political leadership is ordained and appointed by God for our good
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.020]   and also for his glory.
[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.900]   Government properly functioning as described in Romans 13 restrains and punishes sin.
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.660]   It rewards good.
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:17.980]   And when people reject the authority of government leaders for whatever reason, sin, chaos and
[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.540]   disaster is the result.
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.860]   In fact, in Judges 21 verse 25, it describes what happened this way, "In those days there
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.560]   was no king in Israel and everyone did what was right in their own eyes."
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.000]   The other tension there, the other side of that is that wicked, evil and godless political
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.420]   leadership is both a reflection of the people of that nation and that kind of leadership
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:53.560]   also leads a nation into evil and the certain and terrible consequences of sin.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.040]   This is not new.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.680]   All the kings of Israel and most of the kings of Judah described in 1 and 2 Kings were described
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.740]   as having done evil in the sight of the Lord.
[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.940]   As the kings went, the people followed and vice versa.
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.520]   And you can read of the devastation of the afflicted in all of those accounts.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.400]   So we must submit to government as God's ministers of good and we also must think about what
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.160]   to do with evil political leadership.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.780]   Which leadership is the cause of evil and it is the result and I would even say the
[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.320]   consequence of evil in the world.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.580]   How should we think about the leaders around us, those who lead the world, those who lead
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:51.620]   our country, presidents, kings, prime ministers, senators, congressmen?
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.820]   We have a speaker of the house now who says he has a biblical worldview.
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.240]   How do we evaluate that?
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.940]   Governors, they've all been given visible substantial leadership roles and as you consider
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.900]   who's in charge and how to think about them, the Bible is obviously authoritative and helpful
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.900]   and the contrast and the similarities between Moses and Pharaoh that we're going to look
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.620]   at tonight are illustrative.
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:28.520]   I'm not looking to give you three elements of good leadership or bad leadership or the
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.480]   four steps to determining whether you should support leadership or the biblical framework
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.200]   for choosing who to vote for.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.480]   The fact is as we're going to see tonight, those really aren't the right questions and
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:49.020]   they don't get us to the right place, to relevant conclusions as we consider political leadership
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.020]   in this world.
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.260]   Little footnote before we jump into Exodus 1.
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.340]   I am racing through Exodus 1 through 14 tonight.
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:05.500]   These are 14 chapters of incredible drama, a deep story, great color added to the story,
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.500]   a rich history and I cannot urge you strongly enough to go home either tonight or in the
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.380]   next few days and take the time to read these chapters.
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.120]   You will marvel at how much I'm leaving out tonight.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.660]   I made the mistake of reading those chapters late last night and I marveled at how much
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.740]   I was leaving out.
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.740]   It's frustrating.
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.500]   It's a great story.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.780]   But just understand, we're going to focus on two men, profiles and leadership.
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.140]   And we're going to start in Exodus 1.
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:42.500]   If you have your Bible, Exodus is right after Genesis, it's way back in the beginning.
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.620]   It's the tale of two leaders and the fate of two countries inextricably linked to the
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.260]   leadership of these two men and the relationship these two men had with their leader because
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.380]   everyone answers to somebody.
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.020]   First, we need to understand Egypt.
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:09.100]   Egypt is a desert with a river running through it and that river is the Nile River.
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.440]   Without the Nile River, there is no Egypt.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.740]   With the Nile River, there was enormous wealth and power.
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:24.260]   The Nile River is the longest river in the world and that river delivered to Egypt practical
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.740]   sustenance, even life.
[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:33.940]   It was a source of water, fish, and fertile soil from the Ethiopian highlands which are
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:40.780]   deposited in the Egyptian basin delta as it empties into the Mediterranean.
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.820]   That fertile soil enabled Egypt to supply much of the Mediterranean region and the world
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.380]   with grain, food.
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:56.100]   That explains why the Israelites would always go to Egypt when there was a famine or a drought
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.100]   in their land.
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.940]   So that's Egypt.
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.140]   Now we look at Israel and now we're in Exodus 1.
[00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:10.180]   If you're going to follow with me in the Bible, I hope I give you enough markers to stay up
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.180]   with me.
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.820]   We're going to go fast.
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:19.540]   Chapter 1 starts with the Israelites being captive within Egypt and when Exodus 1 starts,
[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:26.060]   they have been captive inside of Egypt for 280 years.
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.020]   To give you some perspective, 280 years ago, it was 1744.
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:39.380]   It's a really long time for a world that lives in 10-minute news cycles.
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.380]   It's not how it worked back then.
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:48.180]   And since the end of Genesis, the captives grew, the Israelites grew from 70 men to approximately
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.140]   600,000 males.
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:58.100]   Exodus 1 verse 7 says, "But the sons of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly and multiplied
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.180]   and became exceedingly mighty so that the land was filled with them."
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:10.140]   The Israelites had become a national security issue but also an economic powerhouse because
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.880]   of the slave labor they provided.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.580]   They had become a nation inside of a nation.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.540]   Verse 8 of chapter 1 says, "A new king arose over Egypt."
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.260]   Verse 9, "He obviously saw the problem.
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.540]   He said to his people, 'Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are more and mightier
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.540]   than we.
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.260]   Come let us deal wisely with them or else they will multiply and in the event of war,
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:41.900]   they will also join themselves to those who hate us and fight against us and depart from
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.900]   the land.'"
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.600]   There's two threats.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:52.580]   One is if somebody attacks Egypt, the Israelites might join the attacking nation.
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:58.900]   The other threat is the Israelites might leave us and then we lose all that labor.
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.780]   So rather than be nice to the Israelites to make them want to stay, they went the exact
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.820]   opposite direction.
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:10.220]   Black masters were appointed to afflict them even more with hard labor, it says in verse
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.220]   11.
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:15.140]   And the great thing is in verse 12, it says, "The harder they worked, the more they had
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.140]   babies."
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.660]   They multiplied.
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:25.900]   Egypt made their life bitter with hard labor and this pharaoh led the way.
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:30.300]   And the king finally decided or the pharaoh finally decided that he needed to stop the
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.580]   population growth.
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:36.860]   So his first try in verses 15 and 16 was to go to the midwives and say, "Kill all the
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.340]   male children."
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.620]   But it says in verse 17, "The midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt had
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.740]   commanded them but let the boys live."
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:56.900]   His second attempt later on in chapter 1 verse 22, he decrees that, "Every son who is born,
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.860]   you are to cast into the Nile and every daughter you are to keep alive."
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:08.780]   It's probably a familiar story to you because in chapter 2 now, that's the context in which
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.980]   Moses is born.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.260]   And you probably know his story.
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:20.140]   The daughter of Pharaoh rescues him, saves Moses, raises him as her own, as if he is
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.780]   one of her children.
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:29.580]   He's raising the culture, the wealth, and the power of Pharaoh's family.
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.540]   When he's 40 years old, he goes to visit his people.
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.800]   Yes, I said 40.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.620]   We just skipped 40 years of history.
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:42.220]   And in verse 11 of chapter 2, it says, "Now it came about in those days when Moses had
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:47.700]   grown up that he went out to his brethren and looked on their hard labors and he saw
[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:52.420]   an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brethren.
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:56.980]   So he looked this way and that and when he saw there was no one around, he struck down
[00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.700]   the Egyptian and hid him in the sand."
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.380]   That's Bible talk for murder.
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:10.660]   Moses' first recorded public act was murder.
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.940]   And by the way, on your handout, there's a lot of open space.
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:20.060]   If you're taking notes, I want you to note the biographical details of these two leaders.
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:27.300]   And sadly, the first one for Moses is he's a murderer.
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:32.960]   He thinks there's no witnesses, but the very next day, it says in the passage, he's trying
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.500]   to break up a fight between two of the Israelites, the Hebrews.
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.180]   And in verse 14, one of the Hebrews says to him, "Who made you a prince or a judge over
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.180]   us?
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:46.060]   Were you intending to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?"
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:51.380]   Then Moses was afraid and said, "Surely the matter has become known."
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:57.260]   And indeed it had because verse 15 says that when Pharaoh heard of this matter, he tried
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.100]   to kill Moses.
[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:04.020]   Pharaoh almost meets Moses.
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:08.160]   Moses fled from the presence of Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:14.440]   That is in modern day Saudi Arabia.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.260]   He marries there and has children.
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.540]   And now we're to Exodus chapter 3.
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:30.140]   Now Moses is 80 years old and he is called by God at 80 years old to rescue his people.
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:34.860]   That's where you'll find the encounter with God through the burning bush.
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.940]   And in Exodus 3, there's the preparation and training of Moses.
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.120]   It's an interesting read.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:46.300]   And God tells him what to say to the Israelites and what God is going to do.
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.180]   And I know you're familiar with the story, but just listen.
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.660]   God says, "I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land flowing with
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.660]   milk and honey."
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:12:00.500]   They, meaning the Israelites, will pay heed to what you say.
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:05.240]   The king of Egypt or Pharaoh will not permit you to go except under compulsion.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.180]   I will stretch out my hand.
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.560]   I will grant this people favor.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.640]   You will plunder the Egyptians.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:19.240]   All of this is given to Moses in preparation for what God's calling him to do.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:26.340]   And then you get to Exodus 4 and either we're looking at the demonstration of genuine humility
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:31.620]   or fear or just foolishness on the part of Moses.
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.860]   After he has been trained by the Lord, he sees the power of the Lord.
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.780]   The Lord has told him what he's going to do.
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.640]   Moses says to God, "What if they will not believe me or listen to what I say?
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.100]   For they may say, 'The Lord has not appeared to you.'"
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.700]   Fair question.
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.980]   In response, God shows Moses his power through a series of miracles.
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:55.320]   We don't have time to go through them, but they're astounding.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:00.940]   Then after that demonstration of God's power, verse 10, "Moses said to the Lord, 'Please,
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:07.260]   Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither recently nor in time past, nor since you have
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:12.640]   spoken to your servant, for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.'"
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.380]   God responds to him in verse 11, "The Lord said, 'Who has made man's mouth or who makes
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.940]   him mute or deaf or seeing or blind?
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.960]   Is it not I, the Lord?
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:29.540]   Now then, go, and I, even I, will be with your mouth and teach you what you are to say.'"
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:37.460]   This is the God of the universe giving Moses everything.
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:43.840]   Moses in verse 13 says, "Please, Lord, now send the message by whomever you will."
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.460]   The translation of that is, "Send anybody but me."
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.700]   Isn't that incredible?
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:55.380]   Moses is negotiating with God.
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.540]   Send someone other than me.
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:03.860]   He believes he knows better and that he has standing to argue with God, to defy God, and
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.620]   he doesn't.
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.980]   None of us do.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:14.580]   Verse 14, it says, "The anger of the Lord burned against Moses."
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.460]   I think you and I would hope that's never said of us.
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.180]   It's not a good place to be.
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:23.860]   "The anger of the Lord burned against Moses, and God said, 'Is there not your brother Aaron,
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:24.860]   the Levite?'"
[00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:34.260]   It goes on to describe the process of God allowing Moses and Aaron to go together.
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:39.140]   Then verse 19, "The Lord said to Moses and Midian, 'Go back to Egypt now, for all the
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:43.220]   men who were seeking your life are dead.'
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.340]   Moses obeys the Lord."
[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:48.780]   I think it's fair to note here that he doesn't do a Jonah.
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.060]   It's an important note.
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.300]   Moses doesn't want to go.
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.480]   I hope you picked up on that.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:02.780]   He doesn't think he's the guy, and he's working really hard to prove it, but God has picked
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:08.660]   him, and he tells him to go, and Moses obeys the Lord.
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:14.260]   Exodus 4.29 says, "Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of the sons of Israel,
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.820]   and Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had spoken to Moses."
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.540]   Did you catch that?
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.620]   Moses is still afraid.
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.340]   Aaron does the talking.
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:28.700]   "Aaron then performed the signs in the sight of the people, so the people believed.
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.820]   And when they heard that the Lord was concerned about the sons of Israel, and that he had
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:37.700]   seen their affliction, then they bowed low and worshiped."
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.780]   And they all lived happily ever after, right?
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:41.780]   No.
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.820]   We have a ways to go.
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:49.420]   And before we jump into Exodus chapter five now to meet Pharaoh, I want to introduce you
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:54.700]   to Pharaoh, and this is really short.
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:16:01.120]   Pharaoh's identity is unknown beyond the behavior that's described here in the Bible and his
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.920]   title, Pharaoh.
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:10.900]   He was immensely powerful, wealthy, and by all estimations, an effective, bold, aggressive,
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:17.100]   powerful, and confident leader who had built a wealthy nation.
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.500]   He was also as pagan as they come.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.940]   And it's interesting that history has completely blotted out his name, including in the nation
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.300]   Egypt.
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:33.100]   They destroyed all records of this Pharaoh's reign.
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:39.900]   Chapter five, "Moses and Aaron came and said to Pharaoh," they're finally meeting now,
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.500]   "Moses ultimately submits and obeys God."
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:52.420]   And from here on out, you will note that God tells Moses what to do, and he does it.
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:58.940]   "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, said Moses, 'Let my people go, that they may celebrate
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.420]   a feast to me in the wilderness.'
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:07.140]   But Pharaoh said, 'Who is the Lord that I should obey his voice to let Israel go?
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:12.140]   I do not know the Lord, and besides, I will not let Israel go.'"
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.840]   Verse four, "But the king of Egypt, Pharaoh said to them, 'Moses and Aaron, why do you
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.420]   draw the people away from their work?
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.020]   Get back to your labors.'
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:25.980]   Again, Pharaoh said, 'Look, the people of the land are now many, and you would have
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.980]   them cease from their labors.'"
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.660]   In other words, Pharaoh's not buying it.
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:38.820]   He orders the Israelites to work harder, and the people come to Pharaoh, the foremen of
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:45.220]   the workers come to Pharaoh to appeal to him, and his response is, "You are lazy, very lazy."
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:52.100]   And he orders the harsh treatment to be elevated to another level.
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:57.400]   So from the perspective of the Israelites, life has gotten markedly worse since this
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:04.780]   man Moses showed up and said that he was going to lead them to freedom.
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:09.580]   Here's this guy saying he's come to deliver them, and so far he's alienated Pharaoh so
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:14.340]   much and angered him so much that their life is now more difficult than it ever was before
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.940]   Moses showed up.
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:20.500]   It's obviously Moses' fault.
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:28.140]   Verse 19, the foremen come from a meeting with Pharaoh, they saw that they were in trouble,
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:32.940]   it says in verse 19, and then in verse 20, "When they left Pharaoh's presence, they met
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:38.200]   Moses and Aaron as they were waiting for them, and they said to them, 'May the Lord look
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:44.900]   upon you, Moses, and judge you, Moses, for you, Moses, have made us odious in Pharaoh's
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:52.180]   sight and in the sight of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us.'"
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:57.020]   This is a tough hit.
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:02.180]   Moses knows the Lord is in control of all of this, the timing and the force of the events.
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:09.020]   Moses is an observer, he's a leader, but in that sense he is an observer, he's a follower
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:14.480]   of God and conversely the leader of God's people.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.820]   So he's kind of betwixt and between as they say.
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:24.780]   He's in this gap, Moses loves his people and this must have stung.
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:28.100]   And by the way, this is one of the many costs of leadership and some of you know this, there's
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:33.980]   people who think they have all the information and they declare with no grace or hesitation
[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:38.500]   the failure and the incompetence of leadership.
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.340]   And that's what the people did with Moses.
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:45.060]   So what does Moses do with that?
[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:52.340]   Unfortunately, rather than lead, rather than remind the people of God's words and God's
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:58.740]   acts and the power of God, he does the same thing his people did to him.
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:05.500]   It says in verse 22, "Moses went to the Lord and said, 'O Lord, why have you brought harm
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.420]   to this people?
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.940]   Why did you ever send me?'"
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.720]   He's back like the dog returning to its vomit.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.680]   "Why did you send me?
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:24.020]   Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, Pharaoh has done harm to this people
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:30.200]   and you have not delivered your people at all."
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:34.820]   That's bold in all the wrong ways.
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:35.820]   He doesn't lead.
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:40.620]   He reminds his people, his people's distrust of the Lord's power and authority and this
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:46.740]   is leadership by consensus rather than principled, courageous leadership.
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:53.060]   This is just another illustration how often leadership weakness is just a reflection of
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:57.340]   the weaknesses of the people that are being led.
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.940]   God's response is really interesting.
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:05.820]   If you go to Exodus chapter 6 verse 1, it's a key verse in this whole story.
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:15.060]   It says, "Then the Lord said to Moses in response to what Moses just said," he said, "Okay,
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.060]   I get it.
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.260]   Next Tuesday this will all be over."
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.580]   Is that what he says?
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:23.140]   It's not what he says.
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.380]   He says, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh.
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:30.300]   For under compulsion he will let them go and under compulsion he will drive them out of
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.300]   his land."
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.340]   Don't go over that too quickly.
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:38.740]   What you have is two completely contradictory statements, at least on their face.
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:43.580]   What God says to Moses is Pharaoh will let them go under compulsion and Pharaoh will
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:46.420]   drive them out under compulsion.
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.940]   So which is it?
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:54.580]   It's interesting that the response of God to Moses' complaint is not clarity.
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.300]   It's muddy water.
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:02.780]   His response must have caused a lot of confusion with a statement that seems impossible and
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:03.780]   contradictory.
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:11.740]   God does not give what Moses had hoped for, no clarity, no timeline.
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.340]   You see, there's no need for God to do that ever.
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:19.060]   He doesn't need to explain or clarify anything.
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.380]   Time does all of that.
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:26.500]   And that's in fact what happens.
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:33.500]   We're now to Exodus 7, the first plague.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:38.360]   And before we get to the plague, you can read later in the beginning part of chapter 7,
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:44.420]   God demonstrates his power to Pharaoh with one more chance for Pharaoh to repent, to
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.420]   bend.
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:50.860]   This is his last chance to humble himself and save his country and his people from the
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:51.860]   wrath of God.
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:55.060]   He rejects that opportunity and the rest is history.
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:23:01.620]   And the first plague is in verse 20, "Moses and Aaron did even as the Lord had commanded
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:06.420]   and he lifted up the staff, struck the water that was in the Nile in the sight of Pharaoh
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:12.140]   and in the sight of his servants and all the water that was in the Nile was turned to blood.
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:16.940]   The fish that were in the Nile died and the Nile became foul so that the Egyptians could
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:25.580]   not drink water from the Nile and the blood was throughout the land of Egypt."
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:31.620]   Notice the text doesn't say the water turned red like blood, the water turned to blood.
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:37.540]   You can imagine what that smelled like, especially when all the fish died.
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:43.580]   The stench of dead fish and the terror of the people because there's no drinking water.
[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:44.660]   And what's Pharaoh's response?
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:48.620]   It says in verse 23, "He turned and went into his house with no concern."
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:53.620]   It says a lot that Pharaoh had no concern for his people.
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:59.580]   He was in a struggle with God and in his mind the people were simply collateral to that
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:00.580]   struggle.
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:06.380]   We move on to chapter 8, "Frogs, Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt and
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.420]   the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt."
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:15.660]   Verse 8, "Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, 'Entreat the Lord that he remove
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:21.940]   the frogs from me and my people and I will let the people go that they may sacrifice
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:22.940]   to the Lord.'"
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:28.580]   It sounds like Pharaoh's in the right place, doesn't it?
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:33.060]   Verse 9 starts off with the words, "Moses said to Pharaoh," and I just want to make
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.420]   note here.
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:41.900]   "Moses seems to have lost his timidity now and his reliance on Aaron.
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:47.380]   Moses interacts firmly and clearly with Pharaoh and it says, "Moses cries out to the Lord
[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.420]   concerning the frogs.
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:54.900]   Moses prays on behalf of Pharaoh and the people, 'Lord, take this away.'
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:58.780]   The Lord did according to the word of Moses," it says in verse 13, "and the frogs died out
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:02.660]   of the houses, the courts and the fields, so they piled them up in heaps and the land
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:03.820]   became foul."
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.180]   You can imagine.
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:11.100]   "But when Pharaoh saw there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to them
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:15.340]   as the Lord had said."
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:16.860]   We need to make note of Pharaoh.
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.420]   He's a liar.
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.000]   He's dishonest.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.420]   He's negotiating with a God without realizing he's negotiating with a God who doesn't negotiate.
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.800]   And you'll see that over and over and over.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:36.800]   It's beyond Pharaoh's ego-driven worldview to ever consider that he answers to God and
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.760]   not the other way around.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.560]   And you'll see that throughout the story.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.640]   Moses, on the other hand, is compassionate.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.780]   He's obedient.
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:53.200]   He follows the playbook exactly and his boldness is growing.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.120]   We go to the third plague, the gnats, or biting insects.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:02.700]   Verse 17, "All the dust of the earth became gnats through all the land of Egypt."
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:10.240]   Pharaoh's response in verse 19, "His heart was hardened and he did not listen to them."
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:15.360]   The fourth, flies, "There came great swarms of flies," in verse 24, "into the house of
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:19.840]   Pharaoh and the houses of his servants and the land was laid waste because of the swarms
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:24.200]   of flies in all the land of Egypt."
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.960]   Verse 28 records Pharaoh's response to this one.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:33.440]   He says, "I will let you go that you may sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness, only
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.660]   you shall not go very far away.
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:39.140]   Make supplication for me."
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:43.120]   He thinks God works for him.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.560]   Verse 30, "Moses went out from Pharaoh and made supplication to the Lord."
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.440]   And you see this pattern over and over and over.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.520]   Moses is a compassionate man.
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:58.360]   "The Lord did as Moses asked and removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.480]   and from his people.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:05.800]   Not one remained, but Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also and he did not let the
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.800]   people go."
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:13.200]   We move on to chapter 9, three more plagues.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:18.120]   Verse 6 of chapter 9 says, "All the livestock of Egypt died, but the livestock of the sons
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:22.520]   of Israel, not one died."
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:27.480]   You could say that frogs, gnats, and flies are more of a personal annoyance, but when
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:34.760]   the animals die, that goes to the heart of the economy and the food supply.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:39.300]   Things are tightening down and verse 7 of chapter 9 says, "The heart of Pharaoh was
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:43.340]   hardened and he did not let the people go."
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.680]   Number 6 is boils, and I know you've enjoyed my pictures.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:52.320]   I actually found pictures of boils and I decided not to do that to you.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.800]   You can do that to yourself, Google it.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:01.400]   Verse 10, "They took soot from a kiln and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses threw it towards
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:06.560]   the sky and it became boils breaking out with sores on man and beast.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:12.760]   The magicians couldn't even stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were on
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:17.000]   the magicians as well as on all the Egyptians."
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.760]   This is painful stuff.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.440]   Verse 12, "And the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:26.960]   He did not listen to them just as the Lord had spoken to Moses."
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:32.680]   Hail, verse 23 of chapter 9, "The Lord rained hail on the land of Egypt."
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:38.480]   Verse 27, and I am skipping a lot, "Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and said to them,
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:43.080]   'Listen to this, I have sinned this time.'"
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.280]   Now we're getting somewhere, aren't we?
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.800]   "I have sinned this time.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.720]   The Lord is the righteous one and I and my people are the wicked ones.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:56.440]   Make supplication to the Lord for there has been enough of God's thunder and hail and
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:01.720]   I will let you go and you shall stay no longer."
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:06.560]   Pharaoh makes the mistake of believing that confession, saying, "I have sinned," is the
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.760]   same as repentance.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:16.240]   In that, he demonstrates his understanding of his need to repent and his refusal to do
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.960]   repentance the way God defines repentance.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.740]   It's a game to him.
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:27.280]   When you hear a contrition from a politician or a government leader, understand that it
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.560]   just might not be honest.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:36.640]   Verse 34, "When Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:41.000]   sinned again and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.280]   Pharaoh's heart was hardened and he did not let the sons of Israel go, just as the Lord
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.320]   had spoken through Moses."
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.200]   Chapter 10, you have the locusts.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:56.360]   Same story, "Pharaoh hurriedly called for Moses and Aaron and said, 'I have sinned against
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.000]   the Lord your God and against you.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.080]   Now therefore, please forgive my sin.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:06.120]   Forgive me this once and make supplication to the Lord your God that he would only remove
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.200]   death from me.'
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.240]   Moses went out from Pharaoh and made supplication to the Lord."
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.440]   There it is again.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:19.720]   Moses has no reason to be concerned for Pharaoh or the people of Egypt.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.800]   They're the enemies.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:25.680]   But over and over and over, Moses makes supplication to the Lord.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:30.980]   So the Lord shifted the wind to a very strong west wind, which took up the locusts and drove
[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:34.240]   them into the Red Sea.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.160]   Not one locust was left in all the territory of Egypt.
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.480]   And what do you think Pharaoh did?
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.000]   And what do you think the Lord did?
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:50.880]   It says, "The Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart and he did not let the sons of Israel go."
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.360]   The ninth plague is darkness.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:59.400]   Verse 22 of Exodus 10 says that, "Moses stretched out his hand towards the sky."
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.180]   There's no warning on this one.
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:02.920]   They don't go to Pharaoh first.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:03.920]   This just happens.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:07.920]   "And there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:12.520]   They did not see one another, nor did anyone rise from his place for three days.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:17.960]   But all the sons of Israel had light in their dwellings."
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:18.960]   No warning.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:23.400]   And the significance of this plague is that it is not only severely inconvenient.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:29.340]   I mean, people were freaking out over a 10-minute eclipse of the sun.
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.440]   Over the last couple of weeks.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:33.920]   Can you imagine three days?
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.680]   This was inconvenient, but it went directly to the false religion of the Egyptians.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:44.800]   To blot out the sun was to block out the chief god in the Egyptian pantheon.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:53.120]   The Egyptians worshiped the sun, and the sun was assumed to be the supreme deity.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:59.040]   So darkness for three days also blotted out Pharaoh's power.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:05.120]   This was an unmistakable statement by God of the universe demonstrating true power over
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:13.740]   the delegated earthly governmental authority and all their false gods.
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:18.160]   Verse 27 of Exodus 10 says, "The Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.680]   He was not willing to let them go.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.880]   Then Pharaoh said to Moses, 'Get away from me.'"
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.640]   Moses is angry.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.760]   And then we get to Exodus 11, the 10th and final.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:37.480]   "Moses says to Pharaoh, 'Thus says the Lord, 'About midnight I'm going out into the midst
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.920]   of Egypt, and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.160]   the Pharaoh who sits on his throne.'"
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.700]   The man he's talking to.
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:49.320]   He's telling him his firstborn is going to die.
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:55.320]   "From Pharaoh to even the firstborn of the slave girl who is behind the millstones, all
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:59.920]   the firstborn of the cattle as well, moreover, there shall be a great cry in all the land
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:06.920]   of Egypt, such as there has not been before and such as shall never be again."
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:11.360]   Again, judgment and grace in the same sentence.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.700]   But against any of the sons of Israel, a dog will not even bark.
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.880]   I love that.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.000]   Moses had a sense of humor.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.100]   Let me say that again.
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:24.840]   He's telling them that the firstborn are going to die from Pharaoh's home all the way down
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:31.480]   to his servants, but against the sons of Israel, a dog will not even bark.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:37.180]   In other words, nothing happens to the Israelites, whether against man or beast, that you may
[00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:43.840]   understand how the Lord makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:48.760]   And it's interesting in the next verse, verse 8, it says, "Moses went out from Pharaoh in
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:53.920]   hot anger."
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.980]   Moses is bold here.
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:34:00.400]   He doesn't need Aaron this time, and that's good.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:05.440]   But after all this time and after everything he's seen, Moses still thinks he can persuade
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.580]   Pharaoh into compliance.
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:16.560]   He has not lost that personal, compassionate concern and hope for Pharaoh.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:23.080]   When he cannot persuade Pharaoh, he doesn't see God's hand in that, he gets frustrated.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.080]   He gets angry and emotional.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:31.880]   And like so many times in leadership, you find yourself more concerned with the sinner's
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:36.120]   sin than the sinner's concern with their own sin.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.520]   And that's where Moses is at.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.320]   We move on to Exodus 12 and 13.
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:48.560]   In the first 28 verses of Exodus 12, God is preparing his people for travel.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:52.400]   There's 2 million people that are going to be moving.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.720]   And then the death comes.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:58.280]   In verse 29, "Now it came about at midnight that the Lord struck all the firstborn in
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:04.840]   the land of Egypt from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on his throne to the firstborn of
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:08.560]   the captain who was in the dungeon and all the firstborn of cattle."
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:12.120]   Exactly what he said he was going to do.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:17.720]   Verse 30 says, "Pharaoh arose in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians,
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.560]   and there was a great cry in Egypt."
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:27.200]   If you can imagine that, as bad a man as Pharaoh is, his firstborn is dead.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:33.880]   "Then he called for Moses and Aaron at night and said, 'Rise up, get out from among my
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:38.360]   people, both you and the sons of Israel, and go worship the Lord as you have said.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:48.240]   Take both your flocks and your herds as you have said, and go and bless me also.'"
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:53.880]   Pharaoh is a utilitarian, "Get out of here, solve my political problem, but bless me on
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.040]   your way out the door."
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.880]   But Exodus 6-1 still isn't fulfilled.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.320]   Pharaoh is not driving them out of the land.
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.960]   He is letting them go under compulsion.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:09.020]   So the story is not done, it's not over.
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:16.800]   In Exodus 14, the rest of the story, "When the king of Egypt was told," in verse 5, "that
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:22.560]   the people had fled, Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart towards the people.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:29.480]   And they said, 'What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?'
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:34.240]   So he made his chariot ready and took his people with him," verse 7, "and he took six
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:38.560]   hundred select chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.560]   of them.
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:43.560]   The Lord hardened the heart of Egypt, the king of Egypt, and he chased after the sons
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:47.980]   of Israel, and the sons of Israel were going out boldly."
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.920]   And you know the rest of the story.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:54.120]   Moses obeys everything the Lord tells him to do in that Exodus.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:37:00.200]   The water parts, the Israelites cross, the Egyptian army follows in hot pursuit, and
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:07.200]   Pharaoh and his army are all wiped out.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:13.120]   So we need to, we just went through 14 chapters of Exodus.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:18.120]   And now I want to draw all of this together and make some observations about leadership.
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:25.600]   First, we want to compare the stories of Moses and Pharaoh.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:31.400]   The Bible later summarizes these two lives this way.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:37.840]   Daniel 9 and Revelation 15 calls Moses the slave or the servant of God.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:42.300]   Psalm 90, a beautiful psalm, is written by Moses.
[00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:47.280]   It's called "A Prayer of Moses, the Man of God."
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:52.360]   Psalm 105, 26 says that God sent Moses his servant.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:59.840]   Hebrews 11, the faith chapter, the heroes of the faith, Moses is included because of
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.840]   his obedience.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:06.800]   It says, "He considered the reproach of Christ to be greater riches than the treasures of
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.720]   Egypt.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.960]   He endured as seeing him who is unseen."
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:19.240]   Pharaoh, on the other hand, rejected God from the beginning to the end.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:22.520]   Nobody knows his name.
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:29.200]   Romans 9, verse 17, summarizes his life this way.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:33.600]   For the scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I raised you up to demonstrate
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:40.000]   my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed through the whole earth."
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:48.320]   Pharaoh accomplished God's purposes exactly the way God wanted him to.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:39:01.560]   So if I describe a murderer who's emotional, arrogant, weak leadership, questions God's
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:09.840]   powers, thinks he can negotiate with God, accomplishes the purposes of God, and was
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:15.840]   appointed by God, am I talking about Moses or am I talking about Pharaoh?
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:21.800]   I heard somebody say, "Yes, that is right."
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:29.160]   And I threw that term "murderer" in there because both men were murderers and they had
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.780]   that similarity.
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:35.080]   If you were God, would you have picked either man to lead?
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.500]   But God did.
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.720]   Those are the similarities, but there's one difference between the two men.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:48.760]   Pharaoh refused to submit, repent, and he died in his defiance and disobedience.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.680]   Moses lived by faith.
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:55.560]   Pharaoh lived by terminal pride.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:59.440]   Moses' life and leadership were both deeply flawed.
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.240]   He was human.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:07.000]   His faith was hindered by his sin at times, but the trajectory and pattern of his leadership
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.720]   was obedience, faith.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:19.600]   Love for God and love for God's people, compassion for Pharaoh, his enemy, a growing boldness,
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:23.680]   a humility, faithfulness.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.860]   Moses grew larger in his leadership.
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:33.140]   Pharaoh was diminished more and more and more every day.
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:37.040]   There's a pattern in the circle of events occurring between God and Pharaoh and Moses
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:41.880]   and that was repeated over and over, and we need to kind of draw this story together.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:46.040]   And if you would, turn to Exodus 9, 14 to 19.
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:47.040]   Six verses.
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.240]   We're going to go through it very quickly.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:57.040]   It's a short and powerful passage dealing with the plague of the hail, but it's a clear
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:02.920]   summary and explanation of the triangle, what I call the triangle of leadership.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:10.160]   Tonight was a tale of two leaders, Moses and Pharaoh and their leader, the God of the universe.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:15.820]   We understand that the book of Exodus is really about God, right?
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:21.400]   If you're paying any attention at all to current news, we're watching the world and political
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:29.660]   leaders direct the nations towards prosperity or poverty, relative holiness, if you will,
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:36.440]   and abject debauchery and evil, success and failure, war and peace, economic growth and
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:41.560]   cultural destruction.
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.980]   Nations are going these directions and you and I don't always get to know the why as
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:57.460]   we observe evil people succeed, control, lead, get elected, reelected, and prosper.
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:04.600]   And in this short passage in Exodus 9, we see a comprehensive presentation of the foundational
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:10.800]   truth to keep in mind when hearing the story of Moses and Pharaoh and while observing the
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:17.480]   world around us today, especially as we think about those who are in leadership in government
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.160]   and politics.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:23.560]   And there's seven observations and we'll go through these very quickly.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:27.000]   They're on your handout from this passage.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.540]   First, there is no one like God.
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:39.080]   Whoever your favorite politician is, your political party, your historical figure, there
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.720]   is no one like God.
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:50.800]   And we see this starting in verse 14, "For this time, I, God, will send all my plagues
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:55.160]   on you and your servants and your people so that you may know that there is no one like
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.180]   me in all the earth.
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:03.360]   For if by now I had put forth my hand and struck you and your people with pestilence,
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:06.680]   you would then have been cut off from the earth.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:13.640]   But indeed, for this reason, I have allowed you to remain in order to show you my power
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:19.120]   and in order to proclaim my name through all the earth, still you exalt yourself.
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:24.800]   Behold, about this time tomorrow, I will send a very heavy hail.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:27.840]   Do you see the personal pronouns?
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.400]   There is nobody like God."
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:35.720]   It's truly remarkable that human beings from their first arrival on this earth have tried
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:42.800]   to replace God, to lift people and things above God, to reject the concept that He who
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:49.080]   created us owns us and it will ever be till the end.
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:55.640]   Believers, just like Pharaoh and Moses in the beginning, attempt to place themselves
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:44:04.720]   above God or as an equal to God and to negotiate with God, to move God.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:08.720]   More obviously, as a leader who seems to be a leader among leaders, his words and actions
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.160]   influence world events.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:15.840]   If you think of historical figures, if he's saving the environment, changing the culture,
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:20.520]   saving the world from tyranny or other evil, there's no shortage of people that will put
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:25.900]   him on a pedestal that's even maybe a little bit higher than God.
[00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:32.920]   There's no shortage of political pundits or experts who will affirm that opinion and unfortunately,
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:36.720]   there are Christians prone to do the same thing.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:42.040]   Never forget, there is no one like God.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:47.360]   Second thing we learn that all authority is given by God and I know you know this.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:53.060]   Verse 15, "For if by now I had put forth my hand and struck you and your people with pestilence,
[00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:56.640]   you would then have been cut off from the earth."
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:03.040]   There's no authority on this earth that can match that statement and if there was, it
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:07.640]   would have been put there by God.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:13.640]   Verse 16, "I have allowed you to remain," that is the ultimate authority.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:20.960]   We've had a taste in this country of anti-Christian political, legal, and cultural leadership
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:24.840]   and they're very successful and we're not done with that.
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:29.960]   There's no reasonable expectation or basis to expect that it will not or should not get
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.800]   a lot worse.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.320]   That doesn't mean God isn't paying attention.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:44.120]   It's hard inescapable truth that God appoints that leadership for His purposes.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:50.040]   God's in charge and those types of leaders ignore Psalm 2, starting in verse 2, "The
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:55.240]   kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers take counsel together against Yahweh
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:46:00.120]   and against His anointed saying, 'Let us tear their fetters apart and cast away their cords
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.120]   from us.'"
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:04.400]   That's Pharaoh.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:06.800]   Verse 4, "He who sits in the heavens laughs."
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:12.040]   The LSB says, "The Lord mocks them.
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:15.720]   Then He speaks to them in His anger and He terrifies them in His fury saying, 'But as
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:20.960]   for me, I have installed my king upon Zion, my holy mountain.'"
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:24.800]   Christ is indeed king.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:33.880]   And we need to remember as we look at political leadership around us that God is their king
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:37.440]   and they rail against God and the Lord mocks them.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:43.400]   There's nobody like God and all authority resides with God and He uses that authority.
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:48.560]   Number three, God is actually and actively involved.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:53.640]   As you view political leadership, governmental leadership, even as you read history, don't
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:47:00.440]   ever forget God is always actively involved.
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:08.680]   I will send my plagues, I will put forth my hand and strike you and your people with pestilence.
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:10.640]   I have allowed you to remain.
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:13.160]   My power, I will send.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:16.360]   Don't miss all of that.
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:22.160]   It's wild to me that anybody can read this and think that God is passive.
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.160]   He does it all.
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:30.520]   He was personal, God and Pharaoh, God's actions, His purposes, His power, His agenda, His plagues,
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.040]   His people, His timing.
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.480]   There was no passivity in any of His statements.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:42.280]   This was not a coincidental series of natural phenomenon simply used by a passive God to
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.320]   make His point.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:52.160]   He intervened to exercise His supernatural will and to display His power through a defiant
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:55.400]   godless leader named Pharaoh.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:48:02.000]   In other words, the story really isn't about Pharaoh and Moses, it's about God.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:09.720]   We can't miss this lesson that as we view the world around us, God is actively involved.
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.680]   Number four, God is purposeful.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:17.200]   It's hard to know sometimes what are God's purposes and I think there's three purposes
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:21.880]   laid out really clearly here and we see over and over and over in the story.
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:25.680]   If you were to read through Exodus 1-14, there's three purposes.
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:32.840]   Verse 14, that you may know there is no one like me on all the earth.
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:39.560]   Verse 16, to show you my power and verse 16, in order to proclaim my name in all the earth.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:45.040]   These purposes are so definitive, so basic that in your life today to the extent you
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:51.040]   don't know God's purposes, you can assume that these three purposes are in play.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.920]   They apply.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:58.080]   And as you listen to the news and get concerned as you observe the world and its leaders and
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:05.600]   you wonder at the wickedness, you may not need to know more than just this.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:10.760]   God is reminding us that there's no one like Him in all the earth.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:16.800]   He is showing His power and He is proclaiming His name through all the earth.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:20.480]   Fifth, God is gracious.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:25.920]   As you view political leadership, understand that the grace and patience of God is pervasive
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:33.120]   in this passage, in this story of Pharaoh and Moses, and in this world.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:36.120]   God could have gone straight to the death plague, couldn't He?
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:41.040]   Did you ever think why didn't He?
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:46.400]   Well it's because verse 15, "If I had put forth my hand and struck you and your people
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.920]   with pestilence, you would have been cut off from the earth."
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:52.520]   He's reviewing what happened and what's coming and it's grace.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:55.200]   Verse 16, "I have allowed you to remain."
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:50:01.560]   And then verse 18, it says, "Behold, about this time tomorrow," meaning I'll give you
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:06.920]   24 hours to move your flocks in.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.880]   That's grace.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:13.560]   Verse 19, "Now therefore sin, bring your livestock and whatever you have in the field to safety."
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:17.480]   There's always opportunity to bend the knee and save yourself.
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:25.320]   And it's to this end that we should be praying for our leaders, that they would repent and
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.800]   be saved.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:32.240]   Pray that the Lord would grant them repentance, not so that our life would get easier and
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:37.720]   our worldview would be affirmed and our politics would be much more comfortable.
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:43.880]   We pray for their salvation so that the Lord's name would be known to show His power and
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:47.880]   that the world would know that there's no one like God.
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:54.060]   Sixth, the goodness of God is always and most clearly seen in contrast with the wickedness
[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:58.160]   of men and vice versa.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:02.700]   The hopeless corruption of leadership is best seen and understood in contrast with the goodness
[00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:07.640]   and holiness of the God who appointed that leadership.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:13.560]   Pharaoh is a man created by God and appointed by God to his authority, presumed and fought
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:16.860]   to exalt himself over God.
[00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:21.320]   That is the ultimate demonstration of the depravity of man and it's contrasted with
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:28.320]   the patience and the grace and the immovable holiness of God.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:38.880]   The futility of Pharaoh's best efforts demonstrate in contrast God's complete power.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:41.540]   There's a cost associated with wicked leadership.
[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:47.360]   Go back and read Exodus 1 through 14 from the perspective of the Israelites.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:52.320]   They were, in some sense, innocent bystanders of a much bigger drama and there was a heavy
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.320]   cost.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:58.880]   Pharaoh's demonstration of wickedness was at the expense of the people of God and that
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:05.940]   is as it has been since the beginning of time, since Eden.
[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:10.640]   But whatever the circumstances, God is good, always.
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:17.480]   Whatever the cost of the wicked, sinful, political leadership, the benefit is to reflect on the
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:22.360]   contrasting goodness of our God.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:26.120]   And finally, the leader is not a passive participant.
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:32.160]   We saw multiple, more than 10 opportunities in Exodus where Pharaoh hardened his heart
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:34.900]   and denied God, but he could have repented.
[00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:42.760]   And 10 occasions when Moses rose to the occasion, Pharaoh was willingly hardened, willingly
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:49.240]   wicked, willingly evil, ruthless, deceptive, manipulative, and dishonest.
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:56.700]   Moses was faithful, obedient, submissive, while also occasionally failing as he challenged
[00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:58.540]   and questioned God.
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:05.420]   You see, man is responsible for his own sin, he's also responsible for his own obedience.
[00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:08.300]   The cost of Moses' leadership was so high.
[00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:15.120]   You can imagine the pressures, the grief, the tension, and the broken human relationships.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:17.820]   It wasn't easy for him.
[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:25.020]   But at the end of it all, the reward was great, not because of the leadership he offered,
[00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:30.700]   but because of the goodness and the greatness of God.
[00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:37.780]   Our national leaders or whoever, political leaders are active participants in God's drama,
[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:42.900]   not theirs, and so are you and I.
[00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:49.420]   So tonight as we reflect on national leaders, political leaders, probably the most visible
[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:54.460]   group of leaders that we interact with, at least in the news and all the rest, more than
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:58.100]   any other, remember this, Christ is king.
[00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:06.540]   He appoints that leadership, and he is far above it all, and God is provident.
[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:12.420]   Whether we view political, economic, cultural leadership as wicked or sympathetic to Christianity,
[00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:14.620]   we don't actually know.
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:19.460]   What we can know is that there's no one like God in all the earth.
[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:27.100]   He is showing his power today, and he is proclaiming his name throughout the earth.
[00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:28.840]   And leadership matters.
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:36.700]   A biblical frame through which to evaluate leadership matters, and I pray that Exodus
[00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:40.260]   1 through 14 has provided that tonight.
[00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:41.260]   Let's pray.
[00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:43.140]   Lord, thank you for your word.
[00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:50.820]   Lord, I pray that you would use what has been said tonight to give us clarity as we view
[00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:52.100]   the world around us.
[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:56.300]   Lord, we thank you that you are God.
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:57.300]   You are king.
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:58.820]   There is no one like you.
[00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:02.820]   Lord, we pray that your name would be known through all the earth, that your power would
[00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:10.580]   be seen, that through that people would come to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, that
[00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:15.580]   they would find salvation and seek salvation through you and not through politics or history
[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:17.540]   or current events.
[00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:21.940]   Lord, we thank you for the peace that we have because of that truth.
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:25.380]   I pray that each man here would have that peace in their heart, and we pray this in
[00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:26.380]   Christ's name.
[00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:26.820]   Amen.
[00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:36.820]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
