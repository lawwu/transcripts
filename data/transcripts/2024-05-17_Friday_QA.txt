[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560]   >> Something amazing is happening in meteorology.
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.280]   Climate researchers are successfully processing a data storm.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.740]   That's because CDW transformed their laptop devices and
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.800]   infrastructure to pre-configured Lenovo ThinkPads and powerful Edge-to-Cloud solutions.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.520]   By delivering faster insights to run more accurate forecast models,
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.280]   it's almost like they're controlling the weather themselves.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.220]   Lenovo and CDW, make amazing happen.

[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.520]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.460]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills,
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.760]   insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.580]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.160]   Today is Friday, May 17th, 2024.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.420]   Friday, May 17th, 2020, 2024.
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.240]   On this Friday, as we do on every Friday,
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.860]   which I can arrange a microphone and a computer and a video camera and all that stuff,
[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.520]   we record a live Friday Q&A.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.360]   [MUSIC]
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.960]   This is your first time here for a Friday Q&A show.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.920]   I welcome you. It works just like call-in talk radio.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.640]   You call in, talk about anything that you want,
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.180]   ask any questions that you have,
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.440]   raise any topics of conversation that you have,
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.600]   you direct the call.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.120]   It is an open-line Friday show.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.000]   You can join today's show or any Friday show by becoming a patron of the show.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.200]   Go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance,
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.600]   patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.000]   Support the show on Patreon and that gains access for
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.480]   you to one of these Friday Q&A shows.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.840]   In addition, quick note,
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.320]   you may have noticed in the podcast feed,
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.240]   but I have opened up consulting appointments.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.080]   So if you are interested in a personal consultation with me,
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.820]   you can sign up for a consultation at the end of May, beginning of June.
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.860]   I have two weeks open,
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.380]   a total of 50 slots.
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.980]   I've actually sold out about 10 of them so far,
[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.320]   in the last few hours since I published the announcement.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.780]   So we're down to about 40 slots.
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.780]   You can sign up for that if you go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/consult.
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.860]   My timing is messed up today.
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.980]   Radicalpersonalfinance.com/consult.
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.780]   If you want the cheapest way to talk to me,
[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.460]   cheapest way to talk to me is generally by joining me for a Friday Q&A show,
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.480]   but then I get to pick and choose based upon what's interesting and cut you off
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.960]   when I want to and all that stuff.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.680]   And you give me content for the public podcast.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.520]   If you want to talk to me, though,
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.120]   you like the way that I interact with you on a Friday Q&A show,
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.120]   you can sign up for a personal consultation at radicalpersonalfinance.com/consult.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.640]   Radicalpersonalfinance.com/consult.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.540]   We begin today with Larry in California.
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.280]   Larry, welcome to the show.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.280]   How can I serve you today?
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.720]   Hey, Jeff, hope you're doing okay.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.320]   A little bit soft.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.520]   Let's check the connections on my end.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.720]   If you can do anything on your end,
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.600]   just pop off of a handset or something like that,
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.600]   that would be helpful.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:07.100]   Go ahead when you're ready.
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.560]   Okay, great.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.840]   First of all, for the other listeners,
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.680]   just give a plug for the personal consulting.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.560]   I did that last year and found it well worth it.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.380]   Thank you.
[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.000]   Today I've got a different question.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.320]   So my wife has been doing private consulting
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.680]   for a little bit of time,
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.200]   and she set up an LLC to help with that effort.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.420]   More recently, she started a new venture with a partner
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.360]   where they're going to be splitting all their proceeds 50/50.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.360]   And we're kind of sitting here wondering
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.680]   how to structure that new venture
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.680]   and kind of what to do with the LLC that already exists.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.640]   Okay.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.240]   Why does she want any kind of business entity
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.280]   in the first place?
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.440]   For the new partnership,
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.320]   I think just as kind of an organizing structure
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.320]   to provide some liability safety,
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.040]   we set up her personal LLC separately
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.800]   because we thought it could help
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.240]   kind of segment the income and help with taxes.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.160]   Okay.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.440]   So the reason I ask it is before you do anything,
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.480]   it's important to ask why you're going to do something.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.840]   And it is perfectly common and normal
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.080]   to establish some form of business entity for a business,
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.080]   but I always question, is it necessary?
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.840]   And whether or not it's necessary
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.960]   is going to depend in many cases on the actual facts
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.200]   and also based upon who you actually ask for advice.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.560]   So the first thing I would point out
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.280]   is the reason to have a limited liability corporation
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.000]   is to protect yourself from liability.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.640]   But generally with something like a consulting business,
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.920]   a limited liability corporation
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.360]   doesn't protect you from any liability
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.040]   because you don't really have any.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.200]   So if you're just giving your advice to people
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.040]   and interacting with people as a professional,
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.960]   you have professional liability,
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.480]   but an LLC doesn't protect you from professional liability.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.240]   Rather some form of errors and omissions insurance
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.840]   or other professional liability insurance policy
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.920]   is what you need to protect you there.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.800]   And so establishing a limited liability corporation
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.360]   for a business that doesn't really have any liability
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.240]   is not that big of a,
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.720]   is not particularly important as a thing to do.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.920]   Now, it may be something that you do
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.920]   if you are trying to file for your tax returns
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.760]   as an LLC tax, as an S corporation,
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.640]   that's the second most common reason that people do that.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.840]   But I think there do the math carefully
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.560]   because depending on what state you're in,
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.600]   depending on the cost
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.720]   of preparing your business tax returns,
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.480]   depending on all of that stuff,
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.800]   it may or may not actually work out
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.080]   and may or may not actually save you all that much money
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.680]   in the long run.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.000]   So what I have found is that while these are great tools
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.920]   and they're useful tools for many people to use,
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.680]   in general, they're tools that are probably overused
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.320]   and you wind up spending all the money
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.160]   that you would have paid in social security taxes.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.960]   Instead, you wind up spending it all
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.800]   in tax preparation fees for yet another entity
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.800]   and yet another set of California franchise tax board
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.480]   filings and things like that.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.240]   Why not go ahead and just pay self-employment taxes
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.040]   and increase your social security wage base
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.840]   or social security earnings record,
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.400]   which may result in earning a few bucks down the road.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.240]   So run the math on it before you do it.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.280]   And for something like a consulting business,
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.560]   there's generally not a lot of liability.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.120]   Now, to the new partnership,
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.240]   will this continue to be a consulting business
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   with no employees, no plant, no equipment,
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.160]   just two individuals working together as consultants,
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.120]   or is this entity probably going to get bigger?
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.000]   - It looks like it may expand
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.840]   to bring on additional employees.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.960]   - Okay.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.280]   Well, then when you have liability,
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.240]   then that's a really good reason for you to make sure
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.120]   that you have a separate entity.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.120]   And so in general, you will choose probably another LLC.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.080]   You could, of course, adjust the current LLC,
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.040]   but my thought would be, depending on the costs involved,
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.240]   it's probably simpler just to start a new one
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.880]   with the member units distributed
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.120]   between the two partners from the beginning
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.440]   so that everything is clean.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.840]   And if you're gonna shut the other one down,
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.320]   shut the other one down, finalize the whole thing,
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.560]   create a new entity,
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.520]   unless there are substantial costs associated with it.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.480]   Do you think that an LLC is appropriate,
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.960]   or do you think that a more formal corporation
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.320]   would be appropriate for this new entity
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.480]   and this new business?
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.200]   - I think that's what they're trying to figure out.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.080]   I think the question we have
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.720]   that we're not totally sure how to solve
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.440]   is there will be certain expenses
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.640]   that are kind of truly joint for the business,
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.600]   say, legal fees for contracts and things like that.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.040]   But then there are gonna be other expenses
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.200]   that are kind of more personal
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.320]   that you might not wanna split 50/50
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.160]   at the partnership level,
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.840]   say, gas or certain business meals.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:22.480]   The question is how to structure the consulting business
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.320]   to kind of capture those joint expenses
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.360]   as part of the business,
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.440]   but also be able to have kind of more personal
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.120]   business-related expenses separately.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.680]   And if you need some kind of structure to do that,
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:39.680]   like a second business entity or if that's unnecessary.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.880]   - Generally, more entities are not necessary.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.200]   You can establish any kind of compensation plan
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.560]   in just about any kind of business that you want to.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.320]   So if you want to include as part of the compensation plan
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.560]   that this person gets these benefits, then that's fine.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.280]   You don't wanna go around just willy-nilly
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.000]   creating entity after entity after entity.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.440]   They're expensive and they're a hassle.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.720]   They require bookkeeping,
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.360]   they require proper management of the corporate affairs.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.600]   They're expensive and they're a hassle.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.400]   So you want the bare minimum necessary
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.360]   to do the job fully and properly.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.000]   Going back just a step from the business entity,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.040]   what is this partnership plan to be a 50/50 partnership?
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.960]   - Yes.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.040]   - What is each partner bringing to the table?
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.040]   - The consulting is doing brand strategy
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.800]   and kind of founder coaching.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.600]   They do have a different and complementary skillset.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.360]   One is a little more marketing focused.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.360]   One is more business planning
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.880]   and helping folks find investors.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.680]   - Okay, so you're anticipating what I'm focusing on,
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.680]   which is to say that in order for a partnership to work,
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.200]   the partner should bring complementary skillsets
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.200]   to the table so that they produce more as a team
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.280]   than they would as individuals working alone.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.160]   Is there, who's gonna invest the money?
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.480]   Are both, is the money coming in equally?
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.600]   Is it just everything,
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.200]   it's a natural 50/50 split from the beginning?
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.840]   - Yeah, it's a natural 50/50 split from the beginning.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.840]   - Okay.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.840]   So I don't know that there's a clear or obvious answer
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.280]   that I know from right off the bat
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.800]   without getting into the details
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:36.800]   of what specifically you want to accomplish
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.640]   from a compensation perspective
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.360]   and what kind of deductions and benefits
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.120]   and things like that that you want.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:51.600]   Either the easiest thing to establish is an LLC
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.120]   and then you can choose to be taxed as an S-corporation.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.440]   In this case, you generally want to establish
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.120]   a corporate entity in order to protect yourself
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.640]   against unlimited liability that you would have
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.960]   in a partnership arrangement that weren't in a corporation.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.880]   So when you're going into an actual partnership
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.080]   to protect yourself from unlimited liability
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.560]   from your business partner,
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.480]   then you definitely do want to go ahead
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.080]   and establish an entity.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.800]   An LLC taxed as an S-corporation
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.200]   allows all of the income to flow through
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.040]   and it's simpler, that's why it's loved.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.320]   There are fewer administrative requirements,
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.160]   it's less expensive to maintain generally,
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.880]   it's just simpler.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:38.720]   An S-corporation or a C-corporation is more burdensome
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.680]   from the perspective of maintenance of the entity.
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.600]   But you're going to appreciate
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.920]   some of the higher level planning
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.200]   that you can do with either of those operations.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.200]   So I can't answer it here in the context of a call
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.600]   because you would want to look at things
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.720]   like health insurance.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.560]   Do we want to put programs through?
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.120]   Do we want to have executive compensation programs?
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.400]   How much money are we actually looking to make?
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.920]   If this is the kind of thing where there's going to be
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.080]   $100,000 split two ways,
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.280]   then we're pretty obviously going to want a simple entity
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.040]   that just passes the money through
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.760]   and distributes everything on a simple equal basis.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.000]   On the other hand, if this is a seven figure business
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.360]   and or multiple seven figures
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.400]   or an eight figure business with potential,
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.560]   then we may want to go ahead
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.600]   and have more of the formalities
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.840]   that we can bring in more of the programs
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.000]   and benefit programs that we would like to have
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.680]   with a corporation.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.240]   Some form of self-reimbursed medical program
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.200]   might be useful to one of the partners.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.960]   You may want to go ahead and bring in
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.200]   something related to transportation allowances,
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.160]   car allowances, things like that.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:53.160]   So I don't think I can go further here in this context
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.320]   without going through those step-by-step.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.000]   So I'd recommend and refer you to a local attorney
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.080]   for a consultation or an accountant
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.040]   who could go through
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.360]   and look at the anticipated profit of the business
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.960]   and then see if there's kind of a natural connection
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.080]   for one entity over another.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.080]   There's nothing wrong with starting as an LLC
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.320]   and then changing in the future.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.580]   That's the simplest and easiest to get going.
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.240]   - Sounds great, thank you.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.160]   - My pleasure.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.000]   All right, move on to Christian.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.840]   Christian, welcome to the show.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.760]   How can I serve you today?
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.600]   - Hi, Joshua.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.760]   And thanks for that last answer.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.560]   It was, I just actually brought in partners
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.520]   from my consulting firm.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.280]   And so we had gone through all those discussions
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.120]   and so forth.
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.040]   - What did you wind up doing
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.200]   in terms of your entity selection?
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.480]   - Yeah, so we actually went with a multi-tiered structure
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.920]   so that we have a partnership that's an LLC,
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:51.480]   and then we each own our ownership
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.040]   through individual S-corps that we have.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.640]   So we are expecting this to be,
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.940]   it's already in the seven figures
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:03.160]   and expecting to get to an eight-figure company pretty soon.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.920]   So we'll be bringing in junior partners and so forth
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:06.960]   for the partnership.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.920]   But to be able to control some of the taxes,
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.440]   how we want to be taxed and our own compensations
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.960]   and split of the profits and so forth,
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:19.480]   we were advised that having that individual S-corp
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.040]   that owns the shares of the partnership
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.040]   would be most advantageous.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.720]   - Yeah, when you have significant money coming in,
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.640]   significant revenue and potential for significant profit,
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.520]   then you absolutely need to make sure
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.960]   that you're getting full advice
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.200]   and that you are structured in a way
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.760]   that takes advantage of it
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:43.240]   with as many individual entities as necessary
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.840]   to get what you're looking for.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.700]   It is much easier to pay your annual tax preparation fees
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.160]   for three or four different entities
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.720]   and pay for your bookkeeping and administrative costs
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:55.360]   and your franchise tax board costs and all that stuff
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.480]   when you have seven figures
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.480]   than if you're just getting started
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.000]   and you may have $70,000 of revenue.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.280]   So good move, and that sounds like a super interesting,
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.400]   I would have enjoyed being there
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.680]   and listening to those conversations
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.880]   and planning your structure personally.
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.520]   Go ahead with your topic of conversation, please.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.560]   - Yeah, so my question's entirely different.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.320]   I was actually gonna ask you about language learning
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.620]   for young children.
[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:23.080]   So my wife and I have two kids, three and eight months.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.680]   Our three-year-old, we started off actually speaking
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.000]   Portuguese at home with her.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.200]   My wife is Brazilian.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.480]   My Portuguese was good enough for young kids.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.100]   So we got by with that, and then after a little while,
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.560]   we lived here in Texas, we started speaking,
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.360]   or I started speaking English with her.
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:43.200]   And so she transitioned to that just to help at church
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:47.640]   and elsewhere, she was getting frustrated communicating.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.280]   And now I'm trying to actually speak German with her.
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:55.360]   And she's getting very frustrated with that
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.760]   as we're trying to teach her that,
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.320]   'cause we figured, okay, we can do one parent,
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.320]   one language at home, now Portuguese with my wife,
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.580]   German with me, and then she can speak English elsewhere.
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.560]   And yeah, she's been having trouble with it.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.360]   It's not been easy for her.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.240]   She gets very, very frustrated, it doesn't go very well.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.820]   But we're sticking to it.
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.520]   I was just wondering about that approach.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.420]   Also with the eight-month-old, I was gonna start speaking
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.140]   actually German in the home with him,
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.500]   and then maybe transition him to more English outside.
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.620]   And that was kind of our approach or our strategy.
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:30.040]   But I was wondering how you approach it with younger kids
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:35.040]   and any tools or tips or anything like that
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.660]   to be able to get them immersed easily,
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.760]   especially when you're trying to do languages
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.460]   that aren't predominant in the area that you live.
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.700]   - Is your German sufficiently strong
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:48.820]   that you will feel comfortable having the fullness
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.480]   of your relationship with your children in German?
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.140]   - I can do that.
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.940]   I went to grad school in Switzerland in a German program,
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.740]   so I'm fine with that.
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.820]   I need to brush it up a little bit probably as we mature,
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.620]   but I don't think I would have any issues
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:05.700]   with that in the long run.
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.660]   - Okay, so to me, that's the most important thing
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.980]   is just to make certain that your language ability
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.400]   is a level that you can really do it.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.580]   And that requires mastery of a language,
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.820]   and you really need the high level
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:22.660]   in order for one language to work.
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.980]   I think that your plan of your wife speaking Portuguese
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.580]   exclusively and you speaking German exclusively,
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.260]   and then perhaps your community language
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.940]   is English on occasion is the right plan.
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:38.340]   And what I would say is the frustration,
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.840]   if there is frustration,
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.180]   then it should be relatively short-lived
[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.340]   because the frustration is coming from the fact
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.820]   that perhaps you didn't begin from the beginning.
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.660]   So I would expect your eight-month-old
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.220]   to not experience frustration,
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.320]   and your three-year-old to experience frustration
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.740]   just for a fairly short period of time.
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:17:59.940]   I don't think that,
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:03.380]   I guess my only comment in terms of frustration
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:07.180]   is I wouldn't try to require in the short term
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.940]   your three-year-old to speak in German to you.
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.580]   And so as long as there's enough English input
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.400]   from school or from community,
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:19.340]   if she can reply in whatever language she wants.
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:23.220]   But at three years old, you could change to Russian tomorrow
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:24.260]   and she would figure it out
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.340]   and be fine in a couple of months.
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.780]   I've never known, I know a lot of families
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.380]   who are multilingual who do one parent, one language.
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.380]   I've known families who do one parent, one language
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.200]   where mom speaks a different language,
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.400]   dad speaks a different language,
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.500]   and then their community language is a third language.
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.700]   And it works fine.
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.860]   It absolutely is the best way to do it.
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:46.860]   And it works fine as long as the parents don't give in.
[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:50.340]   If the parents give in and they allow the child
[00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.500]   in the fullness of time to have the relationship
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.380]   in another language, then something happens.
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.700]   So what I find is with when your child
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.740]   is facing frustration, you have to look at it and say,
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.820]   is this something that is genuinely a problem?
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.940]   Or is this something where I'm just gonna be tougher
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.800]   than my child is?
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.900]   And obviously you wanna make good decisions as a parent,
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.620]   but in general, it just comes down to who's gonna be tougher
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.440]   and more stubborn.
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.700]   And I've determined I'm gonna win every stubbornness battle
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.020]   because I'm gonna make a decision.
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:22.780]   And if I make the decision, I say,
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.100]   this is the best thing for my child,
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.780]   I'm far more stubborn than you are at three years old.
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.500]   So I think it'll work fine.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.660]   What I would suggest is that you add in media
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.220]   in a way to make sure that there's more exposure.
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.200]   Remember that if a child starts learning a language
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:43.020]   from the age of one, he's being spoken to
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:46.460]   for thousands of hours in the language
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.740]   before he sticks out even the first sounds,
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:53.700]   the first da-da, it's so much input.
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.100]   And so if you've recently made the switch to German,
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.540]   then really pour on the input.
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:02.260]   And so story time with lots of great story books
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.860]   every night in German, movies in German,
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:10.300]   tablet in German, if you're using a tablet or computer,
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:14.040]   making sure that there's some kind of German exposure,
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.500]   go take a special trip to Germany for three or four weeks
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.300]   and make certain that you get involved in something local
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.220]   where there's a lot of exposure.
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.180]   Because it just is a numbers game
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.700]   based upon who gets the most exposure.
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.340]   And what causes failure is when people are thinking
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.620]   that somehow I'm gonna do 30 minutes a day
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.300]   of German exposure or whatever language exposure,
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.100]   and that's gonna overcome the 15 hours a day
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.340]   of other language exposure that's there.
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.480]   It's not, it needs to be quite a lot.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.440]   And so if you'll be super intentional about it
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.140]   for the next six months to a year,
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:52.340]   I would bet that a year from now, nothing has changed.
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:55.520]   And then the standard, by the way, I'm contradicting myself.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.680]   So let me identify the contradiction.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.520]   I said, I wouldn't require the child to respond in German
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.000]   because maybe we can relieve the frustration.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.880]   Then I also said, but who's gonna be more stubborn?
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.080]   I think you should balance it,
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.600]   but the vision should be within six months or a year,
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.140]   if I've just started this,
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.740]   that we're going to interact in German
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.680]   and the child's going to interact with me in German
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.280]   and I'm gonna interact with the child in German all the time.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.780]   So I would just say it's going to work.
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:23.920]   It's absolutely great.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.600]   Your child can learn English
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.960]   for the community language in Texas.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.480]   Your wife can speak Portuguese.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.560]   You can speak German.
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.300]   And on occasion, you can use English as a family language.
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.100]   Just be careful because if you have,
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.060]   you need to get in the hours of German
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.900]   in order for her to reach that point.
[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:45.860]   - Right, yeah, and I've noticed one of the challenges
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:48.420]   is that my wife and I speak together in English primarily.
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.980]   It's just always what we've done.
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.180]   I didn't know Portuguese when I met her.
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.980]   So that becomes an issue
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.660]   'cause our daughter wants to try to speak more English
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:21:59.820]   with my wife now.
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.820]   So we've always got to try to remind her,
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.620]   hey, no, stick with Portuguese, stick with Portuguese.
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.940]   And that's become a challenging point.
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.180]   - I've listened to parents who do,
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.460]   I mean, I believe you can do it.
[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.340]   In your situation, it'll be simple.
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.180]   And what I mean by simple is you be committed to German.
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.540]   Whenever you're with your daughter,
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.640]   it's always German between the two of you.
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.140]   You don't read to her in English.
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.940]   You don't read to her in Portuguese.
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.220]   It's always German.
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.400]   All your books are German.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.700]   Everything's German.
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.620]   That's your relationship language.
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.060]   And then with your wife, the same thing.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:32.620]   It's Portuguese all the time.
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.940]   And then use audio books
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.660]   and use other people who are reading in English
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.060]   and the school teachers and things like that.
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:41.900]   It's fine to have English as a community language
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:42.740]   at the dinner table,
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.300]   as long as you're consistent about the other times.
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.140]   I have heard from parents who've been very successful,
[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.920]   even just using different languages on different days,
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.340]   but the child needs a context for the language.
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.740]   I'm sure you've experienced this yourself
[00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.460]   with German and with English.
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.480]   I have friends who speak,
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.740]   I speak Spanish and English, very comfortable,
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:04.400]   totally comfortable, I need a language.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.380]   I have friends of mine who are perfectly comfortable
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.500]   in both languages.
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.500]   In the beginning, there's kind of a back and forth
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.060]   about what language are we gonna do.
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.500]   After the first couple of conversations,
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.820]   whatever the language of our relationship is,
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.700]   that's the language of our relationship.
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:20.900]   And I can't switch it.
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.220]   It's just so uncomfortable to switch it,
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.460]   even though both people are totally comfortable
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.540]   in both languages.
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.940]   It's something about the brain where it says,
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.780]   this person, this is a relationship
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:32.860]   that happens in this language.
[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:34.900]   And so I would say that your daughter's probably
[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:35.780]   still working through that.
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.080]   So just stick to your guns.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.180]   You won't regret it.
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.660]   You will be happy with it,
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.620]   even if you have to just muscle through the frustration.
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.540]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:49.220]   As an aside, have you played with the ChatGPT voice
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.700]   capabilities for language learning?
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.340]   - A lot, yes.
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.180]   - Okay, yeah, yeah.
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.380]   I've been working with that
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.020]   and I found it incredibly helpful.
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:57.180]   I've been trying to find a good app
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.660]   that actually ties into it a little bit more naturally,
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:00.740]   but I haven't found anything.
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.580]   But it's been great.
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:04.420]   - It has been.
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.140]   I have been using it to tutor.
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.460]   So I've been testing it extensively.
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.260]   I've used it for conversations.
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.140]   I'm amazed with the switching ability.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.200]   It's scary good at switching.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.740]   You could start your conversation with it in English
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.820]   and just without any warning whatsoever,
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:22.100]   you switch to German and it'll switch right back with you.
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.220]   You can switch to Portuguese.
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:26.400]   It's scary good with regard to switching.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.860]   I find that it's really useful for back and forth.
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.660]   As long as we have a scenario base.
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.660]   So what I think is the best way right now
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:37.140]   that I've found to use it is you can use it
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.820]   to create a list of scenarios.
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:40.180]   So let's say you're gonna travel.
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.340]   So you say, give me a list of 10 different scenarios,
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.420]   the kinds of things that would be
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.060]   in a standard language book.
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:48.260]   And then give me dialogues for those scenarios.
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.900]   And you do this in text form.
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.780]   Now you take those dialogues and you say, let's role play.
[00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.300]   And you give it the instructions that you want.
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.220]   You do it all verbally and go back and forth
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.060]   and back and forth.
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.740]   It's so useful to have a conversation partner
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.580]   who's gonna feed you different things
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:03.420]   and different scenarios.
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:04.460]   I think it's great.
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.620]   I've also find it really useful
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:10.240]   for making sense of language textbooks.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.620]   I've been teaching my children how to use it
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.300]   with a language textbook for the languages
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.260]   that they're learning that I don't know.
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:18.980]   And so it'll, you know, language textbook will say,
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.700]   hey, do group work.
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.540]   I'll say, well, listen, I don't have group work.
[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.220]   So let's take a picture of the page,
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.020]   send it to chat GPT and tell chat and say,
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.060]   listen, we're gonna do a role play.
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.060]   I need you, I don't have a group partner
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.940]   to do this example from my Chinese textbook.
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.220]   So let's go back and forth
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:37.020]   and let's do the example together.
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.200]   And I find that that's a useful tool as well.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.460]   It's really working well.
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:43.700]   - Yeah, I've been using it where,
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.100]   I like that role playing idea,
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.260]   or I've just been talking to it,
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:47.380]   starting off a conversation.
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.300]   I'll usually open with the prompt of,
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:52.380]   hey, I'm learning, you know, whatever language, Spanish,
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.380]   or working on my Portuguese and start the conversation
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.500]   and tell it to give me corrections
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.140]   if on any grammatical mistakes or pronunciation mistakes
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.140]   or anything like that.
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.740]   And it's usually pretty good about it,
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.340]   about getting back and it'll give me the response
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.180]   and then correct everything.
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.620]   So I have that quick feedback of,
[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:08.700]   oh, I made a mistake here
[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.300]   and then continue the conversation.
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.780]   - Yeah, chat GPT is completely upending
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.420]   the world of languages.
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.580]   I still think it's valuable to learn languages,
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.220]   but I'll tell you what,
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:23.580]   we're already there with real time AI translation.
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:25.420]   And I can't even imagine how good it's gonna be
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:29.500]   in five years with real time AI translation.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.220]   It's so, so good.
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.940]   So we'll see, it's an exciting world we live in.
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:35.940]   For now, the learning tools right now,
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.300]   using chat GPT as a personal tutor,
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.860]   as a personal teacher is, it's so good.
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.700]   So we'll keep it up and I hope it works out.
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.580]   Anything else from you?
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:47.420]   - No, that was it.
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.260]   Thanks, I appreciate it.
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:49.820]   - Great.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.060]   And with that, I had two more callers on the line,
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.380]   but they both dropped off.
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:56.140]   So we'll just end it there early today.
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.140]   Thank you so much for listening to today's podcast.
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.020]   Remember, if you'd like to join me

[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:06.780]   where I can be more prepared for a question
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.620]   like in depth discussion of entity formation,
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:10.700]   things like that.
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.420]   And if carefully thought through the situation in advance,
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:16.780]   you can do that by going to radicalpersonalfinance.com/consult,

[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:20.180]   Talk soon.
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:24.060]   Something amazing is happening with supply chains.
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.500]   They're practically running themselves quickly and securely.
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.020]   That's because retailers consulted with CDW
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.500]   who designed and built a Cisco security solution
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.500]   to defend against attacks and respond to threats.
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:36.740]   With end-to-end protection,
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:38.580]   better decisions are made in real time,
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:41.060]   ensuring warehouse and customer data stay safe
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.260]   until products land at their destination.
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:46.180]   Cisco and CDW make amazing happen.
