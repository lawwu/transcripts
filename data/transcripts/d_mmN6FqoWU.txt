[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   All right, I think we have time for one more quick question.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Richie asks, "Have you read 4000 Weeks Time Management for Immortals by Oliver Berkman? If so, what are your thoughts?"
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Yes, Richie, I've read it. I blurbed it.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Now look at the back of the cover. There's no one read the blurbs anymore. I gave it a nice quote.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   I then told Tim Ferriss about it, and Tim read it on my recommendation, and he actually excerpted the whole first chapter and played it on his podcast,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   and wrote a blog post about it. So I've been trying to do what I can to spread the word.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   I like 4000 Weeks a lot. I think it's a great book.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   And the premise of the book is we have 4000 weeks, roughly speaking, to live.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   You can't do all the things you think you want to do.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   So having a value-based system of productivity in which I got to nail all these different things done,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   and that's where I'm going to get my self-worth, through the quantity of high-end accomplishment, is a sucker's game because you can't do all those things.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   All right, so what next? And that's the question that Oliver addresses.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Once you realize, when you're his age or my age or Jesse's age or all roughly the same age, that, like, "Okay, well, I'm not going to do this,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   and I ran out of time to do this, and if this was going to happen in my life, I already would have had to have been on the road to this about 15 years ago.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   So what next?" And that's the question that he tackles.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   And I think it's a really big question. Most things you can't do.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   You've got to choose a few that matter and do them and enjoy them and go along for the ride and be resilient when that ride doesn't go exactly where you think it would be,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   and course-correct when you can, but also recognize that, you know,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   maybe this vision you had is not going to quite be that vision and still be able to enjoy the wonder and grace of life nonetheless.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And I think that was the message Oliver was making, and it's a message that a lot of people were ready to hear,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   especially in this post-pandemic moment where everyone got disrupted and are asking these questions about, "What is the deep life? What do I actually want to do?"
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   So it was a perfectly timed book. It did very well.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   If you have not read it, check it out. 4,000 weeks.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And if you want to hear the first chapter, look at Tim Ferriss's podcast from last month, I believe,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   and you can actually hear the whole first chapter online.
