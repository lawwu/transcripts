[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   Psalm 21, for the choir director, a psalm of David.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:16.640]   O Yahweh, in your strength the king will be glad, and in your salvation how greatly he
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.720]   will rejoice.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.360]   You have given him his heart's desire, and have not withheld the request of his lips.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.040]   For you meet him with the blessings of good things; you set a crown of fine gold on his
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.640]   head.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.280]   He asked life of you; you gave it to him, length of days forever and ever.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.960]   His glory is great through your salvation, splendor and majesty you bestow upon him.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:54.300]   For you make him most blessed forever; you make him joyful with gladness in your presence.
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.800]   For the king trusts in Yahweh, and through the loving-kindness of the Most High he will
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.160]   not be shaken.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.080]   Your hand will find out all your enemies; your right hand will find out those who hate
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.220]   you.
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.740]   You will make them as a fiery oven in the time of your anger; Yahweh will swallow them
[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.080]   up in his wrath, and fire will devour them.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.200]   Their offspring you will destroy from the earth, their seed from among the sons of men.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.980]   Though they intended evil against you, and devised a scheme, they will not succeed.
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.540]   For you will make them turn their back; you will aim your bowstring at their faces.
[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.820]   Be exalted, O Yahweh, in your strength; we will sing and praise your might.
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.320]   Amen.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.380]   you
[00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:58.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
