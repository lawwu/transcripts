[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.040]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.400]   and welcome back Pastor John.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.240]   We have a question from a listener named Tuck Warner
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.520]   in Coldstream, Canada.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.380]   Dear Pastor John, although I see that the Bible
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.360]   supports a predestination concept,
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.520]   I'm still having trouble reconciling the fact
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.600]   that a perfectly loving God would in essence
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.720]   force us to love him and leave us no other options.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.200]   If his love is perfect, then how can he not allow us
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.360]   the freedom to accept or reject it?
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.320]   How would you respond to Tuck?
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.280]   - I have three responses.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.880]   And mainly, these are responses to the way
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.520]   the question is asked, but I think can help
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.720]   get at the underlying issues he's concerned about.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.340]   The first response has to do with assuming
[00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.560]   that we know what it means for God to be perfectly loving.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.160]   Before we actually see from the Bible how he loved.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.160]   Second is a response that has to do with the word force.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.660]   When he asks, would God force us to love him?
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.000]   I wanna say a word about force.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   And third is a response to God allowing us freedom
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.520]   to accept or reject his love.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.020]   So those are my three things
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.360]   I wanna say a word about.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.040]   When Tuck asks how a perfectly loving God
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.000]   could do this or that, it seems to suggest,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.540]   and I could be wrong, that he has in mind
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.680]   the way a perfectly loving God must act.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.640]   But we humans are not in a very good position
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.160]   to define what perfect love in the creator
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.800]   of the universe must look like.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.980]   We are too sinful, too finite, too culturally bound.
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.080]   For example, this is right off my front burner,
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.660]   I think that if the federal government of Norway
[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.660]   were to vote on what a loving God must or may not do,
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.380]   they wouldn't allow him to spank his children.
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.500]   This has been very much in the news recently
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.580]   because Norway has become increasingly,
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.940]   it seems, heavy-handed, I would say that anyway,
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.000]   in removing children from their parents
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.260]   who don't measure up precisely to the ideas
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.460]   of what parental love looks like to the government.
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.580]   Whoa, government.
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.980]   Well, it's as plain as the nose on your face
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.500]   that God spanks his children.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.140]   God takes the life of his children
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.860]   in 1 Corinthians 11 over the Lord's Supper
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.420]   and he spanks them in Hebrews 12.
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.660]   "In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.480]   "to the point of shedding your blood.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.000]   "And have you forgotten the exhortation
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.320]   "that addresses you as sons?
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.640]   "My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.440]   "nor be weary when reproved by him.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.960]   "For the Lord disciplines the one he loves
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.460]   "and chastises every son whom he receives.
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.740]   "It is for discipline that you have to endure.
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.080]   "God is treating you as sons for what son is there
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.420]   "whom his father does not discipline."
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.560]   Now, the point of what I'm saying,
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.860]   don't distort it by saying Christian parents
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.820]   have a right to take the lives of their children.
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.980]   God forbid that anybody would interpret me that way,
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.720]   but God does.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.640]   God has that right.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.520]   I'm not talking about how to discipline children
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.360]   in this podcast.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.900]   We can do that another time.
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.180]   I'm talking about the cultural limitations
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.540]   on defining what God can do as a loving God.
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.980]   If you start with the cultural assumption
[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.980]   that God cannot do something hurtful to his children,
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.360]   you have canceled out scriptures.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.060]   We need to learn from scripture
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.880]   what love is going to look like.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.000]   So that's all I'm saying,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.420]   is that we bring to the Bible assumptions
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.740]   that may or may not be true
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.700]   in regard to what the love of God must do.
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.100]   Let's let the Bible define God's love.
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.880]   That's my first response.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.460]   My second response is to the word force
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.080]   when Tuck says he has trouble reconciling
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.540]   the fact that a perfectly loving God
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.680]   would in essence force us to love him
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.260]   and leave us no other option.
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.840]   Now, the problem I have with that
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.180]   is that it creates a picture in our minds
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.980]   that is not accurate.
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.980]   Anyone who loves God genuinely loves God freely.
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.340]   He does.
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.160]   He loves God freely.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.900]   Anyone who loves God genuinely loves God freely.
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.440]   That is, he loves God because he wants to love God.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.680]   That's what it means to love God.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.820]   To love God is to see God as infinitely worthy
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.780]   of being loved.
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.820]   To love God is to see God as beautiful
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.400]   and worthy and satisfying.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.260]   And thus seeing God,
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.780]   our hearts are drawn out to delight in him
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.140]   and enjoy him and be satisfied in him
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.180]   and treasure him above all things.
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.520]   Forced enjoyment is an oxymoron.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.940]   It can't be done.
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.460]   You can't force people to make their heart love
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.460]   what they don't love.
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.960]   You can force people to make physical movements
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.380]   they don't like to make,
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.980]   but you can't force them to like what they don't like.
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.900]   You can't force them to love what they don't love.
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.900]   So this picture that somehow we are loving God
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:18.060]   with our arm twisted behind our back in a painful action
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.340]   as God is forcing us to love him is ridiculous.
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.480]   It's not even ridiculous and wrong, it's inconceivable
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.020]   because that's not what love is.
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.820]   When God brings about love, and yes, he does,
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.460]   when God brings about love for himself in a heart
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.820]   where it didn't exist before,
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.340]   he does it by opening the eyes of the blind
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.500]   to see the irresistible beauties of Christ
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.500]   so that we freely delight in him.
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.340]   There isn't any other kind of love,
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.940]   but that kind of free love.
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.620]   Which brings us now to the third response
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.740]   that might help him understand the second.
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.260]   He says, "How can God not allow us the freedom
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.060]   "to accept or reject his love?"
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:16.060]   And the answer is that God does in fact leave many people
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.760]   the freedom to accept or reject his love.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.700]   And this is called judgment
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.780]   because nobody left to themselves
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.380]   will accept the love of God.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.780]   Nobody will accept the love of God.
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.780]   If God leaves us to our own so-called free will,
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.060]   the result will be rebellion and with it, damnation.
[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.500]   So all of us, including Tuck,
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.500]   need to seriously consider that we are not neutral.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.860]   I mean, Tuck's suggestion that maybe we're like a pendulum
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.300]   hanging straight down, not to the right, not to the left.
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.320]   We're neutral, ready to tilt to God or tilt to the devil.
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.380]   That's not true.
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:09.020]   The Bible from cover to cover says we're already tilted.
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.940]   We come into the word tilted.
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.540]   Tilted to the rejection of the love of God
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:18.020]   and such a firm inclination that the Bible calls it slavery,
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.020]   bondage to sin.
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:24.140]   And the only hope for us is not for God to leave us
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:28.940]   in our bondage to sin and watch what our free will will do,
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.180]   but to overcome our bondage
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:36.180]   and enable us to fulfill every inclination we have
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.480]   to worship Him or obey Him
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.020]   because we've seen the irresistible beauty of Christ.
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.960]   I'm recording this just a few days
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.880]   after being at Together for the Gospel 2016,
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.000]   where I preached on this issue.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.300]   And the title of the message was the bondage of the will,
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:04.300]   the sovereignty of grace, and the glory of God.
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:09.140]   And I would encourage Tuck to go to that website.
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.460]   It'll probably be up in a few days
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.000]   and to listen to my argument.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.280]   Let me try to give it in one minute.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:22.340]   The Bible talks in at least five, maybe more ways
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.540]   about how enslaved or in bondage my will is.
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:31.540]   It does not talk about me having a free will to do good.
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:35.960]   We're not free when bondage holds us this way.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.780]   In John 3, 19 to 20,
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.460]   we're in bondage to the love of darkness.
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.580]   In John 5, 43 and 44,
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.820]   we're in bondage to the love of self-glorification.
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.220]   How can you believe who love the glory of man
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.500]   and not the glory of God?
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.720]   In Romans 8, 6 to 8,
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.020]   we're in bondage to the mind of the flesh
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.340]   that is hostile to God.
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.740]   Everybody apart from the Holy Spirit is hostile to God.
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.420]   We don't submit to God's law.
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.660]   Indeed, we cannot.
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.860]   Ephesians 2, 1 to 4,
[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:13.380]   we're in bondage to spiritual deadness, deadness.
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.660]   And in 1 Corinthians 2, 13 to 14,
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.340]   we're in bondage to the natural man's mockery
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.900]   of spiritual things.
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.740]   We can't understand it
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.620]   because we think they're foolish to us.
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.320]   And in 2 Corinthians 4, 4,
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.640]   we're in bondage to blindness,
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.360]   to the gospel of the glory of Christ.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:36.120]   So tuck, if God leaves us to our free will,
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.000]   we will perish
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.600]   because we're only free to do what we love to do.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.840]   And what we love to do by nature is exalt ourselves, not God.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.600]   And the only possibility is to be set free
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.400]   by an act of sovereign grace,
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.340]   only the preciousness and beauty of sovereign grace
