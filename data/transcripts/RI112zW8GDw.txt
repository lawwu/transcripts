[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.200]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.200]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.020]   Today, my guest is Dr. Robert Malanka.
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.840]   Dr. Robert Malanka is a professor
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.680]   of psychiatry and behavioral sciences
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.160]   at Stanford University School of Medicine.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.640]   He is both a medical doctor and MD,
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.280]   and a researcher, a PhD.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.480]   His laboratory is famous for having discovered
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.700]   some of the key components allowing neuroplasticity,
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.960]   that is the nervous system's ability to change
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.040]   in response to experience.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.400]   In addition, Dr. Malanka's research
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.240]   is considered central to the textbook knowledge
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.160]   about how reward systems in the brain
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.880]   are organized and function.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.140]   Indeed, Dr. Malanka's research over the last 10 or 15 years
[00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.740]   has merged what was once two disparate fields,
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.080]   the first being the study of neuroplasticity,
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.180]   again, the nervous system's ability to change
[00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.640]   in response to experience,
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.600]   and the other field being the field of dopamine
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.900]   as it relates to pleasure and addiction.
[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.120]   His laboratory has shown, for instance,
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.620]   that when we seek out particular forms of pleasure,
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.960]   regardless of whether or not they are healthy for us,
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.780]   that changes the way that our reward circuitry works
[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.760]   and actually changes the way that dopamine is released
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.820]   and how it impacts the brain.
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.680]   And his work has also informed
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.660]   how we seek out healthy pleasures,
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.820]   including healthy food and social connection.
[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.900]   Today's discussion explores all of these topics,
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.800]   and by the end of today's discussion,
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.600]   you will have a rich understanding
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.680]   of how neurochemicals like dopamine and serotonin
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.980]   work in parallel to reinforce,
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.320]   that is, to increase the probability
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.960]   that we will engage in certain types
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.920]   of thinking and behaviors.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.460]   So if you are somebody interested in neuroplasticity,
[00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.240]   that is, how the nervous system can change
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.900]   in response to experience,
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.600]   and/or you are interested in reward systems,
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.440]   what motivates us and what we are likely to pursue
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.760]   in the future, given our choices of past?
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.340]   And if you are interested in things like social connection
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.460]   and empathy or lack thereof,
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.380]   today's discussion encompasses all of those topics.
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.800]   It is worth mentioning that Dr. Malenka is a true luminary
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.560]   in all of the fields I just mentioned,
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.260]   as well as several other fields.
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.880]   In fact, when you look out on the landscape
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.520]   of modern neuroscience, what you'll discover
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.440]   is that a very large percentage of the top laboratory
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.440]   studying neuroplasticity and reward systems and so on
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.060]   all stemmed from having trained in Dr. Malenka's laboratory.
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.520]   So it's a real honor and pleasure
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.080]   to be able to host him today,
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.960]   and I'm sure that our discussion
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.960]   is going to greatly enrich the way that you think
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.440]   about brain function, neuroplasticity, and reward.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.180]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.940]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.040]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.040]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.920]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.240]   to the general public.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.280]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.140]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.020]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.080]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.480]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.320]   The company was founded
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.320]   by two all-American swimmers from Stanford,
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.720]   and everything about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.940]   were designed with performance in mind.
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.040]   I've spent a lifetime working
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.600]   on the biology of the visual system,
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.060]   and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.680]   with an enormous number of challenges
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.920]   in order for you to be able to see clearly.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.520]   Roca understands those challenges
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.300]   and the biology of the visual system,
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.000]   such that they've designed sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.680]   that always allow you to see with crystal clarity.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.960]   Now, initially, Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.420]   were designed for sports performance,
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.560]   and as a consequence, all of their glasses
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.280]   are designed to be very lightweight
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.800]   and to not slip off your face if you get sweaty.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.800]   However, the design of the glasses
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.840]   includes some that are specifically for sport
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.320]   and others whose aesthetic
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.940]   really allows you to use them for sport
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.720]   as well as out to dinner or to work, et cetera,
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.040]   and that's how I use them.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.460]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses,
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.120]   you can go to roca.com.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.260]   That's R-O-K-A.com and enter the code Huberman
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.340]   to save 20% off your first order.
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.680]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A.com,
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.160]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.960]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.580]   Levels is a program that lets you see
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.120]   how different foods and behaviors affect your health
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.280]   by giving you real-time feedback on your diet
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.480]   using a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.820]   One of the most important factors
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.280]   impacting your immediate and long-term health
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.960]   is the way that your body manages its blood glucose,
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.620]   or sometimes referred to as blood sugar levels.
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.200]   To maintain energy and focus throughout the day,
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.960]   you want to keep your blood glucose steady
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.960]   without big spikes or dips.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.720]   Using Levels, you can monitor how different types of foods
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.580]   and different food combinations,
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.180]   as well as food timing and things like exercise,
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.780]   combine to impact your blood glucose levels.
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.200]   I started using Levels a little over a year ago,
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.580]   and it gave me a lot of insight
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.240]   into how specific foods were spiking my blood sugar
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.800]   and then leaving me feeling tired
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.380]   for several hours afterwards,
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.580]   as well as how the spacing of exercise and my meals
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.620]   was impacting my overall energy.
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.900]   And in doing so, it really allowed me to optimize
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.900]   how I eat, what I eat, when I exercise, and so on,
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.600]   such that my blood glucose levels and energy levels
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.140]   are stable throughout the day.
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.980]   If you're interested in learning more about Levels
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.640]   and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself,
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.440]   go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.320]   Right now, Levels is offering an additional
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.640]   two free months of membership.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.520]   Again, that's levels.link, L-I-N-K/huberman
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.560]   to get two free months of membership.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.060]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Robert Malenka.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.580]   Dr. Malenka, Rob, welcome.
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.940]   - Yeah, thanks for having me.
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.120]   - Delighted to have you here,
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.440]   both for sake of your medical knowledge and training
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.320]   as a psychiatrist, and of course,
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.840]   as a luminary in the field of neuroplasticity,
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.640]   dopamine and reward systems, social systems,
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.760]   your knowledge of autism and social interactions,
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.640]   a newer interest in, or perhaps old interest in psychedelics
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.600]   and what they're doing and potential for mental health.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.760]   There are just so many things that you've done
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.600]   in this field.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.040]   I've been a long, long time fan of your work
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.720]   since your days as an assistant professor.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.840]   I've tracked your career.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.000]   I've learned a tremendous amount from you by observing you
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.200]   and from being your colleague.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.520]   So really delighted to have you here.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.600]   - You're making me blush,
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.980]   and I don't blush easily.
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.040]   - Well, it's all true.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.760]   And I will say as well,
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.580]   you've also trained an enormous number
[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.820]   of incredible scientists, Carl Deisseroth,
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.820]   the Carl Deisseroth.
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.960]   Anna Lemke always speaks incredibly highly of you
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.400]   as a mentor and somebody she's learned
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.280]   a tremendous amount from.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.440]   And pretty much anyone that's worked on neuroplasticity,
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.280]   on dopamine and reward systems, addiction,
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.200]   and now in the fields of autism and soon psychedelics
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.240]   as well references as you often,
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.440]   and you've been mentioned many times before in this podcast,
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.080]   if not by name, by work.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.160]   So again, thank you for being here.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.840]   I'd love to kick off the conversation
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.680]   by talking about something which is very fundamental
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.340]   to everything we're going to talk about,
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.040]   but certainly fundamental to our daily lives,
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.400]   which is dopamine.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.840]   We hear so much about dopamine.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.600]   People talk about dopamine hits.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.640]   People think about dopamine as pleasure, dopamine reward.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.920]   For the novice, how would you frame the dopamine system?
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.520]   I mean, it does a bunch of different things
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.160]   in different areas of the brain and body,
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.520]   but to you, what does dopamine represent
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.380]   as its major function in the brain?
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.200]   And could you give us a general contour
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.800]   of the neural circuits that allow this chemical
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.720]   to more or less put value on our experiences?
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.360]   - Yeah, that's very well put.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.560]   As you point out, dopamine is one of the major,
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.280]   what we term neuromodulators in the brain,
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.760]   a chemical signaling messenger that the brain uses
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.140]   to mediate a complex array of actions.
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.160]   Its best well-known function is in what we call
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.460]   the brain's reward circuitry.
[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.680]   So this is a circuit in the brain,
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.160]   and when we use the term circuit,
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.940]   what we really mean is one part of the brain
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.820]   communicating with another part of the brain,
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.780]   because the brain is this very complex,
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.280]   it's the most complex organ in the universe
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.120]   with lots of different nerve cells
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.040]   talking to each other simultaneously.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.360]   And as neuroscientists, we try to parse
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.860]   what different brain areas are doing
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.060]   and what different neuromodulators might be doing.
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.500]   And dopamine was discovered, oh, I should know this,
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.500]   many decades ago, and it's, as I said,
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:36.120]   the major chemical messenger molecule
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.640]   in the so-called brain's reward circuitry.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.620]   And when you're talking about,
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.700]   so what is the brain's reward circuitry?
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:47.700]   This is a part of the brain that tells us something
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:54.160]   is reinforcing in our environment, some stimuli,
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:59.220]   or in quotes is rewarding, makes us feel better or good,
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:04.240]   although that's a gross oversimplification.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.560]   And before getting into the details of dopamine
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.640]   and its function in the reward circuitry,
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.760]   I think it's useful to talk about
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.780]   why do we need a reward circuitry?
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.560]   Why do we need something in our brain
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.560]   that tells us this feels good or this feels bad?
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.200]   And it goes back to evolution.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.680]   I am a biological scientist.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.900]   That means I believe in evolution.
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.120]   And if you think about the evolution of our species,
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:37.580]   everything is driven by developing mechanisms
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.640]   that increase our survival.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.460]   And it's really useful.
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.220]   You need something in your nervous system
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.480]   that tells you some stimuli in your environment
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.580]   is important for your survival,
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.800]   or some stimulus in your environment is dangerous.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   So it's not magic that sugary high fat laden foods
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:05.360]   are highly reinforcing and rewarding.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.520]   It's not an accident.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.320]   There has to be a mechanism in the brain
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.620]   that tells us that.
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:14.600]   It's not an accident that most of the time for most of us,
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.760]   a sexual experience is pretty reinforcing,
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.200]   is pretty rewarding.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.260]   It's not an accident that warmth feels really good
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.800]   when you're cold, that water tastes much better
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.020]   when you're really thirsty.
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.900]   What evolved is a mechanism to tell our nervous systems
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.400]   and tell our brains this feels pretty good.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.680]   I should repeat the behavior that leads
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.580]   to that rewarding experience.
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.320]   And similarly, it's really important
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:50.320]   when there is an event in your life that's highly dangerous
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.640]   for some mechanism in your brain to say,
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.160]   "Whoa, I don't wanna go back to where that line was."
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.480]   And we can get into that.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.960]   So this was a long-winded way of saying
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.240]   what the reward circuitry tells us is this event,
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.640]   this stimulus, it could be an external stimulus.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.960]   Like I said, a Krispy Kreme donut, which I happen to love,
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.520]   and I have to be very disciplined so I don't eat too many
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.560]   of them, it could be a drug of abuse,
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.860]   and maybe we'll talk about that a little bit.
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:27.800]   All of these stimuli seem to activate and cause the release
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.640]   of dopamine in this brain's reward circuitry.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.000]   So now we need to get into a little bit of detail.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Neuroscientists use these very unfriendly terms
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.920]   to describe different brain regions.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.880]   So the home of dopamine cells,
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.920]   or brain cells are called neurons,
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:55.840]   so the home of dopamine neurons are in a part of the brain,
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.860]   sort of what we call the lower midbrain.
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.960]   The dopamine neurons that are part of the reward circuitry
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.240]   are found in this area called the ventral tegmental area,
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.600]   which I'm sorry to have to use such technical jargon.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.640]   And we call it the VTA, that's the acronym.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.180]   - I think the roof of the midbrain is the tectum,
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:20.280]   it means roof and the base of the midbrain,
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.800]   it means floor, which is tegmentum.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.560]   I think that's the, so there's a rationale,
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.040]   but it doesn't help much at all to know the names.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.560]   - And in fact, you are absolutely correct,
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.240]   and I always forget that, so thank you for pointing that out.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.040]   - It's a side effect of teaching your anatomy.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.840]   - And then, which I once did back in the early '80s,
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.760]   but I've forgotten everything I taught.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.360]   Anyhow, so these dopamine neurons,
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.300]   and we can talk about other types of dopamine neurons,
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:50.760]   they send messages, what we call projections,
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.840]   using telegraph wires that we call axons.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.120]   They send projections to many different brain regions.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.800]   The key one in the brain's reward circuitry being an area,
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.480]   again, with a very complicated name
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.640]   called the nucleus accumbens,
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.120]   and maybe, Andrew, you know,
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.440]   I actually don't know how that name evolved,
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.480]   the nucleus accumbens, and I'm sure I should know,
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.280]   because I've been studying it for 30 years,
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.640]   but I have never looked up the genesis of that name.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.680]   - Well, the fortunate thing about this podcast
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.000]   is it's both on audio platforms like Spotify and Apple,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.800]   but also on YouTube, and so now we can be absolutely sure
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.080]   that somebody has put it into the YouTube comments
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.560]   underneath this episode,
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.520]   and therefore everyone will learn, including us.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.560]   So I don't know the origins of the word nucleus accumbens.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:45.160]   - And it's a gross oversimplification,
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.120]   but it's the activity of these dopamine neurons
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.200]   in the ventral tegmental area
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.440]   that then cause the release
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:58.440]   of this powerful neuromodulated, neuromodulator dopamine
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.820]   in the nucleus accumbens,
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.760]   which is part of another brain structure
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:09.760]   with a tough-to-remember name called the ventral striatum,
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.480]   and then magic happens, and when I say magic happens,
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.400]   even though we've been studying
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:20.400]   how dopamine modifies the properties of cells
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.680]   in this nucleus accumbens,
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:28.200]   the truth is we don't have a deep mechanistic understanding
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.000]   why, when dopamine is released in the nucleus accumbens,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.440]   we experience that as, I'm being very cautious here.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.160]   The simple way would be to say as highly rewarding,
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.520]   but it's a little more complicated than that.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.360]   What it tells us is that there's something
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.840]   really important happening in our environment.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.600]   - So could we say that it cues the arousal system?
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.640]   - It gets the arousal system going.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.560]   There's close ties to our memory systems,
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.880]   which hopefully intuitively makes some sense.
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.760]   If something really important
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.580]   is happening in your environment.
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.440]   Because again, I think what's helpful for your audience
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.760]   is to always be thinking about how these systems evolved
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.040]   from an evolutionary perspective.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.520]   And if dopamine is signaling something really important
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.400]   and salient is happening in your environment,
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.200]   you wanna remember that.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.720]   It could be a highly rewarding experience,
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.600]   like a source of food.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.720]   For me, I like all donuts.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.600]   So I don't wanna emphasize any one manufacturer
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.480]   of one donut versus the other.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.880]   I like sugar-laden, fat-laden foods.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.640]   That's why I never eat them because I like them so much
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.320]   and I use that as an example.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.880]   But because that was an important event for my survival,
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.420]   this reward circuitry,
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.360]   yes, it stimulates my arousal system.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.800]   It gets me to pay attention.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.720]   It also has very close ties to memory systems.
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.660]   And to go off on a little bit of a tangent,
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.120]   I think the one...
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:10.440]   I don't wanna say it's a mistake.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.640]   I think perhaps somewhat oversimplification
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:19.520]   of how people conceptualize dopamine's role in the brain
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.920]   is even though it's a major important role,
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.780]   is for it to be active and released
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.700]   during highly reinforcing experiences,
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.840]   like sex, like really good food, like drugs of abuse.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.780]   It also can get activated subdivisions of this system
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:41.260]   during painful stimuli and during aversive stimuli,
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.480]   which again are really important for you to be aware of,
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.960]   to say, "Oh my God, that's really bad for me."
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.140]   And so the dopamine system, this reward circuitry
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:57.400]   and its subcomponents that maybe perhaps signal
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.740]   more salience or aversion in the environment
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:05.380]   are closely tied to arousal systems and memory systems.
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.440]   Again, hopefully for somewhat obvious reasons.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:14.200]   You wanna remember powerfully reinforcing events
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.600]   in your life as well as powerfully emotionally
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.480]   or physically painful events in your life.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:26.480]   So I hope I answered your question to a modest degree.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.380]   - Far better than a modest degree.
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.880]   That's an excellent description of the dopamine system
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.540]   from a true expert.
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:38.000]   And the question I have is about some of the context
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.680]   and nuance of the system.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.960]   But in sort of real world terms,
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.460]   how should I think about this?
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.080]   Even in my training as a neuroscientist,
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.920]   I know neurons can be a little active, a lot active,
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:49.840]   everything in between.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.440]   They can be active over long periods of time
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.720]   or short periods of time.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.280]   But let's use the example of the donut.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.840]   I like a glazed old fashioned donut.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.880]   I actually don't have a craving for sweet things,
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.320]   but donuts is an exception.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.420]   I like the glazed old fashioned donut.
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.980]   But if I were to see just a little piece
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.520]   of a glazed old fashioned donut
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.560]   versus a full glazed old fashioned donut,
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.480]   could I expect that more dopamine is released
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.280]   to the anticipation of the complete donut?
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.840]   And then the other question is,
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.920]   how does context influence the dopamine system?
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.000]   For instance, if I'm very full,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.160]   a glazed old fashioned donut might be aversive to me.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.640]   Whereas if I'm just a little bit hungry
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:35.360]   or if I'm actually more on a schedule of rewarding myself
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.200]   for abstaining from sweet, fatty foods,
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.640]   then abstaining from the food
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.000]   might be its own form of reward.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.960]   And so to me, the dopamine system seems incredibly simple
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:50.000]   and yet incredibly prone to immediate context
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.240]   and the kinds of nuance that...
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.000]   I mean, we're constantly juggling...
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   I'll interrupt myself to say that we're constantly juggling
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.160]   a bunch of different reward contingencies.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.760]   We want to have good health metrics
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.080]   and maybe have a certain aesthetic qualities to our body,
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.320]   but we also want the donut.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.600]   And so how does a system as simple
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.520]   as a one neuromodulator system
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.000]   and the VTA to nucleus accumbens
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.520]   and with some connections to the memory area,
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.680]   how does it balance all of that information in real time?
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.360]   To me, that's just like staggeringly complex,
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.440]   but also incredibly interesting.
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:30.360]   - I think you beautifully put, very eloquent description.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.520]   You just said it, it's staggeringly simple,
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.280]   simultaneously staggeringly complex.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.520]   And you asked several different questions.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.800]   So context makes an enormous importance.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.680]   And that's one of the reasons I became interested
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:51.080]   in the dopamine reward circuitry is, as you know,
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.680]   as a colleague in the academic neuroscience world,
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.040]   but your listeners probably don't,
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.720]   I started out my career studying
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.560]   very basic mechanisms of plasticity.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.560]   How does the brain modify itself?
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.120]   And what makes the brain different
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:11.120]   than the computer hardware is the physical connections
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.680]   in the brain are constantly changing,
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.680]   the strength of the communication.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.240]   Similarly, for the dopamine reward circuitry,
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.200]   it's highly plastic and it's highly contextually dependent.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:29.160]   And so you gave the example of donuts and feeding,
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.360]   and I'll answer your question about the cues.
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.800]   Yes, I used to give the example of Thanksgiving.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.080]   So let me give that example.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.120]   In the morning of Thanksgiving,
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:44.160]   all for most of us in the United States,
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.440]   the morning of Thanksgiving,
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.480]   if you're at home visiting your parents,
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.480]   the smells of the apple pie,
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.880]   the smells of the turkey cooking
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.440]   are highly repetitive, highly reinforcing.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.920]   You're anticipating that fun event.
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.720]   You're anticipating Uncle Joe
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.720]   coming to visit you for Thanksgiving.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.480]   And that's all because these cues,
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.600]   the smells, the anticipation of Uncle Joe's,
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.080]   your previous experiences are part of your memory system,
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:19.960]   sort of talking to, in a simple way, your reward circuitry.
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.320]   So you're building up this anticipation.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.120]   One could almost say this craving,
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.160]   which maybe we'll talk about in the context of addiction,
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.680]   and then make a long story short,
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:34.280]   think about that evening at the end of Thanksgiving,
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.240]   those exact same cues,
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.320]   the exact same smell of the apple pie,
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.800]   turkey, and Uncle Joe himself.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.600]   At the very least, they're no longer repetitive,
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.280]   meaning they might actually be a versa.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.120]   The last thing you want is a piece of apple pie.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.600]   You can't wait for Uncle Joe
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.800]   to leave your Thanksgiving dinner.
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.000]   And I always argue that does not happen magically.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.120]   That happens because your brain has been modified
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.800]   by the context in which it sits.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.160]   And this very important modulatory system,
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.720]   this reward circuitry, is responding
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:14.600]   to the exact same stimuli with a very different response.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.360]   So I'm just telling you, I'm repeating what you said,
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.960]   the phenomenology, and again, my other favorite example
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.680]   is any of us who have been in an intimate relationship
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:27.360]   knows that the love of your life
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.680]   can turn to the bane of your existence in 20 seconds.
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.280]   And again, that doesn't happen magically.
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.400]   This person who you crave, who you love, does something,
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.600]   and two minutes later, your brain is saying,
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.920]   "Oh my God, I may have to break up with this person,"
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:49.120]   or, "This is an incredibly painful emotional experience."
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.320]   And what fascinates me about the brain
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.000]   is how does the brain mediate that rapid change?
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   So now back to, so yes, context is everything
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.560]   about how this powerful neuromodulatory system
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.680]   that uses dopamine works.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.000]   And the truth is we don't know.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.520]   It's because the inputs onto these dopamine neurons,
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.840]   the other nerve cells that are driving the activity
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.760]   of the dopamine neurons, and I've actually studied this
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.440]   in my lab at Stanford University with a colleague
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.560]   you know well, Li-Chen Luo,
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.640]   who's a world-class neuroscientist.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.840]   We've studied the complexity of the neuroanatomy
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.080]   of the dopamine system, and these dopamine neurons
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.120]   in the ventral tegmental area,
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.200]   the source of the reward circuitry dopamine,
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.480]   are receiving inputs from all over the brain.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.240]   They're receiving indirectly or directly inputs
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:50.280]   from visual areas, from somatosensory areas.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.320]   And I'm not giving you a really good answer
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.440]   because that's one of the goals of my research,
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.880]   to try to understand how context,
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:03.040]   how the history that you've had with these cues,
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.360]   which we're gonna get back to, of the donut or of a drug,
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.000]   how has that modified
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   how this neuromodulatory system responds?
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.280]   Similarly, the nucleus accumbens,
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:21.160]   the target of this powerful modulator dopamine,
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:26.160]   is receiving communications, what we call inputs,
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:31.160]   from all sorts of brain regions that you know about, Andrew,
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.640]   your audience may not.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.080]   It receives inputs from an area called the hippocampus,
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.040]   which you may have covered in previous podcasts,
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.360]   which is very powerfully, very important for memories,
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.520]   both establishing new memories.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.560]   And again, remember that makes sense.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:51.320]   You want this system, this dopamine reward circuitry
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.200]   to be very connected to memory systems.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:59.200]   So the activity in the nucleus accumbens
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.200]   is modulated by dopamine,
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.760]   while it is receiving information from the hippocampus,
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.680]   which helps encode new memories,
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.440]   while it's receiving information
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.680]   from a brain area called the amygdala,
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.000]   which is a part of the brain
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.960]   involved in our emotional experiences.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.720]   The accumbens also receives inputs
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.160]   from the prefrontal cortex,
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:29.160]   which is this brain area, as you know better than me, Andrew,
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:35.160]   is important for decision-making,
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.560]   for planning our activity, and I could go on and on.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.200]   - Well, could we talk about prefrontal cortex for a moment?
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:46.200]   Because it always was surprising to me
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:50.160]   that prefrontal cortex is talked about
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.200]   as this higher executive function area.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.120]   But then when you look at the neuroanatomy,
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:59.040]   it's, as we say, monosynaptically, as you and I know,
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:03.320]   one connection away from structures like the amygdala,
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.920]   one connection away from structures
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.600]   like the nucleus accumbens.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.400]   In other words, prefrontal cortex, to me,
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.640]   is every bit as ancient as some of these other structures
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.420]   that we think of as more ancient.
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.160]   And really the whole ancient evolved thing
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.200]   gets a little bit dicey because certain areas are,
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.680]   like the prefrontal cortex, are more elaborated in humans.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.420]   But to me, the prefrontal cortex seems to be
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.600]   especially important in the context of this thing
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.560]   of scaling the reward response
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.880]   or context of the reward response,
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.580]   because it can set rules.
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:39.940]   It seems to know, okay, we're recording a podcast now,
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:40.780]   and there are certain rules.
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.720]   There are certain things that we're going to do and not do.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.580]   But what's fascinating about the,
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.740]   and I'm so glad you gave a bunch of different examples,
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.640]   because what's fascinating, for instance,
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:54.280]   about the relationship example is that, yes, at one moment,
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.040]   we can adore somebody, and another moment later,
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.280]   if they do something or don't do something,
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.120]   we can be incredibly frustrated with them.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.760]   They can even become aversive to us.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.880]   Hopefully that doesn't happen too frequently.
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:10.760]   But I think we've all had the experience of a donut,
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:15.760]   an event, or a person actually looking different to us
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.120]   from one moment to the next, hopefully not at random, right?
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.560]   And so to me, it seems like the prefrontal cortex
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.220]   is uniquely positioned to really say, okay, right now,
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.040]   we are in a mode of, for lack of a better word,
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:34.520]   love and loving, like be in the verb tense of loving,
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.420]   be in the verb tense of arguing.
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:37.860]   We're now arguing.
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.400]   We're in the verb tense of reconciliation,
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.800]   kind of somewhere in between or something of that sort.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:48.680]   And how a structure and a circuit as simple
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.820]   as the dopamine system, right?
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.180]   One molecule could suddenly say, oh, you know what?
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.680]   Now getting over my anger is rewarding.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.920]   Whereas five minutes ago,
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.940]   being right and being the most angry was rewarding.
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.960]   And then five minutes before that,
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.560]   again, we're accelerating this movie,
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.720]   but five minutes or five days or five years before that,
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.760]   this person could do no wrong.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.760]   And the dopamine system is just cranking out dopamine,
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.440]   saying, whatever you do, I'm just delighted by it.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.580]   - Incredible.
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.860]   Like to me, I can't think of a more interesting system
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:17.700]   in neuroscience.
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:22.160]   - Well, I mean, that was eloquently put.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.520]   I agree with pretty much everything you said.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.880]   I don't have much to add because what you're pointing out is
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:33.780]   the challenges of studying these systems,
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.440]   the importance of studying these systems,
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:41.440]   and the challenge of presenting how the brain works
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.820]   to this podcast audience.
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:48.820]   Because on the one hand, you have done a fantastic job
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:51.800]   over the last few years in your podcast
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:56.800]   of making complex subjects accessible to a lay audience
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:05.020]   and get them to be thinking about how our modern view
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:09.680]   of how the brain works could be used to enhance health,
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.620]   could enhance mental wellbeing.
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:17.620]   But as neuroscientists, academic neuroscientists ourselves,
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:22.680]   we know, you know, you are oversimplifying things
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.880]   and the actual functioning of a system
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.100]   like the dopamine reward circuitry,
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.760]   as you just eloquently point out, is so much more complex.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:37.320]   It's modified by these prefrontal inputs,
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.160]   which are simultaneously telling our memory systems,
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.940]   you know, pay attention here.
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:46.180]   I'm repeating what you just said.
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.980]   The context makes a big difference,
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:52.980]   the history you have with the person or stimuli
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.600]   with whom you're interacting.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.540]   Like to bring this back to your, you know,
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.560]   which I never, the initial question,
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:03.300]   is a small piece of a donut activate the cue
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.760]   that that small piece of a donut activate
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.560]   the reward circuitry and cause release of dopamine
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.480]   to the same extent as the full donut?
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.480]   Depends on your experience with donuts.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.840]   I mean, I think for you and me,
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.960]   because we seem to both have, you know, like donuts,
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.980]   they're highly repetitive for us.
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:26.120]   Probably doesn't matter because we have learned
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.740]   even a little piece of a donut activates
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.260]   all of our memory systems saying,
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.380]   man, that's an old fashioned glazed donut.
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.680]   I want to eat that or I want to get one
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.880]   or I want to have the discipline not to eat it.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.180]   So I hope I'm answering your question
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:44.940]   and I'm shifting topics completely,
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:48.680]   but that's why addiction is so challenging.
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.260]   - Well, let's talk about that.
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.680]   Let's talk about that because you've done
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.720]   a ton of important work in this area of addiction.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.200]   I mean, one of the basic questions I have about addiction
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.940]   is, you know, we hear that certain drugs
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:02.360]   are more addicting than other drugs or certain behaviors.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.700]   We also hear that we can become addicted to anything.
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.200]   When Ana Lemki was on this podcast, I said,
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.920]   what's the most unusual addiction you've ever seen?
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:13.600]   And she talked about a patient who sadly committed suicide
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.300]   at some point later that she told us had been addicted
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.840]   to water, to drinking of any kind, first alcohol,
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.820]   but then water eventually.
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:26.520]   And so my question about addiction in the dopamine system
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:30.260]   is, you know, let's pick a drug like cocaine.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:36.080]   I've never done cocaine, but people who have done cocaine
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.220]   tell me that it feels very good.
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:42.580]   And one of the more salient features of the cocaine high
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.700]   is that it comes on very fast
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.580]   and it ends pretty quickly too.
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:51.400]   Is the rate of dopamine increase related
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:55.600]   to the addictive property of a drug or behavior
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:59.360]   as much as how much dopamine is released?
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.380]   - And that's a very sophisticated question.
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.180]   And the answer is yes.
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:07.260]   And that's usually the lecture I give.
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.540]   The way I think about addiction,
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.460]   and obviously my friend and colleague Ana Lemki
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:16.000]   is one of the world's experts in terms of the understanding,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.040]   the human experience of addiction.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:22.820]   I have studied it as a cellular molecular neuroscientist
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:27.820]   trying to understand how addictive substances
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.560]   modify reward circuitry, modify the connections
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:35.400]   in the reward circuitry, modify how dopamine neurons act.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.340]   And the way I, you know, like any,
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.720]   what appears to be a simple term,
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.760]   it's layered with complexity.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.340]   Addiction is somewhat of a continuum.
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.620]   And I like to think about whether you're talking
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:52.080]   about substances like cocaine,
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:55.460]   and I will explicitly answer your question soon,
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:59.740]   or opioids, as you know, we're going in this country,
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:03.040]   there is an opioid epidemic.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.800]   I do like to think about addictive liability.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.280]   And it is, in my view, it is pretty clear
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.620]   that when we're talking about drugs,
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:16.900]   they have different degrees of addictive liability.
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:19.300]   I mean, I had a cup of coffee this morning.
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:24.640]   And many of us listening to this podcast,
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.300]   it's really hard to start our day
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.620]   without getting that hit of caffeine.
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.200]   But are we addicted to caffeine?
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.640]   That's a tricky question,
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.260]   because I've never heard of anybody robbing a bank
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:40.260]   to get caffeine, destroying their personal life
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.740]   to get caffeine.
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:46.520]   So I would say caffeine causes tolerance,
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.600]   but I would not say it has a particularly
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.180]   high addictive liability.
[00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:55.520]   Whereas drugs like psychosimulants, like cocaine,
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.940]   have a very, or opioids,
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.760]   have a very high addictive liability.
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.620]   So to answer your mechanistic question,
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.620]   there have been some famous studies done
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:08.620]   by the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:09.840]   Nora Volkoff.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.360]   Simultaneously, there have been studies
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:17.520]   in animal models of addiction where you nailed it.
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:23.620]   In a rough way, the addictive liability of a substance
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:28.620]   is directly correlated with two aspects of dopamine,
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.180]   how much dopamine is released in the accumbens
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:34.140]   and the kinetics of the dopamine release, as you said,
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:36.520]   how rapidly it's released.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.060]   To get a little technical,
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:41.140]   even with a drug like cocaine or opioids,
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:43.900]   it's not only the drug itself,
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:46.180]   it's the root of administration,
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:50.640]   because the root of administration influences the kinetics,
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:54.280]   meaning how fast that drugs gets into your brain,
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.160]   influences the reward circuitry
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:01.840]   and how fast it causes a big rapid release of dopamine.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:06.200]   And some of your podcast listeners may be old enough
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:11.200]   to remember the crack cocaine epidemic or freebase cocaine.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.580]   And cocaine does have, like methamphetamine,
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:17.780]   a very high addictive liability.
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:22.660]   I give lectures to students at Stanford
[00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.300]   about neurobiology of addiction
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:28.860]   as part of a team-taught course.
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.800]   I have kids who I had to deal with.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.900]   And what I always say is,
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.820]   it's not that if you use this drug,
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:39.660]   you're automatically gonna become an addict,
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:43.320]   but you're taking that risk.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:46.300]   And it is impossible to become addicted to a substance
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:48.220]   if you've never used it, by definition.
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:49.940]   But back to the root of administration.
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.780]   So I went off on a tangent there.
[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.540]   - Well, that's actually an interesting statement.
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:55.740]   Because I think we may have heard that in high school,
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.980]   although I, to be honest,
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:59.620]   wasn't the most attentive high school student,
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:01.660]   and I regret that high school students pay attention.
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:02.500]   - You did okay for yourself.
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:03.860]   - Eventually I came around,
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.360]   but it was an uphill battle there.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.100]   But that you can't become addicted
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.100]   to something that you've never done,
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.620]   which I just wanna earmark that,
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:14.640]   because I think it's a profound statement,
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:18.820]   because it points to the importance of the memory system,
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:20.300]   but also plasticity.
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.640]   And so I wanna make sure that eventually we get around
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:26.160]   to talking about how the amount of dopamine released
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.860]   and the kinetics, how that might influence plasticity.
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.200]   Basically what I'm asking here,
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.420]   queuing up in the back of your mind,
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:37.340]   is whether or not addiction is just related
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:41.380]   to the sensation that we have when we indulge in a behavior,
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:44.340]   or when we are under the influence of a drug,
[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:48.060]   or whether or not it actually modifies neural circuitry
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:53.060]   in a way that makes a broader range of drugs
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:56.200]   or experiences attractive to us.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.860]   - It's probably the latter.
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:59.460]   But so let me get back,
[00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.960]   and I will answer that in a second,
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.140]   to the point I was making.
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:03.960]   So it's not only the substance,
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.620]   it's the root of administration.
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:12.640]   As I said, you can't develop a problem with a substance
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.500]   and develop a substance abuse problem if you never take it.
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:21.500]   But snorting cocaine is a different experience
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.300]   than smoking it or injecting it.
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:27.820]   And one of the reasons the crack cocaine epidemic
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:34.660]   was so powerful is it gets into,
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:36.500]   when you're smoking it or injecting it,
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:40.260]   and people do this now with methamphetamine,
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:42.360]   I mean, meth addicts, most of them,
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.580]   and that is another epidemic in our country,
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:47.140]   most of them smoke it.
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:50.380]   And the danger of that is the drug,
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:51.900]   whether it's cocaine, methamphetamine,
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.880]   gets into your brain almost instantaneously,
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:00.880]   causes a very rapid, powerful surge of dopamine
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.440]   in the accumbens, in this reward circuitry,
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.500]   and that the feeling you get,
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:07.940]   which, and we're gonna get into this,
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:11.380]   is not necessarily a happy feeling.
[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:16.380]   And it only lasts, it can last for tens of seconds
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.180]   or a few minutes.
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:22.740]   And it's a feeling that gives you
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:27.660]   this overwhelming compulsion and urge,
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:29.460]   I wanna do it again.
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:34.460]   So even though it may not actually feel all that good,
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:38.260]   and again, this gets into,
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:41.360]   we didn't have an addiction problem
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.600]   for any substance other than alcohol
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:49.800]   for most of humanity's existence,
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.620]   because these substances like cocaine,
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:56.080]   methamphetamine, synthetic opioids like fentanyl,
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.700]   they didn't exist.
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:02.700]   And the truth is our brains are not designed
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:07.980]   to handle those kinds of very powerful substances.
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:08.900]   - As many of you know,
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:11.580]   I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012,
[00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:14.020]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.340]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.160]   that's designed to meet
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.400]   all of your foundational nutrition needs.
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.020]   Now, of course, I try to get enough servings
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.320]   of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.580]   that include vegetables and fruits every day,
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.240]   but oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.220]   But with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.980]   and the probiotics that I need,
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:36.140]   and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress.
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.940]   Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1.
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:41.480]   I have more focus and energy and I sleep better,
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.700]   and it also happens to taste great.
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:45.580]   For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked,
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:48.280]   if you could take just one supplement, what would it be?
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.920]   I answer AG1.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.640]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.480]   go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.100]   to claim a special offer.
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.860]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.520]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:04.760]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:05.820]   - So where do you want to go from here?
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.740]   You asked a question about, you know,
[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:12.660]   the neural mechanisms of what we call addiction.
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:13.900]   - Yeah, I'd like to know about the role
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.740]   of neuroplasticity in addiction.
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.220]   I do want to highlight something you said,
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:20.300]   and I apologize for interrupting a moment ago.
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.420]   - No, absolutely not. - But it was an interruption
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:27.420]   based on real excitement because a person I know quite well
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:32.120]   who is a recovered cocaine addict told me,
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.340]   and by the way, folks, this isn't I have a friend
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:37.680]   and I'm actually, you know, I truly have never tried cocaine.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:41.280]   And this person said that the first time they did cocaine,
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:47.140]   his thought was I hate this and I can't wait to do it again.
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:49.540]   And that's exactly how you described it.
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:54.540]   And I think that is a fairly common experience
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:59.580]   with people suffering from an addiction disorder.
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.140]   We're not supposed to use the word addicts anymore
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.440]   because that's a little bit judgmental.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.460]   - That's the new nomenclature.
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:07.660]   - Something along those lines.
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.820]   - Got it, calling someone an addict
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:10.980]   as opposed to being addicted.
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:15.980]   - Yeah, being, and that is a beautiful description.
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.300]   I hate it, but I want to do it again.
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:23.460]   And again, it just shows the power of this system,
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:27.040]   which remember, evolved for our survival.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.860]   So a very simple way of thinking about it
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:32.740]   is these drugs are tricking the reward circuitry
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:36.780]   to say this stimulus, this experience
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:38.860]   is really important for my survival.
[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:41.180]   I have to go do it again and again.
[00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:44.180]   And again, a side question is the huge question
[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:48.900]   is why does some people develop an addiction problem
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:53.380]   and others who have used this substance just don't?
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:57.300]   And again, as a world-class neuroscientist yourself,
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.260]   you know the answer.
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:03.220]   It's always a complex combination of underlying genetics,
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:06.040]   the environment in which they find themselves,
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.340]   the environment in which they grew up
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:12.500]   and how that modified their reward circuitry.
[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.380]   So to get at your question,
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.820]   one set of experiments my lab did,
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.780]   which other labs did too,
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:24.140]   I don't deserve the sole credit for this,
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:29.140]   is showing that drugs of abuse cause powerful plasticity
[00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:33.140]   in the neurons that make up the cells
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.180]   that make up the reward circuitry.
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:39.580]   And in fact, drugs of abuse like cocaine, methamphetamine,
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:42.640]   opioids like morphine, heroin,
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.740]   change the synapses.
[00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:51.560]   The synapses are the connections from other nerve cells
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.300]   onto dopamine neurons,
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.740]   onto the nerve cells in the accumbens
[00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:59.100]   and these connections, these synapses can change
[00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:03.200]   and drugs of abuse cause powerful changes
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.900]   in those connections and therefore powerful changes
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.940]   in the activity of the dopamine neurons
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:13.780]   and the neurons in the ventral, in the nucleus accumbens.
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:16.980]   And in fact, the types of changes that occur
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:21.000]   appear to be similar to the types of changes
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.540]   that have evolved for good uses,
[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:27.580]   for adaptive forms of learning and memory.
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:30.460]   So again, this is an example
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:35.460]   that this superficially simple dopamine reward circuitry
[00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:40.500]   is changing all the time.
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:45.060]   It is highly plastic and can become more sensitive
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:48.620]   to certain experiences, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:49.660]   - Well, could I ask you a question
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:52.220]   about some of the general contours of the plasticity
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:53.860]   in the dopamine system?
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:56.820]   You said before, and I love this statement,
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:58.380]   even though it's very simple,
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.340]   but in its simplicity, it's really elegant
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.560]   that we can't become addicted to a substance
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:07.220]   or a behavior that we haven't taken or partaken in.
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:12.020]   So is there data to support the idea
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:15.820]   that just one exposure to cocaine
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:19.300]   or one exposure to some sort of behavior
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:23.580]   can lead to a lasting change in the dopamine system
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:28.580]   such that one's propensity to be addicted to that substance,
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:31.620]   again, if one were to indulge in the future
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:34.820]   or behavior again in the future is increased.
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:36.880]   And I have a very particular reason for asking this,
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:38.600]   but I'm very curious what the answer is.
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:43.600]   - I mean, in the work my lab and other labs have done
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:48.760]   in preclinical rodent models, the answer is yes,
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:54.300]   a single administration of a drug of abuse like cocaine,
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:45:00.220]   like morphine, can cause relatively several days,
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:05.060]   several weeks of changes in the connections
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:09.500]   onto dopamine neurons and onto the neurons
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:11.080]   in the nucleus accumbens.
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:14.480]   Those changes, that does not mean these changes
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:19.120]   are permanent or irreversible,
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:21.460]   but the changes last a long time.
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:25.820]   And again, the big question for understanding
[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:28.260]   the neurobiology of addiction is,
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.760]   those changes are probably happening
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.720]   in most people who take the drug in this case,
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:36.720]   and we can talk about other stimuli,
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:40.640]   non-drug stimuli that can become, in quotes, addictive.
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.600]   Again, why in certain individuals?
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:46.300]   To be honest, it's not a big deal.
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.560]   Yeah, I did cocaine at this party.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.200]   It was nice, but I don't feel any craving
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:55.080]   or urge to do it again, whereas other individuals,
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:59.440]   it sets them down a very bad path
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:02.000]   and really badly affects their life.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.560]   And that's a huge question in the research field,
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:08.280]   because obviously if we could make predictions
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:12.880]   on which individuals are more susceptible,
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:16.000]   and not to get too political here,
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:22.040]   but whether you develop a problem with addiction or not
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:28.220]   is influenced by the other parts of your life.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:32.640]   - Do you have other ways of getting reinforcing stimuli,
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:35.760]   getting satisfaction, having an outlet,
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.240]   that other ways of activating your reward
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.840]   or dopamine circuitry?
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.720]   - Healthy ways. - Healthy ways.
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:46.040]   Like as you have articulated, I think, in your podcast,
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.960]   getting exercise.
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:50.420]   You and I both like to get exercise.
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:52.300]   I feel really good.
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:54.300]   Sometimes it's painful during the exercise,
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.300]   but afterwards I feel great.
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.000]   - Almost the inverse of the cocaine response.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.360]   The desire and then the I hate this,
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.420]   but I can't wait to do it again.
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:07.160]   It seems like exercise is often the opposite.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:08.700]   It's I hate this, I don't want to do this.
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:11.440]   And then afterwards, gosh, I always feel better
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.880]   and I'd be happy to do it again.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.500]   - I mean, yes.
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:17.240]   I mean, I like to exercise chasing a ball
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:20.800]   because that gets me off thinking about this hurts.
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.960]   So anyhow, back to addiction.
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:28.440]   So yes, these drugs can cause,
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:30.960]   I don't want to, definitely not permanent changes
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.680]   from a single exposure.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:36.360]   And the types of studies I'm talking about
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:41.280]   were all done in experimental animals.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:46.280]   So how that relates to what happens in our brains,
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:50.380]   in human subjects' brains is not completely clear,
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:52.040]   but I think there are parallels.
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:57.000]   So the changes might last a few days, a week or two,
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.080]   but one can see if somebody,
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:04.000]   there have been studies done where in an animal model,
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   if you give repeated administration of a drug like cocaine,
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.960]   the changes get stronger and they last longer,
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.240]   which is kind of intuitively obvious.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:21.200]   But again, the big question is why in human subjects,
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:25.080]   there are people who can use these substances
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:27.300]   and not develop a serious problem
[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:30.620]   and there are others where they're very, very damaging.
[00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:34.840]   And then that's why I still make the point,
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:39.080]   if you're a young person, do you want to take that risk?
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:42.180]   Is it worth it to have that experience?
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:44.920]   And that's an individual decision.
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:46.600]   - We've done some podcast episodes
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.200]   about alcohol, cannabis, et cetera,
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.640]   and there does seem to be a pretty wide variation
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:52.640]   in people's response to the information.
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:55.040]   I think because there are people out there who,
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:58.200]   well, I've got friends who are recovered alcoholics,
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.800]   who will tell me the first drink they took,
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:03.400]   they use language like,
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:08.600]   it combined with the chemistry of my body
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:12.000]   in a way that nothing before ever had
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.960]   and they felt like it was like this magic elixir, right?
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:18.360]   That has not been my experience with alcohol.
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.360]   - And I've heard the same stories
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:22.600]   and it's hard for me to relate because like you,
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:26.200]   alcohol does not have that effect on me.
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.520]   And that's where, it's hard to believe
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:33.800]   that kind of immediate response to alcohol
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:38.160]   is due to the environment in which they grew up,
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:39.740]   although that can have an influence.
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:43.400]   That just feels almost more genetically encoded.
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:48.400]   And there is evidence that issues with the use of alcohol
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.560]   in developing alcohol use disorder does run in families.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.160]   And obviously if it runs in family,
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:56.960]   you have to worry about how the environment
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.360]   of that family influences.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.760]   There's a lot of studies saying there is a genetic component.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:05.500]   Maybe like you, if I have a drink or two in the afternoon,
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:06.840]   I just fall asleep.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:09.360]   And it does not have that effect on me.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:14.240]   And anyone could imagine similar things
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.600]   for other drugs of abuse.
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:19.040]   There are people who have used cocaine,
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:20.840]   have used methamphetamine,
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:23.640]   who find it modestly enjoyable,
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:28.080]   but it's not the be all or end all.
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:31.000]   It isn't this incredibly powerful experience.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.440]   And you just talked about, I think, a friend or a colleague
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.280]   who said, "I hate it, I hate that,
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.880]   "but I wanna do it again."
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:39.320]   And that's fascinating.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:42.360]   - Yeah, they're now a recovered alcoholic and cocaine addict
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:44.020]   and they've abstained for many years,
[00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:46.580]   but still get a little bit of a gleam in their eye
[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:49.140]   when they talk about alcohol or cocaine
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:51.580]   in a way that I just can't relate to.
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:53.780]   - I can relate, I mean, can I tell you a little vignette
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:55.480]   about me, which I love to tell?
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:56.580]   - Sure, sure.
[00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:59.900]   - And it gets into how the reward circuitry
[00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:04.900]   is so closely associated with memory systems
[00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:10.260]   and how cues associated with powerful experiences
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:15.780]   develop their own reinforcing or aversive quality.
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:18.820]   So long story short, when I was a young kid,
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:21.960]   in, I can't remember, in my 20s, maybe 20,
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:24.300]   I spent a few weeks in Paris.
[00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:25.840]   I started smoking cigarettes.
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:28.580]   I mean, this is a long time ago.
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:31.220]   And I got, cigarettes are very interesting.
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:34.180]   Nicotine is highly addictive,
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:37.380]   as the tobacco companies were fully aware of.
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:38.780]   - High addictive liability?
[00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:40.220]   - Very high addictive liability.
[00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:43.020]   - People will rob people for the money to buy cigarettes?
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:48.440]   - They may not rob because,
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:52.580]   although my understanding is they've become quite expensive,
[00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:57.580]   but counterfeit cigarettes are a huge market
[00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:59.880]   for organized crime.
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:04.200]   There are parts of our, in the world,
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:07.720]   third world countries where organized crime
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:10.360]   produce counterfeit cigarettes
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:14.020]   and are making hundreds of millions or billions of dollars.
[00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:20.180]   And so I think nicotine as it is delivered in cigarettes,
[00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:24.460]   as you know, I mean, tobacco companies put in a lot of work
[00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:28.060]   to figure out the exact dose of nicotine
[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:31.980]   that will make you get that kind of feeling
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:34.680]   that only lasts for a few minutes.
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:37.500]   So you wanna do it again and again.
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:41.140]   So we can talk about, and nicotine, you know,
[00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:46.140]   what becomes a problem in a specific society with addiction
[00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:52.320]   is not only based on the neurobiological actions,
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:53.960]   if we're talking still about drugs
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.000]   or substances of that substance,
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.260]   it's heavily influenced by the availability
[00:52:58.260 --> 00:52:59.440]   of the substance too.
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:02.580]   But my little story is I smoked some cigarettes in Paris.
[00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:06.800]   I learned why people like to smoke.
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:09.980]   It was very satisfying to have a cigarette
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:11.460]   in a Parisian cafe.
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.480]   It just, you know, and it's very interesting
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:16.160]   because the first few times you inhale tobacco,
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.340]   you get dizzy, it's kind of aversive,
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.940]   and it's exactly what you articulated.
[00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:23.360]   Despite that, you wanna do it again.
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:26.260]   So it was just a lot of fun for me.
[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:27.300]   I enjoyed it.
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:30.300]   And I was disciplined, you know, at some point,
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:32.240]   whenever this was, I came back to the United States.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:36.020]   I didn't smoke because I knew it was bad for you.
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:39.760]   But to this day, 40 years later,
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:43.640]   every time I go back to Paris, I get cravings.
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:47.580]   I actually just wanna get a pack of cigarettes.
[00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:52.060]   I want to have that feeling again of inhaling the smoke.
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:55.940]   But the point is of how powerful
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:58.020]   these rewarding experiences can be
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:00.180]   or reinforcing experiences.
[00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:03.660]   And for your audience, technically, you know,
[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:08.260]   what I have been taught by some of my psychology colleagues
[00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:10.380]   is we use the term reinforcing
[00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:14.860]   in a very behaviorally defined way.
[00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:19.660]   Something is reinforcing is if the behavior
[00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:22.240]   that led to that stimuli,
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.780]   it makes you wanna do that behavior again.
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:29.340]   Rewarding means it actually felt, in quotes, good.
[00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:31.340]   - No, it's an important distinction.
[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:33.100]   - They actually can be different.
[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:37.300]   Again, as you defined by your friend who,
[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:38.780]   I forget, I think it was cocaine.
[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:41.420]   Cocaine was highly reinforcing,
[00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:45.100]   but it was not necessarily enjoyable or rewarding.
[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:46.620]   And isn't that fascinating?
[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:50.660]   I have some colleagues in the addiction field.
[00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:53.660]   One of them is retired now,
[00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:56.080]   Kent Barrage and Terry Robinson.
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:55:01.080]   They distinguish between the terms wanting and liking.
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.620]   Wanting and liking.
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:05.400]   And think about that.
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:10.400]   Liking something means it's something you like, you enjoy.
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:15.420]   Wanting means you want it,
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:19.480]   but you don't necessarily like it or enjoy it.
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:21.360]   And that's a description
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:24.080]   of your friend's experience with cocaine.
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:27.800]   Some of us have been in destructive relationships
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:30.040]   where you want that individual,
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:32.880]   but you're not sure you necessarily like that individual.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.360]   - Sometimes people will be in relationships
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:37.400]   where they actively dislike the other person,
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.840]   which is a bit foreign of a concept to me,
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:42.040]   but it's interesting this separation
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:44.220]   of reinforcing and rewarding, wanting and liking,
[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:47.340]   because one of the things that's very prominent
[00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:51.000]   in 12-step programs is to create rewards
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.160]   around abstaining from the drug or behavior.
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:56.360]   And I should mention that programs like 12-step,
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:58.680]   when followed, seem to have very high success rates.
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:00.720]   At least that's what Anna Lemke tells me.
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:05.840]   That in some ways they are modifying
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:07.560]   the wanting and liking.
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:11.000]   They're splitting the wanting and liking of alcohol,
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.480]   for instance, creating a liking of sobriety
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:17.040]   more than the wanting of alcohol, for instance.
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.260]   - That's beautifully put.
[00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:20.560]   And I think that's right.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:24.680]   How that plays out in the neural mechanisms,
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:27.320]   that as a neuroscientist, I'm interested in it.
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:28.920]   Man, that's a tough one.
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:35.220]   But I think that's why those programs
[00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:37.480]   are pretty successful.
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:41.640]   It's helping the person make those dissociations.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:45.580]   And I don't know that much about those programs,
[00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:49.200]   because I have not seen patients myself
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:52.520]   for whatever, it's been 27, 28 years,
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:56.960]   but I think part of them are to help that individual
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:57:01.960]   find both other sources of liking and reward,
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:08.360]   getting some satisfaction and reward
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:10.800]   from the actual abstinence,
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:14.220]   being able to cognitively teach themselves
[00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:17.480]   that I deserve a pat on the back, I deserve credit,
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:22.480]   I feel good that I did not take a drink at that party,
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:26.160]   that I did not use that substance again.
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:30.160]   And how that plays out in our brains is a really tough one.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:32.200]   - Yeah, those are, the way you described it
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:35.200]   is exactly right, those programs are highly reinforcing
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:37.080]   for abstinence behaviors,
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:38.600]   everything from the social connection,
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:42.060]   which we're gonna get to social connection, as you know,
[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:44.980]   to the way that people start to conceptualize
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:46.900]   their addict self versus other self.
[00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:48.880]   It actually involves a splitting of the self
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:50.200]   in interesting ways.
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:54.880]   As long as we're talking about donuts, cigarettes,
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:58.640]   alcohol, cocaine, I'm curious before we move
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:01.260]   to a bit more on neuroplasticity,
[00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:05.560]   is there anything that people ought to know
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:09.060]   about how different substances and behaviors
[00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:10.560]   that are addicting might impact
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:13.480]   the dopamine reward circuitry differently?
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:15.420]   So for instance, we talked about cocaine
[00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:16.900]   as having this very rapid onset,
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.720]   big increase in dopamine, then a crash, as we know,
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:23.860]   a certain pattern of kinetics, as you describe it,
[00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:28.860]   the opioid crisis is incredibly serious problem right now,
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:32.300]   as is methamphetamine, but it sounds like methamphetamine
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:35.860]   functions a bit like cocaine and in terms of its kinetics.
[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:40.860]   So an opioid is a very different chemical than cocaine,
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:45.580]   but it sounds like it impacts the dopamine system.
[00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:50.580]   Is the dopaminergic activity caused by opioids
[00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:53.860]   responsible for the addictive properties of opioids?
[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:57.540]   Or do people also like the feeling of being under opioids?
[00:58:57.540 --> 00:58:59.260]   I personally hate it coming out of surgery,
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:03.100]   like they gave me Vicodin once and I hated it.
[00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:06.440]   I'd rather have the pain, post-operative pain,
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:11.440]   than take something like Vicodin or a Valium or fentanyl
[00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:14.820]   or anything like that to me is just completely aversive.
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:16.920]   But I realized that there are many millions of people
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.460]   that feel quite differently.
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:19.540]   - It's a great question.
[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:23.720]   So I think all the studies, both in human beings
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:28.720]   and preclinical animal models, yes, would suggest
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:35.020]   that the addictive liability of opioids
[00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:39.160]   and psychostimulants, which are cocaine and methamphetamine,
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:43.820]   have the common final action of causing massive release
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:48.540]   of dopamine in this target of the dopamine neurons,
[00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:50.580]   the nucleus accumbens.
[00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:54.100]   They do it, if we wanna get a little scientifically
[00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:59.000]   technical here, via very different mechanisms.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.300]   So cocaine and methamphetamine,
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:05.380]   the drugs known as psychostimulants,
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:09.320]   actually bind to a protein in the brain
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:12.440]   or a molecule in the brain that is responsible
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:15.940]   for sucking up, it's a vacuum cleaner,
[01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:20.260]   sucking up the dopamine after it's been released.
[01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:24.500]   And cocaine prevents that dopamine from being vacuumed up
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:27.060]   so the cocaine hangs around longer.
[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:31.860]   Meth not only prevents the dopamine from being vacuumed up,
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:35.020]   it actually causes the reverse.
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:38.400]   It actually causes the direct release of dopamine
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.460]   from what we call nerve terminals,
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:44.060]   from the site where dopamine's released.
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:46.100]   Opioids work very differently.
[01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:49.140]   They actually primarily, not solely,
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:53.300]   work where the dopamine neurons live.
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:57.020]   And it's a little complicated if it's not that critical,
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:02.020]   but they indirectly increase the activity
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:05.000]   within the dopamine neurons themselves,
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.260]   causing a big massive,
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:09.840]   bigger than normal release of dopamine.
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:12.240]   So that's one commonality.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:16.120]   But anybody who has used these drugs or read about
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:19.720]   these drugs, the subjective experience of the drugs
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.520]   are dramatically different.
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:24.360]   And that's because of the actions they're having,
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:27.960]   not only in the reward circuitry, but throughout the brain.
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:30.560]   So, and it's interesting you talked about Vicodin.
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.800]   I've taken Vicodin because I've had several knee surgeries
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.760]   and things, like you, I didn't like it.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.920]   I've gotten other opioids for pain relief
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:44.280]   that were great.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:46.720]   I mean, they took away a lot of pain
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:49.340]   after my ligament repair.
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:52.720]   And that's a different question,
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.360]   that even when you're talking about opioids,
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:58.720]   all drugs are not, they're not identical.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:03.720]   Fentanyl has a much larger addictive liability
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.520]   because of its molecular properties
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:10.720]   and how it's interacting with the opioid system
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.120]   in our brains and the receptors,
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:17.460]   the actual proteins in the brain that it interacts with.
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:20.580]   But the subjective experience of opioids,
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:22.100]   I mean, it's interesting.
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:24.200]   Some people love it.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:27.380]   That's, you know, if we go back in history, as you know,
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:30.680]   there were the opium dens throughout
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.880]   Asia.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:37.040]   There were wars about opioids,
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.480]   the famous opioid wars between China
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.300]   and the United Kingdom.
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:43.680]   I mean, showing you how powerful
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:48.080]   the availability of a substance like an opioid can be.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.040]   So I'm going off on a tangent, I apologize.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:54.660]   But commonality is dopamine release in the accumbens.
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:58.680]   But it's a, if you remember what a Venn diagram is,
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:01.220]   all these drugs have some common actions,
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:03.960]   usually on directly or indirectly
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:06.680]   causing the massive release of dopamine in the accumbens.
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:10.000]   But then they have their own individual actions
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.320]   because obviously when you take cocaine or methamphetamine,
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.560]   it's a stimulator, you know,
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.480]   people are grinding their teeth, they're hyped up.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:22.120]   For most people, opioids are the exact opposite.
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:26.480]   I mean, in opium dens from the movies I watched
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:29.560]   and watching Narcos and all those TV shows,
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:32.440]   you're often, you're lying down,
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:35.440]   you're kind of in almost a dreamlike state.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:38.560]   So very different subjective experiences.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.140]   - I'd like to just take a brief break
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:43.000]   and thank one of our sponsors, which is Element.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.440]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.660]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:50.280]   That means plenty of salt, sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:53.100]   the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:55.960]   Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.800]   to the function of all the cells in your body,
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:00.440]   in particular to the function of your nerve cells,
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:01.640]   also called neurons.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:04.260]   And we now know that even slight reductions
[01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:07.480]   in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:11.060]   can lead to deficits in cognitive and physical performance.
[01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:13.580]   Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:16.680]   of 1,000 milligrams, that's one gram, of sodium,
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:20.200]   200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium.
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:22.260]   I typically drink Element first thing in the morning
[01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:24.400]   when I wake up in order to hydrate my body
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.160]   and make sure I have enough electrolytes.
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.440]   And while I do any kind of physical training
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:29.940]   and after physical training as well,
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:31.740]   especially if I've been sweating a lot,
[01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:34.560]   and certainly I drink Element in my water
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:37.040]   when I'm in the sauna and after going in the sauna,
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.720]   because that causes quite a lot of sweating.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.800]   If you'd like to try Element,
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:44.280]   you can go to drink element, that's lmnt.com/huberman
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.600]   to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:50.800]   Again, that's drink element lmnt.com/huberman.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.640]   - Yeah, I had an experience with opioid recently,
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:57.080]   not voluntarily over the Christmas holiday.
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:00.580]   We went to visit friends and before going to sleep,
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:02.080]   I wanted some tea.
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.720]   And I asked if they had any non-caffeinated tea.
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.680]   So they gave me this tea.
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:10.720]   And that night I had the most bizarre dreams I've ever had.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.280]   And I slept for 14 hours.
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:16.200]   The next morning I was like, what was that tea?
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.240]   And I felt off in the morning.
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:21.420]   And I went, it was actually a blue lotus flower tea
[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:23.580]   that is actually illegal in the United States,
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:27.860]   but it is sold and it has morphine-like compounds in it.
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:31.200]   And I am one of those people that's very susceptible
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:34.340]   to even low doses of any kind of novel drug.
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:36.900]   - So interesting, have you ever taken cough syrup
[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:38.480]   with dextromethorphan?
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.400]   - No, I avoid that stuff.
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:44.560]   - Well, I have a tendency when I get a cold,
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.260]   it gets into my lungs, I cough a lot.
[01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:49.480]   And I think this has been reported.
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.280]   This is my anecdotal experience.
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:52.960]   I'm confirming what you said.
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:56.900]   Dextromethorphan is a different sort of opioid.
[01:05:56.900 --> 01:06:00.220]   And actually some people develop a problem with it.
[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:03.420]   For me, it gives me really bizarre dreams,
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:05.020]   really similar to what you were describing.
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:06.220]   - Yeah, it was a very unusual experience.
[01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:08.180]   - And that's a whole different conversation
[01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:09.800]   about what makes us dream
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.160]   and what are the meaning of dreams.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.920]   Fascinating, I hope you've covered,
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:14.760]   maybe you've covered that.
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.460]   - We have not yet, but we are intending
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:18.120]   to do a whole series on sleep and dreaming.
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.240]   - Yeah, I think that would be wonderful.
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:20.080]   - We will definitely get into it.
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:21.760]   - I started out in sleep research,
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:23.240]   so I have a fondness for it.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.720]   - Well, drug research and sleep research
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:27.680]   have a long history of overlap with Alan Hobson's work
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.380]   on LSD. - I worked with Alan Hobson.
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:31.260]   - Okay, by the way, folks, if you're interested
[01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:34.420]   in the relationship between hallucinations and dreaming,
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:37.940]   Alan Hobson is a good name to start your rabbit hole.
[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:41.700]   - In 19, oh my God, I'm dating myself.
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:46.700]   19, oh, 70, I can't remember if it was 76 or 77,
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:50.140]   I worked with Alan Hobson as an undergraduate.
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:51.040]   - At Harvard Medical School.
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.860]   - No, as an undergraduate at Harvard.
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:54.920]   - He was at Harvard Medical School, yeah.
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:57.360]   - Amazing, I love his writing and I learned a lot from it.
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:58.960]   He was really ahead of his time.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:06:59.800]   - Yes, he was.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:03.840]   Anybody who knows me won't believe this,
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:08.080]   but back then, I was a very shy, insecure,
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:09.960]   20-year-old kid. - I would not have guessed.
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:12.960]   - Oh, and even in medical school,
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:16.680]   I literally was not confident of my opinions at all.
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:21.040]   I was very shy, thought all of the ideas I had
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.780]   must be obvious and I should never say them out loud.
[01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:25.960]   - Do you mind if I ask, since you raised this,
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.340]   I think it's really important.
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:31.740]   I mean, you have this incredible career track record.
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:35.580]   You're adored by your colleagues, you're highly respected.
[01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:37.820]   You've won just about every award there is
[01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:38.900]   to win in neuroscience.
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:40.440]   So was there something in particular
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:43.420]   that was in an overnight thing where one day you woke up
[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:46.540]   and thought, I actually believe in myself.
[01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:48.040]   But if you wouldn't mind sharing that,
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.800]   'cause I think before we get back into some of the science,
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.240]   I, you know, science is a human endeavor
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:55.780]   and most people listening are probably not scientists,
[01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:59.640]   but I think everybody deals with these issues of self-doubt
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:02.780]   and people appear to have varying levels of confidence,
[01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:05.700]   but what happened?
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:07.140]   - So thank you for asking.
[01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:11.920]   No, for me, it was a very gradual process
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:15.900]   and I'm not, as an undergraduate, as a medical student,
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:20.640]   even as a postdoc, yeah, I was very unsure
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:24.700]   of my ideas, of my intellectual abilities,
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:29.700]   of whether what I was thinking was really worthwhile.
[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:32.980]   So it was a very gradual process.
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:36.520]   I think the increase in my confidence, I think,
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:41.260]   began when I was a postdoc, which is a training period
[01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:44.700]   after you've received a PhD or an MD
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:47.480]   where you get additional research training.
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:50.140]   And I worked with a guy named Roger Nicollet, UCSF,
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:54.040]   and Roger was a very intellectually intense,
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:57.480]   very forceful individual.
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:01.480]   And I got involved in a field where,
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:04.400]   I mean, people, a little bit of a tangent.
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:08.420]   Your listeners may think that scientists
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:13.260]   are these geeky individuals wearing white coats
[01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:15.880]   with no passion or emotion
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:18.840]   and nothing could be further from the truth.
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:21.960]   The most successful scientists that I know
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:25.360]   are pretty passionate and pretty intense
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:29.080]   about what they're working on and driven.
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:32.100]   I mean, and this is a gross generalization.
[01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:35.760]   So anyhow, during my postdoc, I started getting involved
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:40.220]   in a topic where there were vigorous arguments
[01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:43.940]   about phenomenology we were studying.
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:48.360]   So I had to develop a tougher and thicker skin.
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:51.160]   I had to be able to argue my side
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:55.080]   of the hypotheses we were generating.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.320]   So it started developing as a postdoc
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:01.240]   and then it slowly evolved as an assistant professor.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:03.860]   And for your listeners who don't know,
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:08.800]   I don't like to admit this, but I'm in my late 60s.
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:12.900]   I have been running my own lab for almost 40 years.
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:17.400]   So I have been, so gradually as an assistant professor,
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:20.040]   I realized, hey, I can do this.
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.280]   I can do science.
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.280]   I can write papers that my colleagues
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:25.360]   seem to be interested in.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:29.580]   And then gradually, over then the next 10, 20, 30 years,
[01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:33.720]   I gained more and more confidence.
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:38.720]   So for me, it was this very gradual buildup
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:44.160]   of many different experiences
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:49.160]   where I developed some confidence that not all of my ideas
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.800]   are great, of course they're not,
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:55.760]   but it's okay to voice my opinion.
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:59.640]   It's okay to state my ideas and why I believe this
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:01.600]   and why I don't believe that.
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.600]   So that was my experience.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:06.400]   - Thank you for sharing that because I think
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:08.940]   people struggle with that very issue.
[01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:12.000]   And clearly showing up again and again
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.580]   over a long period of time is helpful.
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:16.400]   But as you said, learning to trust one's ideas,
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:21.120]   just a brief anecdote when I was coming up in neuroscience,
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.000]   a few years behind you.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.880]   - 20 years behind me.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:29.880]   - Not too many, I mean, but I recall the incredible number
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:34.400]   of high profile papers on neuroplasticity
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.120]   and long-term potentiation, long-term depression.
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:39.060]   These are terms related to the modification of synapses
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:44.180]   that Rob Malenka and Roger Nicole pioneered
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:45.580]   a big segment to that work.
[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:47.420]   And I remember seeing your names on papers
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:50.020]   and I thought Roger worked for you.
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:50.840]   Sorry, Roger.
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:53.500]   - I'd love to hear that, I'd love to hear that.
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:55.700]   - I was under the impression he worked for you
[01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:58.620]   and only later did I learn that you were his postdoc.
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:01.020]   - And then we collaborated as equals.
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:02.340]   - You became peers very quickly.
[01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:03.180]   - Very quickly.
[01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:04.220]   - Yeah, so you've had a-
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:05.620]   - And Roger, you know, I-
[01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:06.460]   - Roger's wonderful.
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:09.980]   - I did have the confidence even as a postdoc
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:11.640]   and he actually, even as a grad student,
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:14.780]   even though I was a little insecure about my ideas,
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:16.800]   I wanted to be treated as an equal.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.180]   That's the one thing I did have.
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:21.560]   I never felt that I was working for somebody else.
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:24.460]   I always felt that I was working for myself
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:26.640]   and that we were colleagues,
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:29.880]   even though my mentors had more experience
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:31.600]   and I could learn from them, but-
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.260]   - I like that you're working for yourself
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:34.860]   even though you have mentors.
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:38.240]   I think there's some real gems in what you just described.
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:40.360]   So thank you for taking the time to do that.
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.260]   - Sure.
[01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:45.520]   - I'd like to discuss one aspect of reward circuitry
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:48.680]   that I don't think most people think about, right?
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:50.520]   Fairly straightforward nowadays.
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.800]   I like to think more people know what dopamine is
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:56.000]   and understand it thanks to your work and Ana's work
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.240]   and some discussions have taken place on our podcasts,
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:01.600]   other podcasts, but, you know, all too often we think
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:04.440]   dopamine, reward, wanting, liking, drugs.
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:07.020]   Okay, all of that is great.
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:10.080]   But what about the truly adaptive stuff, right?
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:13.980]   Because it's easy to fall into a discussion around dopamine
[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:16.060]   of, you know, the things that are bad for us.
[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:19.400]   But what I'm thinking about here is social interaction.
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:24.600]   Clearly we are a social species and a lot of your work
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:27.960]   in the last decade and a half or so
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:30.680]   has focused on the relationship
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:32.160]   between the reward circuitry,
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:34.240]   which you beautifully described for us,
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:37.880]   and social interaction and connection.
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:40.140]   And where I'm going with this is ultimately
[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:43.780]   this has huge implications for autism
[01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:45.940]   and autism spectrum disorders.
[01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:47.740]   I don't know if nowadays, is it okay?
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:49.360]   You're not supposed to call autism a disease.
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.200]   Is that right?
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:52.720]   You hear about neuro-typical and neuro-atypical,
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:55.660]   but I have friends who have children
[01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:57.540]   who are severely autistic.
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:00.580]   And I don't know many parents who would elect
[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:03.100]   to have a severely autistic kid.
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:07.360]   And so those people often will talk about it as autism
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.940]   or a child having autism.
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:11.640]   So first of all, before we get into the social piece,
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:13.300]   maybe because I just tabled it,
[01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:17.140]   how are we supposed to talk about autism nowadays?
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:23.020]   - I am very interested in the pathophysiology
[01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:26.160]   of what the medical profession
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:28.900]   terms autism spectrum disorder.
[01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:33.580]   As you pointed out, the individuals living
[01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:38.340]   with an autism spectrum disorder are quite heterogeneous.
[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:42.200]   And it can range from individuals
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:45.960]   with severe intellectual impairments
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:50.960]   and quite severe impairments in social interactions,
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:54.080]   impairments in sensory processing,
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:58.600]   impairments in lots of different aspects of our behaviors
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:14:59.860]   that are important.
[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:02.300]   And I think nobody would say,
[01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:05.240]   would argue those individuals on the severe spectrum
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:09.780]   do not have some sort of, in quotes, disorder.
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:13.480]   The issue we have to be sensitive to
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:18.480]   is it's a heterogeneous disorder like many brain issues
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:22.000]   that psychiatrists deal with, like depression.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.360]   We all like obsessive compulsive disorder,
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:26.800]   like various anxiety disorders.
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:30.340]   It's always on a continuum and a spectrum.
[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:34.060]   So for autism spectrum disorder,
[01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:37.260]   there are individuals who are high functioning,
[01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:42.260]   who one could argue have a different style
[01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:44.020]   of interacting socially,
[01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:47.820]   may have a different way of processing sensory information,
[01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:52.820]   but who would prefer not to be viewed as having an illness,
[01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:58.380]   but rather would be viewed as having a different style
[01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:00.080]   of living and interaction.
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.180]   And I think we need to respect that.
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:05.520]   So the challenge is, again,
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:10.520]   not oversimplifying a complex heterogeneous disorder
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:17.440]   and both being respectful of the people
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.460]   who don't wanna be defined as having
[01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:22.240]   a neuropsychiatric or brain disorder,
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:25.800]   while equally being respectful of people like your friends
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:30.640]   with severely impaired children who deserve help,
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.400]   who deserve research.
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:35.760]   And it's a tough one because my understanding from,
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:39.000]   to be honest, just reading articles in the lay press
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.600]   and going to websites from organizations
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:46.940]   that philanthropically support research related to autism,
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:50.240]   within that community of individuals
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.400]   who are not researchers,
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:56.800]   but who have family members or are themselves
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:01.280]   dealing with some degree of autism spectrum disorder,
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:06.160]   there's disagreements about what terminology to use,
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.200]   how to deal with them.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.620]   And it's complicated.
[01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:10.560]   I think we just have to respect everybody.
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:15.240]   And if you're interacting with individuals,
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:16.320]   I think it's appropriate.
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:17.440]   What do you prefer?
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:22.020]   - I do know as a medical professional,
[01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:25.000]   and especially when you're dealing with children,
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.960]   there are children who need help.
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:32.020]   And we're not doing them a service
[01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:34.560]   by saying they don't have an issue
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:36.720]   that we should be helping them with and working on.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.520]   So I hope that answers your question.
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.880]   - Beautifully, I think it beautifully answers it
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:44.800]   and encompasses all sides so that we can move forward.
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:47.500]   And I think, so as we use the term autism
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.520]   or children or people with autism,
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:51.720]   that's what we're referring to.
[01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:53.220]   - I think people are very sensitive,
[01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:57.960]   especially those individuals who are neuro-atypical,
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:00.000]   who previously might be diagnosed
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.760]   as autism spectrum disorder,
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:05.320]   but would prefer to not be labeled
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:08.980]   as having a brain illness, that's fine.
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:11.860]   It's kind of, once you are an adult,
[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:14.340]   you can make that decision for yourself.
[01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:16.640]   - We certainly have colleagues at Stanford and elsewhere
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.360]   who, at least by my non-clinical assessment,
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:21.360]   seem to fall somewhere on that spectrum.
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:22.640]   - And again, it's a continuum,
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:26.280]   just like the experience of depression is a continuum.
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.400]   - And as with depression,
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:30.360]   you wouldn't love a child or an adult any less
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:31.380]   because they have depression,
[01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:34.200]   nor would you love a child or adult any less
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:37.400]   because of expression of some autism symptoms.
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:38.500]   - I know the point.
[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:39.600]   People don't, you know.
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:43.920]   And so we are being trained in the medical profession
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:48.040]   to be very, and our society is going this way too,
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:52.560]   very careful with the terms we use
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:54.920]   and the labeling of individuals.
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:59.160]   So I've been taught you can say individuals
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:02.200]   living with an autism spectrum disorder,
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:05.300]   some people don't like using a term,
[01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:07.580]   oh, that individual is autistic,
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:11.300]   because that has some, can have some,
[01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:13.360]   I don't wanna say derogatory meaning,
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.200]   but some labeling kind of,
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.960]   but you know, sometimes this gets out of control too,
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:18.800]   as we both know.
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:20.480]   - Well, for sake of fluid conversation,
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:21.520]   we will do our best,
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.820]   but we will acknowledge from the outset
[01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:24.880]   that we are well-meaning,
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:27.320]   but far from perfect in how we'll handle this.
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:29.000]   - Well put, well put.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.400]   - So in thinking about social interactions
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:33.400]   and leaving aside anything related to autism for the moment,
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:36.720]   it appears that the circuits in the brain
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:38.900]   that mediate the desire to spend time
[01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:40.840]   with others of the same species,
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:43.300]   maybe even with other species like a dog,
[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:48.160]   are fairly hardwired, but modifiable.
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:51.320]   We were born with the capacity to build them up
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:56.820]   and that social behavior is highly rewarded.
[01:19:56.820 --> 01:20:00.080]   Is it rewarded through the dopamine system?
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:03.080]   And what, if any, involvement is there
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:05.040]   of the serotonergic system?
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.600]   And we haven't talked about serotonin yet,
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.760]   but I'd love to bring up serotonin at this point.
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:11.240]   Maybe you could educate us a little bit about serotonin
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:14.660]   because, gosh, if dopamine is fascinating,
[01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:18.420]   serotonin is at least as incredible.
[01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:19.520]   - Yeah, great question.
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:22.840]   So I think for me, the easiest way for me to answer it
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:27.320]   is actually just tell you my research history
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:30.720]   and how a lab like mine at Stanford
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:33.200]   that at one point was studying
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:35.560]   what you and I would call
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:40.560]   fairly hardcore molecular mechanisms of neuroplasticity.
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:44.880]   How do connections between nerve cells change
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:47.160]   and what molecules are changing
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:50.540]   and pretty hardcore molecular stuff.
[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:54.080]   How did I end up studying social behaviors in mice
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:56.380]   and what I hope we'll end up talking about,
[01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:58.520]   even developing behavioral models
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:02.080]   of what I will define as empathy in mice?
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:03.600]   The answer is very simple.
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:07.360]   My lab was working on roles
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:10.200]   of classic dopamine reward circuitry
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:14.000]   and how it changes in models of addiction.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.960]   We haven't talked about depression, models of depression,
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:18.380]   because just intuitively,
[01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:20.840]   hopefully your listeners can understand
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:25.800]   if one component of depression is what we call anhedonia,
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:29.720]   the inability to experience reward.
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:32.100]   Eating a donut is no longer satisfying.
[01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.760]   Having sex is no longer that much fun,
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:36.920]   which is a component of depression.
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:39.160]   If there's a mechanism in the brain
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:41.180]   that tells you something is rewarding,
[01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:43.780]   by definition, that's not functioning normally
[01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:45.380]   in severe depression.
[01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:47.360]   So we were doing models of depression
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:50.280]   to figure out how the dopamine reward circuitry
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:52.960]   was changing, as were many other labs.
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:54.420]   We were studying addiction.
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:56.180]   Those were the obvious ones.
[01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:59.840]   And I mean, it might be entertaining to your audience
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:02.480]   to learn how academic scientists think.
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:05.160]   I was thinking, those are fascinating topics.
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:07.300]   They're pretty competitive.
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:09.920]   Lots of other labs were working on it.
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:14.600]   And I started thinking, what other experiences
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:17.440]   might be modifying the reward circuitry?
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:20.560]   I actually made some attempts to look at feeding behavior,
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:21.800]   but I don't wanna, I mean,
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:25.320]   we actually never pursued that for a variety of reasons.
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.880]   And that's obviously important because of,
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:32.160]   there is an obesity epidemic in this country.
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:36.280]   And we can talk about how the reward circuitry
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:37.960]   and some of the things we've learned
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:41.560]   from our studies of addiction may be helpful
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:42.960]   to understanding obesity.
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:46.480]   But back to social interaction, I started thinking,
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:51.480]   well, for most of us, what I call a prosocial,
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:55.440]   non-sexual experience is highly reinforcing.
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.160]   Andrew, you're a pretty social guy.
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:22:59.880]   I'm a pretty social guy.
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:03.040]   Most of the time, I'd rather go to a movie,
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:06.500]   a sporting event, a dinner with friends.
[01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:12.000]   Actually, for me, the most meaningful component of my life,
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.520]   other than spending time with my children,
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:17.100]   is spending time with my close friends.
[01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:19.440]   And I started thinking, well, why is that?
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:22.940]   Why do I have such a good time going to a ball game
[01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:25.220]   with my best friend or going out to dinner
[01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:28.980]   with another couple and interacting?
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:31.080]   It's because, well, it's highly reinforcing.
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:32.760]   And if it's highly reinforcing,
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:35.380]   it must involve the reward circuitry.
[01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:37.700]   And then I started thinking evolutionarily,
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:41.000]   it makes a lot of sense because if you are part
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.820]   of a social species, there's a lot of evolutionarily,
[01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:51.960]   a lot of advantages for your survival to be hanging out
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:57.040]   with other members of your species in a non-aggressive way.
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.800]   It can increase your likelihood
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:02.040]   to find a mate and reproduce.
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:05.000]   It can protect you from predators.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.760]   I mean, that's why any of your listeners
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:12.760]   who ever watch wildlife shows or National Geographic shows,
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:17.320]   there's a reason all these animals hang out together.
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.680]   It's for protection from predators.
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.400]   So there are all these reasons.
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:26.400]   So about whenever it was, 13 or 14 years ago,
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:31.180]   my lab decided to start looking at how the reward circuitry
[01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:34.840]   may play a role in what I am gonna call
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:39.840]   positive prosocial non-aggressive interactions.
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:43.520]   Another word we use is just sociability.
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:48.120]   And for a variety of reasons back then,
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:53.120]   this is at least 13 years ago, maybe 15 years ago,
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:56.180]   a postdoc joined my lab named Gul Dolan.
[01:24:56.180 --> 01:24:58.560]   She's now a professor at Johns Hopkins.
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:02.100]   And she had an interest in oxytocin.
[01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:05.440]   And as your listeners know,
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:11.040]   oxytocin is this evolutionarily conserved neuropeptide
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:14.320]   that's very important for parturition,
[01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:18.940]   having a baby born, for milk being produced.
[01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:20.500]   And it's gotten a lot of attention
[01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:23.540]   as a potential love neuropeptide
[01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:26.660]   is something that is released in our brains
[01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:29.140]   during a positive social interaction.
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:34.140]   There's a well-known researcher in social behavior
[01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:37.840]   and bonding research called Larry Young.
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.440]   And he did some very important,
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:44.300]   now somewhat classic work studying a species called the vole
[01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:46.400]   in particular the prairie vole.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:51.260]   And prairie voles are a species where they mate for life.
[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:53.080]   It's called pair bonding.
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:55.220]   So one vole will find another vole.
[01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:58.260]   They basically get married, they have kids,
[01:25:58.260 --> 01:26:01.920]   and they hang out together for the rest of their life.
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:03.780]   - No divorce, no 50% divorce rate.
[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:06.480]   - No 50% divorce rate.
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:10.080]   And what Larry elegantly showed in part,
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:13.520]   in early days in collaboration with a guy named Tom Insull,
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:16.400]   who is a famous academic psychiatrist,
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:20.300]   they showed that oxytocin action
[01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:23.520]   within the nucleus accumbens, within this reward circuitry
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:26.660]   was required and really important
[01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:29.880]   for this monogamous pair bonding.
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:32.820]   Having said that, there was just a paper
[01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:36.500]   that called into question that, but that's--
[01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:39.140]   - But there's 30 years of research prior to that.
[01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:40.100]   I'm glad you brought that up
[01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:41.780]   because we'll keep this contemporary
[01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:44.720]   and the reality is that that recent paper
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.740]   got a lot of attention.
[01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:46.580]   - You know the paper I'm talking about.
[01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:48.060]   - Yeah, that maybe oxytocin isn't playing
[01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:50.460]   as prominent a role in pair bonding as people had thought.
[01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:54.860]   And yet, folks, that could be true.
[01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:57.060]   We have to be scientific about this and be open-minded.
[01:26:57.060 --> 01:26:59.820]   But there's three decades of the work
[01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:01.480]   that speaks to the contrary.
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:04.620]   So I think we wanna weigh the evidence.
[01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:05.460]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:08.760]   And again, the investigators who presented the work
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:10.920]   saying oxytocin may not be as important,
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:13.560]   there are limitations to the manipulations they did,
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:14.780]   which they would agree with.
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:16.600]   So I'm just telling you,
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:19.680]   so Guldolin was a postdoc in my lab
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:22.820]   and we formulated a project to look at the actions
[01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:27.540]   of oxytocin in the nucleus accumbens in mice.
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:32.460]   And the reason we study mice is they're what are known
[01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:35.620]   as a genetically tractable organism.
[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:38.920]   We have all sorts of really cool
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:42.620]   and sophisticated tricks we can do
[01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:45.780]   to probe brain circuitry,
[01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:49.300]   the actions of neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin
[01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:54.300]   and oxytocin in ways that we can't do in other species.
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:58.940]   And I'm gonna get back to dopamine in a second.
[01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:03.380]   And what we found was that oxytocin action
[01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:07.480]   in the nucleus accumbens was indeed important
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:10.760]   for promoting sociability,
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:15.760]   probably for promoting the reinforcing component
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:17.980]   of a social interaction.
[01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:20.100]   And that surprised us.
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:24.800]   It was like, wow, it's oxytocin seems to be causing,
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:29.180]   enhancing the release of serotonin in the nucleus accumbens.
[01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:31.920]   And that, perhaps we'll get to this,
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:35.580]   that led me off on a whole series of experiments
[01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:38.040]   trying to figure out how serotonin works,
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:41.340]   studying this drug we may talk about called MDMA,
[01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:43.340]   which is ecstasy or molly,
[01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:46.100]   which actually causes release of serotonin.
[01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:49.340]   So we did that work and that got us working in serotonin.
[01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:53.580]   Simultaneously, there were some other papers reporting
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:56.180]   that dopamine release in the accumbens,
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:58.900]   that dopamine is released in the accumbens
[01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:00.560]   during a social interaction,
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:03.220]   a positive non-aggressive social interaction.
[01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:05.780]   Truth be told, it may also be released
[01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:08.820]   during an aggressive interaction.
[01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:10.020]   - Some people like to fight.
[01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:11.500]   - Some people like to fight.
[01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:16.280]   And the difference here is the dopamine release
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:18.160]   and its role in social interactions,
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:20.740]   it's not specific only for social interaction,
[01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:22.180]   as we have talked about.
[01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:26.320]   But nevertheless, that led my lab and other labs
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:29.140]   to do a series of papers.
[01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:32.700]   I'm talking about the field now showing that,
[01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.780]   and I'm giving you a lot of information here.
[01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:38.500]   So how might dopamine release happen
[01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:42.020]   during a non-aggressive social interaction?
[01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:46.080]   It turns out that oxytocin is not only released
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.740]   in the nucleus accumbens,
[01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:52.060]   it's released in the home of the dopamine neurons in the VTA.
[01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:55.140]   So my lab and another lab from Northwestern
[01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:59.260]   showed that oxytocin can actually modulate
[01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:03.100]   dopamine neuron activity in the ventral tegmental area.
[01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:04.620]   So I hope I'm making sense here.
[01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:06.060]   I don't wanna get too technical.
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:11.060]   But it just shows how we discuss these neuromodulators
[01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:14.620]   like dopamine, I just brought in oxytocin.
[01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:17.300]   We're gonna talk about serotonin in a second.
[01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:19.540]   Unfortunately for your listeners,
[01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:21.420]   they don't work in isolation.
[01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:25.700]   They influence each other in ways
[01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:27.500]   that I think it's important for us
[01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:29.340]   to understand and elucidate.
[01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:33.100]   - That is not too much technical detail.
[01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:34.300]   And I think it's wonderfully rich
[01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:36.180]   with areas for us to discuss.
[01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:38.900]   And I'm so very glad that you brought up
[01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:42.100]   that neither dopamine nor serotonin nor oxytocin
[01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:44.140]   work in isolation because all too often,
[01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:47.940]   and admittedly, sometimes even on my podcast,
[01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:49.520]   I'll talk about these things in isolation
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:51.180]   as a way to try and simplify them a bit.
[01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:54.960]   But there's just no way that the brain works that way.
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:57.420]   For instance, turning on dopamine and turning off serotonin,
[01:30:57.420 --> 01:30:59.660]   it's a weighting of inputs.
[01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:02.900]   And I think that serotonin, perhaps I should frame it
[01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:05.580]   this way, just as often as dopamine is framed
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:08.980]   as this reward molecule and pleasure and dopamine hits,
[01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:11.780]   all too often, I think, in the popular press,
[01:31:11.780 --> 01:31:16.540]   serotonin is discussed, and oxytocin too, for that matter,
[01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:20.140]   as this kind of warm, feel good, everything's mellow,
[01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:24.020]   not really associated with a reward and reinforcement.
[01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:26.220]   And of course, it's not that simple.
[01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:28.780]   So when it comes to social interactions,
[01:31:28.780 --> 01:31:30.980]   it sounds like oxytocin and serotonin
[01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:34.680]   are playing a prominent role, also in the accumbens,
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:39.180]   and that dopamine is activated too, have that right?
[01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:42.700]   Okay, so I don't want to take us too far down
[01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:45.180]   the rabbit hole of neural circuit function,
[01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:49.020]   but that to me makes at least a brief discussion
[01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:51.180]   about the nucleus accumbens itself.
[01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:53.020]   Interestingly, okay, so I'm thinking nucleus,
[01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:55.060]   I know that means a pile of neurons,
[01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:56.220]   an aggregation of neurons,
[01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:58.580]   it's talking to this ventral striatum.
[01:31:58.580 --> 01:31:59.420]   So we got a bunch of neurons--
[01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:00.620]   - It's a part of the ventral striatum.
[01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:02.260]   It's a subdivision of it.
[01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:04.000]   - Excuse me, I misspoke.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.820]   Yeah, it's part of the ventral striatum,
[01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:09.500]   and the neurons there can be active
[01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:10.960]   and communicate with other brain areas,
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:13.620]   but we're talking about a lot of nuance of function.
[01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:15.940]   - Oh man, I'm smiling.
[01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:17.900]   I don't know if your audiences can see me smiling,
[01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:21.060]   because it's so, I sometimes go to bed feeling,
[01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:23.100]   it's so complicated, oh my God.
[01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:25.100]   - It is, and yet, could we say
[01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:26.740]   that within the nucleus accumbens,
[01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:28.220]   there are neurons that are acting
[01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:32.020]   as accelerators and breaks?
[01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:34.620]   Is there a simple analogy that perhaps,
[01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:37.140]   while not exhaustive, can still be true?
[01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:38.940]   'Cause that's always the goal on this podcast.
[01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:40.280]   There's no way we can be exhaustive,
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:42.500]   but we want to be as accurate as possible.
[01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:45.380]   - So a very influential hypothesis,
[01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:47.420]   which has guided my thinking,
[01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:50.140]   and again, the trick, I mean,
[01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:54.220]   you have done a wonderful job of communicating
[01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:58.900]   complex scientific topics to your podcast audience,
[01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:00.860]   and I congratulate you on that.
[01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:04.220]   And it's a really important role.
[01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:09.860]   But as you know, it's always more complicated
[01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:12.260]   than we want it to be as scientists,
[01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:16.280]   especially when you're dealing with brain activity issues
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:19.620]   and how the brain mediates all its amazing functions.
[01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:24.020]   So historically, we have thought about
[01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:28.680]   the nucleus accumbens and other components
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:33.140]   of this ventral striatal brain area
[01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:38.140]   as primarily being composed to two different cell types.
[01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:42.820]   And as you pointed out, one being sort of an accelerator,
[01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:46.060]   something that promotes certain behaviors,
[01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:51.060]   and then the other cell type somewhat being a break,
[01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:53.140]   saying don't do that behavior,
[01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:55.100]   don't perform that motor action.
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:34:01.060]   And it is true that there are these different cell types.
[01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:06.140]   It is true that they are modulated by these modulators,
[01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:10.900]   like dopamine and serotonin, in different ways.
[01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:15.460]   And that simplistic hypothesis,
[01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:18.860]   or heuristic we call it, has been very useful
[01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:22.040]   in making models about how the accumbens
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.980]   does all its wonderful things.
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:25.560]   What I'm leading up to is,
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:28.140]   unfortunately, it's a little more complicated.
[01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:31.440]   But yes, there are two different cell types.
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:33.080]   And at least for your audience,
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:38.080]   we can think about dopamine driving the activity of one,
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:40.700]   promoting certain behaviors,
[01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:43.620]   and inhibiting the activity of the other cell type,
[01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:47.700]   and being a sort of break on certain behaviors.
[01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:50.820]   As long as you and I as scientists appreciate,
[01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:52.380]   it's not quite that simple.
[01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:54.020]   It's a little more complicated.
[01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:55.940]   - So using that as a framework
[01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:59.260]   to think about social behavior, as you said,
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:04.260]   pro-social, non-aggressive, non-sexual interactions
[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:08.100]   involve the choice of a lot of behaviors,
[01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:10.700]   but also the suppression of a lot of behaviors.
[01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:14.180]   And so maybe you're starting to sense what I'm doing here.
[01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:18.340]   I think for people to understand how a single structure
[01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:20.440]   like the accumbens could mediate social interaction
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:22.960]   and reward it, what it sounds like it's doing
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:25.940]   is rewarding a certain category
[01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:28.700]   and catalog of behavioral options
[01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:31.800]   and punishing, or at least reducing the probability
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:34.100]   of the occurrence of other behavioral actions.
[01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:35.580]   'Cause when I go to dinner with friends,
[01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:38.140]   if I know them really well, I might hug them.
[01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:41.700]   I might even say something mildly inappropriate.
[01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:44.220]   If I know the context to be safe, right?
[01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:48.060]   But at a dinner interview or discussion with somebody
[01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:51.780]   I barely know, I might watch my words a little bit more,
[01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:52.620]   for instance.
[01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:55.620]   - And I think the accumbens and its associated circuit,
[01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:58.540]   I love the way you just put that, probabilities.
[01:35:58.540 --> 01:36:01.460]   It's my probability of having this behavior
[01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:05.220]   in a certain context is increase the probabilities
[01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:07.400]   of not doing certain behaviors.
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:11.660]   And I think there's little doubt that this brain area
[01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:14.880]   called the nucleus accumbens and all of its associated
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:18.680]   circuitry play a very important role
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:22.980]   in what behaviors you choose to do, pursue,
[01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:26.940]   play a very important role in these making the decision
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:30.680]   and performing these pro-social, non-aggressive,
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:32.740]   non-sexual interactions.
[01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:35.740]   I actually also think it plays a role in empathy
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:37.420]   and I'm leading you there.
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:39.500]   I wanna have a discussion about that.
[01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:40.900]   - Please.
[01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:45.480]   - Again, as a mechanistically driven neuroscientist,
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:49.740]   what is frustrating for me is I know a lot of the connections
[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:51.800]   it's making and the other brain areas
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:55.060]   it's communicating with, but I can't give you
[01:36:55.060 --> 01:37:00.060]   a coherent hypothesis or diagram of how it all happens.
[01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:03.860]   - Yet, yet, you're still going.
[01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:07.780]   - What I can say is even at our current level
[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:12.780]   of understanding, it is leading to novel hypotheses
[01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:19.160]   that are allowing the, if we bring it back to autism,
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:25.420]   that are allowing the development of novel at the moment,
[01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:30.180]   pharmacologic therapeutics that might be helpful
[01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:35.180]   for people who are not having normal pro-social interactions
[01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:39.260]   and would like to have them, would like to be able
[01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:44.260]   to function in that domain in a more adaptive
[01:37:44.260 --> 01:37:47.080]   and productive and meaningful way.
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:49.780]   And that's the importance in my view
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:51.980]   of the kind of mechanistic work my lab
[01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:54.360]   and many other labs around the country are doing.
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:58.320]   Even if we don't have a detailed understanding
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:02.400]   of how it's all happening, we can identify drugs
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:06.140]   and druggable targets or even behavioral interventions
[01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:08.420]   that might actually help people.
[01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:13.420]   For example, suffering from autism spectrum disorder
[01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:19.100]   of the sort that they actually want and need therapeutic help.
[01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:25.380]   - I think looking at the social connection circuitry
[01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:27.620]   through the lens of autism is going to be very interesting
[01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:28.460]   for us to do.
[01:38:28.460 --> 01:38:31.980]   I do have a question about what is being selected for
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:34.400]   in rewarding social interactions?
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:37.340]   Because obviously we are living in a time
[01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:40.980]   where we don't have to aggregate in groups necessarily
[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:43.580]   to protect ourselves physically.
[01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:46.980]   It helps in certain ways and certain circumstances,
[01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:51.980]   but certainly to support ourselves and each other emotionally
[01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:54.180]   having people that we can call on when we're not feeling
[01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:57.700]   so well that we can look to for resources
[01:38:57.700 --> 01:38:59.380]   and that they can look to us.
[01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:00.980]   But when we go out to dinner with friends
[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:02.220]   or we go to a ball game with friends
[01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:03.980]   or we interact with friends, I'm very familiar
[01:39:03.980 --> 01:39:05.860]   with the feeling of like, well, that felt really good.
[01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:06.700]   It just felt good.
[01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:07.800]   It gives me energy.
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:10.300]   It actually gives me energy to go back and do other things
[01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:13.580]   like spend four days alone with a bunch of papers
[01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:15.180]   and lectures preparing for a podcast,
[01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:16.720]   which I also really enjoy.
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:20.700]   But when I do that, when I go out to dinner with friends
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:23.180]   or see friends, I'm not thinking about buffering myself
[01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:24.820]   against loneliness when I do it.
[01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:26.980]   I just like the interaction.
[01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:31.980]   So what sorts of evolutionary hypotheses
[01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:36.540]   can we come up with as to why the human brain
[01:39:36.540 --> 01:39:39.540]   is so tuned for these social interactions?
[01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:43.300]   Why it's rewarded by not just one dopamine, but also--
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:45.500]   - Serotonin. - Serotonin and oxytocin.
[01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:50.200]   Three prominent neuromodulatory chemicals in the brain
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:53.500]   are devoted at one site in the brain and others
[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:54.640]   that it's connected to, of course,
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:59.060]   but to making sure that we do this as often as possible
[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:01.180]   without giving up the rest of our lives.
[01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:03.300]   - Well, I mean, again, I think the answer
[01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:06.080]   I'm gonna be able to give, I hope it's not trite
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:09.080]   and it may be a little bit obvious, is,
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:12.580]   and in some ways, it's analogous
[01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:18.940]   to why drugs of abuse and addiction
[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:22.880]   are also a problem is that the circuitry
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:27.720]   that is telling us a prosocial positive interaction
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:32.520]   is so highly reinforcing evolved over millions of years
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:36.060]   or hundreds of thousands of years, whatever that is.
[01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:38.680]   And the only hypothesis I can come up with,
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:41.260]   and Andrew, you may be able to come up with better ones,
[01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:46.020]   is what I alluded to earlier is that it was very adaptive
[01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:47.980]   when we were more primitive organisms,
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:49.740]   nevermind non-human primates,
[01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:54.740]   but when we were whatever we were to be a social species
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:41:00.100]   for basically primarily two reasons.
[01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:05.100]   For reproductive purposes, it increased your likelihood
[01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:08.260]   of reproducing if you were hanging out
[01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:12.780]   with other members of your species in a non-aggressive way
[01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:16.100]   and for protection against predators.
[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:18.300]   And there may be other reasons.
[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:19.500]   - Probably child-rearing, too.
[01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:20.340]   - Oh yeah, thank you.
[01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:22.760]   - In your absence, you want trusted friends
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:24.020]   that can watch your offspring.
[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:26.420]   - Thank you, very good point.
[01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:29.460]   So the circuits, the modulators we use,
[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:32.800]   that evolved over millennia, and as you pointed out,
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:38.960]   eventually, I mean, depending on the society
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:43.820]   in which you live, you didn't need those social interactions
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:48.340]   for protection against predators, although, you know,
[01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:49.980]   if we look at our world now,
[01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:52.060]   one can make arguments both ways.
[01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:54.900]   If you're in a war zone, is it better to be off by yourself?
[01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:57.780]   Is it better to be with a group of people?
[01:41:57.780 --> 01:42:02.940]   But so the mechanisms evolved for one purpose,
[01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:05.120]   and they don't just disappear,
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:09.620]   because there's no disadvantage to having this mechanism
[01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:12.660]   that tells us a social interaction is reinforcing.
[01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:14.500]   And I would still argue there's benefit
[01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:17.060]   for reproductive purposes.
[01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:20.700]   You can't have kids if you're by yourself all the time.
[01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:21.540]   - Well, and this is actually--
[01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:23.660]   - I think it's impossible, at least currently,
[01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:27.300]   and you can't find a partner with whom to have kids
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:30.480]   if you're socially isolated, or it makes it much harder.
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:32.020]   So I hope I'm answering your question.
[01:42:32.020 --> 01:42:36.720]   I think, and then as you pointed out,
[01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:43.340]   for many of us, there's a lot of positive aspects
[01:42:43.340 --> 01:42:46.420]   to having friendships and hanging out with your friends.
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:49.540]   Emotional support, emotional buffering.
[01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:50.620]   - And feeling connected.
[01:42:50.620 --> 01:42:54.080]   There's something about this notion of feeling connected,
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:55.620]   and later we'll talk about psychedelics,
[01:42:55.620 --> 01:42:59.580]   but this notion of feeling connected has a lot to do
[01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:02.700]   with buffering loneliness when we are alone.
[01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:06.620]   The memories and the energy, for lack of a better word,
[01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:10.220]   that we feel in recalling social experiences
[01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:13.620]   and anticipating social experiences is really powerful.
[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:18.040]   You mentioned that people can't have children
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:19.220]   if they spend all their time alone.
[01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:21.500]   It's actually, I realize you're not on social media
[01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:23.300]   and more power to you,
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:25.940]   but this is actually a prominent discussion on social media.
[01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:29.200]   There's an entire culture of young people,
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:30.720]   in particular young men these days,
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:33.220]   who, at least from what I understand
[01:43:33.220 --> 01:43:35.600]   in the research literature about this,
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:39.660]   are socially isolated, spending all their time online,
[01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:41.380]   maybe not even on social media,
[01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:42.860]   but are spending a lot of time online,
[01:43:42.860 --> 01:43:46.860]   video games hiding in electronic landscapes,
[01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:48.060]   digital landscapes.
[01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:53.520]   And concern about mental health issues there, et cetera.
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:57.140]   Concern about porn overuse and addiction there, et cetera.
[01:43:57.140 --> 01:44:01.420]   But social media itself is an incredible phenomenon
[01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:04.120]   to consider in light of everything we're talking about.
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:09.860]   I can't say, even though I am on all social media platforms
[01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:11.960]   and I'm quite active there,
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:15.380]   I can't say that I've ever been on social media
[01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:18.780]   and experienced the kind of delight and thrill
[01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:22.420]   and persistent energy increase
[01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:24.420]   that I experienced with in-person interaction.
[01:44:24.420 --> 01:44:27.040]   And yet social media, I have to assume,
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:30.420]   is capitalizing on some of these same reward mechanisms
[01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:32.900]   in presumably the nucleus accumbens.
[01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:34.660]   So are there any data,
[01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:36.680]   I realize this is a hard experiment to do in mice,
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:37.880]   maybe impossible.
[01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:39.580]   Are there any data that you're aware of
[01:44:39.580 --> 01:44:44.580]   that shows that social media has a high addictive liability
[01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:46.580]   or do we even need an experiment?
[01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:49.560]   - I'm not sure we need an experiment.
[01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:52.360]   I think it clearly does.
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:54.040]   I agree with the point you're making,
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:57.360]   although your podcast audience probably
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:58.680]   doesn't know who I am.
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:00.660]   I am in my late sixties.
[01:45:00.660 --> 01:45:01.500]   I grew up--
[01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:02.400]   - Well, they know who you are now.
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:07.400]   - I grew up before computers, before cell phones.
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:13.320]   So I still am a believer, perhaps in an old fashioned way,
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:18.660]   that physical interpersonal reactions are really important.
[01:45:18.660 --> 01:45:23.660]   Obviously there are advantages to being able to interact
[01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:25.700]   over social media.
[01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:28.760]   And I mean, for all sorts of reasons,
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:31.420]   there's a lot of positive and good from that.
[01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:33.740]   But back to your question, can we get addicted?
[01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:36.140]   I can't speak to social media.
[01:45:36.140 --> 01:45:41.140]   I can speak, and Anna Lemke, I think is much more able
[01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:44.140]   to eloquently describe the issues around here.
[01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:46.540]   I can just talk from my own experience
[01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:50.020]   that my cell phone is,
[01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:54.860]   this isn't social media, but checking my email messages,
[01:45:54.860 --> 01:45:57.960]   checking my text messages,
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:03.020]   for me has a compulsive addictive quality to it.
[01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:03.900]   - It's like a lever press.
[01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:06.240]   - It's like a lever press for a mouse.
[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:10.460]   And part of that is my own personality.
[01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:14.860]   Part of that is the immediate feedback.
[01:46:14.860 --> 01:46:18.980]   So you get from a social media post,
[01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:20.600]   from seeing your name mentioned,
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:23.260]   getting a message from one of your friends.
[01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:26.900]   Sure, I like getting messages from my friends.
[01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:28.600]   It means they're thinking about me.
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:31.860]   It means I'm part of their world.
[01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:36.100]   I have no doubt it's activating my reward circuitry,
[01:46:36.100 --> 01:46:40.180]   not nearly to the degree that a hit of cocaine
[01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:42.240]   or an opioid would do.
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:48.540]   So I don't know what else to say about it.
[01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:55.340]   I think as a society, we have to be aware of these issues,
[01:46:56.580 --> 01:46:59.760]   and it's really complicated how we manage,
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:01.780]   especially once you're an adult,
[01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:04.780]   you make your own decisions for better or worse,
[01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:08.260]   but it's a huge issue obviously for anybody
[01:47:08.260 --> 01:47:11.320]   who has children or is planning to have children.
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:13.180]   - And it halts on social media.
[01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:16.940]   I see lots of accounts of people that are 18 and older
[01:47:16.940 --> 01:47:19.220]   who they spent a lot of time on there.
[01:47:19.220 --> 01:47:21.420]   And I'm not necessarily saying that's a bad thing.
[01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:22.660]   A lot of people have entire careers
[01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:23.820]   that exist on social media.
[01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:27.820]   It just seems to me that Instagram, Facebook,
[01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:30.260]   LinkedIn, Twitter have capitalized
[01:47:30.260 --> 01:47:33.740]   on this hardwired circuitry.
[01:47:33.740 --> 01:47:35.940]   The release of, I mean, to make it really reductionist,
[01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:38.700]   the release of serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin
[01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:41.380]   by virtue of someone saying something to us,
[01:47:41.380 --> 01:47:43.340]   maybe not even a positive thing.
[01:47:43.340 --> 01:47:45.740]   Maybe it's a negative thing.
[01:47:45.740 --> 01:47:47.180]   As you said, they're thinking of us.
[01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:49.940]   There's something about being recognized by others.
[01:47:49.940 --> 01:47:51.100]   And maybe this is a good segue,
[01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:52.820]   we're heading towards empathy here,
[01:47:52.820 --> 01:47:53.900]   a discussion about empathy.
[01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:57.160]   - I think that's very well put.
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:48:01.120]   It is capitalizing on these more primitive
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:03.900]   neurobiological mechanisms that evolved
[01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:07.460]   for purposes of reproduction and survival.
[01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:11.060]   I think that certainly has to be the case.
[01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:13.860]   And I think it's important,
[01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:15.120]   I mean, thank you for bringing that up,
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:20.120]   for us as a society to be at least aware of this.
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:22.340]   And it doesn't mean, it's like many things.
[01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:24.780]   It's not all good, it's not all bad.
[01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:28.840]   It has, there are positive uses of social media, I can see.
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:33.420]   But mostly we read about the dangers of it.
[01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:37.020]   We read about these kids who are socially isolated,
[01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:39.820]   who make bad decisions based on what they're seeing
[01:48:39.820 --> 01:48:41.340]   with social media.
[01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:43.860]   But anyhow, back to the neuroscience,
[01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:45.980]   you're absolutely correct.
[01:48:45.980 --> 01:48:49.800]   It's capitalizing on these mechanisms
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:54.800]   that evolved for physical interpersonal interactions,
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:58.540]   because our evolution didn't anticipate it.
[01:48:58.540 --> 01:49:01.020]   - Right, just as pornography is capitalizing
[01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:03.180]   on the sexual arousal reward circuit,
[01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:04.020]   associated reward circuit.
[01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:07.980]   - No question about it, just as the gambling industry does.
[01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:11.340]   I mean, as you know, the Vegas casinos
[01:49:11.340 --> 01:49:15.340]   have full-time people developing algorithms
[01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:19.920]   for how frequently should a slot machine pay off?
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:22.320]   What's the perfect amount of payoff
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:25.800]   to keep certain individuals coming back?
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:28.800]   - So pernicious, someone, you could tell
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:30.880]   I've been spending a lot of time around addicts
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:31.720]   and former addicts.
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:34.960]   I've been researching some things for the podcast.
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:38.680]   And a gambling addict told me something interesting.
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:42.320]   They said, the real stinger with being a gambling addict
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:45.600]   is that the next time really could change everything.
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:47.180]   Whereas no alcoholic says that,
[01:49:47.180 --> 01:49:49.520]   that the next drink could change everything for the better.
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:51.980]   Or the cocaine addict doesn't think,
[01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:53.820]   oh, the next line of cocaine
[01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:56.480]   could make all of life better now and forever.
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:59.180]   Whereas the gambling addict actually holds in mind
[01:49:59.180 --> 01:50:04.000]   the infinitesimally small and yet real potential
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.700]   that the next time really could wipe out their debt
[01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:08.520]   and perhaps wipe out their,
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:10.640]   and yet we know they would lose that too, right?
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:11.480]   Whatever winnings they have.
[01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:14.360]   And casinos are fully aware of this.
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:16.680]   I have been told by friends who know,
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:21.680]   they employ full-time quantitative,
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:25.020]   for lack of a better term,
[01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:27.360]   well, I was gonna say computer geek.
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:30.040]   I don't mean to that be an innate derogator.
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:32.120]   - And probably neuroscientists too.
[01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:34.720]   - I would be amazed if they don't have neuroscientists
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:37.960]   who have expertise in what's called neuroeconomics
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:39.560]   or behavioral economics.
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:44.840]   I'm 95% sure that has to be the case.
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:47.360]   - I occasionally sit down to the roulette table
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:49.180]   'cause I just, it's so passive and easy.
[01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:51.160]   And not long ago, actually,
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:54.000]   I had the experience of winning a fairly,
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.960]   not a large sum, but a meaningful sum of money.
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:51:00.000]   And I'll tell you, my sole mission at that point
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.480]   was to get up and go back to my room
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:04.500]   and not stop at another table.
[01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:07.540]   And I confess, I pulled one brief stop at another table,
[01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:09.360]   played it one hand and then lost it.
[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:11.400]   And then just got back to my room as quickly as possible
[01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:14.260]   and then left Las Vegas as quickly as possible.
[01:51:14.260 --> 01:51:15.100]   - Gambling is fascinating.
[01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:16.840]   - But they'll probably get me the next time.
[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:19.720]   - Gambling is, again, it all gets back
[01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:21.480]   to this reward circuitry.
[01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:26.480]   And the intermittent rewards are very, very powerful.
[01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:28.400]   - Well, and you mentioned earlier
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:30.920]   that the reward system is powerfully tuned to remember
[01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:32.360]   what were the behaviors that led up
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:34.040]   to the rewarding experience.
[01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:38.080]   And nobody ever won at the roulette or craps table
[01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:41.920]   or poker table by getting up and leaving, right?
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:43.720]   And so I guess my brain was just thinking,
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:44.560]   well, how did I win?
[01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:47.560]   I won by sitting down and putting chips on the table,
[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:49.020]   not by going back to my room.
[01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:50.280]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:53.340]   - And yet I have a fair number of degrees
[01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:55.440]   and I like to think my prefrontal cortex is working
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:58.160]   and yet it was still challenging in that moment.
[01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:00.720]   - Gambling is really, I mean, yeah,
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:05.720]   another human activity that's quite complicated.
[01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:09.880]   It can be enjoyable or it can be incredibly damaging.
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:12.240]   - And now people are gonna think I was that gambling addict
[01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:13.880]   that I was referring to, but I swear I'm not.
[01:52:13.880 --> 01:52:16.920]   Fortunately, I feel very blessed that that's not my addiction.
[01:52:16.920 --> 01:52:21.920]   I'd like to talk about empathy and use that as a framework
[01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:24.120]   for eventually returning to our discussion of autism.
[01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:27.580]   But you have this perhaps longstanding interest,
[01:52:27.580 --> 01:52:31.560]   but recent research interest in empathy.
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:32.400]   Tell me about this work.
[01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:33.320]   I'm not familiar with it yet.
[01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:37.840]   - Okay, so I'm gonna, I hope it's okay,
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:41.320]   drag in some work I've done on this drug called MDMA
[01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:42.720]   because it is related.
[01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:48.520]   So we were working on in my lab, social behaviors,
[01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:53.520]   positive pro-social behaviors that stimulated me
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:56.440]   to start thinking about what are components
[01:52:56.440 --> 01:53:00.480]   of a positive pro-social non-aggressive interaction.
[01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:06.320]   A common key component of that is having some empathy
[01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:13.000]   and compassion for the individuals you're hanging out with.
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.260]   And it is a topic I've been interested in
[01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:17.300]   for many, many decades.
[01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:22.080]   I was once a psychiatrist and to get on my,
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:26.680]   whatever the word is, hobby horse, I look at the world today.
[01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:29.440]   I try to be optimistic.
[01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:32.440]   Again, I am a child of the '60s and '70s.
[01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:37.080]   When I look at the world, and I actually just did a trip
[01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:39.320]   to Israel to give a series of lectures,
[01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:42.200]   and I look at the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
[01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:43.680]   what always enters my mind,
[01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:45.800]   and I've felt this way for decades,
[01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:48.920]   is what is more important for the survival
[01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:52.720]   of the human species than empathy and compassion,
[01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:56.760]   than actually being able to look at another human being,
[01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:58.880]   even if they look different than you,
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:02.520]   even if they have a different belief system than you?
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:05.720]   What is more important than actually understanding
[01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:10.720]   that 98% of your life is very similar?
[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:15.380]   You have some differences in how you look
[01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:18.380]   and the beliefs you have, but there's so much in common.
[01:54:18.380 --> 01:54:20.600]   So what's more important than understanding
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:23.480]   that when another person is suffering,
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:26.560]   they're suffering, it's the same as your suffering,
[01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:29.440]   and having compassion for somebody.
[01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:31.720]   So I started thinking, what is more important?
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:33.400]   And I'm not a politician.
[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:36.760]   As you know, Andrew, I have no social media presence.
[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:39.840]   I figured the only way I might be able to contribute
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:46.120]   to efforts that might help the human species
[01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:48.380]   enhance empathy and compassion
[01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:53.120]   is by studying the neurobiological underpinnings of it.
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:55.880]   And I didn't realize I might be able to do that
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:59.640]   until I started studying sociability
[01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:02.500]   or prosocial behaviors in mice.
[01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:07.500]   And then I was able to have a young woman scientist,
[01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:14.940]   and I want to give her credit, Monique Smith.
[01:55:14.940 --> 01:55:16.900]   You might want to have Monique on your podcast.
[01:55:16.900 --> 01:55:18.220]   She's a dynamo.
[01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:22.040]   She's now an assistant professor at UCSD,
[01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:23.160]   where you once was.
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:28.160]   And Monique introduced me to a series of behavioral assays
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:33.240]   that I like to use the phrase,
[01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:34.240]   they are measurements,
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:38.080]   they are behavioral antecedents of empathy.
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:41.420]   Because in the world of psychologists
[01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:43.360]   and people who use the term empathy,
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:46.680]   it has a lot of different meanings to different people.
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:51.680]   I'm using it basically to mean one member of a species
[01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:55.900]   manifests some behavior that indicates
[01:55:55.900 --> 01:56:00.500]   it is being influenced by the emotional state
[01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:02.860]   or what we call the affective state,
[01:56:02.860 --> 01:56:04.360]   affective with an A,
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:07.360]   of another member of that species
[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:09.080]   in its immediate environment.
[01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:14.000]   For human interactions, I just think of,
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.080]   we were talking about friendships.
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:21.880]   Any of us who watch a close friend suffer, it's hard.
[01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:24.020]   You want to do anything you can to help them.
[01:56:24.020 --> 01:56:25.240]   That's empathy.
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:28.680]   A mother with their child, a good mother, hopefully.
[01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:31.320]   When you have a kid who is sick,
[01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:33.040]   there's nothing worse as a parent.
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:36.000]   You just want to take that pain and suffering away.
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.900]   That's how I'm defining empathy.
[01:56:37.900 --> 01:56:42.900]   So it's my belief that like any complex human behavior,
[01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:48.020]   there are evolutionary reasons why that has been adaptive
[01:56:48.020 --> 01:56:49.860]   and important and maintained.
[01:56:49.860 --> 01:56:54.480]   And if it's evolutionarily evolved,
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:55.800]   there are ways of studying it
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:59.220]   in more primitive organisms like mice.
[01:56:59.220 --> 01:57:02.640]   So I'll tell you some of the behavioral assays we're doing.
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:06.420]   One is, and I get a kick out of this,
[01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:09.720]   because it's pretty new for me.
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:11.820]   So one assay, and we published a paper
[01:57:11.820 --> 01:57:14.300]   in a journal called Science about this,
[01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:20.420]   which is if you take one mouse and in a ethical way,
[01:57:20.420 --> 01:57:23.660]   you put it in pain, you make its hind paw,
[01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:27.780]   one of its paws, one of its feet hurt a modest amount,
[01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:29.960]   and you take another mouse and you let that,
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:32.100]   what's known as the bystander mouse,
[01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:36.140]   just hang out with the mouse that's in pain for one hour,
[01:57:36.140 --> 01:57:38.740]   just one hour, the bystander mouse,
[01:57:38.740 --> 01:57:43.060]   who has experienced no physical injury whatsoever,
[01:57:43.060 --> 01:57:47.840]   will manifest behaviors indicating it is now in pain.
[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:50.620]   And it lasts maybe four to 20 hours.
[01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:51.900]   But think about that.
[01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:54.920]   A mouse that is normal,
[01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:56.940]   hanging out with another mouse in pain,
[01:57:56.940 --> 01:57:59.700]   starts feeling pain itself.
[01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:04.200]   - And the mice are able to see one another
[01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:05.360]   and hear one another?
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:06.200]   - Good point.
[01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:10.260]   So you're getting to how is that communication happening?
[01:58:10.260 --> 01:58:14.780]   And a lot more work needs to be done on it.
[01:58:14.780 --> 01:58:17.440]   Monique and her previous colleagues and others,
[01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:22.540]   one component of it is probably an olfactory cue
[01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:24.220]   or what we call a pheromone.
[01:58:24.220 --> 01:58:26.580]   - So the mouse that's in pain is secreting an ovary?
[01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:27.780]   - Probably, probably,
[01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:31.580]   because you can take bedding from mice in pain
[01:58:31.580 --> 01:58:33.740]   and expose the bystander mice.
[01:58:33.740 --> 01:58:34.580]   So that's one thing.
[01:58:34.580 --> 01:58:37.420]   And I had never heard of these behavioral assays.
[01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:39.420]   We developed our, and this is pretty cool,
[01:58:39.420 --> 01:58:40.580]   and then I'll tell you two others,
[01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:43.420]   and then I'll tell you how it connects to reward circuitry.
[01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:46.700]   We developed a novel assay,
[01:58:46.700 --> 01:58:51.100]   which is the social transfer of pain relief.
[01:58:51.100 --> 01:58:54.120]   Pain relief is called analgesia.
[01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:56.040]   And I thought this was pretty cool.
[01:58:56.040 --> 01:58:59.200]   So you take, and this is in this paper
[01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:01.900]   that was published in Science a year ago,
[01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:06.580]   you take two mice and they're both in pain, modest pain.
[01:59:06.580 --> 01:59:08.560]   I don't want your listeners to get upset.
[01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:12.340]   We are not hurting these mice too badly.
[01:59:12.340 --> 01:59:13.620]   And it is a tricky issue.
[01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:17.100]   Is it okay to put a mouse in pain so you can,
[01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:19.000]   the goal is to develop better treatments
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:22.340]   for human beings in pain, obviously.
[01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:24.760]   So you have two mice in modest pain.
[01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:29.760]   You give one mouse morphine, so it's now analgesic.
[01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:32.720]   It is no longer experiencing pain.
[01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:35.420]   You take another mouse that's in pain
[01:59:35.420 --> 01:59:39.000]   and you just let it hang out with the mouse
[01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.940]   that is no longer in pain.
[01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:44.620]   And the mouse that is in pain will show behaviors
[01:59:44.620 --> 01:59:48.180]   indicating it is experiencing analgesia.
[01:59:48.180 --> 01:59:50.340]   It is no longer in as much pain.
[01:59:50.340 --> 01:59:51.440]   Now think about that.
[01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:54.260]   And there's actually evidence from human studies
[01:59:54.260 --> 01:59:59.260]   that I can't speak to in any comprehensive way
[01:59:59.260 --> 02:00:02.920]   where, I mean, it's called social buffering of pain.
[02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:05.140]   If you are, I mean, to be honest,
[02:00:05.140 --> 02:00:08.860]   I've been having some neck pain just because I'm an old guy
[02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:11.500]   and I woke up on the wrong side of the bed.
[02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:15.940]   And if I'm by myself, I focus on that pain
[02:00:15.940 --> 02:00:17.260]   and it bothers me more.
[02:00:17.260 --> 02:00:21.940]   If I'm in a socially engaged, I think it's not only that,
[02:00:21.940 --> 02:00:23.820]   I'm not paying as much attention to the pain,
[02:00:23.820 --> 02:00:26.740]   but I think there's actually some relief
[02:00:26.740 --> 02:00:29.700]   from what's known as the social buffering of pain.
[02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:32.000]   - Well, I'm no hippie, but I actually think that
[02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:37.060]   all species, including humans, are secreting molecules,
[02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:40.860]   mainly odorants that are perhaps even acting
[02:00:40.860 --> 02:00:43.140]   directly as analgesics.
[02:00:43.140 --> 02:00:46.880]   And I can make that statement without ordering too much
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:49.040]   that people think I'm completely crazy
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:51.940]   because we had a Noam Sobol on the podcast
[02:00:51.940 --> 02:00:55.260]   from the Weizmann who shared with us, you know,
[02:00:55.260 --> 02:00:58.220]   not one, not two, but at least a dozen ways
[02:00:58.220 --> 02:01:03.220]   in which humans are making molecules, typically odors,
[02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:05.460]   and communicating those to one another
[02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:09.060]   to powerfully impact their testosterone levels,
[02:01:09.060 --> 02:01:12.740]   their vasopressin levels, their immune molecules, you know?
[02:01:12.740 --> 02:01:15.020]   And of course, Noam works on olfaction,
[02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:16.580]   so he's going to be biased toward that system,
[02:01:16.580 --> 02:01:19.420]   but that's just one slice of the sensory array.
[02:01:19.420 --> 02:01:22.700]   I mean, what about the way that somebody can look at us
[02:01:22.700 --> 02:01:25.020]   in a way that makes us feel good on a normal day?
[02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:26.300]   Well, when we're in pain,
[02:01:26.300 --> 02:01:28.540]   just even the touch to a shoulder can mean a lot.
[02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:29.620]   I remember going to meetings
[02:01:29.620 --> 02:01:31.940]   when I was a early neuroscientist
[02:01:31.940 --> 02:01:36.940]   and I would probably at that point have, you know,
[02:01:36.940 --> 02:01:39.520]   not been the type to just walk up and say hello to you
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:40.580]   'cause I wasn't in your field
[02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:41.900]   and you're this luminary and stuff.
[02:01:41.900 --> 02:01:43.180]   But I remember as I started-
[02:01:43.180 --> 02:01:44.220]   - I'm a good guy, by the way.
[02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:46.620]   - You are, very, very good.
[02:01:46.620 --> 02:01:48.020]   - I always say hi to everybody.
[02:01:48.020 --> 02:01:48.940]   - I know you are.
[02:01:48.940 --> 02:01:51.300]   And that statement was a reflection on me,
[02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:52.540]   not a reflection on you.
[02:01:52.540 --> 02:01:53.960]   But as I advanced through my career,
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:56.060]   what I found was, you know, you'd give a talk or something
[02:01:56.060 --> 02:01:58.060]   and someone in your field more senior to you
[02:01:58.060 --> 02:02:00.740]   who you respected would give a nod or something.
[02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:02.300]   Those nods meant a lot.
[02:02:02.300 --> 02:02:03.140]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:05.260]   - I mean, those nods could carry you a long distance.
[02:02:05.260 --> 02:02:07.140]   I mean, obviously we wanna be intrinsically driven
[02:02:07.140 --> 02:02:09.820]   to do the work we do, but the social communication stuff-
[02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:10.740]   - We're social species.
[02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:13.740]   - I think there's a whole landscape of things.
[02:02:13.740 --> 02:02:16.660]   So what you're describing is incredible,
[02:02:16.660 --> 02:02:18.940]   but I think makes a ton of sense.
[02:02:18.940 --> 02:02:20.860]   - Yeah, so we have these social transfer pain
[02:02:20.860 --> 02:02:22.020]   of analogies here.
[02:02:22.020 --> 02:02:25.380]   We're working on, and there's a little bit of evidence
[02:02:25.380 --> 02:02:28.860]   in the literature suggesting this might work.
[02:02:28.860 --> 02:02:31.300]   And then I'll talk about reward circuitry
[02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:35.220]   and maybe MDMA and is it an empathogen or not
[02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:39.220]   and how that might influence therapeutic efforts for autism.
[02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:41.300]   We're working on behavioral models.
[02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:46.300]   We're asking the question, will one mouse behave
[02:02:46.300 --> 02:02:49.180]   to give another mouse a reward?
[02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:50.960]   So it's the mouse that's behaving,
[02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:53.880]   that has to press a bar or nose poke
[02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:55.740]   or even experience a shock.
[02:02:55.740 --> 02:02:58.820]   Will the mouse do that simply to give one
[02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:00.780]   of its buddies a reward?
[02:03:00.780 --> 02:03:01.840]   - Pure altruism.
[02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:05.060]   - And yeah, it's pure, it's what we call a generosity,
[02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:07.020]   a generosity assay.
[02:03:07.020 --> 02:03:09.640]   In early days, it looks like it might be working.
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:13.740]   And that's a generosity assay.
[02:03:13.740 --> 02:03:16.540]   We can also ask the question, will a mouse work
[02:03:16.540 --> 02:03:20.220]   so another mouse doesn't get a shock, doesn't get hurt,
[02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:21.820]   which is compassion.
[02:03:21.820 --> 02:03:24.000]   And I think these things are gonna be working.
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:27.580]   And whether you wanna call that empathy,
[02:03:27.580 --> 02:03:29.800]   I would call that, those are behaviors,
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:32.600]   I like to use the term behavioral antecedents
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:35.820]   of how we define empathy in human beings
[02:03:35.820 --> 02:03:37.660]   and the connection to reward circuitry.
[02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:42.660]   And in the little bit of work we have done on this
[02:03:42.660 --> 02:03:47.780]   is we presented evidence that these behaviors,
[02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:50.740]   we call the social transfer of pain,
[02:03:50.740 --> 02:03:53.500]   one mouse experiencing pain just because it's hanging out
[02:03:53.500 --> 02:03:57.460]   with another mouse, the social transfer of analgesia,
[02:03:57.460 --> 02:04:00.260]   a mouse in pain getting some pain relief
[02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:03.780]   from hanging out with another mouse in pain
[02:04:03.780 --> 02:04:05.900]   who has that pain relief.
[02:04:05.900 --> 02:04:08.660]   It seems to involve one component
[02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:11.140]   of the complex brain mechanisms,
[02:04:11.140 --> 02:04:14.760]   seems to involve a part of the brain
[02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:17.540]   called the anterior cingulate cortex,
[02:04:17.540 --> 02:04:22.540]   which human brain imaging studies suggest is activated
[02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:26.220]   during empathic human responses.
[02:04:26.220 --> 02:04:30.340]   And the projections of that area into the nucleus accumbens,
[02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:31.580]   that's the connection.
[02:04:31.580 --> 02:04:37.380]   And we're interested in whether neuromodulators
[02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:42.380]   like dopamine and serotonin may influence these circuitry,
[02:04:42.380 --> 02:04:47.500]   these connections that are involved in these,
[02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:51.880]   in quotes, empathic behaviors, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:54.540]   And we think drugs can be used as probes
[02:04:54.540 --> 02:04:57.020]   of those kinds of neuromodulatory mechanisms.
[02:04:57.020 --> 02:04:58.360]   I hope this is all making sense.
[02:04:58.360 --> 02:05:01.380]   - Yeah, it makes excellent sense and it's fascinating.
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:05.020]   I'm not one to suggest experiments to colleagues
[02:05:05.020 --> 02:05:07.700]   in areas where I don't work, but I'm going to anyway.
[02:05:07.700 --> 02:05:10.780]   - Yeah, please, you're a really smart guy,
[02:05:10.780 --> 02:05:13.900]   so I will value your suggestions.
[02:05:13.900 --> 02:05:16.280]   - You know, I love the motivational backbone
[02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:18.360]   to what you're describing here because I agree,
[02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:20.060]   the world has a lot of issues
[02:05:20.060 --> 02:05:21.480]   and what could be more important
[02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:24.500]   than to increase the amount of empathy and compassion
[02:05:24.500 --> 02:05:25.880]   in the world.
[02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:29.800]   But one thing that we know inhibits empathy and compassion
[02:05:29.800 --> 02:05:32.740]   is one's own challenges and struggles.
[02:05:32.740 --> 02:05:34.860]   And so I'm wondering if there's a way to introduce something
[02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:39.820]   to this behavioral paradigm such that the working
[02:05:39.820 --> 02:05:42.460]   to provide another animal relief from pain,
[02:05:42.460 --> 02:05:44.500]   one animal working to provide relief
[02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:47.860]   of another animal in pain or a animal working
[02:05:47.860 --> 02:05:51.000]   to provide pleasure, reward for another animal.
[02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:52.580]   You know, if it could be scaled
[02:05:52.580 --> 02:05:55.420]   with how inconvenient that work is, right?
[02:05:55.420 --> 02:05:57.440]   Like if I'm very hungry, I mean, we're all taught
[02:05:57.440 --> 02:06:00.720]   to put our own oxygen mask on first in some way too,
[02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:03.340]   so that we don't all die, so to speak.
[02:06:03.340 --> 02:06:07.060]   But you know, I grew up, for instance, with one parent.
[02:06:07.060 --> 02:06:09.300]   My mother was the kind of person who would see,
[02:06:09.300 --> 02:06:11.540]   at that time, there were far fewer homeless people
[02:06:11.540 --> 02:06:12.380]   on the street.
[02:06:12.380 --> 02:06:15.200]   Maybe they were all institutionalized, I don't know.
[02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:18.740]   But if she saw a homeless person on the street
[02:06:18.740 --> 02:06:21.780]   of the town we lived in, she would literally pull over,
[02:06:21.780 --> 02:06:23.860]   give them money, find hotels.
[02:06:23.860 --> 02:06:25.940]   She had homeless people living in hotels
[02:06:25.940 --> 02:06:27.460]   all over the town we lived in.
[02:06:27.460 --> 02:06:28.460]   It was crazy.
[02:06:28.460 --> 02:06:29.700]   I mean, we couldn't get anywhere.
[02:06:29.700 --> 02:06:31.580]   That was the problem, is we would never arrive anywhere
[02:06:31.580 --> 02:06:33.580]   on time, and that's my excuse for always being late.
[02:06:33.580 --> 02:06:35.460]   I would positively reinforce her being late.
[02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:37.980]   I always run late and I always run, incredible, right?
[02:06:37.980 --> 02:06:41.060]   Just a very strong sense of social connection,
[02:06:41.060 --> 02:06:42.060]   that kind of thing.
[02:06:42.060 --> 02:06:44.380]   But in any case, you know, some people are like that.
[02:06:44.380 --> 02:06:48.740]   Like she could not experience any even modicum
[02:06:48.740 --> 02:06:51.960]   of inconvenience for helping others.
[02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:54.340]   Whereas I think most of us feel like if I'm rushing
[02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:56.820]   to catch a flight and I see someone who's struggling,
[02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:58.880]   I'm probably gonna help them if they're in acute pain
[02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:00.900]   or it seems like a dire circumstance.
[02:07:00.900 --> 02:07:02.100]   But let's be honest.
[02:07:02.100 --> 02:07:06.020]   Most people are probably gonna prioritize
[02:07:06.020 --> 02:07:11.020]   their own stress and priorities, for lack of a better word,
[02:07:11.020 --> 02:07:15.620]   when the situation often calls for us to set those aside
[02:07:15.620 --> 02:07:17.500]   and tend to people that are suffering.
[02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:21.360]   So if there was a way to introduce a probe
[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:24.060]   of the interplay of circuitries that involve
[02:07:24.060 --> 02:07:25.780]   how convenient or inconvenient it is,
[02:07:25.780 --> 02:07:28.120]   like if we're well fed, it's pretty easy to go out
[02:07:28.120 --> 02:07:30.300]   and gather and distribute food for others.
[02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:33.820]   But if we're hungry, we tend to focus on our own hunger.
[02:07:33.820 --> 02:07:38.220]   - So first, you know, in full disclosure,
[02:07:38.220 --> 02:07:40.380]   even though I'm studying empathy and compassion,
[02:07:40.380 --> 02:07:42.160]   I can look in the mirror and say,
[02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:45.360]   I probably don't practice it nearly as much as I should.
[02:07:45.360 --> 02:07:46.680]   I'm thinking of your example.
[02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:48.980]   If I was late for a plane,
[02:07:48.980 --> 02:07:51.180]   I'm not sure I would stop and help somebody.
[02:07:51.180 --> 02:07:52.020]   And I'm not saying that--
[02:07:52.020 --> 02:07:53.500]   - I guess it depends on what sort of suffering.
[02:07:53.500 --> 02:07:54.340]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:07:54.340 --> 02:07:56.180]   - I mean, if they're hemorrhaging on the side of the road,
[02:07:56.180 --> 02:07:57.020]   we all would. - Of course, of course.
[02:07:57.020 --> 02:07:58.940]   - But if I'm tired, right, you might think,
[02:07:58.940 --> 02:08:00.740]   oh goodness, like, do I have time for this?
[02:08:00.740 --> 02:08:01.580]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:08:01.580 --> 02:08:03.520]   And so I'm not proud of that statement.
[02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:05.040]   But back to your question.
[02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:09.640]   Yes, I think absolutely we can design experiments
[02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:13.640]   where after we've established the basic phenomenology,
[02:08:13.640 --> 02:08:17.880]   then we can take our subject, animal or mouse,
[02:08:17.880 --> 02:08:21.360]   and put it into certain circumstances.
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:23.240]   If it's hungry itself,
[02:08:23.240 --> 02:08:25.600]   will it work as hard to give another animal?
[02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:26.920]   I mean, it's a good question
[02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:28.900]   because I'm not sure what the outcome will be.
[02:08:28.900 --> 02:08:30.800]   One could predict it might work harder
[02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:34.160]   because it understands the hunger, in quotes, more.
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:36.540]   - I love that answer. - Or it could be,
[02:08:36.540 --> 02:08:39.480]   of course it's not gonna work hard for another animal
[02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:42.680]   to get a food reward because it's starving itself
[02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:45.040]   and it needs to take care of itself first.
[02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:46.040]   It's a great question.
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:48.220]   We're also asking questions about,
[02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:50.920]   do you have to know your buddy mouse, right?
[02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:53.740]   Do you, is it, are you more likely to behave
[02:08:53.740 --> 02:08:56.400]   in a generous or compassionate way
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:08:59.260]   if you grew up with that mouse, you know,
[02:08:59.260 --> 02:09:03.960]   in the way our mice grow up in academic environments?
[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:07.300]   And if it's a stranger, how will you behave?
[02:09:07.300 --> 02:09:09.200]   How will you behave if you had a fight
[02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:11.360]   with that mouse previously?
[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:14.960]   And what if you had, and it also matters,
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:18.760]   did you win the fight or did you lose the fight, right?
[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:21.760]   Intuitively, as we probably would all guess,
[02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:23.520]   I'm more likely to help somebody
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:26.840]   I defeated in a fight previously
[02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:31.400]   because I'm the, in the hierarchy, I'm the dominant one.
[02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:34.920]   I'm probably less likely if that person beat me up.
[02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:37.160]   So all these are great questions.
[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:39.480]   I think we can study them.
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:41.720]   I also think there are ways we can study
[02:09:41.720 --> 02:09:45.260]   these kinds of interactions in human subjects.
[02:09:45.260 --> 02:09:47.120]   Not that I am gonna do that myself.
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:48.220]   - But someone at Stanford will.
[02:09:48.220 --> 02:09:49.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:51.120]   So I think there's also an opportunity,
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:53.920]   and I'm happy to discuss how neuromodulators,
[02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:56.080]   like in particular serotonin,
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:09:59.000]   but also perhaps dopamine and oxytocin
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.960]   may influence the brain, the circuitry
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:04.760]   and the brain mechanisms that are mediating
[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:07.680]   what I term empathic behaviors.
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:09.040]   - Let's return to autism.
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:09.880]   - Right.
[02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:14.760]   - Does autism involve a lack of empathy?
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:18.900]   Does autism involve a restructuring of the reward system
[02:10:18.900 --> 02:10:21.260]   around social interactions?
[02:10:21.260 --> 02:10:24.160]   Maybe considering the second question first,
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:25.880]   I could imagine, for instance,
[02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:28.480]   that there are variations in brain wiring
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:31.840]   that would make it such that a kid
[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:35.520]   who then becomes an adult gets a tremendous amount of reward
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:40.240]   from, I don't know, math, designing mugs,
[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:43.040]   any number of activities,
[02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:46.740]   but that through some variation in brain wiring,
[02:10:46.740 --> 02:10:49.640]   social interaction, spending time with friends
[02:10:49.640 --> 02:10:51.480]   is just not as socially rewarding.
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:54.360]   It just doesn't feel good in the moment,
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:56.240]   doesn't necessarily feel bad,
[02:10:56.240 --> 02:10:59.040]   but it's not selected for.
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:01.840]   And is there any evidence that that's the case
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:06.120]   in children who are classified as autistic
[02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:07.120]   or having autism?
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:10.000]   - I wanna be clear.
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:14.080]   I am not a world expert on pathophysiology
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:17.200]   of individuals with autism spectrum disorder.
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:18.920]   I have read some of the literature.
[02:11:18.920 --> 02:11:23.200]   I do study mouse models
[02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:26.600]   of genetically-based autism spectrum disorder.
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:28.200]   So the answer is yes.
[02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:31.120]   There have been imaging studies.
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:34.320]   And again, so your audience,
[02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:37.100]   certain members of your audience, don't get mad.
[02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:39.200]   Remember our earlier conversation,
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:42.720]   we made the point that autism spectrum disorder
[02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:47.720]   is a highly heterogeneous set of behavioral symptoms
[02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:53.160]   with wide variation in how these symptoms manifest
[02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:54.560]   in each individual.
[02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:58.040]   So we cannot make blanket statements
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:03.040]   that individuals with autism spectrum disorder
[02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:04.720]   are this or that.
[02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:08.600]   But there are studies, both in human beings and mice,
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:12.400]   that suggest that the reinforcing component
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:17.400]   of a social interaction is much less or lacking
[02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:22.280]   in our models of autism spectrum disorder
[02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:24.280]   and certain individuals.
[02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:29.280]   An important point is, is that just genetically wired?
[02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:34.620]   Was that because in their early experiences,
[02:12:34.620 --> 02:12:38.000]   they weren't able to get the sensory stimuli
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:42.100]   that tell them this is a reinforcing social experience?
[02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:44.960]   Unknown, or at least those are topics
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:47.260]   that I think are worthy of investigation.
[02:12:47.260 --> 02:12:53.340]   Do individuals or mice with autism spectrum disorder
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:57.320]   lack or do not have the capacity
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:00.640]   or the same experience of empathy?
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:03.960]   Again, a very complex topic in question.
[02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:08.760]   And it's very likely for some individuals,
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:13.080]   the answer is yes, meaning they do lack
[02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:15.540]   some of the neuro mechanisms that allow them,
[02:13:15.540 --> 02:13:18.120]   but that probably doesn't apply to everybody.
[02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:23.120]   I can say in our mouse models of social mechanisms,
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:26.680]   of social interactions, and our mouse models
[02:13:26.680 --> 02:13:31.680]   of in quotes, empathy, in these are mice show deficits.
[02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:40.140]   And those deficits can be rescued, meaning improved upon,
[02:13:40.140 --> 02:13:44.440]   by manipulations of certain neuromodulatory systems,
[02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:47.060]   in this case, the serotonin system,
[02:13:47.060 --> 02:13:52.060]   by giving drugs, including a drug called MDMA or ecstasy,
[02:13:53.020 --> 02:13:56.280]   so I hope I'm answering your question.
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:14:01.280]   I think these are worthwhile subjects for investigation.
[02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:08.680]   I think there's a lot of value in studying them.
[02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:11.920]   - Let's go back to serotonin in the nucleus accumbens.
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:13.920]   We will get into this in a bit more detail
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:16.600]   when we discuss MDMA, but I've now spent a lot of time
[02:14:16.600 --> 02:14:19.200]   with a recent paper of yours that really parsed--
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:21.200]   - Really, which one, the MDMA paper?
[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:22.960]   The Boris Heifetz one?
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:26.960]   - Yeah, that parsed the relative roles of dopamine
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:28.880]   in the nucleus accumbens versus serotonin
[02:14:28.880 --> 02:14:29.720]   in the nucleus accumbens.
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:33.280]   By the way, folks, by the time this episode comes out,
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:36.820]   an episode all about MDMA itself and its modes of action
[02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:39.600]   will have already aired, and you can find that,
[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:41.500]   but even if you haven't heard that,
[02:14:41.500 --> 02:14:44.000]   MDMA is an amazing molecule
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:47.400]   because it profoundly increases dopamine,
[02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:50.320]   and that's why the word methamphetamine
[02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:52.500]   is actually in MDMA.
[02:14:52.500 --> 02:14:55.220]   Still a surprise to many people to hear that,
[02:14:55.220 --> 02:14:59.640]   but it also robustly increases serotonin transmission,
[02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:02.520]   and what I love about the paper from your lab
[02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:06.300]   that explored this is that, at least by my read of the data,
[02:15:06.300 --> 02:15:10.400]   it showed very convincingly that it's serotonin released
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:12.160]   in the nucleus accumbens that's responsible
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:14.340]   for the prosocial effects of MDMA,
[02:15:14.340 --> 02:15:17.360]   whereas oxytocin, this thing we talked about earlier
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:19.560]   that everyone assumes is the pair bonding molecule,
[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:22.640]   the molecule of love, both in humans now,
[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:23.600]   there's a study in humans,
[02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:25.760]   and in the mouse work that you've done,
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:28.240]   doesn't seem to play as prominent a role
[02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:32.800]   in the social enhancement that MDMA causes,
[02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:35.440]   and the reason I'm asking this in the context of autism
[02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:38.800]   is that, for a long time, there was excitement
[02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:41.280]   about the idea that oxytocin nasal sprays
[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:43.720]   might make autistic kids more excited
[02:15:43.720 --> 02:15:45.580]   about social interactions,
[02:15:45.580 --> 02:15:48.040]   more tuned to social interactions.
[02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:50.340]   First question is, is there any evidence
[02:15:50.340 --> 02:15:54.200]   that increasing oxytocin in a child or adult with autism
[02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:55.960]   makes them somehow more social
[02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:59.080]   or desiring more social connections?
[02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:00.320]   I'm not aware of any.
[02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:05.320]   - I don't think the, I think it is a worthwhile,
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:10.080]   it has been studied, I don't think we can close the door
[02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:14.200]   on the potential therapeutic uses of oxytocin.
[02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:17.720]   From the people I know who are much more expert in this
[02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:21.040]   than I am, I think most of the clinical trials
[02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:23.020]   have been pretty disappointing,
[02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:27.080]   with a lot of hope that intranasal oxytocin
[02:16:27.080 --> 02:16:32.080]   would promote more positive prosocial experiences.
[02:16:32.080 --> 02:16:33.900]   I don't think the door is shut yet.
[02:16:33.900 --> 02:16:38.900]   There may be different ways of administering it.
[02:16:38.900 --> 02:16:43.760]   There may be ways of making a different type of oxytocin
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:45.880]   that might be beneficial.
[02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:48.240]   I have a colleague at Stanford
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:50.980]   who's actually looking at a related neuropeptide
[02:16:50.980 --> 02:16:52.640]   called vasopressin,
[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:57.280]   and she's finding some potential benefit from that.
[02:16:57.280 --> 02:16:59.040]   And vasopressin and oxytocin
[02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:01.280]   are closely related to each other.
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:04.360]   They can even activate some of the same,
[02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:06.680]   what we call receptors in the brain.
[02:17:06.680 --> 02:17:10.840]   So I don't think the door is closed on the possibility
[02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:15.840]   of oxytocin or related therapeutic agents.
[02:17:16.600 --> 02:17:19.440]   Having some therapeutic potential.
[02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:22.760]   The evidence, as far as I'm aware, is not there yet.
[02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:27.760]   In terms of MDMA, again, complicated story.
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:32.320]   As you pointed out, MDMA,
[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:36.920]   it's major molecular targets,
[02:17:36.920 --> 02:17:39.160]   don't wanna get too technical here,
[02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:43.160]   are the serotonin vacuum cleaner,
[02:17:43.160 --> 02:17:47.600]   the molecule that vacuums up serotonin,
[02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:50.640]   and the dopamine vacuum cleaner,
[02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:55.640]   the molecule that vacuums up and, excuse my language,
[02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:59.240]   sucks up dopamine when it's released.
[02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:04.180]   And because it's an amphetamine derivative,
[02:18:04.180 --> 02:18:06.680]   as you correctly pointed out,
[02:18:06.680 --> 02:18:10.380]   it not only prevents these proteins, we call them,
[02:18:10.380 --> 02:18:12.900]   these molecules, these vacuum cleaners,
[02:18:12.900 --> 02:18:16.300]   from vacuuming up the dopamine and serotonin
[02:18:16.300 --> 02:18:19.620]   when it's released, it actually causes it,
[02:18:19.620 --> 02:18:21.020]   I don't wanna use the term,
[02:18:21.020 --> 02:18:23.840]   the terminals to vomit out dopamine and serotonin.
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:25.200]   - That's what I say on the--
[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:26.040]   - All right, is that, am I allowed to say that?
[02:18:26.040 --> 02:18:27.520]   - When I talk about synaptic release,
[02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:29.800]   I'm known for, in my solo episodes,
[02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:31.240]   when I talk about synaptic release,
[02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:34.180]   I'll say that they, bleh, they vomited out.
[02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:35.780]   - So what amphetamine derivative--
[02:18:35.780 --> 02:18:37.220]   - But you worked on synaptic transmission,
[02:18:37.220 --> 02:18:38.960]   so that's almost an insult to a biologist
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:39.800]   that works on synaptic transmission.
[02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:40.620]   - No, no, not at all.
[02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:41.780]   What MDMA does is it actually calls
[02:18:41.780 --> 02:18:43.500]   what's known as a reverse transport.
[02:18:43.500 --> 02:18:45.940]   It actually causes, it not only prevents
[02:18:45.940 --> 02:18:49.080]   the vacuum cleaners from sucking up
[02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:50.840]   the dopamine and serotonin,
[02:18:50.840 --> 02:18:53.960]   it causes it to spew out dopamine and serotonin.
[02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:56.620]   So imagine if your vacuum cleaner started,
[02:18:56.620 --> 02:18:58.960]   the pressure in your vacuum cleaner reversed
[02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:02.360]   and all the dirt you collected started being spewed out.
[02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:04.400]   Now the one difference for MDMA,
[02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:08.500]   and it's a fascinating topic I hope we have time
[02:19:08.500 --> 02:19:13.500]   to talk about, is why does MDMA qualitatively for most people
[02:19:13.500 --> 02:19:19.120]   give human subjects a different experience
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:22.080]   than cocaine or meth, or especially methamphetamine?
[02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:24.440]   - Presumably it's the fact that there's so much serotonin.
[02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:25.280]   - Exactly.
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:29.000]   And so if you actually get, and this is why,
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:32.840]   for your audiences, this is why hardcore molecular science
[02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:36.580]   can actually teach us something about
[02:19:36.580 --> 02:19:39.280]   complex human behavioral phenomena,
[02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:43.780]   such as social interactions and addiction.
[02:19:43.780 --> 02:19:46.080]   At least the hypothesis we propose,
[02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:48.800]   and others in the field, it's not just,
[02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:51.040]   science is not done in isolation.
[02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:53.060]   So I wanna give credit where credit is due.
[02:19:53.060 --> 02:19:54.880]   We did not define the following,
[02:19:54.880 --> 02:19:59.880]   that MDMA affects the serotonin system
[02:19:59.880 --> 02:20:03.000]   more than the dopamine system.
[02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.640]   So it's not 50/50.
[02:20:05.640 --> 02:20:08.500]   Maybe it's 70/30, 80/20,
[02:20:08.500 --> 02:20:12.480]   and that's because the molecule itself of MDMA,
[02:20:12.480 --> 02:20:15.100]   again, I'm trying not to use language,
[02:20:15.100 --> 02:20:18.280]   it binds to, it has a higher affinity.
[02:20:18.280 --> 02:20:20.820]   It likes to bind to and influence
[02:20:20.820 --> 02:20:22.880]   the serotonin vacuum cleaner
[02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:25.160]   more than the dopamine vacuum cleaner.
[02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:28.460]   It's still affecting both, but it's not 50/50.
[02:20:28.460 --> 02:20:33.460]   It's more, whatever, 70% serotonin, 30% dopamine.
[02:20:34.980 --> 02:20:39.980]   And then it does influence oxytocin in very complex ways,
[02:20:39.980 --> 02:20:44.860]   which is a further technical discussion.
[02:20:44.860 --> 02:20:48.860]   It was just a nice paper that came out
[02:20:48.860 --> 02:20:51.560]   that reported that serotonin release
[02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:53.760]   in a hypothalamic structure,
[02:20:53.760 --> 02:20:55.540]   which again, the hypothalamus,
[02:20:55.540 --> 02:20:58.160]   you can explain to your listeners.
[02:20:58.160 --> 02:21:00.960]   - Marble-ish size structure above the roof of your mouth,
[02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:04.040]   responsible for sex temperature control,
[02:21:04.040 --> 02:21:07.040]   feeding and satiety, and a bunch of other things critical.
[02:21:07.040 --> 02:21:12.680]   - And it's a home of neurons that produce oxytocin.
[02:21:12.680 --> 02:21:16.280]   So this paper reported that when serotonin is released
[02:21:16.280 --> 02:21:18.040]   in the hypothalamus, it activates
[02:21:18.040 --> 02:21:20.420]   and causes the release of oxytocin.
[02:21:20.420 --> 02:21:21.620]   That's in the hypothalamus.
[02:21:21.620 --> 02:21:26.620]   Our work in the reward circuitry suggested oxytocin,
[02:21:26.620 --> 02:21:30.060]   so that's serotonin upstream of oxytocin
[02:21:30.060 --> 02:21:33.100]   in the hypothalamus, where we were looking
[02:21:33.100 --> 02:21:35.500]   in the accumbens, it was the opposite.
[02:21:35.500 --> 02:21:38.740]   Oxytocin caused the release of serotonin.
[02:21:38.740 --> 02:21:40.480]   So the point to your listeners is,
[02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:42.640]   the brain's unfortunately complicated.
[02:21:42.640 --> 02:21:43.840]   - It's tractable.
[02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:45.240]   - It's tractable.
[02:21:45.240 --> 02:21:49.140]   We like to come up with general hypotheses and principles,
[02:21:49.140 --> 02:21:51.380]   but sometimes the devil's in the details
[02:21:51.380 --> 02:21:53.620]   and we really need to probe deeper.
[02:21:53.620 --> 02:21:57.620]   So back to your question about our previous paper
[02:21:57.620 --> 02:21:59.620]   and dopamine and serotonin.
[02:21:59.620 --> 02:22:04.620]   So what we proposed, which is far from nailed down,
[02:22:04.620 --> 02:22:10.440]   is that MDMA, because it is an amphetamine derivative,
[02:22:10.440 --> 02:22:12.840]   does influence dopamine release
[02:22:12.840 --> 02:22:15.900]   and the dopamine system.
[02:22:15.900 --> 02:22:20.060]   And some of my colleagues in the MDMA field,
[02:22:20.060 --> 02:22:23.260]   who I respect enormously, don't like me to say this,
[02:22:23.260 --> 02:22:24.980]   but I'm gonna say it anyhow.
[02:22:24.980 --> 02:22:29.340]   Remember earlier in the podcast,
[02:22:29.340 --> 02:22:31.300]   we talked about different substances
[02:22:31.300 --> 02:22:33.580]   having addictive liabilities.
[02:22:33.580 --> 02:22:36.640]   It doesn't mean a substance is automatically addictive,
[02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:40.300]   doesn't mean it's automatically not, it's a continuum.
[02:22:40.300 --> 02:22:44.700]   And I would argue that MDMA does have
[02:22:44.700 --> 02:22:47.220]   some addictive liability,
[02:22:47.220 --> 02:22:49.460]   because it is an amphetamine derivative.
[02:22:49.460 --> 02:22:50.300]   - It feels good.
[02:22:50.300 --> 02:22:51.260]   - And it feels good.
[02:22:51.260 --> 02:22:55.260]   And so there are individuals that especially,
[02:22:55.260 --> 02:22:56.860]   as your listeners may know,
[02:22:56.860 --> 02:22:59.700]   MDMA has gotten a lot of attention
[02:22:59.700 --> 02:23:01.560]   because it's in a therapeutic trial
[02:23:01.560 --> 02:23:06.380]   that looks very promising as an adjunct to psychotherapy
[02:23:06.380 --> 02:23:08.500]   for post-traumatic stress disorder.
[02:23:08.500 --> 02:23:11.620]   And the FDA, the part of our government
[02:23:11.620 --> 02:23:16.500]   that approves or disapproves the legal distribution
[02:23:16.500 --> 02:23:18.180]   of therapeutic drugs,
[02:23:18.180 --> 02:23:21.880]   may end up approving MDMA for certain uses.
[02:23:21.880 --> 02:23:26.620]   The point being is that if it gets approved,
[02:23:26.620 --> 02:23:30.340]   my personal feeling is it will have some addictive liability.
[02:23:30.340 --> 02:23:35.100]   It also has this very powerful,
[02:23:35.100 --> 02:23:38.840]   what you and I might term, Andrew, a prosocial effect.
[02:23:38.840 --> 02:23:42.860]   Some people even call it an empathogen.
[02:23:42.860 --> 02:23:44.340]   That's a little controversial,
[02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:48.120]   meaning it enhances your capacity for empathy,
[02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:53.100]   to experience the emotional state of another individual,
[02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:56.720]   to want to understand that person's experiences
[02:23:56.720 --> 02:23:58.060]   and emotional state.
[02:23:58.060 --> 02:24:02.740]   And what we've suggested is that the addictive liability
[02:24:02.740 --> 02:24:04.700]   is mostly, although not solely,
[02:24:04.700 --> 02:24:08.340]   being mediated by its actions on the dopamine system,
[02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:11.920]   whereas its positive, more prosocial effects,
[02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:14.980]   and perhaps its empathogenic effects,
[02:24:14.980 --> 02:24:18.980]   are more likely to be mediated by its interactions
[02:24:18.980 --> 02:24:23.340]   with the serotonin system in this reward circuitry.
[02:24:23.340 --> 02:24:25.840]   And we're actually doing a lot of work
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:28.080]   to test that hypothesis.
[02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:31.180]   We're actually testing MDMA
[02:24:31.180 --> 02:24:35.380]   in these behavioral models of empathy in mice.
[02:24:35.380 --> 02:24:39.920]   And it looks like our hypothesis is being supported.
[02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:44.020]   The other thing, just to drive your listeners crazy
[02:24:44.020 --> 02:24:47.860]   about, sorry, listeners, how complex the brain is,
[02:24:47.860 --> 02:24:48.700]   if you think--
[02:24:48.700 --> 02:24:50.580]   - Well, neither you nor I were consulted
[02:24:50.580 --> 02:24:53.220]   at the design phase, and so we don't have to apologize
[02:24:53.220 --> 02:24:54.460]   for the brain's complexity.
[02:24:54.460 --> 02:24:56.960]   - Because I don't, trust me, as a scientist,
[02:24:56.960 --> 02:24:59.740]   I wish I could keep things as simple as possible.
[02:24:59.740 --> 02:25:01.480]   That's what good science is.
[02:25:01.480 --> 02:25:05.780]   It turns out the serotonin is produced by neurons
[02:25:05.780 --> 02:25:07.780]   in another part of the brain,
[02:25:07.780 --> 02:25:11.920]   with this wonderful name called the dorsoraphane nucleus.
[02:25:11.920 --> 02:25:15.140]   And it turns out the serotonin neurons
[02:25:15.140 --> 02:25:17.140]   talk to the dopamine neurons.
[02:25:18.260 --> 02:25:20.820]   And influence the dopamine neurons.
[02:25:20.820 --> 02:25:24.880]   And so it's, again, the point we made earlier
[02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:28.700]   in your podcast, even though it's fun and useful,
[02:25:28.700 --> 02:25:32.020]   both for your listeners and as scientists,
[02:25:32.020 --> 02:25:35.600]   to think about these powerful chemical messengers
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:39.440]   in isolation, because that's how we can make progress
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:43.500]   scientifically, it's how your audience can understand
[02:25:43.500 --> 02:25:46.660]   some of the concepts that have been elucidated
[02:25:46.660 --> 02:25:50.580]   from brain research over the decades.
[02:25:50.580 --> 02:25:52.860]   But they don't work in isolation.
[02:25:52.860 --> 02:25:54.260]   They influence each other,
[02:25:54.260 --> 02:25:56.280]   they communicate with each other.
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:59.260]   We're actually doing studies showing that
[02:25:59.260 --> 02:26:01.100]   serotonin release in the accumbens
[02:26:01.100 --> 02:26:03.220]   actually modulates dopamine release,
[02:26:03.220 --> 02:26:06.120]   so it gets crazy complicated.
[02:26:06.120 --> 02:26:09.440]   But you can still develop simplistic hypotheses,
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:12.020]   like as I was saying about MDMA,
[02:26:12.020 --> 02:26:14.800]   where, you know, abuse, addictive liability,
[02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:17.960]   and some of its reinforcing qualities,
[02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:19.600]   which you just mentioned, MDMA,
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:22.200]   a lot of people find it fun to take it,
[02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:26.560]   is probably mostly being mediated via the dopamine system,
[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:28.560]   and some of its social effects
[02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:32.800]   are being mediated by the serotonin system.
[02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:34.600]   We're actually doing studies to figure out
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:39.360]   whether the reinforcing component of a social experience
[02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:42.860]   requires that dopamine release, probably does.
[02:26:42.860 --> 02:26:44.620]   - That's what I'm most interested in, really,
[02:26:44.620 --> 02:26:45.940]   in the context of MDMA.
[02:26:45.940 --> 02:26:46.920]   And we should just mention,
[02:26:46.920 --> 02:26:51.060]   'cause we do like to mention these caveats,
[02:26:51.060 --> 02:26:53.340]   yes, and I can say this 'cause I participated
[02:26:53.340 --> 02:26:56.420]   in a trial with MDMA, it is a very pleasant experience.
[02:26:56.420 --> 02:26:57.820]   It's certainly not for everybody.
[02:26:57.820 --> 02:27:00.340]   It still is a schedule one drug at this moment.
[02:27:00.340 --> 02:27:01.260]   - Absolutely.
[02:27:01.260 --> 02:27:04.420]   - So you can go to jail for possessing or selling it.
[02:27:04.420 --> 02:27:07.060]   In fact, there was a big bust recently in Canada
[02:27:07.060 --> 02:27:08.760]   and another one in Brussels.
[02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:11.580]   Large amounts of MDMA collected.
[02:27:11.580 --> 02:27:13.340]   Those people are probably gonna go to prison
[02:27:13.340 --> 02:27:14.520]   for a long period of time.
[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:17.860]   So you don't want to take it or possess it.
[02:27:17.860 --> 02:27:19.160]   It's illegal.
[02:27:19.160 --> 02:27:20.460]   We're talking about clinical trials here,
[02:27:20.460 --> 02:27:23.040]   but also the fentanyl issue.
[02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:24.880]   There's a lot of fentanyl contamination.
[02:27:24.880 --> 02:27:25.720]   - And I was just gonna mention to your listeners-
[02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:27.460]   - So we'd be remiss if we didn't mention.
[02:27:27.460 --> 02:27:28.920]   A lot of people are dying thinking
[02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:30.820]   that they're taking one drug when they're taking another.
[02:27:30.820 --> 02:27:33.260]   So we are not encouraging the use of these,
[02:27:33.260 --> 02:27:36.620]   but I will say that the subjective experience
[02:27:36.620 --> 02:27:38.660]   of MDMA provided it's done
[02:27:38.660 --> 02:27:40.320]   in the appropriate clinical setting,
[02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:43.060]   it's actually MDMA, doesn't contain other things,
[02:27:43.060 --> 02:27:44.560]   dosed correctly, et cetera,
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:47.940]   is a pleasant one for sure.
[02:27:47.940 --> 02:27:52.180]   And my sense is that the dopamine release
[02:27:52.180 --> 02:27:56.540]   is reinforcing the experience that,
[02:27:56.540 --> 02:27:58.720]   the context that serotonin is providing
[02:27:58.720 --> 02:28:00.240]   with the social context.
[02:28:00.240 --> 02:28:02.300]   And the word context there becomes important
[02:28:02.300 --> 02:28:04.080]   when we think about back to the '90s
[02:28:04.080 --> 02:28:05.420]   when there were a lot of raves
[02:28:05.420 --> 02:28:09.060]   and people were also getting, I guess,
[02:28:09.060 --> 02:28:11.280]   positive feedback from the interactions they were having,
[02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:13.460]   dancing all night, partying with friends, et cetera.
[02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:17.060]   I mean, I think that returning to the issue of autism
[02:28:17.060 --> 02:28:18.580]   and the role of serotonin,
[02:28:18.580 --> 02:28:22.860]   so in autism, there seems to be less
[02:28:22.860 --> 02:28:25.220]   of a reinforcement pathway
[02:28:25.220 --> 02:28:27.680]   for certain kinds of social interactions
[02:28:27.680 --> 02:28:29.980]   in some individuals with autism.
[02:28:29.980 --> 02:28:33.700]   And I'm aware that there are some prescription treatments
[02:28:33.700 --> 02:28:36.620]   for autism that capitalize on the serotonergic system
[02:28:36.620 --> 02:28:37.740]   and dopamine system.
[02:28:37.740 --> 02:28:39.420]   So is it fentamine?
[02:28:39.420 --> 02:28:43.920]   To my knowledge, the only FDA approved
[02:28:43.920 --> 02:28:47.900]   pharmacologic therapeutic for individuals
[02:28:47.900 --> 02:28:51.380]   with autism spectrum disorder is actually,
[02:28:51.380 --> 02:28:53.320]   oh God, I'm just blanking.
[02:28:53.320 --> 02:28:55.960]   It's not a serotonergic drug.
[02:28:55.960 --> 02:28:59.020]   I have to look it up.
[02:28:59.020 --> 02:29:02.740]   I wanna say resperidone for agitation.
[02:29:02.740 --> 02:29:06.780]   There is no drug for,
[02:29:08.300 --> 02:29:12.700]   for lack of a better term, the social deficits.
[02:29:12.700 --> 02:29:14.740]   There's no FDA approved drug.
[02:29:14.740 --> 02:29:16.860]   If you look at the literature,
[02:29:16.860 --> 02:29:21.180]   psychiatrists and individuals with good intention
[02:29:21.180 --> 02:29:26.180]   have tested the utility of traditional serotonergic drugs
[02:29:26.180 --> 02:29:29.100]   like Prozac, SSRIs.
[02:29:29.100 --> 02:29:31.580]   There are drugs known as SNRIs,
[02:29:31.580 --> 02:29:33.460]   drugs that influence serotonin release
[02:29:33.460 --> 02:29:35.940]   and another neuromodulator that you know well,
[02:29:35.940 --> 02:29:40.940]   norepinephrine and at least well done clinical trials,
[02:29:40.940 --> 02:29:44.340]   which in my view as an academic are very important.
[02:29:44.340 --> 02:29:46.820]   None of them have showed efficacy.
[02:29:46.820 --> 02:29:49.620]   Having said that, there are several companies
[02:29:49.620 --> 02:29:51.780]   and full disclosure here,
[02:29:51.780 --> 02:29:55.660]   I am the founder of a small biotech
[02:29:55.660 --> 02:29:57.600]   called Map Light Therapeutics.
[02:29:57.600 --> 02:29:59.880]   And I'm not advertising for Map Light.
[02:29:59.880 --> 02:30:02.060]   I'm just doing a full disclosure.
[02:30:02.060 --> 02:30:04.220]   It was founded with Karl Deisseroth,
[02:30:04.220 --> 02:30:06.500]   who you've had on your podcast
[02:30:06.500 --> 02:30:09.580]   and an entrepreneur in San Francisco
[02:30:09.580 --> 02:30:11.040]   named Caroline Nickolich.
[02:30:11.040 --> 02:30:15.220]   And we have the phase two trial.
[02:30:15.220 --> 02:30:18.340]   Phase two trial means it's a safe drug.
[02:30:18.340 --> 02:30:22.380]   We've done all the safety work
[02:30:22.380 --> 02:30:27.380]   and it's a drug that targets a subtype
[02:30:27.380 --> 02:30:30.220]   of receptor for serotonin.
[02:30:30.220 --> 02:30:32.160]   Serotonin works on many different,
[02:30:32.160 --> 02:30:35.100]   I don't know, what word can I use other than receptor?
[02:30:35.100 --> 02:30:37.340]   - No, listeners of this podcast
[02:30:37.340 --> 02:30:38.640]   probably be familiar with receptors.
[02:30:38.640 --> 02:30:41.340]   It's sort of parking spots for molecules.
[02:30:41.340 --> 02:30:45.900]   Yes, the paper I was referencing earlier from your lab,
[02:30:45.900 --> 02:30:48.580]   it talked about serotonin 1B receptors
[02:30:48.580 --> 02:30:50.020]   being particularly important.
[02:30:50.020 --> 02:30:52.640]   - And so the point being is,
[02:30:52.640 --> 02:30:54.940]   I do have an interest in this
[02:30:54.940 --> 02:30:59.900]   on can you use the type of discoveries we've made in mice?
[02:30:59.900 --> 02:31:04.900]   Might it actually have any relevance to human beings,
[02:31:04.900 --> 02:31:07.940]   in particular those who,
[02:31:07.940 --> 02:31:11.900]   some of which have some sort of sociability deficits?
[02:31:11.900 --> 02:31:16.080]   Other companies are pursuing this too.
[02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:20.040]   So MDMA itself, there has been,
[02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:21.380]   I don't know if it's ongoing.
[02:31:21.380 --> 02:31:23.280]   There's a well-known organization.
[02:31:23.280 --> 02:31:27.300]   I don't know if you've ever had anybody from MAPS on this.
[02:31:27.300 --> 02:31:31.140]   The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies.
[02:31:31.140 --> 02:31:34.660]   MAPS deserves a lot of credit for being a pioneer
[02:31:34.660 --> 02:31:38.020]   in saying, in particular with MDMA,
[02:31:38.020 --> 02:31:42.300]   promoting the idea that this drug deserves
[02:31:42.300 --> 02:31:45.880]   rigorous and ethical study.
[02:31:45.880 --> 02:31:48.800]   That's at least my view.
[02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:53.980]   And MAPS, which was founded by a individual
[02:31:53.980 --> 02:31:57.260]   named Rick Doblin, deserves enormous credit
[02:31:57.260 --> 02:32:02.160]   for their 30-year effort to make it allowed and legal
[02:32:02.160 --> 02:32:03.580]   to actually study MDMA.
[02:32:03.580 --> 02:32:06.900]   The point I'm making is I know MAPS and perhaps others
[02:32:06.900 --> 02:32:10.940]   have done some small trials studying MDMA
[02:32:10.940 --> 02:32:15.140]   in individuals, high-functioning individuals
[02:32:15.140 --> 02:32:18.520]   with some form of social anxiety.
[02:32:18.520 --> 02:32:21.500]   I'm saying this because this is public.
[02:32:21.500 --> 02:32:24.500]   There's another company called MindMed,
[02:32:24.500 --> 02:32:28.380]   which is one of the publicly traded psychedelic companies,
[02:32:28.380 --> 02:32:30.280]   and this is on their website.
[02:32:30.280 --> 02:32:34.200]   Full disclosure, I am on their scientific advisory board.
[02:32:34.200 --> 02:32:40.140]   They are gearing up to do a trial of a,
[02:32:40.140 --> 02:32:44.700]   I don't wanna get too technical, of a certain form of MDMA.
[02:32:44.700 --> 02:32:47.020]   There are two different types of MDMA.
[02:32:47.020 --> 02:32:51.940]   They have these horrible names called enantiomers.
[02:32:51.940 --> 02:32:56.940]   So the MDMA that is used for clinical trials at MAPS,
[02:32:56.940 --> 02:33:01.540]   MDMA is a molecule and it has mirror images of itself.
[02:33:01.540 --> 02:33:06.540]   And one has the name R-MDMA and one has the name S-MDMA.
[02:33:06.540 --> 02:33:09.660]   And they're called the enantiomers
[02:33:09.660 --> 02:33:12.300]   because they're mirror images of each other.
[02:33:12.300 --> 02:33:15.580]   And other labs over the years, not my lab,
[02:33:15.580 --> 02:33:19.660]   I deserve no credit for this, have done some studies
[02:33:19.660 --> 02:33:23.780]   to suggest that the S enantiomer
[02:33:23.780 --> 02:33:27.460]   is the one that has a higher interaction
[02:33:27.460 --> 02:33:29.260]   with the dopamine system.
[02:33:29.260 --> 02:33:33.300]   And the R enantiomer has a higher interaction
[02:33:33.300 --> 02:33:35.060]   with the serotonin system.
[02:33:35.060 --> 02:33:36.500]   - Interesting.
[02:33:36.500 --> 02:33:40.740]   - If you look at the literature on autism spectrum disorder
[02:33:40.740 --> 02:33:45.740]   in human subjects, there's a bunch of papers suggesting
[02:33:47.380 --> 02:33:52.180]   serotonergic systems are malfunctioning
[02:33:52.180 --> 02:33:56.260]   in individuals with autism spectrum disorder.
[02:33:56.260 --> 02:34:01.260]   And if you look at reviews I've written or any of my papers,
[02:34:01.260 --> 02:34:03.340]   we probably cite some of the reviews.
[02:34:03.340 --> 02:34:06.020]   - It's clear that serotonin is playing some role
[02:34:06.020 --> 02:34:09.220]   in social interactions, at least in mice
[02:34:09.220 --> 02:34:11.420]   and almost certainly in humans as well.
[02:34:11.420 --> 02:34:14.180]   It's hard to imagine based on data from everything
[02:34:14.180 --> 02:34:16.900]   from SSRIs to neurotoxic lesions of the human brain,
[02:34:16.900 --> 02:34:18.660]   et cetera, that it's not also playing
[02:34:18.660 --> 02:34:19.980]   at least a similar role in humans.
[02:34:19.980 --> 02:34:22.380]   - Right, and I fully agree with that.
[02:34:22.380 --> 02:34:27.380]   And as we were discussing, there's a modestly extensive
[02:34:27.380 --> 02:34:30.780]   clinical literature, meaning literature from human subjects
[02:34:30.780 --> 02:34:35.780]   suggesting that some aspects of brain systems
[02:34:35.780 --> 02:34:41.180]   that utilize serotonin as one of their signaling molecules,
[02:34:41.180 --> 02:34:44.060]   one of their neuromodulatory mechanisms
[02:34:44.060 --> 02:34:47.740]   may not be functioning in some populations
[02:34:47.740 --> 02:34:50.260]   of individuals with autism spectrum disorder.
[02:34:50.260 --> 02:34:53.500]   So based on that, based on my lab's work
[02:34:53.500 --> 02:34:57.900]   on the role of serotonin in modifying reward circuitry,
[02:34:57.900 --> 02:35:00.940]   its role in pro-social behaviors.
[02:35:00.940 --> 02:35:04.860]   And the biggest clue, which I think you would agree
[02:35:04.860 --> 02:35:08.180]   with, Andrew, is this drug, MDMA.
[02:35:08.180 --> 02:35:11.500]   I mean, this is why I am not a druggie myself.
[02:35:11.500 --> 02:35:14.180]   I am a child of the '60s and '70s.
[02:35:14.180 --> 02:35:17.540]   So I did, which means I'm 20 years older than you, Andrew,
[02:35:17.540 --> 02:35:22.100]   I did experiment like everybody of my generation
[02:35:22.100 --> 02:35:25.540]   with psychoactive substances in the '70s.
[02:35:25.540 --> 02:35:29.020]   So I don't wanna lie about my experiences.
[02:35:29.020 --> 02:35:32.180]   I also would say like many neuroscientists,
[02:35:32.180 --> 02:35:35.460]   my experiences with psychoactive substances
[02:35:35.460 --> 02:35:39.540]   stimulated my interest in neuroscience.
[02:35:39.540 --> 02:35:41.660]   How do these substances work?
[02:35:41.660 --> 02:35:45.620]   Why, when I was a young kid,
[02:35:45.620 --> 02:35:49.980]   the first time I got drunk on beer, why is that happening?
[02:35:49.980 --> 02:35:54.980]   But more seriously, I use drugs in my research
[02:35:54.980 --> 02:35:59.220]   as powerful probes of brain function
[02:35:59.220 --> 02:36:01.180]   with the advantage that,
[02:36:01.180 --> 02:36:05.540]   and now I'm talking scientist to scientist with you, Andrew,
[02:36:05.540 --> 02:36:09.740]   they have molecular targets that we can manipulate
[02:36:09.740 --> 02:36:11.260]   in rigorous ways.
[02:36:11.260 --> 02:36:14.580]   We can figure out where in the brain they act
[02:36:14.580 --> 02:36:17.160]   using the modern tools of neuroscience,
[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:20.260]   which your audience may not know about.
[02:36:20.260 --> 02:36:23.700]   I'm saying this to you, conditional knockout mice,
[02:36:23.700 --> 02:36:24.900]   rescue experiments.
[02:36:24.900 --> 02:36:27.420]   We can do all those fancy stuff.
[02:36:27.420 --> 02:36:31.140]   And we can use drugs to study even things
[02:36:31.140 --> 02:36:34.300]   as complicated as empathy.
[02:36:34.300 --> 02:36:37.820]   And I really do believe that it's why I've been interested
[02:36:37.820 --> 02:36:41.780]   in MDMA for decades is there's a clue there.
[02:36:41.780 --> 02:36:46.020]   How does a drug that has molecular targets
[02:36:46.020 --> 02:36:48.660]   in the dopamine neuromodulatory system,
[02:36:48.660 --> 02:36:51.420]   in the serotonin neuromodulatory system
[02:36:51.420 --> 02:36:54.620]   have such a powerful effect,
[02:36:54.620 --> 02:36:59.620]   which is relatively specific on social interactions.
[02:36:59.620 --> 02:37:03.620]   It doesn't make you wanna go eat more donuts.
[02:37:03.620 --> 02:37:08.620]   It doesn't, I don't know, for me, there's a clue there.
[02:37:08.620 --> 02:37:11.420]   There's something really important
[02:37:11.420 --> 02:37:14.840]   from that phenomenological observation
[02:37:14.840 --> 02:37:18.140]   in the human experiences that we can learn from.
[02:37:18.140 --> 02:37:20.260]   - I completely agree about MDMA.
[02:37:20.260 --> 02:37:23.620]   And we've done a couple podcasts about psilocybin
[02:37:23.620 --> 02:37:25.380]   and by extension LSD,
[02:37:25.380 --> 02:37:27.660]   because even though there are differences there,
[02:37:27.660 --> 02:37:30.700]   psilocybin LSD, as far as we understand,
[02:37:30.700 --> 02:37:35.060]   largely work through activation of the serotonin 2A receptor,
[02:37:35.060 --> 02:37:37.340]   broadening of a brain network connectivity.
[02:37:37.340 --> 02:37:40.260]   So again, it's serotonin, serotonin, serotonin,
[02:37:40.260 --> 02:37:42.140]   but different receptors,
[02:37:42.140 --> 02:37:45.840]   very different subjective experience.
[02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:48.100]   And I guess perhaps the best way to describe it
[02:37:48.100 --> 02:37:51.420]   is that LSD and psilocybin are almost always considered
[02:37:51.420 --> 02:37:54.140]   mystical in their subjective effects,
[02:37:54.140 --> 02:37:58.740]   whereas MDMA can be an empathogen, an actogen.
[02:37:58.740 --> 02:38:03.700]   And so serotonin acting through different receptor systems
[02:38:03.700 --> 02:38:04.980]   impacting and creating
[02:38:04.980 --> 02:38:06.540]   very different subjective experiences.
[02:38:06.540 --> 02:38:09.380]   I also agree, I think MDMA is particularly interesting
[02:38:09.380 --> 02:38:10.860]   for the neuroscientist,
[02:38:10.860 --> 02:38:14.120]   perhaps also because at least to my knowledge,
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:18.140]   there is no substance in nature, no plant, no mushroom,
[02:38:18.140 --> 02:38:23.140]   no ergot, no mold that creates this increase
[02:38:23.140 --> 02:38:27.700]   in dopamine and serotonin simultaneously.
[02:38:27.700 --> 02:38:30.060]   MDMA is a synthesized molecule.
[02:38:30.060 --> 02:38:32.460]   And so it may be one of the, again,
[02:38:32.460 --> 02:38:33.880]   highlighting all the safety issues
[02:38:33.880 --> 02:38:34.900]   and things we talked about before,
[02:38:34.900 --> 02:38:38.680]   it may be one of the great, at least experimental probes
[02:38:38.680 --> 02:38:40.900]   of the brain that humans have developed.
[02:38:40.900 --> 02:38:44.260]   And it may be one of the great therapeutic probes
[02:38:44.260 --> 02:38:47.900]   that folks like MAPS are now doing such fantastic work on.
[02:38:47.900 --> 02:38:50.260]   So I'm very excited about what's happening
[02:38:50.260 --> 02:38:51.500]   with the research on MDMA.
[02:38:51.500 --> 02:38:53.500]   And I'm so glad that your laboratory
[02:38:53.500 --> 02:38:56.820]   has parsed some of the relative roles of serotonin
[02:38:56.820 --> 02:38:58.980]   in the receptors involved.
[02:38:58.980 --> 02:39:02.040]   Since we mentioned serotonin 2A for psilocybin and LSD,
[02:39:02.040 --> 02:39:04.620]   we'd be remiss if we didn't say that this wonderful paper
[02:39:04.620 --> 02:39:06.500]   that we will provide a link to in the show note captions,
[02:39:06.500 --> 02:39:08.020]   by the way, folks,
[02:39:08.020 --> 02:39:10.500]   that Rob Malenka here's lab,
[02:39:10.500 --> 02:39:13.540]   it's focused on the serotonin 1B receptor.
[02:39:13.540 --> 02:39:16.620]   So it even just differences in receptor subtypes
[02:39:16.620 --> 02:39:19.340]   leading to profoundly different subjective outcomes.
[02:39:19.340 --> 02:39:24.040]   I find that to be just one of the most important areas
[02:39:24.040 --> 02:39:27.860]   that one could even think about, let alone work on.
[02:39:27.860 --> 02:39:30.060]   - Thank you, I appreciate the compliment.
[02:39:30.060 --> 02:39:33.520]   I will also say, like everything we're finding,
[02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:36.020]   it's not all about only serotonin 1B,
[02:39:36.020 --> 02:39:38.780]   but that's, as you know, there are, again,
[02:39:38.780 --> 02:39:43.780]   pointing to the amazing and powerful complexity
[02:39:43.780 --> 02:39:47.460]   of the human brain or the mammalian brain.
[02:39:47.460 --> 02:39:52.460]   There are 16 different serotonin parking spots or receptors
[02:39:53.300 --> 02:39:57.240]   that are distributed in different brain areas
[02:39:57.240 --> 02:40:00.480]   in complex ways, and so that's daunting,
[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:04.340]   but it also offers possibilities
[02:40:04.340 --> 02:40:07.620]   for developing very novel therapeutic agents
[02:40:07.620 --> 02:40:12.620]   that activate or inhibit these in complex ways,
[02:40:12.620 --> 02:40:14.740]   hopefully for therapeutic benefit.
[02:40:14.740 --> 02:40:17.980]   - So before we conclude, I'm very curious
[02:40:17.980 --> 02:40:22.140]   to get your opinion on what you see as the landscape
[02:40:22.140 --> 02:40:26.040]   of the work on psychedelics and MDMA,
[02:40:26.040 --> 02:40:27.860]   which isn't really a classic psychedelic,
[02:40:27.860 --> 02:40:30.800]   but all these drugs that, as you pointed out,
[02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:33.320]   during your youth were used recreationally
[02:40:33.320 --> 02:40:35.300]   and for mind exploration and expansion
[02:40:35.300 --> 02:40:39.100]   and are now being probed as potential therapeutics
[02:40:39.100 --> 02:40:41.580]   for various mental health challenges,
[02:40:41.580 --> 02:40:44.780]   as well as potentially expanding consciousness,
[02:40:44.780 --> 02:40:46.540]   empathy, and all of that.
[02:40:46.540 --> 02:40:50.420]   I mean, not getting into the details of the legal issues
[02:40:50.420 --> 02:40:52.820]   that have to be overcome, not even necessarily
[02:40:52.820 --> 02:40:54.360]   talking about the clinical trials
[02:40:54.360 --> 02:40:56.500]   or the people doing the work in different laboratories,
[02:40:56.500 --> 02:41:01.260]   but just, I have to imagine this must amuse,
[02:41:01.260 --> 02:41:02.640]   tickle, surprise you.
[02:41:02.640 --> 02:41:05.220]   I mean, how do you feel about what you're seeing now?
[02:41:05.220 --> 02:41:08.980]   Because it is a very exciting time for these compounds.
[02:41:08.980 --> 02:41:11.340]   - It tickles me and excites me
[02:41:11.340 --> 02:41:14.380]   with the appropriate caution.
[02:41:14.380 --> 02:41:18.380]   So I do think drugs are very powerful probes
[02:41:18.380 --> 02:41:19.780]   of brain function.
[02:41:19.780 --> 02:41:21.780]   I think this class of drug,
[02:41:21.780 --> 02:41:23.300]   which as you correctly pointed out,
[02:41:23.300 --> 02:41:27.660]   people use the term psychedelics scientifically
[02:41:27.660 --> 02:41:32.420]   when pursuing their understanding,
[02:41:32.420 --> 02:41:35.940]   their therapeutic potential, their mechanism of action,
[02:41:35.940 --> 02:41:39.560]   it's more useful to divide them up into different categories,
[02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:43.780]   the classic hallucinogens, which are LSD and psilocybin,
[02:41:43.780 --> 02:41:47.020]   the intact or empathogens, which is MDMA,
[02:41:47.020 --> 02:41:50.340]   which is really a qualitatively different drug.
[02:41:50.340 --> 02:41:51.740]   There are other substances,
[02:41:51.740 --> 02:41:53.540]   which we don't have time to talk about,
[02:41:53.540 --> 02:41:55.180]   like Ibogaine and ayahuasca,
[02:41:55.180 --> 02:41:58.160]   which are very complex, and peyote.
[02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:00.980]   But nevertheless, I am tickled and excited
[02:42:00.980 --> 02:42:03.580]   as a child of the '60s and '70s,
[02:42:03.580 --> 02:42:08.460]   but I am also not evangelical
[02:42:08.460 --> 02:42:13.060]   about their use and their therapeutic potential.
[02:42:13.060 --> 02:42:15.780]   So as you can imagine what I'm gonna say,
[02:42:15.780 --> 02:42:19.620]   I think they should be the subject of rigorous,
[02:42:19.620 --> 02:42:24.620]   sophisticated, and most importantly, ethical research.
[02:42:24.620 --> 02:42:29.020]   I think we could learn a lot about how the brain works
[02:42:29.020 --> 02:42:32.780]   and its amazing capabilities.
[02:42:32.780 --> 02:42:36.900]   I think we could, I think they may, notice I say may,
[02:42:36.900 --> 02:42:39.340]   have therapeutic potential,
[02:42:39.340 --> 02:42:43.680]   but I do not think they're gonna be miracle cures.
[02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:47.720]   And I do worry, as somebody who lived through
[02:42:47.720 --> 02:42:52.240]   the '60s and '70s and watched, because of the Leary,
[02:42:52.240 --> 02:42:57.540]   the history with Timothy Leary and his colleagues,
[02:42:57.540 --> 02:43:00.780]   and the political landscape of how
[02:43:00.780 --> 02:43:03.860]   they were being used and promoted,
[02:43:03.860 --> 02:43:08.380]   I am cautious that these substances
[02:43:08.380 --> 02:43:12.700]   need to be studied scientifically and rigorously.
[02:43:12.700 --> 02:43:14.520]   And I hope that's the case.
[02:43:14.520 --> 02:43:17.720]   And I wanna caution your audience
[02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:20.560]   that not everybody should take these substances.
[02:43:20.560 --> 02:43:22.440]   They are not miracle cures.
[02:43:22.440 --> 02:43:25.760]   And while they certainly may be of benefit
[02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:27.880]   to certain individuals who are suffering,
[02:43:27.880 --> 02:43:32.880]   and they certainly may provide unusual
[02:43:32.880 --> 02:43:35.680]   and in quotes, mystical experiences
[02:43:35.680 --> 02:43:37.700]   for certain individuals,
[02:43:38.560 --> 02:43:43.160]   I am very concerned that there are individuals out there
[02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:46.320]   that will gain access to these substances
[02:43:46.320 --> 02:43:48.800]   and have very bad experiences.
[02:43:48.800 --> 02:43:50.900]   Because anybody who grew up in the '60s and '70s
[02:43:50.900 --> 02:43:53.500]   knows all about bad trips.
[02:43:53.500 --> 02:43:58.500]   And truth be told, I have had a bad trip or two in the '70s.
[02:43:58.500 --> 02:44:02.740]   And I'm glad I did, because it made me,
[02:44:02.740 --> 02:44:07.600]   I have no idea what a suicidal depression feels like,
[02:44:07.600 --> 02:44:11.000]   where you are experiencing such a darkness,
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:15.580]   such a lack of hope that a rational decision
[02:44:15.580 --> 02:44:18.120]   is to end one's life.
[02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:21.360]   And I think the closest I ever came to that experience
[02:44:21.360 --> 02:44:23.820]   is a bad trip on LSD.
[02:44:23.820 --> 02:44:26.940]   And I do have concerns that if you look
[02:44:26.940 --> 02:44:29.520]   at the clinical trials that have been done,
[02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:32.680]   the well could be done, not the anecdotal.
[02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:35.640]   I went and saw some psychedelic therapist
[02:44:35.640 --> 02:44:37.400]   that a friend recommended.
[02:44:37.400 --> 02:44:39.900]   And it did wonders for me.
[02:44:39.900 --> 02:44:42.200]   But the well-controlled clinical trials
[02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:44.640]   that are being done by certain biotechs,
[02:44:44.640 --> 02:44:48.920]   some academic institutions, they have very strict
[02:44:48.920 --> 02:44:54.240]   what are known as inclusionary and exclusionary criteria
[02:44:54.240 --> 02:44:57.600]   about who is allowed to participate in the subject.
[02:44:57.600 --> 02:45:00.440]   And they rule out a lot of people.
[02:45:00.440 --> 02:45:02.840]   So I don't mean to be overly cautious,
[02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:07.840]   but I do worry that if some people
[02:45:07.840 --> 02:45:11.360]   take these substances and bad things happen,
[02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:15.600]   it will slow down the excitement that's currently happening.
[02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:17.980]   And it will make it more difficult
[02:45:17.980 --> 02:45:21.700]   for serious human subjects researchers,
[02:45:21.700 --> 02:45:25.040]   preclinical researchers, to study these substances
[02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:27.480]   in the way they deserve to be studied.
[02:45:28.500 --> 02:45:33.500]   So I hope that articulates my viewpoint.
[02:45:33.500 --> 02:45:36.140]   - I think it does.
[02:45:36.140 --> 02:45:37.620]   And thank you for that viewpoint.
[02:45:37.620 --> 02:45:39.460]   It's an important counterbalance
[02:45:39.460 --> 02:45:42.060]   on a lot of the excitement that we hear about these days.
[02:45:42.060 --> 02:45:46.220]   I think the state of Kentucky just recently decided
[02:45:46.220 --> 02:45:51.000]   to give $42 million from the opioid lawsuit settlement
[02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:55.020]   with Purdue Pharmaceuticals to the study of Ibogaine.
[02:45:55.020 --> 02:45:57.660]   So there's a lot happening here.
[02:45:57.660 --> 02:46:00.860]   Just to be clear, I think there's no problem with that.
[02:46:00.860 --> 02:46:03.080]   And I actually would support that
[02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:07.420]   as long as the studies of Ibogaine
[02:46:07.420 --> 02:46:12.180]   are done thoughtfully, carefully, and ethically.
[02:46:12.180 --> 02:46:15.220]   I see no problem with testing its efficacy
[02:46:15.220 --> 02:46:20.140]   in certain mental illnesses and addiction.
[02:46:20.140 --> 02:46:23.500]   And it's actually a topic I know a little bit about
[02:46:23.500 --> 02:46:25.860]   that we'll save that for another time.
[02:46:25.860 --> 02:46:29.580]   - Right, well, first off, I want to thank you
[02:46:29.580 --> 02:46:32.900]   for coming here and sharing your knowledge with all of us.
[02:46:32.900 --> 02:46:35.380]   For me, it's been a real thrill.
[02:46:35.380 --> 02:46:37.660]   And I also just want to thank you
[02:46:37.660 --> 02:46:39.260]   for the incredible amount of work
[02:46:39.260 --> 02:46:40.300]   that you've done over the years.
[02:46:40.300 --> 02:46:41.620]   I know it's still ongoing.
[02:46:41.620 --> 02:46:43.860]   You're by no means retiring.
[02:46:43.860 --> 02:46:44.820]   - Who knows, who knows?
[02:46:44.820 --> 02:46:45.960]   - I certainly hope not.
[02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:50.380]   But I'm sure the listeners have now a clear picture
[02:46:50.380 --> 02:46:52.500]   of the enormous number of contributions
[02:46:52.500 --> 02:46:54.220]   and areas you've worked everywhere from,
[02:46:54.220 --> 02:46:56.420]   as I mentioned earlier, neuroplasticity
[02:46:56.420 --> 02:46:59.780]   at the cellular level, molecular level, addiction,
[02:46:59.780 --> 02:47:02.800]   work relating to social cognition and social interactions,
[02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:06.740]   rather as it pertains to autism models
[02:47:06.740 --> 02:47:10.140]   and now psychedelics and empathy and on and on.
[02:47:10.140 --> 02:47:12.300]   And again, trained so many prominent scientists
[02:47:12.300 --> 02:47:14.680]   in our field and to take time out of your schedule
[02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:17.780]   to come sit here with us and share some of that knowledge
[02:47:17.780 --> 02:47:19.020]   and stimulate our thinking.
[02:47:19.020 --> 02:47:22.020]   And as you mentioned, raise still more questions
[02:47:22.020 --> 02:47:25.280]   that need to be resolved is a real privilege.
[02:47:25.280 --> 02:47:26.980]   So thank you ever so much.
[02:47:26.980 --> 02:47:28.200]   And indeed, as you just mentioned,
[02:47:28.200 --> 02:47:30.380]   we'd love to have you back again for another conversation.
[02:47:30.380 --> 02:47:34.240]   - All I can say is I want to thank you for having me.
[02:47:34.240 --> 02:47:39.080]   I was a little hesitant or nervous about coming here
[02:47:39.080 --> 02:47:40.860]   and now I want to come back.
[02:47:40.860 --> 02:47:45.460]   So that was a blast when I just did with you
[02:47:45.460 --> 02:47:49.180]   and I'd be happy to continue this conversation anytime.
[02:47:49.180 --> 02:47:51.860]   So thank you for your very sophisticated
[02:47:51.860 --> 02:47:54.520]   and thoughtful questions.
[02:47:54.520 --> 02:47:57.120]   - To be continued. - Yeah, to be continued.
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:47:59.260]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion,
[02:47:59.260 --> 02:48:01.980]   all about neuroplasticity, reward systems,
[02:48:01.980 --> 02:48:05.700]   social connection and empathy with Dr. Robert Malanka.

[02:48:37.700 --> 02:48:39.060]   Not so much on today's episode,
[02:48:39.060 --> 02:48:42.020]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:48:42.020 --> 02:48:43.360]   we discuss supplements.
[02:48:43.360 --> 02:48:45.520]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:47.520]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:50.020]   for things like enhancing sleep, hormone support
[02:48:50.020 --> 02:48:51.780]   and focus and much more.
[02:48:51.780 --> 02:48:53.340]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is partnered
[02:48:53.340 --> 02:48:54.460]   with Momentous Supplements.
[02:48:54.460 --> 02:48:56.300]   If you're interested in learning more about the supplements
[02:48:56.300 --> 02:48:57.880]   discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:48:57.880 --> 02:49:00.380]   please go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S.
[02:49:00.380 --> 02:49:03.160]   That's livemomentous.com/huberman.

[02:49:05.580 --> 02:49:08.220]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:49:08.220 --> 02:49:11.060]   So that means Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:49:11.060 --> 02:49:12.780]   On all those platforms, I post content,
[02:49:12.780 --> 02:49:14.260]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:49:14.260 --> 02:49:15.740]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:49:15.740 --> 02:49:17.900]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:49:17.900 --> 02:49:19.660]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:49:19.660 --> 02:49:20.740]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:49:20.740 --> 02:49:23.740]   to the Huberman Lab Podcast, Neural Network Newsletter.

[02:49:26.200 --> 02:49:29.800]   It is completely zero cost and it includes protocols
[02:49:29.800 --> 02:49:31.960]   or what we call toolkits that you can download.
[02:49:31.960 --> 02:49:34.180]   So for instance, toolkits for enhancing sleep,
[02:49:34.180 --> 02:49:36.380]   a toolkit for learning and neuroplasticity,
[02:49:36.380 --> 02:49:39.040]   toolkits for fitness and for much more.
[02:49:39.040 --> 02:49:41.140]   To sign up for the Neural Network Newsletter,

[02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:50.360]   that we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:52.600]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[02:49:52.600 --> 02:49:54.240]   with Dr. Robert Malenka.
[02:49:54.240 --> 02:49:56.440]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:49:56.440 --> 02:49:58.120]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:49:58.120 --> 02:50:00.700]   [upbeat music]
[02:50:00.700 --> 02:50:03.280]   (upbeat music)
