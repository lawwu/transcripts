[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680]   So we kind of spent the weekend putting together some thoughts about some of the problems we
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.880]   saw and how people were thinking about this and tackling this and I was, I can't believe
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.040]   what happened.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.920]   As you see over half a million people read this thing, which we've never reached that
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.080]   many people with anything before.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.560]   So clearly there's kind of orders of magnitude more interest in what we have to say about
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.560]   COVID-19 in the community than deep learning, so should probably talk about it briefly.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.800]   You know, one of the things we talked about in this, this post is now translated into
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.080]   like 15 languages, thanks to amazing volunteers.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.440]   I did a little Twitter summary of it, I'll mention a couple of the things we said.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.560]   Now that this is eight days old, a lot of this is pretty well understood, but for those
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.360]   people that aren't yet locked down like San Francisco is, you should probably be thinking,
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.440]   acting as if you are, certainly canceling events, getting together with more than 10
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.000]   people, is giving an opportunity to basically kill them and their families, because you
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.800]   don't know if you're infected.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.520]   So work from home if you can, not everybody can, we'll talk a bit about sanitation, it's
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.960]   actually not that easy to do properly.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.440]   Most importantly, a lot of people watching this are in a position of authority, and so
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.120]   I particularly want to talk to you and say, you know, give, provide sick leave, make meetings
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.160]   virtual, cancel events, so make them online.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.240]   You're the folks who can save the most lives, perhaps other than the medical people.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.880]   There are still people saying this is just like the flu, eight days ago, most people
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.560]   seem to be saying that, but the flu has a death rate of about 0.1%.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.920]   The director of the Center for Communicable Diseases at Harvard estimates that for COVID-19
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.440]   it's like 1 or 2%.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.800]   So 10 or 20 times more infectious, we don't know that, but this is a guess from somebody
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.440]   who knows what he's talking about, and it's not, you know, it's somewhat widely accepted
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.560]   amongst epidemiologists, some think it's higher, some think it's lower.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.080]   Other modeling suggested it was 1.6% in China in February.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.920]   So it's much, much more infectious, sorry, much, much more deadly than the flu.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.660]   One of the really terrifying things also is it spreads incredibly quickly.
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.980]   So it's, there's nothing, you know, from an epidemiological point of view there's nothing
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.140]   that suggests anything you understand about the flu is going to help you understand COVID-19.
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.960]   A lot of people say they're basically, their responses don't panic.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.280]   We find that a super unhelpful response.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.320]   It can tend to lead to kind of apathy or hubris.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:11.780]   In China, by the time they were where we US was when we wrote this eight days ago, tens
[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.160]   of millions of people were already on lockdown and two from all these hospitals were built.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.640]   China did this amazing, I mean, they did plenty of wrong things at the start in terms of not
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.920]   actually listening to the whistleblowers and in fact arresting them.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.880]   But then they did an astonishing response, Italy, not so much.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.400]   And at the time we were writing this, they had to go to the point of locking down 16
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.840]   million people too late, we'll talk about more about that in a moment.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.440]   So we don't really know much about anything.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.240]   And for scientists, one of the challenges here is we tend to not like to do things when
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.120]   we don't know anything.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.600]   We demand high levels of evidence and, you know, this is not peer review level stuff.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.080]   But we're not in that world anymore.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.760]   We're in the world of like, what do we know?
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.480]   What don't we know?
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.760]   What's the kind of, from a Bayesian point of view, figure out the priors.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.280]   How likely is it that this thing is true?
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.720]   How likely is it that this is false?
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.480]   What would be the utility impact of doing these two things?
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.820]   Kind of model that out.
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:27.880]   So we need to learn to behave in the, you know, in a kind of an optimal way under uncertainty,
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:36.000]   which is not easy and not very compatible with kind of usual scientific approaches.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.780]   But we can see empirically, you know, what's actually happening in Italy, for example.
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.280]   So we can, we don't have to guess totally about where things will be in 10 days time,
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:57.460]   because we can see what's happening in countries that are 10 days ahead of the US or the UK.
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.880]   One of the horrific things about this we pointed out in our post is that in the US in particular,
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.240]   those impacted are those who can least afford to be.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:16.880]   So the lowest 10% of wage earners in the US of that group only a third have paid sick leave.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.600]   So one of the things that happens in a country like the US that doesn't have very strong,
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:27.560]   to say the least, social safety nets is we force people to go to work and, you know, financially.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:34.080]   And as a result, we force them to spread their possible infection to everybody else at work,
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.280]   which is terrible for the economy and terrible for society.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.600]   So these are some things to be aware of.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.360]   In terms of like, what does this look like?
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.280]   It seems like it's something that people have trouble taking on board emotionally.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.720]   Like this was a, and I'm definitely not hassling this person.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.120]   I want to, you know, this person's been super brave, but I want to point out this guy's
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.960]   a doctor and he was tweeting just at the start of March, "Hey, don't worry about this.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.640]   It's, you know, it's a cold virus.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.320]   He's got to stop this fear mongering.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.720]   This is insanity.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.720]   Come on, guys.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.840]   Look at this in perspective.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.280]   You know, like it's so not deadly.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.200]   Why aren't we panicking about other things?
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.800]   You know, look at all these other things which are much worse than COVID-19."
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.000]   And then, you know, good on him.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.640]   He said, "Ah, my hospital asked physicians to form a response team.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.640]   So I volunteered.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.960]   Let's let you know how it goes."
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.280]   And then, you know, this is a terrifying bit.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.760]   A few days later, oh, I've now seen this.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.800]   And I can tell you in 18 years of medical practice, I've never seen anything like this.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.300]   And if you now look at this, look at this guy's Twitter account, it's full of messages
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.040]   saying take this seriously.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.040]   This is terrifying.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.320]   I've never seen anything like it.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:58.400]   So the different, you know, when you see people on the ground, how they're reacting, I find
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.880]   that pretty powerful.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:12.480]   So, you know, the data, and I'm focusing on the US because I know most of our people watching
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:20.060]   this are in the US, but if you look at somewhere like Italy and you say, "What was Italy looking
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.080]   like in terms of the number of cases on the 23rd of February?"
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.240]   United States on the 5th of March had about the same number of cases.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.760]   And so then if you go a day forward, Italy and United States a day later have a similar
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.480]   number of cases, and another day later they have a similar number of cases, and so forth.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:47.120]   So this is just for Italy and the US, but actually if you draw this graph for most Western nations
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.120]   in kind of cold or temperate climates, it looks exactly the same.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.440]   Everybody is following Italy just by a different number of days.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.920]   And so that means that we know that if we respond in the same way as Italy, we're basically
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.000]   going to follow the same shape.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.440]   So Italy is a very useful role model to understand.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:13.960]   So you know, as data scientists, here's some great data.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:20.880]   So turning that data into reality, here's what people were saying on the 28th of February.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:28.800]   So the 28th of February is here, okay? Italy had 888 cases, the equivalent of the US on
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.080]   the 10th of March.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:35.160]   So you know, tourists are hanging out, people are chilling.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.440]   28th of February.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:48.520]   And then by yesterday, Italy was losing 368 lives in a single day.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.440]   More than China ever lost in a single day.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.960]   Many of those lives being lost in, you know, a fairly small number of locations.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.200]   So what does that look like?
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.640]   I mean, you see it in so many ways.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:11.320]   You see it as, oh, hi folks, I'm sorry, but our president of the medical group just died.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.360]   The director of our training school just died.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.440]   Doctors are dying quickly.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:26.240]   These are pictures from Italy, it's, you know, everybody is just working all the time.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:33.080]   There is not nearly enough beds and doctors are having to make horrific decisions where
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:38.480]   they have to make a judgment call about who is it worth them treating.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:44.160]   Who is too old that it's going to die anyway, they just let them die.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.600]   Who is, anybody under 65, last time I heard was basically not being looked at on the assumption
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.120]   that they should be, you know, that they might be fine.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:10:02.080]   So this is scary.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:08.400]   There are countries that look particularly scary, perhaps the most scary outside of Italy
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.320]   at the moment is the UK.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:17.640]   The Imperial College just released their latest modeling, which actually had some, looks like
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:22.520]   some errors that might have underestimated the number of fatalities.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:32.680]   But even with that, this red bar here represents the total hospital capacity in the UK.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.160]   And these different lines represent the number of people that need hospitalization under
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:45.680]   the assumption of UK does nothing versus UK closes schools and universities versus UK isolates
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:53.840]   cases versus UK isolates cases and quarantines households versus UK isolates cases, quarantines
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.240]   at home and has social distancing.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:03.320]   In every case the difference between the number of people required to be in hospital versus
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.600]   the amount of people that can be in hospital is vast.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.760]   So what does that mean in the UK?
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:19.760]   This is basically showing what percentage of symptomatic cases require hospitalization.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:27.240]   And in the over 50 group, it's well, you know, 1 in 10 to 1 in 4.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:34.000]   And of that group, how many require critical care goes from 1 in 10 to 70%.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.640]   Critical care basically means ventilation, oxygenation.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:44.920]   If you don't get it, I don't know exactly what happens, but the answer seems to be very
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.920]   likely you die.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.120]   I mean, you basically suffocate.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:58.040]   So this is scary stuff and the UK obviously did nothing for too long.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:03.880]   And countries like the Netherlands and Sweden have explicitly made a decision at this point
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:11.120]   to follow the UK's example, even though the UK is now, it was actually the Imperial College
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:16.540]   that did the original incorrect, totally incorrect modeling that caused the incorrect response
[00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.540]   from the UK.
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.960]   It's based on their new modeling.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:25.560]   And so people who are still saying, let's do what the UK did heading in this direction
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.400]   and basing things off totally wrong information.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.480]   Talking of information, it's very hard to be data scientists in this environment because
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.740]   the data is not there.
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:42.360]   In the United States, the number of tests we're doing per million people, 23 compared
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:49.840]   to South Korea, 3,700, things are starting to ramp up now, but it's a huge shortage.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:54.560]   And just to orient on this graph, the blue circles are showing the number of tests and
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:01.360]   the per capita per million and the red circles are showing the population size.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.900]   Thanks, Rachel.
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:11.020]   So one of the things that's really interesting is to look at South Korea and China because
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:16.480]   these are countries that have, you know, a very different experience as you'll see to
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.040]   places like the UK and the US and Italy.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.800]   And so we'll talk about that in a moment.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.620]   In fact, let's look at it now.
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:35.320]   This is from today and you can see we start basically at 0.0 for each country is when
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.520]   they have 10 deaths and then this is the cumulative number of deaths.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.740]   So this is a very lagging indicator from a data point of view.
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:49.480]   This is something that happens along, you know, you've been infected, you've got sick,
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:54.640]   you've gone to hospital, there's hospital beds and eventually if things go badly you
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.640]   die.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:01.480]   So on this very lagging indicator, you can see there's very, very different shapes, right?
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:07.520]   There's the Spain and UK shape, which is still early, but it's just, you can see these shapes
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.600]   once they are on a certain direction, they tend to kind of stick in that direction for
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.880]   quite a while, right?
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:19.760]   And then there's the, where's Italy, here we are, there's the Italy shape, which is pretty
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.740]   similar, not quite as bad, right?
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:27.120]   And we've already talked about where that shape's ended up.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.760]   Iran's kind of similar to Italy.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:35.320]   The US is a pretty big country, pretty spread out.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.320]   So yes, Rachel?
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:41.640]   Oh, your cursor is showing offset from the curves you're talking about.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.640]   Whoa!
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:49.840]   Yeah, it kind of just, it just goes a little slowly, okay.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.840]   So I'm...
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:55.960]   So maybe just focus on the color of the curves you're highlighting?
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.960]   I guess if I kind of sit there, yeah.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:05.760]   Okay, so the pink one, US, I mean you guys can read which one it is, thanks Rachel.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:14.440]   It's a very different geography, so it looks a little different.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.300]   So there's kind of one set.
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:23.320]   On the other hand, look at South Korea and Japan.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:30.760]   Now South Korea is super interesting because they haven't had a lockdown.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.560]   So what's going on there?
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.120]   South Korea has not had a lockdown.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:40.880]   So economically, they're keeping their economy going.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.520]   And you know, for society, they're keeping their society going.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.480]   So studying them seems like a great idea.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.980]   And the things they're doing are very different to at least what the US is doing.
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:16:00.180]   In South Korea, they have massively invested in tests, in testing and in tests.
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:06.960]   So the US is good at investing in things and making things, but currently the US is not
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.800]   investing in that.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.560]   They also are investing in masks.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:19.280]   Everybody is wearing masks in South Korea and anybody who, you know, everybody's getting
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:24.760]   tested regularly and that anybody who's tested with the virus is getting quarantined.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:30.080]   So South Korea is, you know, it's great to look at data, see outliers and figure out
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.800]   what the hell is going on.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.960]   So South Korea is a great outlier.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.000]   You can also see China.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.340]   China has taken their curve and flattened it.
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:49.600]   And they did this by a very early lockdown and also what many would consider draconian
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.740]   measures.
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.280]   So there seems to be a couple of different models we can follow.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:17:00.800]   There's the lots of masks, lots of tests model of South Korea or there's the kind of major
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.800]   lockdowns.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:09.800]   But China is now at the point where they are, the disease is not really spreading anymore
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:18.440]   and they're starting to remove the lockdowns and wind the economy back up again.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:22.360]   So the impact of these interventions is huge.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.980]   We don't have to give up, right?
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:29.400]   R0, which is the measure of each person, how many people do they infect on average, was
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:33.040]   way up around 4 in Wuhan.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.820]   And after the interventions in Wuhan, it went down to 0.3.
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:45.700]   So when you go down from one person infecting 4 to one person infecting 0.3, you're going
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:49.200]   from a disease which is growing to a disease which is shrinking.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:54.440]   But we had a question about the previous graph.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:59.520]   What's the significance of the 33% daily increase line?
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.520]   I'm not sure.
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:05.160]   I think my understanding is it was just like a kind of an estimate, it's kind of like an
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:11.100]   average of what seems to be happening in places that aren't really doing much around response.
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.320]   Somehow Spain and UK are even worse than that.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:18.000]   But at the time they were adding this, it was before Spain and UK were appearing much.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.680]   So it's kind of like, oh Iran, early China, Italy are all kind of, that seemed to be a
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:31.080]   kind of a default I guess that people were following.
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:36.560]   So early response, how important is it?
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.800]   Well these are two regions of Italy.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:46.920]   And one region, Lodi, the green one, did a very early lockdown.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:56.160]   And you can see what happened as a result, their number of cases has not increased exponentially.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.300]   Bergamo, on the other hand, has.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:06.840]   And the reason this matters is going back to the graph we saw earlier.
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:12.280]   If you can keep this going up slowly enough, you can try to keep it under the red line,
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:16.480]   which means people that need to be hospitalized get hospitalized.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.500]   So it makes a huge difference to the number of deaths.
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:31.060]   And we saw that in the 1918 flu, where regions like, it was St. Louis, right, that responded
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.240]   early, Rachel?
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:38.640]   Responded early and did on the whole manage to get people into hospitals and ended up
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:43.840]   with a much lower death rate than places like Philadelphia that literally put on a parade
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:47.280]   for 250,000 people, just as the pandemic was spreading.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.800]   And this was for the flu of 1918.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.560]   1918, that's right.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:59.000]   So it's not like we don't have data or history to learn from, we do.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.920]   One of the challenges is it's kind of, you know, in Rachel's work as the founding director
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:10.280]   of the Center for Applied Data Ethics, she talks a lot about disinformation and trust.
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:16.440]   It's very hard at the moment because we are in a low trust environment, for good reason.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:24.680]   For example, the big UK newspaper, The Daily Mail, internally writes, "Official government
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.760]   advice is no longer adequate enough to safeguard our staff."
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:36.080]   At the same time that they write in the newspaper regarding Boris and his boffins, "We must
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.760]   trust their judgment and do as they say."
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:46.040]   So we're seeing, you know, this low trust environment being created where very clearly
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:51.920]   media and governments are not always telling the truth.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:58.440]   It makes it very difficult to know where we get, you know, good information from.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.280]   So an example of this is like masks.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:06.200]   I mentioned that kind of from an empirical point of view, we can see that countries that
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:12.960]   are using masks widely are doing much better than those that aren't.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:20.680]   Correlation is not causation, but as I mentioned at the start of this discussion, we are not
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.360]   looking for proof here.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.560]   We're looking for like, what makes sense, right?
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:32.880]   And compare the cost of a mask or a bunch of masks to the cost of a lockdown.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.960]   It's a big difference, right?
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:41.480]   If we can be South Korea, our economy is going to be much better, and of course our society
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:48.080]   is going to be much better than if we have a lockdown and even that turns out not to
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.080]   be enough.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.480]   So we kind of, we have to go on the information we have.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.920]   We can't look for proof.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:58.840]   We can't look for there is no peer-reviewed, definitive answer, right?
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:05.720]   The fact is, when people cough, there's a lot of coughing involved in this disease.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:10.840]   It's one of the most common symptoms as a dry cough.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.040]   Droplets head out there somewhere up to eight meters.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.440]   And if you've got a mask on it, it's your mask rather than, you know, hitting your,
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.640]   well, particularly if you've also got glasses or goggles rather than hitting your eyes and
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.640]   nose or whatever.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:30.520]   So you know, that on the other hand, a lot of governments are saying they're not effective.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:35.160]   Now we don't know that, as I mentioned, but there's a good reason for them to say this,
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.000]   which is there's a shortage of them.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Yes, Rachel?
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.120]   I was just going to know, St. Upto Effect, she wrote an excellent op-ed on this in the
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.960]   New York Times today called "Why Telling People They Don't Need Mass Backfired?"
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.000]   Yeah, it's not great for all kinds of reasons.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.240]   I mean, you know, she mentioned the obvious things like, hey, you're saying that we don't
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:57.840]   need masks, so you should stop buying them so that then doctors can have them because
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:58.840]   they need masks.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:22:59.840]   It's like, what?
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:03.680]   You know, and she's kind of mentioning, oh, it's because you can't possibly know how to
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.680]   put them on.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:10.920]   So come on, you know, it's a five minute YouTube video showing how to put on a mask.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.680]   It's basically a government response where they don't want to do the stuff that's been
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:20.800]   happening in Southeast Asia, which is in Southeast Asia, they basically say, okay, the government
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:27.120]   has decided that this many masks have to be given to hospitals, so they've allocated them.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:31.480]   And for whatever reason, we're not doing that in the West, on the whole.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:37.800]   And also in China, they bought 38 million masks right at the start of this.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.680]   The US is not investing in increasing capacity.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:47.200]   So when you're not doing those things, it can seem like the right response is to tell
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:53.000]   people not to buy them, tell people they don't need them, but probably not a good long-term
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.040]   solution.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:03.720]   So as I say, that the trust situation is such that doctors are saying they're learning more
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:10.040]   from Facebook and Twitter than peer-reviewed and even pre-pub medical research literature
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:14.960]   at the moment, which is, it's not a great situation, but let's accept that this is what
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:21.400]   it is, right? And it partly is because there's a great community response, you know, of doctors
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:27.040]   and virologists and epidemiologists saying like, okay, I don't have time to write a paper,
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.640]   but let me tell you, I just went to this place, I did this study, I found this thing, I talked
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:38.000]   to this person, you know, it's fast-moving information, you know, for, but we do have
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.040]   information about masks, not for COVID-19, but for other things that involve coughing
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:52.760]   and droplets moving around, so there is some research, not perfect, but can tell us a bit
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:57.840]   about what kind of masks work. And interestingly, this particular example showed that just simple
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:06.640]   surgical masks were just as useful as N95 masks for influenza virus. Virologists are
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:15.640]   telling us exposure dose matters and therefore masks help. And because when you have a mask
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.920]   it means, you know, less of those droplets end up in your nose and mouth and if that
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:24.480]   happens it keeps the peak viral load lower and so it does less damage, the immune system
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:29.640]   starts responding earlier and can flatten the curve. So, you know, there's a big difference
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:34.880]   between, at least in the West, the official information that's generally being passed
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:41.400]   on and the information that we can see in research papers and from, from experts. Having
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:46.800]   said all that, it's certainly true that there isn't enough masks for doctors. And so one
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:55.120]   of the things, you know, if people can find ways to acquire more masks, create more masks,
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.760]   figure out better ways to reuse masks, I don't know, like this is something everybody is
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:02.920]   trying to figure out right now because it could make a big difference, particularly
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:11.040]   because it's becoming increasingly clear that people who are infected, so most people who
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:15.560]   are infected don't have symptoms. But the problem is that it's, it's seeming pretty
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:19.480]   clear that those people are spreading the disease. So again, there's a lot of official
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:26.640]   advice saying, you know, if you've got symptoms, stay home, if you've got symptoms, self isolate,
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:34.360]   so forth. But the kind of the data we currently have does not show that to make sense. It
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:40.480]   seems actually like regardless of whether you have symptoms, if you have the virus,
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:47.600]   you need to be not spreading it. So that means again, more testing, more masks, more self
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:55.680]   isolation, particularly if we have testing like super wide testing. Another thing I wanted
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:05.360]   to talk about was young people. People under 50 probably won't die. Some do, the kinds
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.880]   of people who might, you probably know if it's you because they're kind of immunocompromised
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:15.040]   people and so forth. But you know, let's, let's be honest, you probably won't die if
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:21.680]   you're under 50. You might pass it on to your grandparents or parents and kill them, or
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:28.160]   your colleagues at work. But the other thing to mention is these kinds of diseases have
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:37.080]   tend to shown long term impacts for people when they get older. So less lung function,
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:43.040]   neurological symptoms, depression, you know, there's tended to be for this kind of class
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:53.360]   of viruses, there's tended to be pretty debilitating lifetime impacts even for young people. So
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.960]   you know, if it's not enough to say, hey, stay home so that you don't kill your community
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:03.680]   and family, then you know, maybe okay, we'll stay home so that you don't make your rest
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:08.720]   of your life much crappier than it otherwise would have been.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:13.080]   I was also just going to add that you probably have more coworkers and acquaintances who
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:17.040]   have chronic illnesses that you're not aware of, because many people don't share this information
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.200]   out of a very reasonable fear of discrimination.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:29.720]   Okay, there is something which is terrifyingly complicated, which is in the 1918 flu, the
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:35.080]   second and third seasons were much worse than the first. That's what a lot of people are
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:40.080]   worried might happen. I don't think anybody has a good idea really of what to do about
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:51.600]   this. It was because of this that the UK did the original disastrous response of, let's
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:56.600]   not close down events, let's not close down schools, and now there as we saw there in
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:06.360]   a lot of trouble. And indeed that same group, Imperial College, is now saying in the U.S.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:12.280]   there's a chance that if you isolate cases and household quarantine and social distancing,
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:18.080]   we might be able to, for the initial period, we might be able to keep things under the
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:31.840]   red line. This is a super concerning, dangerous kind of approach, because if we don't close
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.880]   schools and universities and we don't calculate the exponentials right and nobody actually
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:43.760]   knows, then we won't find out that we failed to get this right until we're well up along
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:49.120]   kind of the black line, you know, particularly because we can't really do case isolation
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.120]   because we don't have testing capacity. So this kind of modeling that's being done to
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:59.920]   say like maybe we don't have to do too much right now is not based on reality of what
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:04.640]   we can do, and it's also kind of assuming data we don't have. And most importantly from
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:09.400]   a Bayesian point of view, we don't have confidence intervals here. So if you actually do this
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:13.680]   modeling with confidence intervals, you'll realize that kind of probability that each
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:18.780]   of these things is successful, the number of cases that we actually find through testing,
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:24.000]   the bounds we have on our understanding of what the death rate is and so forth, basically
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   mean that the kind of confidence interval of this brown and green line kind of go from
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:37.680]   down here to way up here. And of course the utility of each direction varies a lot. So
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:44.000]   I kind of just wanted to mention that when you look at this kind of modeling, I haven't
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:53.040]   seen any done yet with that kind of full confidence interval approach and considering the utility
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:58.320]   of each of the possibilities. And so I'd say be very, very careful of this and that's what
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:07.240]   the UK got so very wrong so far. Finally, I wanted to talk about stuff that you can do.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:12.720]   One thing you can do is not stress about the supply chain. There's plenty of food. There's
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:20.880]   plenty of toilet paper. The supply chain is not threatened. And by the way, I'm using a
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:25.760]   lot of slides here from other people without credit, which I normally wouldn't do, but
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:31.120]   I wanted to put together something that's very up-to-date and very quick and I apologize
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:35.960]   but I'm trying to put people's names at least including them where they were already on
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:46.080]   the slide. So this is from Michael Lin. So over the next few weeks as people settle down,
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:51.120]   you should see your shops. I mean, I'm still already starting to see shops starting to
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:57.080]   see goods again. This is an opportunity to take advantage of some casual racism. You'll
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:02.880]   find that Chinese Asian grocery shops are absolutely stacked right now. So Rachel and
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:07.920]   I went shopping at one the other day and got everything that we wanted straight away. So
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:16.520]   yeah, don't worry about that. It is hard to find hand sanitizer, which is super important.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:20.400]   If you can find something with at least 60 or 70 percent, sorry, with something with
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:24.600]   at least 90 percent alcohol, you can mix it up with glycerin or aloe vera and create your
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:35.640]   own. There's actually an official WHO sanitizer recipe. Here's another one. It is a bit difficult
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:41.760]   to kind of handle things properly without hand sanitizer. I did post on Twitter a list
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:48.060]   of Singapore's official list of chemicals which kill the virus that you can find in
[00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:52.160]   basically household cleaners. And I found we had like five household cleaners at home
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:57.720]   of which four turned out to have the ingredients recommended. So you might be surprised at
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:09.240]   how many things you can kind of use. The tricky thing here is thinking about how to stay safe
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:14.800]   is Rachel and I kind of play this game. I think of this computer, think of it like a
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:20.440]   computer game. We call it the Code Red game, where somebody else has sat at a table and
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:27.400]   they were infected with COVID-19. And so you then sit at that table. So that table, we
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:33.320]   would say it's red, right? And you have to assume that everything that you haven't personally
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:38.720]   cleaned thoroughly is red because you don't know if it is or it isn't, right? So that's
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.760]   your red. So you have to assume that's red. So you go to a table at a restaurant, you
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:47.240]   sit down and your hand touches it. So now think of a computer game where like every
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:51.960]   time something touches a red thing, it becomes red as well. So your hand touches the table,
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:59.080]   it's now red, by which I mean potentially infected. You pick up your phone, bing, that's
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:05.360]   now red. You take the phone home, you put it on your desk, bing, that's now red. You
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.240]   pick it up off the desk and then you put your computer where it was sitting, bing, that's
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:13.120]   now red. Right? So that's kind of like how you have to think about this. And so the thing
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:20.440]   is now you then say like, oh, forgot to wash my hands after I went out to the restaurant.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:26.160]   So you clean them and hands are now green. But this kind of now whole chain of things
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:30.040]   which touch things, which touch things, which touch things, they're all red. Right? So this
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:35.600]   is one of the reasons that kind of everything's taking us a long time at the moment to just
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:44.160]   get around the place is we have to make sure that everything red becomes green in a way
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:48.200]   that we don't make other things red in the process. And you know, sometimes we forget
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:51.040]   and then we realize there's a whole chain of things that happened and then we have to
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:57.720]   go and do all of those over again. But if you get good at this, then you can kind of
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:02.360]   like, as long as you stay distance from people, you can kind of go about your day to day life,
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:09.920]   you know, you can go and get takeout or whatever. But for this to work, you need hand sanitizer.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:18.600]   It helps to have proper, what are they called? Night trial gloves. Night trial gloves. And
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.400]   of course, you know, cleaning fluids that you can just spray on a piece of paper on
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:29.720]   a piece of, you know, cleaning paper and wipe things down. So like when we get shopping,
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:35.600]   we just pop it on the front deck, wipe down everything with alcohol or bleach before we
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:44.640]   bring it in and so forth. So it's a hassle, but you know, it's, you can totally handle
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:51.840]   the situation this way. There's a lot of opportunities for data scientists to help. People have been
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:59.080]   reaching out to me and so this gentleman said like, hey Lombardi is, I mean Lombardi's really
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:03.080]   the place is nearly struggling the most. We founded a nonprofit group of data scientists
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:09.760]   where we're trying to help. So you can go to defeat covid19.org to find out what kind
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:16.680]   of help they need. There are ways to deal with, you know, a little bit some of the lack
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:23.040]   of testing to at least figure out a bit of what's going on, for example, by, so if you
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:29.840]   don't follow Eric Fagel-Ding, he has lots of great information about this. Folks like
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:35.720]   him have been looking at what's the kind of reporting of flu like symptoms based on just
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:40.320]   the regular reporting that we have coming out of hospitals and comparing that to the
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:45.720]   amount of flu diagnoses. And you can kind of get creative like that to figure out like,
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:51.320]   oh maybe the difference is because of covid19. And the bad news is based on that kind of
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:56.760]   back of the envelope analysis, things look much worse than the official figures. Pete
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:01.480]   Skomrock kind of had the idea, you know, as other people have had similar ideas, hey maybe
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:06.920]   things like the Google business system that tells you when it's busy or not could be kind
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:14.280]   of reused to try and help do some kind of pandemic social distance measurement stuff.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:19.040]   This kind of stuff we've got to be super careful of creating some kind of dystopian surveillance
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:25.120]   society that we then can't untangle again at the end. But you know there's opportunities
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:31.560]   for data scientists and kind of software developers to think creatively about ways to help fill
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:48.720]   in these gaps, fill in the gaps around testing, around keeping data available.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:55.920]   So one of the things to think about is how can we help improve testing. The data that's
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:02.020]   available is suggesting that, so this is from science, that the vast majority of infections
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:08.760]   were undocumented. And that's led folks like Jeff Dean to ask what's been the economic
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:13.240]   cost of delaying testing in the US. I reckon it might be hundreds of billions or trillions
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:18.000]   of dollars. You can see the difference between South Korea and United States that both saw
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:25.800]   their first cases within a day of each other. South Korea tested massively. United States
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:32.960]   just starting to test super late. So you know if you can help us find ways to do more tests
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:43.600]   that would be super helpful. Also I mean you know we're data scientists but there's people
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.720]   with all kinds of backgrounds here. If you've got a background in hardware or 3D printing
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:53.360]   people are saving lives here. These folks bought a 3D printer to a hospital in Italy
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:39:01.920]   and there are people now breathing who previously couldn't thanks to that 3D printing. The world
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:06.480]   being what it is these people have now been sued by a patent troll which I guess was probably
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:12.760]   predictable but yeah. I guess a lot of people are trying to get creative and sometimes working
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:19.680]   around regulations as necessary to save lives which hopefully will turn out to be a good
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:24.800]   thing not a bad thing. Ventilators is one thing a lot of people are trying to build
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:32.960]   at the moment so maybe you can help. So the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:39.560]   Security is saying we need a wartime mobilization to make mass number of ventilators and to
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:49.000]   get enough oxygen. So kind of wartime mobilization means a lot of creativity and a lot of you
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.120]   know not being quite as precise about things as we might have used to have been but just
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:40:01.000]   trying things out and seeing what works. Mind you the first thing we could do in the US
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.560]   is just buy the capacity we already have. There's actually an opportunity to ramp up
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:11.440]   production fivefold right now but the US just hasn't actually ordered the product. So make
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:17.440]   of that what you will. Some of these folks reached out to me and asked for help finding
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:23.800]   people to help with open source medical supplies. They're sharing CAD files and there's now
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:35.880]   been responses all around the world to that and that's going pretty well. Okay so that
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:45.720]   is my little spiel about COVID-19. Rachel is there anything you wanted to add? I was
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:52.160]   planning to yeah. Okay so for those of you that aren't interested in that topic I apologize
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:57.480]   for taking up your time hopefully some of you found that useful. For those of you that
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:10.200]   did and are interested in contributing I have created a forum category for this. Here it
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:17.440]   is COVID-19. Now I think there's a lot of opportunities to matter I wouldn't say I think
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:21.320]   maybe there's opportunities to apply some of the stuff we're learning in this course
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:26.680]   to do projects that are related to COVID-19. It would be nice wouldn't it to spend these
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:32.080]   two months learning a new thing but also meeting other people working together on something
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:40.440]   that seems important. So if you're interested in doing that this is the place to put it
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:45.840]   because it's not a closed category like our course category is. If you do of course don't
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:50.400]   like say hey I've just learned this thing in the course to people who aren't in the
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:54.400]   course because they're going to feel jealous or whatever. So just remember you're talking
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:42:02.620]   to folks who aren't necessarily part of the course but yeah this is a great place to help
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:10.520]   write screen scrapers to put data sets together or set up automation of things or you know
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:15.360]   do a survival analysis that incorporates uncertainty in the way that I don't think I've seen done
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:29.240]   yet or you know so on and so forth. So hopefully that turns out to be useful to some people.
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:34.080]   So I'm back again and I just had a quick huddle with Rachel and we decided to put this thing
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:41.000]   online publicly not just for our course. So I figured I'd better just pop in again to
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:48.720]   folks that aren't part of the course and are watching this to fill in some gaps here. When
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:58.120]   I was talking about the forums I'm talking about this website here forums.fast.ai we normally
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:03.720]   use it to talk about deep learning not to talk about COVID-19 but we can talk about
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:09.920]   COVID-19 as well we've got a category for it there. If you're somebody who's not a data
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:14.480]   scientist but is interested in having a conversation about COVID-19 particularly if it's something
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:22.840]   that's more on the technical side or data driven or practical which is kind of our things.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:26.560]   We would love to hear from you even if it's not a data science perspective if you're a
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:31.640]   3D printing person if you're a chemist who knows good ways to create oxygen if you're
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:39.600]   somebody who knows a good source of reagents for testing whatever we would love to hear
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:46.440]   from you there. So thanks very much for listening to this extremely non-deep learning related
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:53.760]   video about COVID-19 and I guess the other thing to mention is you may have no idea who
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:44:06.480]   I am. I'm Jeremy Howard. This is my Twitter @jeremyphoward and Rachel is @mathratial_ratial.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:12.360]   Don't forget the P in Jeremy P Howard. I'm going to be pretty busy trying to create this
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:16.200]   deep learning course over the next few days so I don't promise I'll be putting much on
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:21.360]   Twitter but I will do my best to share things which I think are of interest so thanks a
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:22.040]   lot for listening.
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:32.040]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
