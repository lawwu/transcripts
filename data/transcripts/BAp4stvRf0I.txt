[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:38.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.280]   Hi, everyone.

[00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.800]   of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.880]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.360]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.600]   for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization

[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.960]   Today, our special guest is Ron Lieber, New York Times
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.400]   award-winning columnist and the author
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.840]   of a new book, The Price You Pay for College,
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.040]   an entirely new roadmap for the biggest financial decision
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.240]   your family will ever make.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.360]   I recently interviewed Ron for the Bogleheads speaker series
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.040]   in a live interview that is available on the boglecenter.net
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.100]   website.
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.240]   This is the audio from that video.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.400]   What I learned after reading Ron's book
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.680]   and interviewing him was that picking the right college,
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.200]   getting into that college, and paying for that college
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.240]   is not nearly as clear-cut as we would like it to be.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.280]   There's an awful lot that goes on behind the scenes.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.640]   This is a wonderful interview.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.960]   If you have children who will be going to college
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.640]   or grandchildren who will be going to college,
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.640]   or perhaps you will be going to college,
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.000]   there's something to learn for everyone.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.560]   So here we go.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.560]   With no further ado, let's welcome Ron Lieber.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.640]   Thank you, Rick.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.800]   It is an honor here to be among my fellow personal finance
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.280]   nerds.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.000]   I know there are few people living and walking
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.680]   and breathing in the United States
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.960]   or in the world who care more about beating the system,
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.920]   winning the details, and getting it right than this crew.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.840]   And it's a special honor to be here
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.360]   with Mr. Asset Allocation himself,
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.240]   doing the grilling for the next 60 minutes.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.840]   So I look forward to it.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.720]   Lay it on me.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.960]   Well, Ron, we'll start out with you.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.000]   Over the past decade, your writing
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.640]   has shifted to focus on family finances,
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.040]   but particularly raising children,
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.280]   teaching children about money, and now sending
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.760]   those children to college.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.560]   So I think I can guess this, but what
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.000]   sparked your interest in doing a book on the price
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.200]   you paid for college?
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.480]   Sure, well, some of this is born of my own personal experience.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.720]   I grew up in Chicago.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.760]   My family was well off enough to afford three private school
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.400]   tuitions back in the day in the '70s and '80s
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.560]   when that didn't cost quite as much as it does today.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.000]   And I had a couple of things happen in there that kind
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.360]   of changed everything for me.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.320]   So my parents split up.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.080]   If any of you are divorced or the children of divorce,
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.800]   you know that that is a calamitous financial event
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.840]   among others, right?
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.320]   You take one household, you turn it into two,
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.480]   they're just going to be more expenses.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.440]   And then right about the same time, my father,
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.680]   my late father, lost his job.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.320]   And he did not earn much income to speak
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.240]   of for the next couple of years, except through some occasional
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.640]   consulting jobs.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.680]   And it was about a decade, really,
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.680]   until my family was back to where it had been financially.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.400]   So right away, we were sort of thrust
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.280]   into the private school financial aid system for K
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.160]   to 12, such as it exists.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.920]   It basically consisted of a board of directors
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.720]   at our school in Chicago deciding
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.720]   whether the leaver kids were going to be evicted
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.400]   for lack of ability to pay.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.040]   And thank God, we weren't.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.720]   It's still the most generous thing
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.480]   that anybody's ever done for me.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.200]   And those kids who I grew up with became my family
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.480]   and are still my closest friends to this day.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.200]   So I got to stay there at the Francis Parker School.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.240]   But when it came time to apply to college,
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.320]   we did not have enough money for the places
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.920]   that I wanted to attend.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.000]   Luckily, our college counselor there
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.480]   knew the name of a guy to see, the guy in the Chicagoland
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.720]   area, who you would go to for help
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.080]   with applying for financial aid.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.560]   And we called him up.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.640]   He gave us an address.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.160]   He said we were to show up at 5 PM the following Tuesday
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.720]   at this place in Evanston.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.120]   And we were supposed to bring him $50 in cash.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.680]   And he said to go through the side door.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.560]   So we thought, OK.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.000]   And we show up at this address.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.840]   And it turns out it's the Office of Financial Aid
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.160]   at Northwestern University.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.760]   And it turns out that we were there
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.560]   to see the assistant director, who
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.720]   had this incredible side hustle going on, where
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.840]   every day during the fall at 5 PM,
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.840]   he would usher in these needy families.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.200]   And you would pay him a little money, which he presumably
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.880]   would not report to the IRS or certainly to his employer.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.760]   And then he would proceed to explain to you
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.360]   all of the secrets of the financial aid system.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.360]   And it turned out that this guy knew exactly what
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.320]   he was talking about.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.520]   And I got into Amherst College, early decision.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.840]   I got a great financial aid package.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.560]   And I learned a couple of important things from that,
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.600]   namely that the grown-up world was filled,
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.280]   just chock full of complex systems involving money.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.960]   And they were totally made to be hacked.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.840]   He wasn't encouraging us to break the law.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.880]   But there was this guy out there who knew the answers.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.680]   And for very little money, we could get a hold of him.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.840]   And he could tell us what to do.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.280]   That lesson stayed with me.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.320]   So it's not any big surprise, really,
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.520]   that I grew up to be the person whose beat is beating
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.080]   the system in the newspaper.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.560]   That's always the way that I've thought
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.920]   of my personal finance work at "The Wall Street Journal"
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.200]   and now at "The New York Times."
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.560]   But basically, anything and everything
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.680]   that hits you in the wallet, particularly items
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.440]   that have large costs or large potential costs
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.120]   and that involve a lot of emotions and feelings
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.360]   are the things that I care the most about.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.080]   So of course, when I became a dad in 2005 for the first time,
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.280]   I now have two kids, a 15-year-old and a 5-year-old,
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.960]   I became a little bit obsessed with 529 plans.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.880]   Back then, I was at "The Wall Street Journal."
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.840]   And there was still a fair bit to say
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.560]   about the lousy investment choices and the high fees
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.400]   and the various limitations and the complexity.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.440]   As most of the people on this call probably know,
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.480]   we have largely, although not completely,
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.040]   solved for the generalized mediocrity of these 529 plans.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.440]   So at a certain point, I moved on in my writing
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.640]   to write about how to pay for college
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.120]   instead of how to save for college,
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.280]   because we were starting to hear about all these people
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.280]   coming out of undergraduate
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.960]   with just piles of student loans,
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.120]   particularly 15 years ago,
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.000]   when you could still get these so-called private loans,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.720]   not the federal loans that are capped,
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.840]   but private loans without any adult cosign.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.840]   So I started digging into that area,
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.360]   and I'm still writing sort of sporadically
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.200]   about those very complex systems involving money
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.440]   that we have not yet solved for in "The New York Times."
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.240]   But what started to happen as time went on
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.560]   is that I would hear from readers
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.840]   and from colleagues and friends who were super confused,
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.680]   not so much about how to save
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.760]   and not so much about how to pay.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.520]   They were asking value questions.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.560]   They would come to me, and they'd say,
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.320]   "Ron, you know, my kid got into the University of Illinois
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.240]   at Champaign-Urbana, and that's going to be maybe $125,000
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.680]   because we don't qualify for any need-based aid.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.720]   My kid also got into Kenyon College
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.960]   because they're interested in English, being a writer,
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.960]   and that's a really great small liberal arts college in Ohio.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.120]   And they gave us a bunch of discounts.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.040]   Even though we don't qualify for any need-based financial aid,
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.680]   that's going to be $200,000."
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.040]   And then my kid shot the lights out
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.840]   and got into Northwestern, right?
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.280]   So that's going to be $300,000.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.120]   Where in your library of big data sets
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.000]   that you keep track of over there
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.160]   is the data set that tells me why Northwestern
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.280]   is $200,000 better than the University of Illinois?
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.240]   -And we're going to get into that.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.120]   We're going to get into that. -Yeah, and I didn't have that, right?
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.360]   So I thought, "Wow, I need to start thinking about value.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.680]   I need to start thinking about what to pay for college, too."
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.680]   And so that was sort of my journey
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.600]   to becoming obsessed with the college question.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.320]   It was from personal experience as a student,
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.520]   as a middle-income student.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.240]   It was from personal experience as an investor
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.640]   with one and then two kids
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.120]   living in New York City, a high-cost area.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.960]   And then it was from professional experience
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.600]   with this, like, avalanche of incredibly confused people
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.840]   asking questions about value that I did not know how to answer.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.400]   -Well, your book starts with a discussion
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:22.840]   that contrasts the advertised cost of college
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:27.040]   by those institutions with the price of college.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.680]   So I'm going to show a chart,
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:40.200]   and this chart is the cost of college from 1980 through 2000.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.640]   Now, 1980 is a really important date for me
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.680]   because it's when I graduated college.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.040]   And I went back and I looked.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.240]   I actually paid room and board, tuition, everything else,
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:56.480]   $10,000 for a four-year degree at the University of Rhode Island.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.440]   That's what it cost.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.600]   Now, this chart is showing the cost of college
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:09.640]   over the next 40 years going up by 1,200%.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.160]   And during that same period of time,
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:16.960]   the cost of inflation going up by 236.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.080]   So here's what I did.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.720]   I went back to my old alma mater,
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.360]   the University of Rhode Island,
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:27.920]   and I said, "If I paid $10,000 back in 1980
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:34.480]   and the cost of inflation was 236%,
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:40.280]   I would pay $36,600 for the same education today."
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.960]   Turns out, yeah, turns out, though,
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:48.360]   I actually looked at the data that I got off the website
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.200]   from the University of Rhode Island,
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:55.360]   and it came out exactly to $128,000.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.080]   This chart is very accurate.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.520]   Now, my question to you, Ron, is why does this chart exist?
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.840]   What happened here?
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:11.200]   -Yeah, so I guess let's start by making sure
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.200]   we label this chart correctly, right?
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.480]   Because what we were looking at there was list prices,
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.520]   and I assume at some point sooner rather than later
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.320]   in the hour, we'll get to net prices and discounts, right?
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.520]   But there are plenty of people who pay the list prices,
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.880]   particularly at public institutions like URI
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.320]   that don't have a lot of institutional aid.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.320]   And if you're a good Bogle head and you saved effectively,
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.880]   you may have so many assets,
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.800]   and so you may well pay the list price.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.760]   So let's talk about those list prices.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.880]   First of all, let's consider a public institution
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.120]   like the one that you attended
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.640]   or any flagship state university.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.240]   What's gone on there more than anything
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.880]   that's caused that line to be so steep
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.120]   is a decrease in the amount of subsidy
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.440]   that the state legislatures give to the schools, right?
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.520]   I mean, to the extent that the price of those institutions
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.360]   are, quote-unquote, "artificially low,"
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.640]   that they don't cover the cost of actually
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.080]   maintaining the buildings and paying all the professors
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.280]   and providing programming for the students,
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.640]   is because the state uses tax or other revenue
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.840]   and just hands it over to the university
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.240]   to keep tuition costs down, right?
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.680]   So back in the day, this was thought to be a useful
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.880]   enterprise, a good investment.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.360]   A well-trained workforce grows up to be more productive,
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.880]   pays higher taxes 'cause it's earning more,
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.480]   and that money just sort of comes back to the state
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.920]   and it gets a return on investment.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.440]   But back in the last big recession in particular,
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:46.440]   2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, these states were so hammered
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:52.080]   by a loss of tax revenue in that enormous recession
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.680]   back then that they had to make some difficult choices.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.120]   And one really easy thing to do politically, right,
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.400]   is just to sort of stick it
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.600]   to the state university system, right,
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.720]   and force the chancellor and the board
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.800]   to make difficult decisions about whether they're gonna
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.960]   raise prices or whether they're gonna cut services
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.560]   or cut programs, right?
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.400]   And those schools felt like, well, we can raise prices
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.120]   because what it really means is that these students
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.440]   and these families will probably just have to borrow
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.240]   a little bit more, maybe $1,000 extra per year.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.280]   They can afford it, right, 'cause this was already
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.120]   a subsidized education in particular.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.680]   But if that thinking continues to feed on itself over time,
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.960]   that's how you get a chart like this
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.560]   with public institutions.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.640]   Now, if you're looking at the chart
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.360]   for private institutions, still pretty steep,
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.480]   far outpacing inflation, maybe not,
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.160]   but starting from a higher price,
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.600]   which is why the angle, the slope is not as high
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.400]   as it would be for publics.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.560]   With the privates, the private institutions need
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.440]   to justify their higher prices with more faculty,
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.000]   better services, shinier buildings.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.960]   They're in competition
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.360]   with the state university systems, right?
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.160]   But the other thing they have going on
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.920]   is that as time has gone on,
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.000]   both market demand and regulatory requirements
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.440]   have meant that these institutions have either needed to
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.840]   or felt like they really had no choice,
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.560]   but to add a whole bunch of administrators, right?
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.960]   We've got all sorts of new laws that require equality
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.720]   on the playing field for our daughters, right?
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.560]   Title IX, diversity and equal access
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.720]   in areas outside of gender.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.200]   We have ever higher technology budgets
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.440]   at these institutions.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.480]   There are parents who demand bigger
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.960]   and better career centers, right?
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.720]   Kids have become accustomed to living in a certain manner.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.920]   And if your dorms don't have air conditioning,
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.960]   well, people may not choose your school, right?
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.360]   And so there are all these market pressures,
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.120]   regulatory pressures, which has led
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.680]   to there being a much higher number
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.880]   of administrators at these schools.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.520]   Administrators don't come cheap.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.120]   They're reasonably well-trained.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.040]   They're experienced.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.720]   And I think if you get right down to it, right?
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.400]   As a parent, if you've got a child who's going to college
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.440]   and they've got a medium grade mental health challenge,
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.280]   right, you don't want a 23-year-old grad student
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.600]   working in the counseling center
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.520]   using your child as their guinea pig, right?
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.960]   You want a 43-year-old PhD psychologist
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.920]   working in the mental health center
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.560]   to take care of your precious child
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.040]   who you've pushed off into the world
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.480]   for the first time, right?
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.880]   And you multiply that times all sorts of different parents
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.400]   with all sorts of different needs.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.360]   And pretty soon, you have a lot more administrators
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.480]   than you used to.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.600]   And that's got to be paid for some way.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.040]   And for the private institutions,
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.400]   if they don't have a big endowment,
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.320]   that comes from tuition.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.640]   So that's how the list price goes up there.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.200]   - Well, the second thing is, you know, the books,
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.840]   I noticed the books have increased
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.600]   with the rate of that original inflation, the cost.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.000]   Books have gone up about 1200% over the last 40 years, too.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.240]   So they have far outpaced the cost
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.440]   of just buying a regular book.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.840]   In fact, if you bought a regular book,
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.160]   the cost has actually come down.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.560]   It's basically been lower than the inflation rate.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.160]   So tell me, if you will, if you know this,
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:16.200]   what's going on with textbooks, college textbooks?
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.520]   Why are they so expensive?
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:23.840]   - Yeah, so I know a little bit about this
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.560]   only because I helped some friends of mine
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.840]   run a campus-based used bookstore
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.480]   back in the late '80s and early '90s.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.120]   And look, you know, some industries
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.760]   have higher profit margins than others.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.800]   And textbook publishers really rake it in.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.880]   Why do they do that?
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.720]   Well, first of all, I can tell you the how, right?
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.840]   If you put out a slightly changed,
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.480]   really just like repaginated,
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.800]   where you change the font size
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.560]   of the edition of your textbook every 18 months,
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.920]   then you can just sync the used textbook market altogether.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.480]   And if you wanna do well in the class
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.440]   and don't wanna be checking the book out from the library,
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.640]   you've got no choice but to buy this thing.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.720]   And the books back in the day
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.840]   would only be available at the campus bookstore.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.200]   And you paid the list price, and that was that.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.280]   And there's a reasonably high barrier to entry
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.240]   for these things because the professors themselves
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.800]   have high standards.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.840]   They want the textbook to be excellent.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.560]   And it turns out it takes a couple of years
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:33.520]   to write a really great, thoughtful textbook
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.760]   for organic chemistry or for Psych 101 or for Econ.
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.360]   And so they do this because they can.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.960]   I mean, it's not an incredibly large
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.440]   piece of the budgetary pie,
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:50.520]   but it's just high enough that it really bugs people.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.880]   And there have been various attempts at innovation,
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.240]   most recently with the electronic textbook publishing.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.400]   And that's helped some,
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.240]   but this is just a slow industry to change.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.360]   And people, the professors in particular,
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.680]   have sort of ingrained habits,
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.200]   and it's a tough one to crack.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.240]   - So let me ask a question
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.920]   since college is getting to be so expensive,
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.760]   as we've seen.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.240]   And we'll get into what people actually pay
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.320]   as opposed to what the advertised cost is
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.360]   here in a little bit.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.240]   But tell me whether it's still worth it
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.040]   to pay all of this money to go to a four-year college.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.880]   Did you go to college anymore or a four-year college?
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.440]   Are you gonna get a better job?
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.680]   And what's the data show?
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.400]   - Well, so, I mean,
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.360]   let's start with the baseline economic data.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.880]   The baseline economic data tells us
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:48.880]   that there's roughly a million dollar lifetime gap
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.760]   in earnings between people who go to college and finish,
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.480]   which is important because roughly,
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.400]   there's a very high percentage of people
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.120]   who go to college or start college
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.000]   and never actually finish.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.120]   So that million dollar difference
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.840]   is between people who finish
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.280]   and people who don't or who never go in the first place.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.120]   So that's a lot of money over time,
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.640]   but that's just an average.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.200]   So of course, all of our kids are above average.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.240]   And the ones who are above average,
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.520]   who don't go to college,
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.360]   are ones who enter highly paid trades
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.640]   for which there is a relatively consistent demand,
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.560]   often in a situation where they're self-employed
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.840]   and not at the whim of,
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.120]   whether the local manufacturer moves out of town
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.600]   or whether the Chrysler plant closes and moves to Mexico.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.920]   I ask people to consider a different question, right?
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.080]   Because not everybody goes to college
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.640]   for the same reason in the first place.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.040]   So trying to figure out what's worth it
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.720]   and how much it's worth,
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.840]   gets to the very definition
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.160]   of what college is in the first place.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.920]   And when I started doing the reporting
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.880]   for the price you pay for college,
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.200]   people sort of looked at me funny when I asked them,
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.240]   well, like, what is college, right?
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.960]   They would just sort of look back at me blankly.
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.880]   And I'm like,
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.760]   surely you've thought about the point of the exercise
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.160]   if you're about to maybe spend $300,000 on this thing, right?
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.920]   And then their faces scrunch up and they're like,
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.680]   yeah, I guess we should do that, right?
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.840]   And so I get them talking, right?
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.800]   And it really just comes down to three things.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.880]   College first and foremost,
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.080]   not foremost, foremost for some people.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.680]   First, college first is about the education, right?
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.840]   It's about the learning.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.840]   It's about having your mind grown and your mind blown, right?
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.200]   Essentially having your brain taken apart
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.000]   and put back together again by an expert practitioner.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.080]   So that's the first part.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.360]   The second part of college for many people
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.520]   is the kinship, right?
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.200]   You go to college to find the people
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.840]   that you never could have imagined existing in the world,
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:55.680]   right?
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:00.000]   The people who will be by your side
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.120]   for the rest of your life
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.920]   and who will mold and shape you themselves
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.920]   through four years of banter
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.760]   and decades afterwards of friendship.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.880]   These are also the people who will form
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.120]   the beginnings of your career network.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.560]   And it's not just peers, by the way,
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.360]   it's also grownups, right?
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.000]   It is the professors,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.080]   it is the deans or other people you encounter along the way
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.040]   who will become your mentor soon
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.480]   and who will sort of drag you
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.960]   into a bigger and better version of yourself.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.560]   So that's number two, college is about the people.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.640]   And then number three, college is also, of course,
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.800]   at least for most people, about the credential, right?
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:42.800]   And maybe that's a credential that allows you
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.240]   to take a kind of quantum leap up the social class ladder
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.920]   and into a middle-class career
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.640]   where there is a reasonable amount of job security,
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.520]   because you've gotten a bachelor's in nursing
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.760]   or a bachelor's in accounting or something like that,
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.480]   or you're gonna go to med school.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.400]   Or perhaps you're getting that credential
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:08.400]   because you know that the degree from Princeton,
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.320]   when you're coming from rural Wisconsin,
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.600]   will open doors for you into industries and companies
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.400]   that never would have been open to you otherwise,
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.520]   with the sort of social capital and the snobbery
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.280]   and elitism and all of it that comes
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.640]   with a fancy name-plated degree.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.760]   So those are the three things that college are about.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.080]   And there's no right answer to the question.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.800]   Some people think all three are of equal importance.
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.920]   Then there's some people who are only going for the kinship.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.360]   And I make no judgments about that.
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.360]   I only make judgments about the people who never stop
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.920]   to ask themselves the question in the first place.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.320]   Because if you don't do that,
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.920]   how do you know what you're shopping for?
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:51.960]   - We're going to go to college.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.240]   The children or the grandchildren are gonna go to college.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.520]   Now we have to figure out, well, which college,
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.120]   and then how to get into that college,
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.680]   and then how to pay for that college.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.680]   So let's start out with selecting the right school.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.400]   You list three unhelpful feelings.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.760]   You call them the three unhelpful feelings
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.040]   of fear, guilt, and snobbery and elitism.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.200]   Can you explain why these are unhealthy?
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.320]   - Sure.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.920]   Well, I guess where you start, right,
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:30.160]   is you always want to be checking yourself, right?
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.160]   And this is not gonna be any news to bogelheads, right?
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:38.680]   You know, the bogelhead community has become used to,
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:43.680]   over decades, resisting flashiness,
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.920]   resisting so-called expertise,
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:51.160]   resisting the smart man and the smart woman
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.240]   who are supposedly the end-all, be-all
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.760]   of, you know, investing prowess, right?
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:02.600]   And so, you know, what are the things that can cause you,
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.000]   you know, to spend more than you need to?
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.960]   And I think, you know, those emotions
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.520]   and those answers apply equally well
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:12.840]   to colleges than they do to mutual funds or ETFs, right?
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.920]   First of all is fear, right?
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.000]   Fear that if you don't spend money,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.560]   fear that if you don't believe
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.040]   that you'll get what you pay for
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.000]   and the more you pay, the more you'll get,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.160]   that the fear that if you do it wrong,
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.080]   if you cheap out, that in this instance,
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.160]   your kids will go tumbling down the social class ladder
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.320]   from wherever it is that you've managed to clamber up to
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.760]   because you were too cheap, essentially.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.400]   And that there's something wrong with you
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.400]   as a parent or as a grandparent
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.360]   if you're not ponying up for the most expensive version
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.440]   of whatever it is that you know
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.080]   that your kid actually needs, right?
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.160]   College is not a want for many families.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.520]   It's a given, right?
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.880]   So this is actually a need.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.920]   It's just a question of, you know,
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.680]   how much you're going to pay for it.
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.600]   So there's that fear, right?
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.640]   Then there's guilt.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.760]   Guilt that we have not saved enough
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:11.160]   to provide whatever it is our kid wants
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.040]   in this category of need.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.160]   Guilt that we do not earn enough.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.520]   Guilt that we chose the wrong profession
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.360]   that does not allow us to write a $300,000 check
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.760]   after taxes out of current income.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.560]   Guilt that we cannot do what our parents did for us,
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.040]   even though Rick's parents in 1980,
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.880]   if they did pay for any of it,
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.600]   and it looks like they didn't,
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.560]   but you know, had they wanted to or been able to,
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:42.040]   you know, the final price tag for you,
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.400]   as you just explained at the top of the hour,
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:48.400]   doesn't look anything like the $128,000 price tag,
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.960]   you know, that somebody in Kingston or Cranston
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.960]   or Providence would be looking at right now, right?
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.320]   And so, you know, we get ourselves all hung up
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.680]   on what our parents did for us
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.360]   without really understanding
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.120]   that the world has changed entirely.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.920]   Or maybe we get all hung up
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.920]   on what our parents did not do for us, right?
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.800]   And we either deeply resent that they had the ability,
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.920]   but not the willingness to pay for us,
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.560]   or we know how much we struggled
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.960]   because they did not have enough money
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.520]   through no fault of their own.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.160]   And we want it to be exactly the opposite for our kids.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.520]   We want them never to have to worry
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.160]   about money during college for a second,
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.040]   no matter how much it costs, right?
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.640]   And if we haven't accomplished that,
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.120]   if we haven't satisfied that goal,
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.520]   then we're doing it wrong, right?
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.680]   So it's just like guilt, guilt, guilt.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.720]   We can send ourselves on so many guilt trips
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.200]   about this stuff, and I'm trying people,
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.400]   trying to, you know, get people off those guilt trips.
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.160]   And then the fear and the snobbery
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:47.080]   is about the subconscious or maybe the conscious sense
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.880]   that where our kid goes to school,
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.840]   where we can afford to send our kid,
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.040]   where they are able to get in,
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:59.040]   is all some kind of final exam on parenting
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:05.160]   that the results of which played in public, to the public,
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.320]   through like, you know, the Facebook
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.160]   and Instagram sweatshirt reveals
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.880]   and the bumper sticker in the window, right?
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.240]   And you want that college to be as prestigious
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.480]   or fancy as possible.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.800]   Otherwise you did it wrong.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.960]   Otherwise, you know, you've gotten a C- as a parent, right?
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.840]   Or even if we managed to kind of get over that
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.640]   and step outside of ourselves,
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:30.000]   we're worried about other people's snobbery, right?
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.040]   Because if we got a 16-year-old budding investment banker
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.480]   on our hands, and that kid has already figured out
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.960]   that like, oh, okay, if I'm gonna do this,
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:43.240]   I wanna be an investment banking analyst at Goldman Sachs
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.600]   or Morgan Stanley, or, you know,
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.120]   a couple of other Wall Street firms,
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.200]   those places are just shock full of snobs and elitists.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.200]   And they are not gonna hire you
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.920]   out of Wisconsin whitewater, right?
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.840]   But they are gonna hire you out of Princeton.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.160]   They are gonna take a close look there.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:04.960]   And so if you've got 10,000 acres and, you know,
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.320]   5,000 head of dairy cattle, you know,
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.600]   up in Northern Wisconsin, and you're tempted to, you know,
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.400]   just send your kid to Wisconsin whitewater, that's great.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.520]   But if that kid really wants to be a banker,
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.160]   and you want that kid to have a shot at their dream,
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.680]   and you're not gonna earn any need-based financial aid
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.120]   because you're making all that money, you know,
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.560]   selling the milk to Ben and Jerry's,
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.720]   you're gonna think really hard
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.080]   about spending that $300,000 for Princeton
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.840]   if your kid manages to get it.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.960]   Not because you think it's worth it,
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.000]   but because somebody else on Wall Street
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.720]   is a big freaking snob, right?
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.040]   And so, you know, these are relatively
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.480]   limited circumstances, but, you know, as a parent, right,
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.560]   I can see how, if you have the means
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:48.080]   or the ability to borrow, right,
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.280]   you wanna do everything you possibly can,
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:55.280]   or you're tempted to, not to close off any avenues
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.200]   to your kid whatsoever.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.760]   And that is how people end up spending $300,000
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.120]   or borrowing to do so.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.960]   And sometimes it's for, you know, a reasonably good reason,
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.440]   and sometimes it's because people are confused.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.440]   - You talk a lot in the book about value.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.200]   And, you know, are you getting the value
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.440]   out of your education or so forth?
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.160]   So how do you separate, for each individual,
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.360]   of course, it's different.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:25.600]   So how do you separate value and how do you find value
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.840]   in the college system?
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:30.440]   - Sure, so, I mean, it begins with trying to figure out
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.320]   what it is that you're going to school for, right?
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.520]   So let's forget about the 16-year-old investment banker
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:37.360]   for a minute.
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:41.360]   Let's think about 16-year-old who wants nothing more
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:44.840]   than to be a marine biologist, right?
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.520]   And this isn't, you know, the eight-year-old
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.800]   who like loves the dolphins.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.280]   This is the 16-year-old who's like shooting the lights out
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.000]   at AP Bio and has done an internship
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.760]   and is reasonably sure that they want to go
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.520]   not just to college, but to graduate school, right?
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.040]   So you're thinking about a lot of things there, right?
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.800]   But probably the first thing you're thinking about,
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.520]   hopefully, is you're thinking about the quality
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.600]   of the education, but what you're also thinking about
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.360]   is the quality of the mentorship.
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:15.000]   Because you know that you can't get into one of these,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.800]   you know, teeny tiny, very competitive
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.080]   marine biology PhD programs,
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.760]   or you figure this out with a little bit of research.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.480]   You can't do that without just a glowing,
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.920]   lights-out recommendation from your undergraduate,
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.960]   you know, faculty advisor, right?
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:34.800]   So how are you gonna find somebody at an institution
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.400]   who's gonna actually get to know your kid well enough
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.960]   to be able to write that kind of recommendation?
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.200]   And what sort of environment or circumstances
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.600]   are going to need to exist?
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.760]   Is there a better chance of that happening
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.840]   if they're in, you know, Biology 101
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.640]   with 800 other people, including 300 people
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.240]   who want to go to medical school?
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.680]   Or is there a better chance of that happening
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.280]   if they go to a small liberal arts college
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:01.320]   that happens to have a really great biology program, right?
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.400]   So, you know, you start thinking about size.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.680]   You start thinking about faculty contact.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.880]   Again, if you're, you know, up there in Northern Wisconsin
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:13.760]   and you've got that budding marine biologist on your hands
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.320]   who wants to do it someplace other than Lake Superior,
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.480]   you know, maybe you're gonna send them to Madison
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.080]   or to Wisconsin Whitewater,
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.320]   but there may be a lot of adjunct professors there
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.280]   or part-timers who aren't even gonna be around
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.880]   two or three years later.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.160]   Whereas if they go to Lawrence University,
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.240]   you know, a smaller school, you know,
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.600]   if they go to Knox College,
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:37.040]   if they go to one of the smaller colleges in Minnesota,
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.320]   they're gonna have a better shot
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.600]   at making that kind of contact, right?
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.360]   And then you can go looking for data,
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.920]   which actually does exist,
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.000]   that will tell you which undergraduate institutions
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   the PhD students at the biggest biology programs
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.360]   for PhD students, you know,
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.000]   where the undergraduates actually come from, right?
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.080]   This data is out there.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.000]   So, you know, you start looking for whatever data
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.680]   or evidence you can that exists
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:02.960]   that might give you some sense
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.280]   of whether an institution that costs more
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.640]   than your state university might actually be worth it
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.880]   if it stands the chance of raising the odds
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.080]   of helping your kid do whatever it is that they wanna do.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.760]   So there are a number of problems with this, right?
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.360]   First of all, to the extent that the colleges
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.240]   have good data on outcomes,
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:26.160]   they're not always so great about sharing, right?
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.920]   Because if everybody shared standardized data,
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.840]   then there would be even more ways to compare
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.000]   and rank the schools.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.800]   And this is not in their interest.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.720]   And so, you know, there's not always great data.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.040]   It isn't easy to find.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.800]   I spent years, you know, sort of hoovering up resources
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.200]   and trying to spit them out in the book,
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.880]   but I was not ultimately satisfied
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.360]   with what I was able to put together.
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.680]   And it's the school's fault, right?
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.800]   And then there's the not so small matter
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:56.000]   of the fact that we are dealing with children, right?
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   For reasons lost to history,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.560]   but that make absolutely no sense whatsoever.
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:03.280]   We spend all this money on teenagers, right?
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.600]   We don't send them off to serve in the US armed forces
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.040]   on a mandatory basis.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:11.760]   We don't send them off to do non-military national service.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.920]   We don't encourage them for the most part
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:16.720]   to take a year or two off before going to college.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.040]   So we've got these 18-year-olds
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.680]   who've never done a darn thing in the world,
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.560]   except, you know, scoop ice cream and work at a day camp
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.920]   and, you know, sit in high school going to college.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.880]   And we're making these six-figure decisions,
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:31.000]   investments based on what we think their interests are,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.480]   but some of them have no earthly idea what they want to do.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.000]   And then many of the rest who are absolutely certain
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.520]   about Wall Street or marine biology change their minds
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.200]   once they get into a really good college classroom
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.120]   and get exposed to, you know, bigger and better ideas.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.280]   So the whole thing is fundamentally flawed
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.240]   and deeply dissatisfied.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.880]   And I'm just trying to help people, you know,
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:57.600]   walk through a reasonably dysfunctional system
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:01.640]   with their head screwed on reasonably straight.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:06.000]   - Okay, so at the end of this journey,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.480]   you're gonna pick out a few schools
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:13.480]   and you're gonna have to apply to get into those schools.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:17.840]   So now we need to get in.
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.160]   And with that in mind,
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:23.680]   the big thing these days seems to be diversity.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:28.360]   I was listening to some entrance experts, if you will,
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.800]   former admissions experts,
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:34.520]   and they were talking about diversity, diversity, diversity,
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.440]   not just race and religion, but athletics,
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.520]   anything that sets you apart from others.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.880]   So how do you use diversity
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.080]   to get into the school you want to get into?
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.720]   - Sure, so, I mean, let's just, you know,
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:51.960]   talk briefly and bluntly about how this works at,
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.000]   you know, the rejective schools, right?
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.440]   The schools that reject the highest percentage of applicants
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.360]   and there you are at the biggest, you know,
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:03.040]   advantage if you are rich and if you are white.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:06.280]   You're at an advantage if you're rich
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:09.600]   because you can donate a building, right?
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:14.480]   And it tends to be way more affluent and way whiter people
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.960]   who benefit from what's known as,
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.240]   what's known as a legacy preference, right?
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.800]   Where your grades can be lower
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.160]   and your scores can be lower
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.320]   as long as your mom or your dad or both,
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.880]   or like four generations of Cabot's, you know,
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.520]   or eight generations, you know,
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.000]   went to Harvard or Amherst or Stanford.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   Those people tend to be disproportionately affluent
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.360]   and white.
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.960]   When it comes to athletic preference,
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.560]   which gives you even a bigger edge
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.680]   than legacy preference does, you know,
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.400]   many of those sports, although not all,
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.760]   but, you know, the majority of them
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:47.120]   are sports that require a great deal of investment
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.720]   and nurturing to, you know, get you to a place
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.320]   through the private tutoring,
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.760]   through the kind of elite level club sports, right?
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.040]   That will get you ready to swim or play golf
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.280]   or play tennis or play lacrosse or play hockey
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.800]   at an institution that will give you a preference, right?
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:06.560]   So there too, being wealthy gives you the bigger advantage
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:09.720]   and more often than not, the people who are wealthy are white.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.560]   Same thing through with testing and tutoring on academics.
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.640]   And then there are preferences based on race,
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.640]   which are the ones that get the most attention,
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:21.840]   but may have a little bit less to do
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.280]   with who gets in than, you know,
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.640]   the total number of people who get in via legacy preference
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.000]   or via athletic preference,
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.320]   particularly in the rich white sports.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.080]   So all of that is like a, you know,
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.840]   big kind of toxic stew that generates a lot of attention.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:40.000]   But what I think people miss a lot of the time
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.600]   is that like a step below there
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:46.560]   at some still like really excellent high quality schools
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.560]   that, you know, reject way more applicants
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.560]   than they can take.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.160]   There is actually, you know,
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.920]   a huge advantage to being able to pay full price
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.480]   because they get 50 or 75% of the way
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.600]   through the number of admissions they have to hand out.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.840]   And then they start running out of financial aid money,
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:03.680]   right?
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.120]   And then the packages get weaker
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:08.120]   or they just start rejecting people who need aid, right?
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:11.360]   So if you are a Bogle head and you, you know,
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:16.000]   have those compound interest charts imprinted in your brain,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.560]   which I do, thanks to my dad and the USAA Magazine,
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:23.120]   you know, sending me one when I was 23 years old,
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.440]   I knew good and well, right?
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.560]   That I didn't want money to be a factor.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:31.000]   And so I just started saving for college for my kids.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.040]   Like, well, they were still in utero, right?
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:38.040]   So money does provide a really sizable
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.640]   and sometimes measurable admissions advantage there too.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.480]   So, you know, in many of these institutions,
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.160]   the parents would be proud to send their kids to,
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.480]   it's good to be rich.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.800]   You know, it's complicated and it becomes politicized.
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.440]   But the fact of the matter is that
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.560]   there are all sorts of people
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:58.640]   of all sorts of skin tones and backgrounds
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:02.880]   benefiting from a certain amount of admissions preference.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.640]   And that makes it harder, you know,
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.400]   in many instances and most instances
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.480]   for people who do not have any sort of a hook.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.560]   But we shouldn't forget that there are hundreds
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:16.040]   and hundreds of, you know, essentially open access
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.120]   undergraduate institutions out there
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.920]   where more or less anybody can go, you know,
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.760]   if you can fog a mirror and, you know,
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:25.920]   there's a lot of dedicated instructors at those places too.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.880]   And, you know, I don't want to discount
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.960]   the worth of those institutions.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.080]   - So I was reading in the book that
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:37.080]   we were talking about the advertised price of college
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:41.040]   and the two reasons why colleges
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:45.440]   put these very high prices on their website.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.680]   Number one, because some people will pay it.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:49.920]   They'll pay it.
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.760]   And number two is because
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.320]   if they don't put the high price on there,
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.680]   people don't think they're getting good value
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.520]   for their money.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:02.400]   So with that in mind, how do we pay for college?
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.400]   First of all, let's talk about discounting.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.120]   It was enlightening to me in reading your book
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:11.640]   that internally admissions people call it discounting,
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.200]   but externally they call it scholarships.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:19.400]   Anyway, go into discounting.
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.240]   I mean, what should you pay?
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.840]   Not what the price is, but what should you pay?
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:27.600]   - Right, well, gosh, where do we start here?
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.680]   I mean, there's a couple of different ways
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.040]   that these discounts happen.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.800]   And, you know, we'll use the terms interchangeably,
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.840]   but what you want to be thinking about as a parent,
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.400]   as a shopper, right?
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:43.400]   Like what is my actual cost of attendance going to be?
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:47.520]   And if I get an offer of financial aid,
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.840]   am I a hundred percent sure I understand
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.640]   which of these discounts or scholarships
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.560]   that we're not going to have to pay back?
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.480]   And that, you know, we understand how much the school
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:59.360]   is asking us to actually pay out of pocket
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.880]   or what it's telling us to borrow, right?
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.200]   So there's two basic kinds of financial aid.
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:07.400]   You know, back in our day, even back in my day,
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.200]   I'm a couple of years younger than you, Rick,
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.080]   most of the financial aid that was offered
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.600]   was offered based on need, right?
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.080]   So my family had to kind of lay ourselves bare
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.000]   in terms of our income and our assets.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.760]   And then Amherst College decided
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.800]   what they thought we could afford to pay.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.480]   And they basically were good for the rest of it
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:27.240]   with, you know, with a couple of, you know,
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:31.040]   campus jobs and undergraduate loans thrown in.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:34.720]   What's changed now is that that need-based aid system
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:39.240]   still exists, you know, at the hundred or so,
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.600]   you know, most well-resourced private institutions
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.560]   in America, state systems are a little different,
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.800]   but, you know, at the private ones,
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.760]   it still kind of looks like that.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.880]   But, you know, starting around in the '90s,
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.960]   this like whole separate system hived off
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.400]   that's become known as Merit Aid.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.840]   And Merit Aid was originally designed
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:41:01.480]   to help like fourth-tier institutions
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:04.120]   improve to the third or second tier
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.760]   by swiping kids who were qualified
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:09.200]   for second or even first-tier institutions
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.120]   by throwing money at them and making them feel good, right?
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.120]   So if you got this unsolicited, you know,
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:17.000]   offer in the mail after you took your PSAT test
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.120]   and you've done well from a school
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:20.520]   that you've never heard of, you know,
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.320]   the letter would say, "Hey, we have our eye on you,
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.400]   and we're not gonna charge you any application fee.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.000]   If you come here and you get in,
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.960]   you know, we'll give you $5,000 off the list price."
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.640]   And that worked so well,
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.680]   so many of the, you know, of the good, smart kids,
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:38.040]   like were getting bought off, you know,
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.080]   from higher-tier institutions,
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.520]   that market forces intervened, you know,
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.840]   competition took hold,
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.800]   and over the course of 10 or 15 or 20 years,
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.040]   it just kind of moved, you know,
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.120]   farther and farther up the food chain,
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:54.720]   where now, you know, it's really only 30 or 40 schools
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:58.240]   that aren't forced to offer some kind of discount.
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.440]   And let's be clear, too, this merited discounting,
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:04.760]   it has nothing to do with your ability to pay
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.800]   and kind of everything to do with your willingness, right?
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.120]   So there are all sorts of super-rich families
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:13.440]   who are being offered $10,000, $20,000, $30,000 off a year,
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.520]   or even a full ride,
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:18.920]   if the school has decided that their kids are attractive,
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:21.480]   whether because of their actual academic
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.200]   or extracurricular merit,
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.120]   or just because they're throwing money around
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.240]   to, you know, try and get people to come.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:28.920]   So, you know, think about it this way, right?
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:32.000]   If you're Kenyon College, right, in Ohio,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.320]   or Connecticut College in London, Connecticut,
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:40.120]   if you are Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota,
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.920]   you know, excellent schools,
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.600]   but they have slipped enough
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.000]   in terms of marketplace perception
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.360]   that even a certain number of people
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.840]   with the ability to pay $75,000 a year
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:54.800]   are lacking the willingness to do so, right?
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.000]   But if you are Macalester
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.800]   and your cost to educate a student is $42,000 a year,
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:03.040]   all right, you're charging a list price of 70, right?
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.000]   If you throw an $18,000 merit aid package
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.800]   at an affluent family,
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.440]   that family's gonna feel really good
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.960]   about what it has accomplished, right?
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:16.800]   Because they're gonna get 18, 36, 54, $72,000 off
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.400]   over the course of four years.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:22.760]   Their cost of attendance in any given year is $52,000, right?
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:26.720]   But if Macalester only needs $40,000 to educate that kid,
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.960]   that's still a $12,000 profit, right?
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.400]   And they can take that profit
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.680]   and they can toss it at a lower income family
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.520]   and help them too, right?
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.080]   So in theory, everybody wins,
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.480]   but it's a real weird look
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.560]   to be throwing scholarships at millionaires,
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.680]   which is essentially what's going on.
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:48.080]   And so as a parent, as a shopper,
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:52.080]   it is not at all clear that this is going on,
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.360]   the extent to which it's going on,
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:57.960]   nor is it predictable in many instances
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.240]   how much you will get, right?
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:04.880]   And so for somebody with like a bogal head mindset,
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.080]   the temptation and the desire,
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.600]   once you understand what's going on behind the curtain,
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.320]   is to crack the code, right?
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.160]   To try and beat the system.
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:16.840]   And so I did my level best in the book
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.640]   to show people exactly where the data is
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.520]   that can give them some level of predictability
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:25.040]   about what kind of merit it might be offered.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.080]   But the fact of the matter is,
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:29.240]   is that the schools kind of change their goals each year,
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:32.840]   in part, depending on their own institutional priorities,
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.280]   and also based on what's going on in the market around them.
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:39.640]   And especially in the last couple of years with the pandemic,
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.240]   whatever algorithms they're using
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:45.400]   to try and decide what prices to offer which students,
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.240]   which is another revelation for people,
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:50.200]   a lot of these merit aid offers are delivered by robots,
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.600]   by software, not by humans, right?
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.920]   These algorithms can't predict
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:57.000]   how people are gonna behave during a pandemic.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.320]   And so you're getting all sorts of wacky results
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:01.960]   where people are getting no discounts
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:05.440]   or they're deciding to apply to 22 schools
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:08.120]   just because it's all so unpredictable
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.760]   and they're only getting into four.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.800]   And it's all a real hash.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:16.120]   I do hope that things will have kind of leveled out
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.560]   and they'll be making more sense by next year.
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:21.640]   It's not always predictable.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:24.280]   So the best we can do sometimes
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:27.360]   is just attempt to explain how the system works,
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:31.040]   even if we can't predict precisely what kind of offer
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.640]   it's going to make in any given year.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.320]   - Let's get on to a couple of other ways of saving.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:39.880]   And that is the most popular one is a 529 plan.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.120]   And a lot of people use 529 plans.
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:43.960]   Parents use them, grandparents use them.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.760]   Some states give tax breaks, some don't.
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:48.400]   A lot of people ask,
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.520]   the most common question I get about 529s
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:51.720]   is how much is enough?
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.280]   How much should I put in?
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:56.960]   What should I put in every year?
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:59.520]   And what do I need to get to by age 18
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:03.040]   when my son or daughter goes to college?
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:03.880]   - Sure.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:07.000]   As I think most of the people in this crowd probably know,
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.440]   the nice thing about 529s
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:11.680]   is that they come with some sizable tax benefits, right?
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:13.160]   In 30 some states,
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.120]   you get some kind of a tax break
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:17.040]   for putting money in in the first place.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.240]   And then for everybody,
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.480]   you get a huge tax break on the way out.
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.720]   As long as you take the money
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.840]   and you use it for some higher educational purpose,
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:28.720]   you don't pay any capital gains taxes on the earnings.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:31.120]   And so if you start at age zero
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.600]   and you get the kind of market
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:34.920]   that we've had the last 15 or 20 years,
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.440]   you're going to have a lot of capital gains
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.800]   that you're not paying taxes on.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.760]   So yay for being in the system, right?
[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:44.200]   So the downside is there's a bit of complexity.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:46.480]   Every state has their own plan.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.960]   The rules tend to be different,
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.440]   different investment lineups.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:54.480]   Sometimes, although with increasingly less frequency,
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.880]   your plan may not have an index fund
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:00.240]   for every asset class that you want to be in,
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.600]   although that's mostly gone now.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:05.440]   It was definitely the case 10 or 15 years ago.
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:09.640]   Thankfully, Vanguard and others who index
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.320]   are running or providing investments
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:12.680]   for most of these plans.
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:14.680]   So how much should you save?
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:19.040]   Well, save as much as you reasonably can, right?
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.000]   Everybody's different.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.040]   But here's something to anchor to
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.960]   that might make you not freak out.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:26.680]   Because I talked to a lot of parents of young kids
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:30.040]   and if they can do any kind of inflation math in their head,
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.000]   they're thinking, wow,
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.880]   if I want my kid to go to the institutions that we went to,
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:39.280]   it's going to be $500,000 by the time they're 18.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.920]   And that's insane, right?
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.960]   Like I'm still paying off my student loan debt.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.640]   We haven't bought our forever home yet.
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.880]   We want to have seven figures in retirement savings.
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:49.400]   How am I going to do this, right?
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.200]   So many years ago,
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.640]   I had a conversation with a financial planner in Wisconsin
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.200]   named Kevin McKinley,
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.040]   who came up with what I now refer to as the McKinley Rule,
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.360]   which is just to think about it in fraction.
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:04.600]   You want to save a third of the money
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.000]   that they'll need for college.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.440]   And maybe your goal is public,
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:08.800]   or maybe your goal is private,
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.040]   or maybe it's somewhere in between those two list prices,
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.240]   as we've discussed, right?
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:15.000]   So you want to save a third,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.120]   you want to pay for a third out of current income, right?
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:21.360]   So while they're in college, you stop taking vacations,
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:24.680]   you eat rice and beans, you do whatever you can,
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:26.720]   and you pay for a third of that while they're there,
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.080]   and then you borrow a third.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.760]   Maybe the parents borrow half of that third,
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:33.440]   and the kid borrows the other half, right?
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:35.880]   Although if your kid goes to a state university,
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:39.200]   the federal loan borrowing limit of $31,000 or so
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.640]   will almost cover that third all alone, right?
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:44.240]   So then this starts to feel reasonable, right?
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.480]   You know, if your goal is to end up
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.560]   with $50,000 of savings in today's dollars,
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.560]   you know, you can do that with 250 bucks a month,
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:54.120]   or whatever it is, depending on your return assumptions.
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:57.440]   And that starts to feel a little more doable for families,
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:58.280]   right?
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:48:59.840]   Then you're not driving yourself crazy.
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.640]   Now that number is going to need to be higher
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:04.560]   if you want to have a third of a private college
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:06.280]   available to you 18 years from now,
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.680]   and if you have more than one kid, well, right,
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:09.640]   there you go, right?
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:10.480]   So what can you do?
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.360]   Well, you can talk to grandparents about this, right?
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.920]   Even $50 a month, you know, a contribution from a relative
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:19.560]   can make an appreciable difference going forward.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.400]   Okay to ask, right?
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:23.440]   Much better than all the plastic trinkets
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.400]   that they tend to show up with that, you know,
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.440]   end up underfoot and then in the garbage.
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:31.520]   And so those are the basics, right?
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.880]   You know, there's an hour-long debate we could have
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.000]   about whether you might be better off
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.720]   just saving in a standard brokerage account
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:39.120]   for a whole variety of reasons,
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.600]   and that's fine if that's the way you want to go.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:44.840]   I just urge, beg people to, you know, start early,
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.760]   save as much as you reasonably can.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:50.000]   It is so rare that anybody regrets saving too much
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:50.840]   for college.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:52.160]   That would be a high-class problem.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:54.520]   - So let's talk about student loans for a couple of minutes.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.040]   I mean, there are three types.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:58.600]   The direct loans from the government, as you mentioned,
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.240]   then there's private loans,
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:03.360]   and then there's parent loans called direct PLU loans.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:06.040]   Could you just briefly describe the three different types?
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:06.960]   - Sure.
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.720]   It has worked different ways over the years,
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.320]   but the way it works today is that if you are borrowing
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:12.960]   from the federal government,
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.800]   there is no bank involved, right?
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:17.960]   And in most instances, if your kid is a dependent,
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:21.440]   they can borrow, you know, roughly $31,000 and change
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.280]   over the course of four years.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.920]   And then what's known as a servicer will step in
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.440]   to start sort of collecting those payments.
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:31.040]   So those are how the undergraduate loans work.
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:33.480]   Then there are private loans from institutions
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.600]   like Sallie Mae, Discover,
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.680]   maybe your credit union does some of this,
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:40.000]   you know, a few other companies you may have heard of.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.320]   And again, back in the day,
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:43.960]   undergraduates used to be able to get private loans
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:46.960]   on top of the federal loans or in lieu of the federal loans
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:50.560]   without any kind of, you know, parental grownup cosigner.
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.840]   And that is not the case anymore.
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:54.880]   If your kid has maxed out their federal loans
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:56.560]   and you want to borrow even more,
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:58.280]   which I would encourage you to think hard
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:00.160]   about whether that's smart or not,
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.720]   you will need to be a cosigner.
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.120]   And then there's going to be a, you know,
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:06.120]   sort of complex dance afterwards
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.120]   where all of you will have to decide, like,
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:09.440]   who's making the payments
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.640]   and whose credit rating is getting messed up
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:14.360]   if the 22-year-old is making the payments and forgets,
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:17.480]   right, you know, and how much debt is too much.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:19.480]   And, you know, for what sort of degree.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:21.320]   Then there are those parent loans that you mentioned.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:24.040]   There are the, what's known as the plus loans
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.880]   that you can get from the federal government,
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:27.960]   pretty high origination rate,
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:30.000]   pretty high interest rate.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.920]   You know, people who do feel the need to borrow
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:36.080]   sometimes will, you know, borrow against their home instead,
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:38.080]   you know, to avoid these federal loans.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:40.760]   But parents are increasingly using them.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.440]   And we actually know more
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:44.720]   about where this plus loan borrowing
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:46.680]   tends to be most persistent.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:50.400]   And it is not, you know, as you would expect
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:54.480]   at private institutions that are not all that well-resourced
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.520]   in terms of their financial aid offerings.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:59.320]   And also historically black schools
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:02.960]   have a fair amount of parent borrowing there as well.
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:05.080]   So, you know, those are the basic types.
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.480]   - Well, last minute here,
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:10.280]   you offer a message of hope for people.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:12.920]   Can you just give us your message of hope?
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:14.920]   - Sure.
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:16.840]   So, I mean, let me tell you about the opposite of hope.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:18.600]   I mean, the opposite of hope is, you know,
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:21.240]   all of these calls that I used to get in March and April
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.280]   from incredibly smart people
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:26.480]   who like help run institutions in New York City
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.920]   that you have actually heard of.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:30.720]   And they have gotten to the end of the process
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:31.880]   and realized that, you know,
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:35.400]   they had no idea that they weren't gonna get any discounts
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:38.720]   and that their kid had applied to all of the wrong schools.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.880]   And they're just, you know, saying to me,
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:43.400]   "Ron, is there something you can do to help?"
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:45.360]   And after too many of these calls,
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:49.000]   I thought, wow, it is deeply problematic here
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.960]   that this system is so complicated.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:53.360]   And while I can't solve for that,
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:56.360]   I can certainly help pull the curtain back
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:59.760]   so that people know, first of all, how the system works,
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.800]   the best ways to get, you know, discounts most effectively,
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:06.200]   and how to shop for the sort of institutions
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:09.320]   that will give their kid everything that the kid needs
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:11.440]   and at least some of what they want.
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.440]   And for people to know that they don't have
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:16.760]   to spend $300,000 or anything close to that
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.520]   to accomplish those needs.
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:21.680]   And, you know, once you're going into the process
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:23.640]   with a head of steam and frankly,
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:28.160]   like a bobblehead style system beating question authority,
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:30.840]   question everything mindset,
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:34.160]   it actually starts to be fun again.
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:36.520]   And, you know, less about dread
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:39.760]   and more about this incredible experience
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:42.640]   that you are gonna be able to provide for your kid
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:46.640]   one way or the other that will change their life, right?
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:49.480]   And as much as you may dread letting them go,
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:53.320]   you should also be excited and hopeful about the fact
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:55.360]   that you're able to provide it for them.
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:57.520]   So I don't want this to be a downer.
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:01.000]   I don't want people to be angry by the end of the book.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   I want them to feel ready, right?
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.400]   And I want them to feel excited and jealous, frankly,
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:08.640]   that their kid gets to do this amazing thing.
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.680]   - Well, the name of the book is
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.160]   "The Price You Pay for College,"
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:15.800]   an entirely new roadmap for the biggest financial decision
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:19.040]   your family will ever make by Ron Lieber.

[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:39.640]   you know, those ideas are gold to me.
