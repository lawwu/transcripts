[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   Hello I'm here with Pastor James at the LSB celebration dinner. James can you
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.360]   introduce yourself? Yeah my name is James Coates I'm the pastor at Grace Life
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.920]   Church in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and I'm here for the Shepherds Conference.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.120]   Alright and James you've been reading through the LSB what do you think? Yeah
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.160]   so I'm not all the way through yet. I started in Ezekiel and I'm almost
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.680]   through Revelation and I'm also begun in Genesis and I think it's fantastic. It's
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.000]   it's clearly a careful rendering of the original languages. I think it's the
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.220]   update to the New American Standard that we've all been wanting and and I think
[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.600]   there are some choice portions of scripture where it's evident that the
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.640]   the adjustment was the right adjustment to to more accurately reflect what the
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.420]   text says and so it's been a good study tool. I lean on it for almost every
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.480]   sermon and I'm grateful for the work. Thanks for being with us tonight.
