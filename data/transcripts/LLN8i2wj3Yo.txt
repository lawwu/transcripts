[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   How did he get it done?
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   How did he do it without scandal?
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   I mean, when you think about how the world is in our time,
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   when everything has either a financial scandal
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   or a sexual scandal attached to it,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Moses didn't have scandals.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   He built the Whitestone Bridge, for example,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   which is a gigantic bridge connecting the Bronx to Queens.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   It's beautiful.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   It was finished in the late 1930s on time and under budget,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   actually a little earlier.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   There's no such thing as that now.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   You're going to do a big public works project
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   and you're going to do it on time?
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   And also, he did it well.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   I think Robert Caro deserves a lot of credit
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   for doing research on Moses, his childhood, his growing up.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   I think his legacy will continue to evolve
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   and I think slightly improve as Americans realize
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   that it's hard to build public works,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.800]   especially in dense urban environments, and he did it.
