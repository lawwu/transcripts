[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   I like a lot the sunbelt smart cities. I sort of have a two-factor model of economic growth,
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.800]   which is it's about education, and it's about having governments that are pro-business. The
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.960]   U.S. has historically been better on being pro-business than, let's say, the northern
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.160]   European social democracies, but the northern European social democracies are great on the
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.560]   education front. Within the U.S., you also have this balance, whereas places like Massachusetts
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.520]   and California are certainly much less pro-business, but they're pretty well educated.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.720]   But the sort of real secret sauce is finding those places that are both highly educated and
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.600]   pro-business. So those are places like Charlotte and Austin and even Atlanta, places in the
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.480]   sunbelt that have attracted lots of skilled people, and they've done very, very well during
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.480]   COVID. I mean, Austin, by most dimensions, is the superstar of the COVID era in terms of just
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.880]   attracting people. So I think you had to wait for the real estate prices to come down a bit in
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.780]   in Austin, but those are the places that I would be looking at.
