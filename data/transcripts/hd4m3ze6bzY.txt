[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Well, of course, it is right and fitting for us to talk about praising and glorifying God.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   That's our calling and our great delight.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Our greatest joy is found in magnifying God, so that those two things, our joy and God's glory,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   are not two things, but one mutual aim.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   They're wed together.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   That's what we call Christian hedonism around here.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   So then, is it possible for us to talk about God praising and glorifying us?
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   This seems very awkward, but is it even biblical to go here, to say that God will praise and glorify us?
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   It's a question because you caught off guard one watcher of your "Look at the Book" videos, Pastor John.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Here's the email we got. No name was given.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   "Hello, Pastor John. I was watching one of your 2017 lab videos, the one titled 'To the Glory of God Alone.'
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   I was really confused with something you said near the end of the session at the 15 minute and 47 second mark.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   There you said that 'we' will be praised and glorified.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   I was stunned. I had never heard that before.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   What did you mean that 'we' will be praised and glorified?
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Isn't this for God alone? If not, what Bible verses would help this make sense to me?"
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Let's begin with this biblical principle. It's very important. Listen carefully.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   This biblical principle.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Just as God, in His mysterious providence, governs all the actions of non-Christians
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   in such a way that their bad deeds are still blameworthy, so also He governs all the actions of Christians
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   in such a way that their good deeds are still praiseworthy.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   That's not a presupposition that I bring to the Bible.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   That is a conclusion from thousands of hours of pondering what the Bible actually teaches.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   So we should get out of our minds the thought that any praise that Christians will receive from God
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   is because their good deeds were done without God's decisive enabling power.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Get that out of your mind.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   That good deeds done by Christians were done without God's decisive enabling power.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   All our good deeds are done by His power. That is part of what makes them good.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And they are praiseworthy.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   There are numerous texts which teach that everything a Christian does that is pleasing to God
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   was done by the power of God.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   For example, Hebrews 13.21, the writer says that God equips us with everything good
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   that we may do His will, working in us—this is the key part—working in us that which is pleasing in His sight
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Another example is what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15.10, "By the grace of God I am what I am."
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   And His grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that was with me.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Paul did the work, but the decisive cause was the grace of God.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   One more example, Philippians 2.12, where Paul tells Christians to work out their salvation
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   because it is God who works in them, both the willing and the working of His good pleasure.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   God causes the miraculous willing and working of our good deeds, but we act the miracle.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   He causes it, we act it.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Now, all of that tends to make us think that only God is to be praised for the good that any Christian does.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   It tends to make us think that it would be unfitting for God himself to commend His people,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   to praise His people for their good deeds when He Himself is the decisive cause of those very good deeds.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   But that would be a profoundly unbiblical thing to say.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   This is where human reasoning can so easily go off the rails if it's not magnetized to the iron tracks of all of God's Word.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   And God's Word says plainly and repeatedly that God's imperfect, ever in need of forgiveness people,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   are going to be glorified and commended and praised by God in proportion to the way they lived.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   So let's start with the glorified texts and then look at the praised texts.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Romans 8.30, "Those whom God predestined, He called, and those whom He called, He justified, and those whom He justified, He glorified."
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   That means He's going to make us beautiful, glorious.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   2 Thessalonians 1.11, "We always pray for you that our God may make you worthy of His calling
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   and may fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith by His power,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you."
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Yes, yes, we all know that. Yes, amen.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   "And you might be glorified in Him."
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   That's His glory gets magnified and our glory shines in that process
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   according to the grace, to all of grace, of our God, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   1 Corinthians 15.43, "So it is with the resurrection of the dead.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   What is sown," thinking of our bodies now, the bodies of unbelievers, I mean believers,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   "What is sown in is perishable. What is raised is imperishable.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   What is sown is sown in dishonor. It is raised in glory."
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   You look in the mirror now, it is not glorious.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   You look in the mirror at the resurrection, you will be tempted to worship,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   but you won't because you'll be perfected.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   So 2 Corinthians 3.18 got it all started, "We all, with unveiled face,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   from one degree of glory to another."
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   This comes from the Lord. Yes, of course it does, who is the Spirit,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   but it's glorious. One more.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   The process of 2 Corinthians 3.18 comes to completion in the twinkling of an eye
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   when we see him face to face. 1 John 3.2, "Beloved, we are God's children now,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   and what we will be has not yet appeared, but we know that when he appears,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   we shall be like him because we shall see him as he is."
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   All of those passages unpack what Jesus meant when he said in Matthew 13.43,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   "The righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their father."
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   I'm smiling. Ace of the day.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   So the upshot is that the Holy Spirit is gradually bringing Christians
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   into conformity to the glory of Christ and that when we see Christ face to face,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   this will be completed spiritually at death and physically at the resurrection.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   God not only takes away the guilt of sin, he will take away the ugliness of sin
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   and what will be left will be glory, glory, beauty, glory.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Christ will not be married to a homely bride.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   He died for a homely bride. He's faithful to a homely bride,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   but he is making her glorious. It says that explicitly in Ephesians 5.27,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   "He gave himself for her that he might present the church to himself in splendor."
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   So the final question is, will we, because of our progressive and climactic glorification,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   receive praise from the Lord?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   And the biblical answer, which our friend is stumbling over, is yes.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Matthew 25.21, "His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   You have been faithful over a little. I will set you over much.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Enter into the joy of your master.'
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Faithfulness in this life is acknowledged by the Lord of heaven and commended."
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   1 Corinthians 4.5, "Do not pronounce judgment before the time before the Lord comes,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Then each one will receive his praise from God."
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Now, that's translated "commendation," and that's fine.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Commendation is praise. But the word is "epinos" in Greek.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   That word is used in Ephesians 1, "to the praise of the glory of God's grace."
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Ephesians 1.12, "to the praise of his glory." Ephesians 1.14, "to the praise of his glory."
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   It's the same word that we use to describe what we will say to God, he says to us.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   In other words, it is a fitting, this is what "epinos" is,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   a fitting response of strong approval for something glorious or beautiful.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   There are numerous other places that teach this.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   John 5.44, Romans 2.7, 1 Peter 1.7, but let me just quote one more.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Romans 2.29, "A Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   by the Spirit, not the letter. His praise," so a true Christian, a true Jew in the Messiah Jesus,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   "His praise is not from man, but from God."
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   So my conclusion from all these passages is that genuine Christians will be glorified
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   both progressively in this life and then finally at the second coming,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   and the faithfulness shown to Christ in this life and the beauty completed at the end of this age
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   will receive commendation and admiration from the Lord Jesus himself.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   And this will not contradict the biblical teaching that everything we do by the power of Christ
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   will result in him, not us, getting the ultimate glory and praise and commendation,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   because what Christ will be commending and admiring in us will be the essence of true virtue,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   which is what? What's the essence of true Christian virtue?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   The essence of Christian virtue is our joyful treasuring of God himself in all we do,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   so that God's admiration of our sanctification and glorification is in fact ultimately
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   the admiration of his own merciful workmanship.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Amazing. Thank you for putting all of that together for us, Pastor John.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   And thank you for joining us today. You can ask a question of your own,

[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   A friend of mine in high school drove an old rusty car, and on that old rusty car
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   was a rather snarky bumper sticker on the back. It read, "You're unique."
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   And then in smaller font underneath it said, "Just like everybody else."
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   "You're unique, just like everybody else." It's a witty line, but there's an important question
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   to be asked about human uniqueness. Is human uniqueness defensible from the Bible?
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   According to the Bible, are we each unique? I'll ask Pastor John that next time on Monday.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   I'm your host Tony Reinke. Thanks for joining us, and have a great weekend.
