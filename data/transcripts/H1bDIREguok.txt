[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.880]   The simple question is, can I use this finish line strategy to make the start line a goal
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.800]   and get my system more engaged or motivated?
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.720]   And is there any physiology or physiological changes I should say to reflect the idea that
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.940]   maybe just visually focusing on the start line would actually get me more excited as
[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.680]   opposed to make me less excited to engage in effort?
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.060]   There's certainly vision science that's tied up in that very first stage of goal setting,
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.520]   like identifying what that goal is in the first place and taking those first steps.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.520]   A lot of people's go-to strategies that involve vision are vision boards or dream boards or
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.000]   post-it notes, right?
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.240]   They're creating some sort of visual representation of what it is that they want to accomplish.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.680]   Where is it that I want to be in five years, 10 days, 10 years, whatever that timeline
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.200]   is that they're working under.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.720]   The idea of vision boards or dream boards is that you, almost like a scrapbook, collect
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.200]   visual icons that reflect where you want to be to motivate yourself.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.100]   It's a really common tactic that people use.
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.800]   And it's not bad to do that, right?
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.160]   For some people, just even knowing what they want in life is a major accomplishment, defining
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.800]   the goal can be really challenging for people, and that's a strategy that works and involves
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.960]   our visual experience, right?
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.120]   It's not just, people aren't saying like, "Why don't you just sit around and imagine
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.640]   what you want your life to be like in 10 years?"
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.120]   The strategy that people are suggesting is like, "No, cut out the pictures, put it on
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.680]   a board and stick it by your bathroom mirror so you see it every day."
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.680]   Or make a list.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.680]   Or make a list, yeah.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.680]   People are big on these lists.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.320]   I have a lot of friends who are like, "Have you made your list?"
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.040]   The list of things that you insist on having in the context of fitness, relationship, job,
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.400]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.840]   This seems more and more common now.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.840]   Yeah, totally.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.840]   And the idea, like, write it down, right?
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.040]   They're telling you, "Write it down," or create a visual manifestation of it.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.240]   And so, yeah, that's effective for identifying what you want, but it may not actually be
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.200]   effective for helping you to meet the goal, to get the job done.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.140]   So colleagues of mine at New York University have probed, "Well, why?
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.140]   Why is that?
[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.780]   Why is just thinking about what you want in your life and sort of putting yourself vicariously
[00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.900]   into those shoes, imagining what my life will be like if I can accomplish everything on
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.700]   this list?
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.700]   Why doesn't that work?"
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.700]   Well, first of all, does it work?
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.700]   The answer is no.
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.500]   And why does it not work?
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.500]   Because what happens, these colleagues, Gabrielle Oettingen and her research team have found,
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.660]   is that going through and dreaming about or visualizing how great my life will be when
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.380]   I get X, Y, and Z done, that is like a goal satisfied.
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.260]   I have identified what it is that I want.
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.540]   I have experienced it, even if just in an imaginary way.
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.180]   I've had that positive experience of thinking about how great my life is going to be when
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.300]   I get this thing done, and they start to sort of rest on their laurels.
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.740]   These actually measured systolic blood pressure and heart rate, and they found that people
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.540]   who do that, who go through that experience of visualizing how great my life will be when
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.740]   I get X, Y, and Z done, their systolic blood pressure, the bottom number on your blood
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.060]   pressure reading, decreases.
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.060]   Okay.
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.860]   Now, I'm all about finding ways to relax, especially in New York, right?
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.620]   You're constantly living at a high level of stimulation, and so like, "Cool, great.
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.220]   So maybe I should just like think about how awesome my life will be when I get my bucket
[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.500]   list done," but motivation scientists know that systolic blood pressure is actually an
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.540]   indicator of our body's readiness to get up and act, to do something.
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.980]   Now, that can be the going out for a walk, going out for a run, hitting the gym.
[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.220]   It can also be things like doing math problems, right?
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.620]   Even if it's something that's just mental, systolic blood pressure actually goes up in
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.780]   anticipation of your body or your mind needing to do something, taking the first steps on
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.960]   a goal.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.020]   So then, it helps us to understand of like, "Okay.
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.940]   If I've just created this dream board, this vision board, and put myself psychologically
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.220]   in that space of a goal satisfied, why is it bad that blood pressure goes down?"
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.980]   Because it means your body is chilling out.
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.220]   It's like, "All right.
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.220]   Cool.
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.220]   I just accomplished something pretty major."
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.220]   Right?
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.140]   I actually now don't have the physiological resources at the ready to take the first step
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.480]   right now to do something about that.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.740]   So that was a pretty monumental finding for motivation scientists to understand that creating
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.100]   these dream boards, these vision boards, or to-do lists might actually backfire because
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.620]   it in and of itself is the creation of a goal and the satisfaction of the goal.
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.360]   And then, people understandably give themselves some time to just enjoy that positive experience.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.540]   So much for the secret.
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.540]   Yeah.
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.540]   Exactly.
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.540]   Exactly.
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.660]   I guess now the secret folks will come after me with pitchforks, but-
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.180]   I try to never say the name.
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.180]   Right?
[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.180]   I'm not afraid to say the name.
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.520]   I mean, I imagine that certain strategies might work for other people, but everything
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.640]   you're saying, again, is consistent with what we know about the physiology of dopamine circuits
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.640]   for motivation.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.920]   I have a good friend who, perhaps incidentally, perhaps not, is a cardiologist at a major
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:25.500]   university, said that one of the major errors that people make with book writing and completion
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.940]   is they will tell people they're going to write a book, and people will say, "Oh, you
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.500]   definitely should write a book.
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.500]   Someone's going to love your book."
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.820]   And they never end up writing it.
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.340]   And his theory is that they get so much dopamine reward from that immediate feedback, with
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.380]   all the protection of never having the book criticized, that they never write the book.
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.740]   I'm sure there are exceptions to this, but I guess it raises the question, what's the
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.740]   better strategy?
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.740]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.060]   So, I'm not saying that people who enjoy a dream board creation should stop what they're
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.060]   doing.
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.060]   That's not the take-home message here.
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.060]   Nightmare board?
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.060]   You can-
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.060]   Oh, definitely not that.
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.060]   No.
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.060]   There's enough anxiety and fear in the world.
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.820]   You can't encourage more of it.
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.580]   But the process of goal setting shouldn't stop with articulating what the goal is.
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.020]   So at that same point that we're trying to figure out what do we want to do?
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.320]   What is my vision for the future?
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.940]   In those planning sessions, we need to simultaneously think about a couple other things.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.220]   One is, how are we going to get there?
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.940]   So take it out of the abstract.
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.740]   Take it out of this idyllic visual iconography, and start thinking about the practical day
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.740]   to day.
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.520]   Break it down into more manageable goals, not just my 10-year plan for myself, but my
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.180]   two-week plan.
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.620]   What can I accomplish in the next two weeks and the two weeks after that's going to set
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.620]   me on the right trajectory?
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.140]   That's probably not surprising to anybody who's been thinking about how do I set goals
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.380]   better.
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.380]   Plan big picture.
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.100]   Think big picture abstractly, but then also break it down more concretely.
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.540]   That's probably not surprising, but it's an important aspect of the goal setting process.
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.940]   Then, again, Gabrielle Oettingen in my department has identified a third often overlooked or
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:07.420]   underappreciated stage that has to happen in the goal setting process, and that's thinking
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:13.540]   about the obstacles that stand in your way of success, and that will actually help improve
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.580]   motivation in the long run.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.340]   And sometimes people think that that is counterintuitive.
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.260]   You're saying, if I want to increase my motivation, have more motivation than I need to think
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.860]   about how hard it's going to be, all the ways that I'm going to fail, how is that going
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.860]   to jazz me up?
[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:32.860]   How is that going to help me get through when things get hard?
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:39.360]   But it does because it's like coming up with a plan B, a plan C, plan D in advance of actually
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.980]   experiencing that.
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.700]   If you were on a boat and the boat started to sink, that's not the time you want to start
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.380]   looking for life jackets.
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.540]   You already want to know where one is so you can go to it right away.
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.580]   It's the same thing with goal setting, is that you want to know, what am I working towards?
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.580]   How am I going to get there?
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.420]   And if I experience this obstacle, here's what I'm going to do about it.
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.180]   You may never experience that obstacle, but if you do, you're probably going to be shy
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:07.180]   on time, thin on resources, maybe experiencing an anxiety that hijacks your brain so you're
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.940]   not functioning at that optimal level of judgment and decision making.
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.660]   You want to already have the snap next step in place so you can just hop to it.
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:21.820]   We're not going to do our best thinking when we're in crisis mode, but we don't have to
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:27.300]   if we have already used our resources in advance to come up with that plan B or that plan C.
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:35.860]   [music]
