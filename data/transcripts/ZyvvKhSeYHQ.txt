[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   All right, well, why don't we get technical?
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.480]   We haven't done a good old fashioned habit
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.940]   tune up in a while.
[00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.280]   For those who don't remember the habit tune up segment
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.320]   is one where I take a piece of advice
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.760]   that I have given before,
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.240]   and we just get into the weeds a little bit.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.400]   So let's get into the weeds,
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.360]   get a little bit technical
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.460]   about some specific productivity advice.
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.460]   I have an email related habit to talk about
[00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.640]   in today's segment.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.320]   It's an idea that I first introduced in my book,
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.320]   Deep Work, where I gave it the incredibly compelling
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.980]   and sexy name of process centric email.
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.100]   So what is process centric email?
[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.420]   Let me step back first,
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.620]   my preamble to getting to the tactic here
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.480]   is pushing for a little bit more clarity
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.480]   on the question of what is it about email that we dislike?
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.840]   This is something I think a lot of people get wrong.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.280]   I get a lot of messages from people that say,
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.520]   "Yeah, I love this idea of like digital minimalism
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.980]   because I hate how when I go into my email inbox,
[00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.580]   there's all of these newsletters.
[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.520]   And I'm gonna simplify and unsubscribe
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.920]   from a lot of newsletters."
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.680]   All right, that's fine if you wanna do it.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.760]   Too many newsletters is not your problem with email.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.360]   Other people say, "Yeah, I have all of these announcements
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.080]   and notices and promotional emails from every company
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.280]   that I've ever bought something for.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.200]   My employer sends out 17 announcements a day,
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.080]   new parking things, new programs.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.880]   There's all these announcement emails
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.280]   they clutter up my inbox."
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.480]   Yeah, it's annoying, it's not the problem with email.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.080]   Some people say, "Yeah, everyone is always shooting me
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.720]   these questions.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.840]   Hey, what time is that meeting tomorrow?
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.680]   What about this?
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.280]   And that's annoying.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.360]   Like, can't we just talk next time we see each other?"
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.400]   But short questions that can be answered,
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.640]   you know, two o'clock.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.520]   The client's name is this, here's the link.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.160]   That's also not the problem with email.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.000]   If all of email was a combination of newsletters,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.200]   announcements and promotions,
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.040]   and short questions that could be answered,
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.640]   we would have no problem with our inboxes.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.680]   It really doesn't stress us out that much
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.840]   to see too many newsletters.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.080]   You can just archive.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.400]   It doesn't stress us out that much
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.920]   to see too many promotional announcements,
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.040]   just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, right?
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.240]   You just delete and archive them.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.560]   It's actually kind of fulfilling.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.960]   It's easy to do.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.240]   It feels like you're making progress.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.760]   We don't get stressed out by questions we can answer
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.640]   immediately with a short response.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.240]   It's very productive.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.080]   Let me give you the answer to this.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.920]   Let me give you the answer to this.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.740]   Let me give you the answer to this.
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.680]   If that's all email was, 20 minutes twice a day
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.720]   would be on top of it.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.320]   There'd be a little burst of productivity.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.440]   It would be something that'd be positive.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.600]   The real productivity poison that's frothing around
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.520]   in that email inbox is messages that initiate
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.440]   back and forth interaction.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.840]   That is above all else, the source of almost every
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.640]   piece of cognitive distress that we feel from email.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.120]   Not a newsletter, not an announcement,
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.240]   not what time is the meeting tomorrow.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.940]   It's the email that says,
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.320]   "We should probably make a plan
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.320]   "for the client coming tomorrow."
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.920]   Or, "What are we gonna do to get this thing ready
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.460]   "for next Monday?"
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.000]   The message that is gonna begin back and forth,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.600]   back and forth, like, "Well, when should we do that?
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.440]   "And what about next week?
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.640]   "Oh, next week doesn't work.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.800]   "Let me CC in Jesse and ask him if he remembers
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.640]   "when this has..."
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.080]   Back and forth, back and forth.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.200]   Unscheduled, ad hoc, back and forth,
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.340]   interactive conversation delivered through emails,
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.120]   working towards trying to figure out something
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.160]   or achieve some goal.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.720]   That is the main productivity poison in our inboxes.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.780]   Why?
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.560]   It brings with it two demands.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.620]   One, that's more than anything else
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.300]   what keeps you coming back to your inbox again
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.140]   and again and again,
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.460]   because you have to service
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.420]   these back and forth conversations.
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.460]   If five messages have to get back and forth
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.780]   before we can get a resolution,
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.860]   and we need that resolution by the end of the day,
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.280]   I can't wait three hours for message number two,
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.700]   'cause we have to fit in all five messages.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.100]   So back and forth conversations
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.260]   require much more frequent inbox checking.
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.220]   'Cause I gotta see when the latest message comes in
[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.460]   so I can bounce it back.
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:17.660]   And you gotta see when that comes in
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.560]   so you can bounce it back to me.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.680]   And I have to see that pretty soon after and bounce it back.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.000]   We check our inboxes all the time,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.960]   not because we know there's new newsletters in there,
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.720]   not because there's promotions from Levi's we wanna see,
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.440]   it's because we have back and forth conversations
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.580]   we have to service.
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.980]   The second reason why these are productivity poison
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.480]   is that these are the conversations
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.040]   that bring with it the dreaded ambiguity.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.040]   I don't know how to answer this.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.920]   It's where you get the,
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.400]   can you figure out how to fix this issue
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.460]   we have with the budget?
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.320]   And you're like, I don't know how to do that.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.040]   And now I guess I can afford this as someone else
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.980]   or I'll do obligation hot potato
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.860]   and shoot off a question to someone else
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.920]   just to get it off my plate and wait for it to come back.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.560]   I have to like talk to different people
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.560]   and see what they tell me.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.560]   You've created, they create these major open loops
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.800]   in terms of our obligation storage systems.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.800]   And it's a real source of stress and distress.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.360]   If you feel anxious checking your inbox,
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.360]   going through your inbox,
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.800]   these are the type of messages that create that anxiety.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.080]   They're like, oh my God, I don't know.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.280]   I don't know how to fix the budget.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.120]   I don't really know how this works.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.060]   I don't even really know who I should talk to about this.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.420]   Oh, I guess I'm gonna have to start sending messages
[00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.020]   and like kind of letting this thing unfold
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.920]   and keep checking this throughout the day.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.980]   So those are the productivity poison.
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.980]   So if you wanna make your experience
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:31.940]   with your inbox better,
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.660]   it is these back and forth interactive ambiguous
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.820]   conversations that you have to tame.
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.740]   That is what process centric emailing is all about.
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.540]   The idea is simple.
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.400]   When you see a message arrive,
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.520]   that is initiating one of these long back and forths,
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.540]   your first entrance into this conversation,
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.260]   your first message into this conversation
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.380]   should include in it a proposal
[00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.180]   for the process by which this whole collaboration
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.540]   ending in the goal being achieved
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.820]   in this conversation is going to happen.
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.660]   You say how it's gonna happen.
[00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.220]   So it doesn't just default to like,
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.900]   let's just keep going back and forth.
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.420]   You declare this is how I think this should happen.
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.440]   Oh, we have to figure out what to do about this client.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.080]   Okay, well, here's what I suggest.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.720]   We have this meeting coming up on Wednesday.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.480]   Let's add time to talk to that.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.320]   I'm gonna, before we get to that meeting,
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.760]   talk to Susan to make sure that we understand
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.320]   the full whatever, the full process
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.040]   for what we need to do to onboard the client.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.480]   We'll talk about this in the last five minutes
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.960]   of the meeting and make a plan going forward.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.600]   Or you say, okay, here's what we need to do.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.440]   You're right.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.080]   We have to figure out when we're gonna meet.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.560]   Here's what we'll do.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.680]   I have listed here, whatever, 15 times.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.440]   Jesse, you then highlight the times that work for you
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.740]   and then you forward it onto the third person
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.820]   and you select one of those that works
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.180]   and put that just into an invite and send it to all of us.
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.680]   And we don't even have to discuss anymore.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.160]   What I'm talking about here is processes
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160]   that gets the thing done.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.880]   The thing that this conversation is gonna lead towards
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.080]   gets you to done without ambiguity
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.560]   and without having to just wait for messages to arrive
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.660]   and respond to them and go back and forth.
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.600]   Process-centric emailing is a little bit stilted.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.700]   It's not very casual.
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.320]   So typically the people who use this
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.400]   will have a casual message with emoticons
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.560]   and all the other stuff,
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.400]   but then have the pretty detailed thing below.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.160]   You can blame it on me.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.240]   So sorry for the formality.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.400]   I've been listening to much Cal Newport, but it works.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.920]   And it takes a little bit more time up front
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.840]   because you have to figure out,
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.040]   what's the right way to get to done?
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.800]   What's the right way to get the done here?
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.240]   And you gotta think it through
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.600]   and you gotta explain it to people
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.600]   and you might have some extra work to do to set it up.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.840]   Here's the Google doc, here's the doodle,
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.440]   here's how it's gonna unfold.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.440]   I've set up an office hours.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.640]   It takes more work,
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.800]   but it is almost always worth spending 10 or 15 more minutes
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.480]   at the beginning of an exchange
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.540]   than it is to have 10 or 15 messages you have to respond to.
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.920]   10 or 15 minutes right now
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.840]   takes away 10 or 15 minutes from your day,
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.640]   but 10 to 15 messages,
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.120]   each of which is requiring five inbox checks
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.080]   while you wait for it,
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.400]   that's gonna be 50 to 75 inbox checks over the next few days
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.720]   which is way more damaging
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.000]   than you adding 10 minutes right now to what you're doing.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.360]   So I'm a big believer in process-centric emailing.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.880]   And of course, if you find yourself,
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.760]   it's a bonus,
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.400]   proposing the same process again and again
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.200]   because the same type of work happens again and again,
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.660]   then you can just codify that.
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.700]   You know what?
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.940]   We do this client onboarding all the time.
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.240]   Why don't we all just agree this is how we do it?
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.480]   And so you don't even have to write out
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.460]   the whole process every time.
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.820]   So it's also a good way to unearth
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.740]   or make legible repeated work and get good processes in place
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:54.580]   so just remember that.
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.520]   Ongoing interactive conversations,
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.320]   that is the thing that kills us in our inbox.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.960]   That's the thing you should care about.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.200]   That is the thing you should be willing to do
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.560]   almost anything to vanquish.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.280]   It really is productivity poison.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.720]   (upbeat music)
