[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   Merry Christmas to you all and depending on where you listen, perhaps Sunday night on
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.040]   Christmas Eve you're listening or on Christmas Day, either way, from all of us at DesiringGod.org,
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.400]   I want to wish you a very Merry Christmas.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.640]   Thank you for listening to the podcast and making it a part of your day.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.700]   We really appreciate it.
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.280]   And this, of course, is the season to reckon with the fact that Almighty God became little
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.160]   boy.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.540]   And not only that, Jesus grew up and He matured, which leads to this question from a listener
[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.540]   named Tina.
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.600]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.160]   I need your help.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.680]   Can you explain to me Hebrews chapter 5, verses 8 and 9?
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.780]   Particularly this Christmas season, I want to better understand the early years after
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.620]   the Incarnation, specifically how Jesus learned obedience and had to be made perfect as a
[00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.820]   child.
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.700]   These verses make it sound like Jesus wasn't fully God and fully human, but that He had
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.820]   to work His way to perfection and obedience.
[00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.380]   So what does human maturity look like in Jesus, the little boy?"
[00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.280]   Okay, I did a whole "Ask Pastor John" on these two verses, Hebrews 5, 8 and 9, June 2016.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:26.460]   So let me just give the conclusion of that effort and then tackle, I think, what she's
[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.140]   most curious about, namely Jesus as a boy.
[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.140]   Here's the verse.
[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:40.180]   "Although He was a son," this is Hebrews 5, 8, "although He was a son, He learned obedience
[00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:47.140]   through what He suffered, and being made perfect, He became the source of eternal salvation
[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.100]   to all who obey Him."
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:58.740]   Now this same book of Hebrews says Christ was tempted in every way, yet without sin.
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.940]   So learning obedience from what He suffered and being made perfect don't mean that He
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.220]   moved from being in a state of sin to being in a state of sinless perfection.
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.740]   That's what they don't mean, because this author makes clear He never sinned.
[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.620]   Well what do they mean then?
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.740]   What does it imply?
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.940]   That He learned obedience.
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.220]   What they mean is this.
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.420]   He learned obedience not in the sense that He moved from disobedience to obedience, but
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:39.220]   that He moved from untested or untried obedience to fully tested, fully tried obedience.
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.100]   So He was being tested at every point and proving Himself obedient at every point,
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.700]   like you'd be giving a person a test and he gets an A on every one.
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.380]   It's not like, "Oh, He proved His obedience by getting all A's, so He must have had B's."
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.380]   No.
[00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.580]   You can get an A on every test if you're Jesus.
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.420]   And He was made perfect doesn't mean that He moved from sinful imperfection to sinless
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:13.340]   perfection, but that He moved from incomplete obedience to full, complete, total life of
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.100]   finished obedience that fitted Him perfectly for His great sacrifice.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:27.020]   So the question that Tina is asking, I think, is what we can know about this younger, less
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.380]   mature, less complete person, Jesus Christ, as a youth.
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.100]   So let's read it.
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:40.500]   Let's read the one story, the one story that we have in Luke 2, 40 to 52.
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.420]   We get one glimpse into this boy's life, and here it is.
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.580]   And the child grew and became strong and filled with wisdom, and the favor of God was upon
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.580]   him.
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.660]   Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the Passover, and when he
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.960]   was twelve years old, they went up according to custom.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.220]   And when the feast was ended, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.220]   Jerusalem.
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.020]   His parents did not know it, but supposing him to be in the group, they went a day's
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.220]   journey and then they began to search for him among the relatives and acquaintances.
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.100]   And when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem searching for him.
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.440]   After three days, they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.420]   and asking them questions.
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:35.580]   And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.180]   And when his parents saw him, they were astonished.
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.940]   And his mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us so?
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.380]   Behold, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress."
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.460]   And he said to them, "Why were you looking for me?
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.620]   Did you not know I must be in my father's house?"
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.060]   Or about my father's business.
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:06.540]   It's sort of my father's things, and you have to decide what particular is meant there.
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.020]   My father's business, my father's house.
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.900]   And they did not understand the saying that he spoke to them.
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.520]   And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was submissive to them.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.980]   And his mother treasured up all these things in her heart.
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.580]   And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and men.
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:33.660]   Now I see four things that you can say about Jesus as a boy from this.
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:40.380]   Number one, Jesus was sufficiently intelligent and articulate and informed in the Scriptures
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.320]   so that he could interact with the temple teachers so as to amaze them.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:52.300]   Number two, when asked why he stayed behind in the temple, he answered, "This is my father's
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.180]   house," or "This is my father's business."
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.340]   In other words, "This is my real calling," not carpentry.
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.460]   Joseph's house and Joseph's business is not mine.
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:10.340]   God is my ultimate father, not the carpenter Joseph, and I'm going to be back here in some
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.500]   years to show these teachers how I came to fulfill these Scriptures.
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:22.420]   Number three, he was submissive to his parents in a way that did not compromise his calling
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.780]   and did not compromise their authority.
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:32.900]   And number four, he grew in wisdom and stature in a way that won favor with people and with
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.900]   God.
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.140]   And I would add a fifth, not from this passage, but from Hebrews 4.15, 1 Peter 2.22, 1 John
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.900]   3.5, John 8.46, 2 Corinthians 5.21.
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.740]   In all his life, he never sinned.
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.860]   He was sinless all through his boyhood and young adulthood.
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:59.740]   But here is the most striking and probably the most important thing to realize.
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:09.020]   In the four accounts of Jesus' life—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—this is the only glimpse
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:16.800]   into this young boyhood or any of his life up till he was 30 years old.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.940]   The Gospels are not ordinary biographies.
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.300]   What a weird biography.
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.380]   He was born and he turned 30.
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:31.860]   They focus almost entirely on the last three years of Jesus' life.
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.340]   And the question is, why?
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:42.940]   And I assume it's because if the Gospel writers included lots of stories about his
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:51.140]   boyhood, they would be seriously distracting from what he came to be and do.
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:56.900]   They would stir up unhelpful curiosity about things that are not crucial.
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:07.480]   So it seems to me that the vast silence, the vast silence about Jesus' first 30 years
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:15.580]   is like putting a huge megaphone to the last three years of his life, saying, "Look at
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.580]   this!
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:17.580]   Look at this!
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:24.940]   Linger over this, and surely that is what we should do this Christmas."
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:33.980]   Glory in the arrival of Jesus as the God-man, and then do what Paul did in Philippians 2:8.
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:34.980]   This is amazing.
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:39.460]   I wonder if everybody's listening who has ever thought about this when they read verse
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.460]   8.
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:47.940]   Here is Paul's summary from manger to crucifixion of the life of Jesus in one verse.
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.940]   Here it goes.
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:58.820]   "Being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to death, even death on
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:08:59.820]   a cross."
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:00.820]   Period.
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.540]   Found in human form, manger.
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.660]   Next main event, cross.
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.460]   Amazing.
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:15.060]   And I think that's the way we should celebrate Christmas.
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:19.940]   Every carol, every candle, every present, every meal, every mistletoe, every manger
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:26.260]   scene catapulting us over 30 years to the cross.
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.780]   That's why he came.
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.580]   That's why it is a merry, merry Christmas.
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.780]   "Behold, I bring you good news of great joy."
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:42.420]   Good news, good news of great, great, great joy that will be for all the people.
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:52.460]   "Unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, and the way he saved was at
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.460]   the cross."
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.460]   Amen.
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.460]   What a great place to wrap up and end for Christmas.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:04.100]   And again, Pastor John and I want to wish you all a very happy Christmas as you reflect
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:10.460]   on the glories of Jesus Christ from the cradle to the cross, from Bethlehem to Calvary.
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.620]   What a sobering thought and what a sobering connection.
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.540]   I am your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.580]   We will see you on Wednesday.
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.100]   [END]
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.100]   1.
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.100]   What a sobering thought and what a sobering connection.
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.100]   I am your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.100]   We will see you on Wednesday.
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:21.100]   [END]
