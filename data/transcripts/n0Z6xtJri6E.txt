[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.160]   [music]
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.440]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue after a short holiday hiatus. We're back. I'm joined, as
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.080]   always, by Duncan Hill. Duncan, do you subscribe to the Larry David theory that you can only
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.960]   say "Happy New Year" three days after the New Year, or are you still saying it?
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.760]   Hill: I'm a little more weeny. I think you can say it for a week.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.320]   Lewis: Okay. Alright. Remember, this is our show where we take questions straight from
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.760]   the viewers. So, if you have a question for us, email us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.400]   We're also getting some good feedback. You might have missed it over the holidays. I
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.000]   think two days before Christmas, we had a show with Jonathan Novy talking about annuities
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.400]   and got some good feedback on this. I think it goes to the psychology of investing. We
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.000]   were talking about annuities. Jonathan made the point that when you put your money with
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.560]   an annuity, the majority of the time, you're getting your money back for the first 15,
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.120]   20, 25 years. Looking at it that way, a lot of people emailed in and said, "I've never
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.980]   thought about it that way." You could say, "That's a terrible deal. I don't get returns
[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.880]   until after my whole money is paid back." But a lot of it is just psychology. I think
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.320]   that's the whole thing about investing as it is. It's just so much depends on tricking
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.840]   yourself into sticking with a plan. It's not that annuities are good or bad. It's just
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.760]   it depends how much you need that psychological component to help you stay on course. It doesn't
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.520]   have to be all or nothing, but I just wanted to touch on that because we had a lot of comments
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.280]   on that, surprisingly. Annuities, hot topic. Who knew? Anyway. Alright, Duncan, let's go.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.040]   What do we got?
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.680]   Okay. So, first up, we have a short and sweet one, but a very interesting one. Can you help
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.720]   me understand where we are with total market cap over GDP, the Buffett Indicator, and what
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.480]   this could mean for the market going forward?
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.000]   Alright, let's start with a definition here. Good question. In 2001, in an interview with
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.240]   Carol Loomis, Warren Buffett laid out the Buffett Indicator. It was just comparing the
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.640]   market cap of the U.S. stock market to U.S. GDP. He said at the time, I found this old
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.520]   piece, and he said, "The ratio of certain limitations and telling you what you need
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.360]   to know still is probably the single best measure of where valuations stand at any given
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.040]   moment." And as you can see, nearly two years ago, the ratio rose to an unprecedented level.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.520]   That should have been a very strong warning signal. Now, that level was 150%. So, stocks
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.320]   were worth 150% more than GDP at the time. This is 1999, late '99, early 2000. The tech
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.880]   bubble had blown to epic proportions, and then it burst. And so, Buffett was looking
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.840]   back at it after the fact, saying, "Look, if we would have just looked at this level,
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.200]   everyone should have known. Stocks were wildly overvalued." Now, John, let's do a chart
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.440]   on it and see where we stand today. So, this is the Buffett Indicator today. You can see,
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.280]   today's value just dwarfed '99. '99 is 150%. We're now well over 200%, something like 220%,
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.480]   I think, on the Buffett Indicator. So, a lot of people think, "Well, wait. Buffett said
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.240]   this is the single best indicator of stock valuations, and now it's way, way higher."
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.040]   You can see, they drew like this, where I found this, they drew a historical trend line
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.880]   here, showing that it's just way off-trend. So, what is this telling us? Basically, the
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.200]   stock market is around $50 trillion right now. $23 trillion GDP. Stocks are worth way
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.640]   more than the economy. I do want to preface this with the fact that Buffett was asked
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.640]   about this again in 2017, saying, "Hey, you said this in 2001. What do you think about
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.120]   it today?" Here's what he said, and I quote this. "Every number has some degree of meaning.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.960]   It means more sometimes than others. They can be important, meaning this valuation.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.440]   Sometimes they can be almost unimportant. It's just not quite as simple as having one
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.080]   or two formulas and then saying the market is undervalued or overvalued." I think there's
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.140]   a reason Buffett kind of changed his tune on this one, because things have changed.
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.200]   The question is, you could be one of those people saying, "Every time I see a valuation
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.120]   higher than the past, I think bubble, bubble, bubble. Get out, get out, get out." Other
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.240]   people say, "Well, context is more important than anything." And I'm a context guy. But
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.040]   you still have to wonder, why is this happening? So, John, put this other chart on. This one
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.120]   is from J.P. Morgan, actually. And this shows the ratio of total U.S. financial assets,
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.080]   so this includes bonds and other assets, to GDP. And you can see, throughout the '50s,
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.000]   '60s, and '70s, and even '80s, it was kind of just staying in this band two to three
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.040]   times. Now it's shot up to 5.6 times GDP. So even if you say, "Okay, maybe this doesn't
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.600]   mean we're in an epic bubble like '99," what is going on here? How is this happening? I
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.760]   think there's some reasons, if people are worried about the Buffett indicator, to kind
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.480]   of put it into context. So the first one is easy. The stock market is not the economy.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.000]   I think that's probably more true now than ever. I mean, just think about how powerful
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.520]   corporations are, especially now than they were in the past. Think about how important
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.880]   some of these companies were during the pandemic to keeping your life going, how big some of
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.800]   these companies are. Apple, and Amazon, and Google, and Microsoft are basically their
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.640]   own economies these days. And they're not just based in the U.S. anymore, like they
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.960]   were back in the '50s and '60s. These are global companies. So we're dealing with global
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.200]   earnings now. It's not just the U.S. John, let's do the next chart here. This shows the
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.480]   asset allocation by household to U.S. stocks. This is from an old post by the pseudonymous
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.640]   Jesse Livermore on philosophical economics. I come back to this often. This shows household
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.760]   allocation to equities. Now, you can see here where I circled. This is in the '70s and '80s,
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.960]   and the allocation to equities by households was like 25 to 30%. Very, very low. Then in
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.860]   the '90s, it finally shot up, and now we're back to those levels, but still like 50, 55%.
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.480]   So still relatively low. So the thing is, a lot of people just didn't own that many
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.840]   stocks in the past. And there was reasons for this. There was higher rates back then,
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.140]   and higher inflation. It was harder to invest. And then in 1978, we had the 401(k) plan was
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.800]   born. So pretty much before 1980, there was no such thing as a 401(k) plan. Target date
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.520]   funds are only 10 years old. Interest rates have fallen a ton. So it's easy to never be
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.440]   invested in stocks. So it makes sense. People are pouring money in all the time. Now we
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.200]   have 50 to 60% of the country that's invested in stocks, where back in the '80s, it was
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.720]   like closer to 20%. I put this out to some of my finance people to understand, what is
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.560]   going on here? A few of the reasons people gave were that we had this huge IPO boom in
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.400]   the '90s. And you think back to the '80s and '70s, you had all these private companies
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.560]   where all the wealth was tied up for rich people. Now all that wealth is in public companies.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.880]   The richest people in the world all own public companies that they started, and they IPO'd,
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.440]   and they've seen all their spoils from that. Think of how many mom-and-pop shops used to
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.980]   be around that are now just Walmarts and Targets and Starbucks. And also, it would be hard
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.760]   not to mention globalization here. It's so much easier for foreigners to buy U.S. assets
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.240]   as well. So, it's more of a global world. I think you'd be foolish to say that stocks
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.960]   aren't way above previous valuation levels at any valuation metric you're looking at
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.440]   now. But I think trying to compare that number to '99 and say it's exactly the same thing
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.040]   is tough. And even Buffett himself has said he's not quite as worried about it. And maybe
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.680]   you need some context with these things, especially as the markets and environment change. Duncan,
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.000]   have you heard of this one before? Buffett Indicator?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.480]   Duncan: No. This was a new one to me. That's why I was asking the chat if everyone had
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.680]   heard of it before. So, yeah. Interesting stuff. I didn't realize that Target date funds
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.880]   were that new. I thought that you were investing in them as a kid. I thought that was the jerk.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.720]   Lewis: Well, they've been around, but it's probably only been eight to ten years ago
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.720]   that they were set as a default option for 401(k) plans. So now there's $1.5-$2 trillion
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.560]   in these things, and they're automatically being invested and then rebalancing. I just
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:30.000]   think this wave of money that is so just on autopilot now didn't exist in the past.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.160]   Buffett Indicator? Yeah. No, that makes sense.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.840]   Lewis: Alright, let's do the next one.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.600]   Buffett Indicator? Cool. The next one is one that everyone's talking about right now, which
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:43.080]   is buying a car right now. I'm a first-time car buyer, and I've noticed that the prices
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:49.240]   in New York City are insane. A Toyota RAV4 costs as much to lease as a BMW with the markup
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.040]   on these vehicles. I feel like it's almost impossible to justify purchasing right now.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.520]   Any thoughts on what to do in this environment and what figures one should calculate to ensure
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.440]   a fair deal? Leasing terms are confusing, and I would appreciate any guidance you could
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.440]   share.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.840]   Lewis: Alright, and this is not just new cars. I think used cars are probably even crazier.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.920]   So, John, let's do a chart on used cars. This is the CPI index for used cars and trucks.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:16.560]   Look at that jump. It's insane. I recently had to turn in a lease at the end of last
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.680]   year, and the value they put on our used car that was three years old was more than we
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.160]   paid for it. So, brand new. The used car value was more. Three years later, after all three
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.200]   of my kids demolished the car, they still gave us more than we paid. That's because
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:37.240]   new car prices have gone up. I want to get into the lease versus buy deal first, because
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.600]   personal finance people are going to hate me, but I've been leasing my car for the past
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.920]   six years or so. This would have been sacrilege to 25-year-old Ben.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.640]   O'Reilly: People get really worked up about this.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.640]   Lewis: Yes, people do. I want to give my reasons why I lease first. One of them, I just mentioned
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:56.960]   I have kids. They destroy my car. Cheerios and goldfish in every crevice of my car. I
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.040]   like car companies taking that risk instead of me. I'm not a huge car person. I don't
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.960]   get a high-end model, but I do like to drive a newish car every few years. I think new
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.440]   car smell is one of the top five smells in the world. I mean, easily. Duncan, right?
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.780]   I think technology is improving so fast in these cars that it's almost like averaging
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:17.400]   up in bonds with rising rates. You're getting better technology every time you get a new
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.340]   car. The other thing is, I don't put a ton of miles on my car. My office is like five
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:25.420]   minutes from my house, so I'm not driving it a ton. It's a lower payment than if I bought.
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:29.320]   I know this is factored into it, but I'm not going to own the car and drive it past the
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.520]   date of the loan, which makes sense for a lot of people in terms of owning a car.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:38.060]   I've driven a ton of used cars in the past. They all cost way more money for upkeep and
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.880]   maintenance and repairs. I've gone through alternators and transmissions and new tires
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.920]   and radiators and new brakes and all this stuff. You name it, I've probably replaced
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.920]   it and spent way more money than I ever would have thought. So that's one of the reasons
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.280]   I lease. I understand why people buy and own a car for the long term. If you don't have
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:59.000]   a car payment, if you own it past the length of the loan, you're essentially giving yourself
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.700]   free monthly payments. I get that.
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.600]   But there actually has been someone who did the numbers on this. So this guy, Jesse Kramer,
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.440]   emailed us into Animal Spirits and we talked about this a few months ago. He wrote this
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.600]   blog post called "The Cost of Car Ownership." He decided to break down what is the break-even
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.640]   level here. When does it matter if you're buying a car and what are the things that
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.680]   you want to look at? Here's a few of the factors that he said matter. How long you drive it.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.080]   So of course, the longer you drive it, the more you want to own. The shorter you drive
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.640]   it, the lease makes sense. He said cars typically depreciate 10% per year. I think 10% when
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:36.520]   you drive it right off a lot, which good luck with that. He said the average cost of owning
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:41.580]   a car, if you wanted to do this yourself, is in the range of 35 to 65 cents per mile
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:45.560]   over the life of a vehicle. That includes things like registration, insurance, gas,
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.560]   all this other stuff, maintenance.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.320]   He said when you add in all this, the gas, registration, insurance, maintenance, you
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:55.680]   could be looking at an all-in cost over the life of a car if you drive it to 100,000 miles
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:02.240]   of, say, $90,000 versus a $30,000 vehicle. He said that there's probably like a 5 cent
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.440]   per mile premium for leasing versus buying. But the upside is totally taken away if you
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.440]   have a catastrophic repair and maintenance, you know. So anyway, I think right now is
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.560]   probably the hardest time to buy a car. And if you want to find one thing in the economy
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.320]   that could be transitory for inflation, I think it has to be cars. Because there's a
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.560]   reason there's so few cars on the lots when you go to look for inventory. They can't produce
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.760]   enough of these chips anymore to get the cars off the lot. So they have all these cars.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.620]   I know this in Detroit. They have all these cars sitting there ready to go on the lots,
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:38.060]   but they don't have any of the technology to put in them to make them function, basically.
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.680]   So eventually when that happens, you're going to see a lot of this come off the inventory.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.040]   And this is one of the reasons used cars cost much right now, because there's just such
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.800]   a lack of inventory for new cars. So I think you have to ask yourself, like, are you going
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.560]   to drive a lot? Do you want to trade up to a car every few years? Do you plan on driving
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.600]   it well past the time it's paid off? That's the only reason it makes sense to buy. If
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.800]   you're going to take out a six-year loan and get a new car in five years, owning it doesn't
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.920]   seem to make sense, because you get a lower payment with a lease. I will say this. It's
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.160]   really difficult to negotiate right now, because inventory is so low. So you're probably going
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.040]   to have a hard time finding exactly what you're looking for. If you can put it off, I would
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.440]   probably wait. It's one of those things where if you wait to buy a house, maybe in a few
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.560]   years you're going to have a hard time finding it at a lower price. But with a car, I think
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.800]   that's reasonable to think. So if you can wait, I think it makes sense. Duncan, do you
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:26.000]   have a car in New York? Yeah, I do. Parking for you probably costs more than your monthly
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.600]   payment, right? Well, we street park, so we just have to move the car every week for all
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.960]   street parking in the middle of the day. It's a mess. It's terrible. I hate it. We looked
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:42.080]   for one for my wife, and the lot was empty. Usually you go inside one of these dealerships
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.640]   and it's full of cars. You can look at the new models, and they're spiffy and brand new.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.800]   There were zero cars inside the actual dealership. It was empty. It looked like the place had
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.200]   been ransacked. So yeah, I think it's a really hard time. I think if you can wait, it probably
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.920]   makes sense. Yeah, it seems like it, with all that in mind.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:02.680]   All right, let's do the next one. Okay. Up next, we have a long one, but a good
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.600]   one. I think a lot of people will benefit from this. What's the difference between a
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:12.000]   wealth manager, a financial advisor, a premium banking/brokerage rep, and an accountant?
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.260]   How does one know which of these they need? For instance, I've been pitched by financial
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.240]   advisors before, but never really considered it. I'm in my 40s and have a middle to upper
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.680]   middle income. Could someone like me benefit from an advisor? What about an accountant?
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.840]   Should I not be ignoring the calls and emails I get from premium division units of my bank
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:33.760]   and brokerage? Are there other types of financial services that a person like me ought to consider?
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.760]   The gist of this question is basically, when should you seek out help from a financial
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.960]   professional, and then how do you gauge which one to use? I think a lot of that is circumstantial,
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.360]   but I have some thoughts here. I wanted to bring in an actual financial advisor to help
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.560]   here because she's dealing with this on a daily basis. Blair Duquene, who's been on
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:54.940]   the show before, is going to come help. Blair is dealing with clients on a daily basis,
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:59.840]   her current clientele, and then prospects as well. Blair, if you had to sum it up in
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.960]   four or five different buckets, I guess, what are some of the main reasons people come to
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:10.400]   you for financial advice? What gets them to make a decision to do this?
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:15.400]   Yeah, absolutely. I think the number one reason not to hire a financial advisor is because
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:20.320]   somebody is trying to sell you on their financial services. That is not a reason. We do see
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:26.080]   a few reasons for why people want to have a professional helping them out with those
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:32.020]   financial decisions. There's really no magic age, no magic net worth, no magic circumstance
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:36.960]   in which you must hire a financial advisor. In fact, Vanguard found years ago that 25%
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.560]   of investors are already do-it-yourselfers and they do just fine. Today, there are plenty
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:46.200]   of tools and software out there where if you are that do-it-yourselfer, you can probably
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:51.380]   make it all the way through. It's a matter of preference. With TurboTax, I could do my
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.600]   own taxes. I prefer not to. I see many high net worth investors still doing their own
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:00.160]   taxes and they're not really making mistakes. At the end of the day, you may be one of those
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.840]   people who never needs financial advice. Here are the reasons that we see people coming
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:10.160]   to us. The number one is their life has become too complicated. They're too busy. Working
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.320]   parents fall into this, busy professionals. I've seen people with cash just piling up
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.360]   in their bank account simply because they didn't have time to invest it. If things are
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.720]   just becoming overwhelming from a time perspective, that's when an advisor can come in and make
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.760]   sure that they're taking care of that for you. We all have administrative duties, whether
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.480]   it's work, family, household chores, and all those administrative items, especially finances
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.200]   seem to get pushed to the back. If it's not getting done, that's probably a good reason
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:35.960]   to look out for help.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.400]   Maxwell: I think people like us in finance probably take for granted that some people
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.160]   just don't care about this stuff as much as we do. We pay attention to this stuff on a
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.520]   daily basis. Some people, it's like watching paint dry. They just don't care and they would
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.720]   rather outsource it to someone, right?
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.840]   Craig: Exactly. Another reason that people come to us are major life changes and events.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:57.360]   Marriage, birth of a child, divorce, death of a family member or spouse, even personal
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:03.560]   health issues. Those reasons can trigger wanting to bring in an outside professional to help
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:08.480]   with a more complicated situation. Maybe the spouse has died. They used to handle the finances.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.000]   Those types of reasons are pretty common.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.520]   Another one that we're seeing a lot recently are retirees who are sick of spending the
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:19.480]   time to do it themselves and they want to hand that over and go and enjoy their life.
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.120]   It's really just taking up too much time. They don't want to watch CNBC anymore. They're
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.400]   tired of being tied to the markets and so they want to come in and bring a professional.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:34.200]   Then I think the last one is really the people who know that for behavioral reasons, we all
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.720]   succumb to fear and greed and emotions, but there are some people that just know themselves
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:43.040]   and they know that they are going to need an advisor to help them not make a mistake.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:48.960]   That can pertain to anybody at any income level, any asset level, at any age. Unfortunately,
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.640]   sometimes it takes making mistakes for people to really have that realization about themselves.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:58.360]   It doesn't apply to everybody, but there are some that really do value that behavioral
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:03.880]   component that an objective professional can provide to them. Those are common reasons.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.080]   Yeah, some people aren't ready until they do make those mistakes and they realize, "Okay,
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.320]   I need to get my hands off the steering wheel."
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:12.360]   I think another one, a good one is, especially even for those DIY people who have all the
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.120]   tools today, if they have the rest of their family, so they're planning for their kids
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:20.760]   or their spouse that doesn't pay attention as much as they do, especially as you retire,
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.400]   "What happens if something happens to me? What if I get hit by a bus tomorrow? Who's
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.800]   going to handle the finances for my family?" I think that's another thing where it's almost
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.240]   like a backup plan where you have someone waiting in the wings to help out if you can't
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.240]   do it anymore.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.800]   Exactly. I mean, I just traveled with my husband together on a plane. We left our children
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:43.840]   behind and I realized I needed to write down a list of just in case. Yes, there are people
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:48.120]   that have the foresight to say, "I'm handling this for the whole family. If something were
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.600]   to happen to me, that's a big risk. Let's go ahead and bring in an outside objective
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.560]   professional advisor to help us out with that."
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.240]   I think if my wife and I were on a plane and it went down, the number one thing my kids
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.800]   would be looking for is who can get them a snack fastest because that's what they see
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.520]   is my job for them is who can get them a snack. All right, let's do one more question here,
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.520]   Duncan.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:13.480]   Okay. Last but not least, question about 401(k) loans. If I have $40,000 in my 401(k) and
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:19.140]   choose to take a loan of $20,000, does my active balance continue to be $40,000 or does
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:23.320]   it drop to whatever my balance is as I repay? In other words, do I continue to grow the
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.560]   original $40,000 or does the working balance drop to $20,000?
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.380]   I've never actually taken out a 401(k) loan or gone through this, so I'm a little unfamiliar
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.800]   with it. I know the reason a lot of people say that it makes sense to do this because
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:40.080]   you say, "Well, I'm borrowing from myself here. What's the harm?" Blair, how does this
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.680]   process actually work?
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:47.040]   Yeah, this questioner hit the nail on the head and this is the part of taking a 401(k)
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.280]   loan that many people miss. Everybody says, "I know I've got to pay interest, but I'm
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:54.400]   going to be paying it back to myself. It's all good." But you are taking that money out
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:59.480]   of the market. So not only are you having to make payments on the loan with interest,
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.460]   you are missing out on the growth of that investment in the market. So that's probably
[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:07.880]   the number one reason and the reason that we say the 401(k) is probably the last place
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.680]   to tap. It's still a good resource in a crunch if it's really the last place you have to
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.920]   tap. The interest rate is going to be lower than credit cards. You are paying the interest
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.760]   back to yourself. But at the end of the day, you're taking a chunk of money out of the
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:25.600]   markets where it could grow and taking it off and then also adding in the extra payments.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.960]   And then if you want to still continue to save on top of the loan payments, now you're
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.160]   taking away from your monthly income just to pay the loan back. So it can be a nice
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:40.080]   alternative to taking higher interest rate loans. But you have to remember that that's
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:45.160]   a big factor that a lot of people miss. There's no phantom balance. That money is actually
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.600]   coming out of the market. It's not going to earn returns. You could get lucky. It could
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:53.120]   be when the market goes down. But these are long-term retirement savings. So for the most
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.440]   part, you want to stay away from 401(k) loans as much as possible.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.960]   If this is like your last resort, what are some better alternatives?
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:08.000]   Yeah, that's a tough one. That cash reserve in financial planning, we always say you want
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.560]   to have a minimum of maybe three to six months in cash. You can look at after-tax savings
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.720]   and investments that you already have. And then what are you using the loan to buy if
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:24.520]   it's a home? You can look at creative financing with home equity loans. Banks have gotten
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:29.720]   a little bit better. It depends on your income situation. But yeah, that's the reason that
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.640]   people do end up taking these 401(k) loans, is because there really are no better options
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:38.680]   sometimes, unfortunately. But just keep in mind, you are taking that money out of the
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.680]   market.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.800]   Alright, Blair, I have one more question for you here. We talk a lot about behavioral bias
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:48.440]   in investing and behavioral psychology. What is a behavioral bias for a guy like me believing
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.960]   that the Big Ten could actually beat an SEC team in the college football playoff? Because
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:58.320]   your Georgia Bulldogs just put an ass-whooping on my Michigan Wolverines. And for some reason
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:04.560]   in my brain, I thought, "Wait, we can probably hang with these guys." What is that bias called?
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:09.400]   I don't know what the bias is called. But unfortunately, you are not seeing your team
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:14.840]   week after week beat every other team in the SEC. And there's just no conference that compares
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.920]   to the SEC, unfortunately, Ben. I'm so sorry. The Georgia team that played through the regular
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:24.300]   season undefeated showed up that day. The team that played in the SEC championship and
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:28.300]   lost to Alabama terribly did not. We're going to see who has to show up Monday night, and
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.320]   I hope it's going to be the team that beat yours.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:36.080]   Good luck in the next one. My heart is broken, and you ruined my New Year's Eve. But I'm
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.080]   happy for you.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.080]   Sorry about that.
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:42.120]   If you have some thoughts about the questions today, if you're a big Buffett Indicator person,
