[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.840]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.860]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.940]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.800]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.880]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.500]   Recently, I had the pleasure of hosting two live events,
[00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.100]   one in Seattle, Washington, and one in Portland, Oregon,
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.920]   both entitled The Brain-Body Contract,
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.160]   where I discussed science and science-related tools
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.940]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.780]   My favorite part of each evening, however,
[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.800]   was the question and answer period that followed the lecture.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.960]   I love the question and answer period
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.720]   because it gives me an opportunity to hear directly
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.520]   from the audience as to what they want to know most,
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.440]   and indeed, to get into a bit of dialogue,
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.560]   so we really clarify what are the underlying mechanisms
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.600]   of particular tools, how best to use the tools
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.100]   for things like focus and sleep.
[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.080]   We also touch on some things related to mental health
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.200]   and physical health.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.180]   It was a delight for me,
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.440]   and I like to think that the audience learned a lot.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.400]   I know that many of you weren't able to attend those events,
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.520]   but we wanted to make the information available to you.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.200]   So what follows this is a recording
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.360]   of the question and answer period
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.040]   from the lecture in Seattle, Washington.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.180]   I hope you'll find it to be both interesting and informative.
[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.720]   I'd also like to thank our sponsors of these live events.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.600]   The first is Momentus Supplements,
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.680]   which is our partner with the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.940]   providing supplements that are of the very highest quality,
[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.420]   that ship international, and that are arranged in dosages
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.980]   and single ingredient formulations that make it possible
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.080]   for you to develop the optimal supplement strategy for you.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.220]   And I'd also like to thank our other sponsor,
[00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.280]   which is Inside Tracker,
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.280]   which provides blood tests and DNA tests
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.700]   so you can monitor your immediate
[00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.320]   and long-term health progress.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.200]   I'd also like to announce
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.880]   that there are two new live events scheduled.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.040]   The first one is going to take place Sunday, October 16th
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.460]   at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles.
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.200]   The other live event will take place Wednesday,
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.620]   November 9th at the Beacon Theater in New York City.
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.560]   Tickets to both of those events are now available online
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.000]   at hubermanlab.com/tour.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.700]   That's hubermanlab.com/tour.
[00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.640]   I do hope that you learn from and enjoy the recording
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.840]   of the question and answer period that follows this.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.200]   And last, but certainly not least,
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.900]   thank you for your interest in science.
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.480]   [upbeat music]
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:19.480]   - What is your most used protocol?
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.160]   I'm assuming that you mean the protocol that I use the most.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.320]   I genuinely do the morning sunlight viewing this evening.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.360]   I went and looked at the sunset every single evening
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.080]   and I absolutely do 10 to 30 minutes
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.280]   of some non-sleep deep rest protocol every single day.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.920]   Every single day.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.840]   The reason I called it non-sleep deep rest
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.120]   is because while I love the classic traditions
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.000]   and things like yoga nidra,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.360]   my fear was that if I call things yoga nidra,
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.660]   that people would get spooked.
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.640]   But I also have to say that I rather loathe
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.520]   the fact that scientists use so many fancy terms
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.640]   that it also vaults information
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.160]   from the very people that fund the work.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.360]   So I have a kind of an ax to grind
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.820]   with the scientific community too.
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.680]   So non-sleep deep rest was my attempt to put my arms
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.600]   around a number of different things like yoga nidra,
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.940]   which I have great reverence for and other tools like that.
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.880]   I do that usually in the early afternoon
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.640]   or if I wake up first thing in the morning
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.140]   and I haven't slept enough or not that well,
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.800]   I'll do 30 minutes of yoga nidra
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.080]   and I feel terrific after that.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.300]   I'll just mention a brief anecdote.
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.000]   I learned about yoga nidra while researching a book
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.680]   that I never wrote that may or may not ever be published.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.060]   I went and spent a week in a trauma center
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.040]   and addiction treatment center in Florida
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.620]   and saw some amazing work of some amazing people
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.100]   and some amazing transformations
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.740]   and it was a big part of their daily routine
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.780]   for these people to do yoga nidra and non-sleep deep rest
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.500]   and I thought they're really onto something here.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.100]   So almost religiously for me every day, 10 to 30 minutes.
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.980]   Not that it matters but the CEO of Google
[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.300]   is really into NSDR.
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.380]   I don't know him but he's written about that
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.480]   a number of times.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.680]   In Seattle, sunrise varies from 4.30 a.m. to 9 a.m.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.540]   depending on season.
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.320]   Are you recommending to vary your wake up outside time
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.160]   with the seasons?
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.160]   Somewhat, you don't need to see the sun cross the horizon.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.060]   That would be great but not everyone can wake up
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.900]   with the sun.
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.020]   You want to get so-called low solar angle sunlight.
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.860]   Why?
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.140]   'Cause of that yellow blue contrast
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.120]   that we talked about before.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.560]   Many people wake up before the sun is out.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.520]   If that case, if you wanna be awake,
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.200]   turn on as many bright lights as you can.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.720]   Up here, I don't know, does anyone here,
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.200]   you don't have to admit this if you don't want to
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.320]   but maybe nod or raise your hand if you're comfortable
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.080]   with meaning that in the winter you feel less well
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.800]   or typically in the transition.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.040]   Yeah, it's huge up here.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.320]   It's really, it's amazing.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.680]   And then when you're on campus
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.560]   or that's where I've spent time and you see Rainier
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.800]   and it's like the blossoms are out and you feel almost high
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.660]   because that's dopamine.
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.160]   Animals that have white pelage in the winter
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.960]   and then it turns dark in the summer and spring months,
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.500]   that pathway, the melanin pathway is from tyrosine
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.720]   which is the precursor to dopamine
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.900]   and also to melanin production in the fur.
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.400]   So the whole system is linked.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.860]   It's not rigged, it's linked.
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:25.880]   So what do I suggest?
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.140]   I suggest in the winter months,
[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.760]   getting 30 minutes of sunlight viewing.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.640]   I know it's a lot but it's much better
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.320]   than feeling lousy all day.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.280]   And then the real key in the winter
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.940]   is to try and catch some sunlight before it goes down.
[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.720]   If you're indoors and it goes down
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.780]   and then you go outside and it's dark,
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.900]   your brain and body don't really know
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.580]   where they are in time.
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.240]   And then you flip on Ozark and you're watching Ozark
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.960]   and then you really don't know where you are in time.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.880]   I have one more episode, don't tell me what happened,
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.400]   that shows.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.400]   When I was a postdoc,
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.700]   I used to recommend The Wire to my competitors.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.840]   True.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.780]   I go to sleep fired up, ready and excited
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.620]   to do whatever it takes.
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.480]   When I wake up, that drive is depleted.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.800]   Why and what can I do?
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.820]   Interesting.
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.740]   Have not heard that one before
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.720]   but if I were to venture a guess,
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.060]   you know we didn't spend much time tonight
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.760]   talking about the autonomic nervous system,
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.680]   this kind of see-saw that takes us from very alert,
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.680]   potentially panicked, but to very, very deep sleep.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.920]   Even, you know, God forbid we go into a coma,
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.600]   it's because the parasympathetic nervous system
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.920]   is overactive relative to the sympathetic nervous system,
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.820]   see-saw of autonomic function.
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.060]   You may be sleeping very, very deeply
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.020]   and when you are in deep, deep rest,
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.080]   the last thing you want to do
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.380]   is get into that forward center of mass,
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.680]   thinking, planning, predicting, right?
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.840]   In, you know, again, in yoga nidra,
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.960]   again, non-sleep, deep rest,
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.720]   there's this common theme in the script
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.440]   of going from thinking and doing and predicting
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.140]   to being and feeling, they say.
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.040]   And I'm not making fun of them as the moment I hear that,
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.880]   I go, oh, just going to be and feel.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.720]   What are you doing?
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.280]   You're actually just moving into sensation
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.540]   but no planning, right?
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.400]   There's nothing mysterious about it.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.680]   Sensation but no planning.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.340]   Now, in sleep, a very deeply parasympathetic
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.160]   sleep state, what's happening?
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.780]   You actually, that visual aperture is actually so big,
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.580]   right, you're not in panoramic vision,
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.920]   your eyes are actually closed.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.660]   Space and time are, from past, present, and future,
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.920]   are invited into your thinking.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.520]   You're in a deep, deep state of relaxation
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.080]   and it may be, Dustin, that when you're waking up,
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.320]   you're having a hard time transitioning out of that
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.120]   because you're sleeping so deeply.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.240]   You may be waking up mid-sleep cycle.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.720]   Many people find it useful to set an alarm
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.020]   so that they wake up at the end of a 90-minute
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.720]   so-called ultradian cycle.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.260]   There are some sleep apps that do this on the phone.
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.480]   I can't recall their names.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.300]   So rather than sleeping seven hours,
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.360]   you might be better off sleeping six
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.960]   or seven and a half hours, right,
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.440]   waking up at the end of one of these 90-minute cycles.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.280]   Try that.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.500]   That would be consistent with what we know
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.480]   about the biology.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.200]   But I think it's common to, if you sleep very deeply,
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.120]   to wake up and not necessarily wanna spring out of bed.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.120]   I've heard of these people that just wanna spring out of bed
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:18.960]   and attack the day.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.800]   Jocko Willink, 4.30 in the morning,
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.680]   his Casio phone, watch, I'm seeing his watch,
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.880]   when it's like eight for me.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.340]   I'm like, wow, like again, these people are amazing.
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.100]   I must be doing something wrong.
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.060]   But these are, you know, I don't wake up that way,
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.240]   you know, like Tigger.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.460]   I'm like, I want water, I want sunlight,
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.300]   90 minutes later, I want caffeine.
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.960]   What are some of your favorite books
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.420]   that have had the biggest impact on you?
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.900]   Kyle G, thank you, Kyle.
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.140]   Gosh, so many.
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.200]   You know, for non-fiction,
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.500]   well, Oliver Sacks' autobiography, On the Move,
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.940]   had a profound impact on me.
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.680]   You know, people hated him.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.880]   The scientific community tried to kick him out.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.400]   They said horrible things about him,
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.920]   created all sorts of scandals.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.620]   It wasn't until Awakenings became a blockbuster movie
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.780]   that suddenly he got appointments at NYU in Columbia.
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.020]   Then now they wanted him back,
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.300]   and the revered neurologist, like incredible, right?
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.120]   But he was also a real seeker in the cuttlefish thing,
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.540]   and he had a lot of internal struggles too,
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.480]   some of which I relate to, some of which I don't.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.940]   Actually, I've been in touch with his former partner
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.040]   because I actually moved to Topanga Canyon
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.140]   for a short while just 'cause Oliver lived there.
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.580]   I thought, if I go there, I'll actually finish this book.
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.420]   Guess what?
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.180]   Just moving someplace doesn't allow you to finish a book.
[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.860]   He lived in Topanga, so I was like, that's the key.
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:49.860]   It didn't work.
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.780]   And people were wondering why I was hanging
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.560]   around their house all the time,
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.500]   'cause it was Oliver's former home.
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.960]   So that's an amazing book.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.320]   And tells you my obsessive nature.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.320]   The other books that have had a profound influence on me,
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.840]   I would say in the non-fiction realm,
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.080]   well, I learned how to make a decent steak
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.960]   and a few other simple recipes not well
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.120]   from Tim Ferriss' book, The 4-Hour Chef,
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.240]   'cause I really needed help.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.260]   That was a fun one.
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.280]   I like Robert Greene's book, Mastery,
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.160]   because I've had amazing mentors,
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.980]   and that book is all about finding mentors
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.880]   and assigning mentors to you, even if you don't know them.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.800]   And as you can tell from my stories about Oliver,
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.760]   who I never met, and a few other folks
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.500]   that I've just decided that they don't know it,
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.340]   but I'm mentoring them, they're mentoring me, excuse me.
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.540]   That book was really important for me.
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.940]   And that mentor-mentee relationships
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.200]   always involve a breakup, either by death or by decision
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.840]   or by consequence, your circumstance, rather.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.580]   There's something happens, and they're supposed to break.
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.840]   You're not supposed to apprentice with somebody forever.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.640]   That was an interesting book for me.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.020]   I would say in the fiction realm,
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:08.720]   I would say in the fiction realm, it's all childhood books,
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.520]   'cause it's been a long time since I've read fiction.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.360]   I read a lot of poetry.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.020]   I'm a big Wendell Berry fan.
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.700]   I like poetry because poetry, to me,
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.840]   is like the subconscious.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.160]   The structure is all messed up,
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.020]   and you think you understand what they're talking about,
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.240]   but you don't really know.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.040]   And so it always feels important and consequential,
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.640]   even though it's your own interpretation.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.440]   And then I love the psychologists.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.120]   I love Jung, I love Erickson,
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.820]   I love the psychologists and could read endlessly
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.820]   about the early days of attachment theory
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:43.660]   and things like that,
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.720]   because I find that stuff to be fascinating.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.040]   So those books have been a lot of fun,
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.340]   and I love picture books with animals.
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   And so if you can get ahold of Joel Sartore's
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.640]   Instagram account, The Photo Arc,
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.520]   he decided to take pictures of every animal on the planet,
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.360]   especially the ones that are endangered.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.720]   He's an amazing photographer,
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.080]   but his books are even better,
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.280]   so if you like animal books.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.240]   What excites you most about the future research
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.120]   of mental health treatment,
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.800]   particularly anxiety and depression?
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.080]   Michael, thank you, Michael.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.680]   Well, there I think that we're in an exciting time.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.480]   I'll just reveal my biases.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.480]   I'm quite pessimistic at the idea
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.440]   that we're gonna have better medications soon
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.160]   for most things.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.520]   What I do think we are starting to approach
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.880]   is a time in which we understand
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.720]   how broad categories of drugs impact
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.940]   broad categories of chemicals,
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.680]   which kind of shift our mind
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.060]   in broad categories of directions.
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.200]   What does all that mean?
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.500]   I think we're starting to realize
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.280]   that because there are different receptors
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.640]   for all these chemicals all over the brain and body,
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.120]   that that side effect-less drug
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.040]   is unlikely to exist for mental health,
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:07.040]   but that the combination of maybe some pharmacology,
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.340]   but especially behavioral tools,
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.940]   people actually learning how to drive this thing
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.960]   that we call our nervous system,
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.880]   is potentially helpful, maybe very helpful.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:22.400]   Now, in cases like schizophrenia, autism,
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.920]   and I didn't put those next to one another for any reason,
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.920]   by the way, OCD, eating disorders,
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.600]   and I'm very mindful of the fact
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.440]   that anorexia is the most lethal
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.040]   of all the psychiatric disorders, right?
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.260]   Amazing and sad fact.
[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.800]   I think for those conditions,
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.560]   we are soon going to enter a time
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.840]   in which it's going to be combination behavioral,
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.380]   drug therapy, and yes, brain-machine interface.
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.520]   I don't mean putting chips down below the skull.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.920]   I think there's going to be,
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.280]   and there are things happening now
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.180]   of people using devices like virtual reality,
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.300]   as well as transcranial magnetic stimulation,
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.260]   placing a magnet on a particular location in the head,
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.440]   combined with a particular maybe drug,
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.940]   maybe psychedelics, maybe not, to enhance plasticity.
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.360]   I hear a vote for psychedelics,
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.800]   and I wanna make a serious point about psychedelics.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.700]   Five years ago, when I, well, four years ago,
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.000]   when I started doing a bit of public-facing stuff,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.100]   I was absolutely terrified to say that word.
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:28.940]   Terrified.
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.660]   I thought I'd lose my job.
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.500]   I really did.
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.020]   I thought, "Don't say psychedelics."
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.860]   And I'll be very honest.
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:40.280]   You know, for me, I think that the clinical data
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.020]   on MDMA and on psilocybin are very interesting,
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:44.860]   very interesting.
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.660]   I don't think they are the first and only pass
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.480]   at rewiring the brain,
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.740]   but it is clear that the brain can enter a state
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.620]   of heightened learning capacity,
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.900]   but it needs to be directed towards something.
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:04.840]   The goal of opening plasticity just, it opens plasticity.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.740]   That's not the goal.
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:07.740]   It's like running.
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.280]   The goal isn't running.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.620]   The goal is to run in a particular direction.
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.020]   So what I think is really needed
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.660]   is to drive that plasticity in particular directions.
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:19.820]   And I would love to see more directed use of those
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.700]   in, of course, the safe clinical setting
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:22.780]   where it's appropriate.
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.020]   And a guest on the podcast, Matthew Johnson,
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.700]   who's at Johns Hopkins,
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.140]   I asked him, "What's the deal with the microdosing?"
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.260]   And you know what his answer was?
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.660]   I was very surprised.
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:36.240]   He said, "Macro dose."
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:42.060]   And I thought, okay, I'm not a guy who, you know,
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:46.020]   I'm not into, I'm not pushing this, I'm not a proponent.
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.820]   I said, "You're kidding me, why?
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:48.660]   "Why, why would you say this?
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.600]   "This guy runs an NIH-funded lab
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.720]   "at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.400]   "I thought, why?"
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.320]   And he said, "Because the one session
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.500]   "with a trained professional
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:04.060]   "that's triggering rewiring plasticity that's guided
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.940]   "is as far as they know from the data."
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.660]   You can go back and listen to, these are his words,
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.120]   not mine, but he's the expert in this area.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.640]   "Are encouraging plasticity in a particular direction."
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.360]   And he thinks that that's far more useful
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.600]   than just kind of nudging the system a little bit
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.480]   without any particular goal or outcome.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.440]   Very interesting and very surprising.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.280]   And again, a trained academic
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.000]   at one of the most elite institutions in the world.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.700]   I think we're in very exciting times for those compounds.
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.920]   And there are studies at Stanford and elsewhere on ketamine
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.680]   and other things, but it's early days.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.040]   Young people should be very cautious, young, young people.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.520]   And adults should be cautious,
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.880]   especially people with pre-existing psychiatric issues.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.040]   And people who have the propensity for addiction,
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.520]   although some of those compounds
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.480]   are being used to treat addiction.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.200]   So I'd be an idiot and I would be lying
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.040]   if I didn't say that it is very exciting times
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.780]   for psychedelic therapies.
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.780]   (audience cheering)
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.940]   (audience applauding)
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.140]   Where do you see the biggest area,
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.540]   and I've done only one clinical trial.
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.380]   - True.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.420]   - I took part in one clinical trial,
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.200]   so I don't speak from a lot of experience there,
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.100]   just a little bit.
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.240]   I was a subject in that trial.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.160]   Where do you see the biggest area
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.220]   for performance enhancement within the elite athletes
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.340]   and operators that already hit marks
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.080]   of proper sleep and nutrition?
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.140]   Meg Young, thanks for your question, Meg.
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.300]   - Yeah, I think that, well, first of all,
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.340]   very few of them hit marks for proper sleep.
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.920]   But for those that do,
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.100]   so once you have your sleep dialed in
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.540]   and you've got your nutrition dialed in
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.060]   and the motivational component is there,
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.600]   I think where there's a lot of work still to be done
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.220]   and where people can really get outsized effects
[00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:00.900]   is in this weird little cavern of human existence
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.500]   that we call creativity.
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.820]   And I didn't have time to talk about it tonight.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.580]   But there's a very unique brain state
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:07.980]   that we call creativity,
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.620]   which is taking pre-existing neural maps
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.940]   and starting to combine them in unique ways
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.180]   to create new ways of performance.
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.620]   Performance can be basically summarized in any domain
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.100]   as essentially four stages.
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.460]   You have unskilled, skilled, mastery,
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.260]   which is when the brain can generate movements
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.100]   or cognitive computations
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.540]   that create very predictable outcomes.
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.780]   And then there's this fourth tier,
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.300]   this fourth layer, which is virtuosity.
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.660]   And virtuosity, by definition,
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.780]   means inviting back in a component of uncertainty.
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.280]   What this looks like in terms of operators
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.520]   or this looks like in terms of athletes,
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.640]   or even we can say musicians
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.700]   or people who are in the cognitive fields
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.220]   or poets or writers,
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:00.300]   is what it means is introducing that uncertainty
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.820]   about what's gonna happen next.
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.320]   And the way to do that is to destabilize the system.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.520]   In other words, to create states of mind
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.780]   in which there are literally sensory disruptions.
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.760]   It's like what I would like to see is more training
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.980]   in a kind of fun house of mirrors type environment.
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:21.660]   That's when you start to see incredible performances emerge.
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.500]   And virtuosos invite in uncertainty.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.200]   They actually don't know what they're going to do next.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.320]   And so this becomes a little bit of a vague concept.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.740]   And what I'm about to tell you next
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:33.700]   might seem a little silly,
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.100]   but one of the best ways to access creative states
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:40.360]   is to, no surprise, use your visual system
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.960]   to view things that are highly unstable and uncertain.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.580]   I don't just love fish tanks.
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:51.240]   I love staring at videos of aquariums in Tokyo
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.840]   and actually watching the fish
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.960]   because it's completely unpredictable.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.860]   There's some evidence that doing things like that,
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.960]   or people will say, "Oh, I was in the shower.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.020]   "I took a walk in nature
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.160]   "and then I had this idea."
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.960]   I actually don't think it was the walk or the shower.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.520]   It's that nature is filled
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:13.020]   with unpredictable visual stimuli, auditory stimuli.
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.160]   When you can predict what's going to happen next,
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.140]   you have very little opportunity
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.960]   to up-level your game, so to speak.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:24.280]   It's only by way of unpredictable sensory input
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.120]   that you can do that.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.400]   So if you're a coach or you're working with people
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.320]   who are very high-level performers,
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.680]   do you want them to stand on one leg and spin around
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.520]   and then do what they're doing?
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.940]   Not necessarily.
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.120]   What you want to do is try and get them into brain states
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.160]   that are different than the brain states that they're in
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.100]   when they normally enter their practice.
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.920]   The liminal state between sleep and waking, excuse me,
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.680]   the liminal state between sleep and waking
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.960]   is a very powerful one for accessing creativity.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.520]   Many people access ideas as they're waking up in the morning
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.560]   they have great insights.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.580]   Other people, while strolling in nature,
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.120]   I don't think it's the strolling or the waking up.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.520]   I think it's the lack of, as we call it,
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.520]   top-down regulation on rules.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:10.380]   You are able to access combinations of neural maps
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.900]   that are unusual.
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.260]   So you can play with this a little bit.
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.160]   A lot of people throughout history
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.660]   have used compounds, drugs, to do this.
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.000]   Great writers would get drunk
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.480]   and then try and write or wake up.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.280]   The amount of self-abuse that people,
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.760]   including athletes and creatives,
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.260]   put themselves through to try and capture these windows
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:32.000]   of cognitive ability is pretty intense
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.440]   and I don't think that's a good idea.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.360]   I think one should be an explorer
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.480]   and try and find these cognitive states
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.960]   in ways that are non-destructive.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.020]   I'm starting to sound like my mother with all this.
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.220]   Heel flips on lock, no kick flips, next question.
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.820]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.160]   There's some skateboarders in the audience,
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.080]   my first non-biological family,
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.300]   there's some amazing skateboarders in this audience
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.000]   and I'm not gonna be the one doing a kick flip
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.700]   anytime soon, but they're great to have.
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.960]   One of the reasons we built the podcast
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.160]   with the help of the great Mike Blaback
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.760]   is because I learned a long time ago
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.580]   that if you want things done right
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.040]   and you wanna do them outside the lane lines
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.700]   and you wanna have control over how things come across,
[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:18.680]   you do it with skateboarders.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.920]   'Cause I didn't come from a community
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:25.880]   where I didn't have parents at my sports games
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.140]   and things like that, so thanks to the skateboarders
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:32.000]   and the misfits and those folks.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.760]   Do you have any tips on how to improve memory?
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.260]   Yes, Ron Verrett, yes, okay, this is a wild literature
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.240]   and I love it and it's changing the way that I do things.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.680]   I thought that to remember things,
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.460]   you're supposed to get really, really excited,
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:46.080]   really focused and remember them.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.120]   And guess what, that's not how you do it.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:54.640]   There are data and there are stories
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.520]   going back to medieval times
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.760]   that they used to teach kids things
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.860]   and then throw them in the river.
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:05.760]   There's a beautiful annual review of neuroscience
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.680]   written by the late James McGaugh,
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:12.380]   a brilliant researcher who taught me that in this review.
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.800]   And it turns out that if you want to remember something,
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.760]   you want to spike adrenaline
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.160]   after you acquired that information, after.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.640]   That means the double espresso and the ice bath
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.920]   after you study for math, immediately after.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.120]   And you think about this and you know,
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.040]   that makes perfect sense, right?
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.920]   Think about the one trial learning
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.360]   that nobody wants to experience,
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.800]   which is a car accident or some traumatic thing.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.200]   You didn't get the spike of adrenaline first,
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.520]   you got the spike of adrenaline after.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:49.440]   So again, I discourage the use of excessive stimulants
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.720]   or you know, anything like that.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.540]   But if you're going to try and remember information,
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.320]   you need to get your brain and body
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.680]   into a high autonomic arousal state.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.840]   Literally, you need to deploy adrenaline into your system
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:07.840]   after you have made the attempt to learn some information.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.460]   So much so that if you give people a beta blocker
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.840]   after learning emotional information,
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.920]   they don't learn it as well.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.840]   Incredible, just incredible data in animals and humans.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.840]   This is the beautiful work of Larry Cahill
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.960]   at UC Irvine and James McGaugh.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.680]   So that's how I would focus on remembering things better.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.680]   And it's also true that if you tell yourself
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.840]   that something's really important to you,
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.800]   you'll be able to learn it better.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.440]   If you meet people and they tell you their name
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.360]   and you forget it two seconds later,
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.320]   well, you should probably be thinking,
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.360]   and now I do this, I meet people and I think,
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.680]   okay, what terrible thing did this person do
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.580]   just trying to spike my adrenaline or something like that?
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:44.600]   It's a terrible trick,
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.680]   but I haven't figured out a better way.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.560]   But that's actually one data-supported way to do that.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:53.000]   Easily a dozen or more studies in humans
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.200]   on that very topic.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.840]   How do you manage social media addiction, Paul?
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:03.240]   Well, we should be careful with the use of the word addiction
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.140]   because here I think it's entirely appropriate.
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.740]   When you're engaging in a behavior
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:08.920]   over and over and over again,
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.040]   and you're thinking to yourself,
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.060]   this isn't even that interesting.
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:15.160]   You're officially addicted.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.840]   That's the litmus test for addiction,
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.160]   not this feels so good.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.160]   People talk about the dopamine hits of social media.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.360]   Those only come at the beginning.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.960]   But then when you find yourself scrolling,
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.560]   like what am I doing?
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.520]   Maybe it's that narrow visual aperture,
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:31.960]   you're a hypnotized chicken.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:37.760]   But maybe also you are seeking more dopamine hits
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.160]   because guess what, that dopamine wave pool is depleted,
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.180]   at least for that activity.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.360]   It is true that dopamine, you have a baseline
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.120]   and then you have peaks that ride on that baseline.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.420]   I do think that we can have dopamine for one behavior
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.740]   and not for another, but it's a generalized phenomenon.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.300]   So how do you manage it?
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:59.740]   You have to stop seeking within social media.
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:03.280]   And so I've taken on the practice of turning off my phone
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.560]   for a couple hours each day.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.800]   It's incredibly hard.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.020]   People get really upset too, by the way.
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.540]   So you haven't noticed?
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.900]   These tethers that people expect.
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.880]   We recorded a podcast recently,
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:17.080]   so I don't wanna go into too much depth now
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:20.080]   about attachment and grief.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.880]   And we all have a map,
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.680]   now you understand what the maps are,
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:28.060]   of space, time, and a dimension called closeness
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.960]   to everyone that we know.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:33.260]   Space, where they are, time, when they are,
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:36.080]   dead, alive, when will I see them again, et cetera,
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.120]   and closeness.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:41.080]   And the phone has allowed us to tap into space, time,
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.500]   and this closeness map, which define all our attachments
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.440]   on a very regular basis.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.740]   So you can understand why it's so valuable to people.
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.680]   The plane lands and everyone's texting.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.080]   The plane takes off, everyone's texting.
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:53.900]   It's like, where are you?
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:54.740]   Well, the plane's in the air.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:55.920]   There's this thing called flight tracker.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.640]   No one cares about that anymore.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.920]   You wanna hear from the person.
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.720]   So I do think that, I used to do an every odd hour
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.220]   of the day, my phone was off,
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:06.220]   and like half the relationships in my life disappeared.
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.120]   They couldn't tolerate it.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:12.080]   I loved it, but I loved them too.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.360]   So I would say take breaks, and I would say at least an hour.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.140]   And if you find yourself excited to get back on the phone,
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:22.520]   that excitement, that is the dopamine system.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.560]   So you can kind of learn where it is for you.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.320]   But if you find yourself scrolling mindlessly,
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.160]   and it's not doing anything for you,
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:33.600]   you're driving that wave pool down, down, down, down, down.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.400]   So hopefully that analogy will help.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.800]   It's weird to call myself Dr. Hebermann.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.140]   In my business, if you refer to yourself in the third person,
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.840]   it means you're officially a narcissist.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:46.280]   So I'm just gonna start with, were you nervous tonight?
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.920]   And if so, what did you do to prepare?
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.860]   Brianne, you saw my nervousness, didn't you?
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:54.320]   No, I asked myself that question.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:58.520]   I was excited, and I think I'm good at lying to myself
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.360]   and telling myself that autonomic arousal
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.320]   that might be nervousness is excitement.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:06.780]   But in truth, I wasn't.
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.540]   I was and am really excited to tell you all these stories
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:11.840]   and about biology.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.900]   I know this might sound like a little bit of a line,
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:18.900]   but I actually don't feel myself as a person
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.900]   when I do the podcast or I do this stuff.
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:25.500]   I took a walk before I got here, and I have to be careful.
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.160]   There are only two topics that make me cry.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.400]   One is talking about my bulldog,
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.100]   the other is talking about my graduate advisor.
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.340]   So I have to be very careful.
[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.900]   But I took a walk, and I imagined that they were here.
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.280]   And I know.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.480]   I know, don't make me cry.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.440]   Lex Friedman made me cry on a podcast,
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.880]   and it was really unfair.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.400]   And he was like digging and digging.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.920]   And there are a few people in the audience
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.320]   that know Costello, and it's like, you know.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.940]   And I just kept thinking to myself before coming in here,
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.140]   like, you know, I love them and miss them,
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:55.880]   and Costello would be entirely bored with this whole thing.
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:59.160]   So I distracted myself a bit, and not so nervous.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.720]   Now, I do get nervous about things.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.760]   Sure, I'm human.
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.440]   But when it comes to biology,
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.000]   I think I still feel like that little kid
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.440]   who just wants to tell you all the stuff, you know, so.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.040]   You know, can't help it.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:14.120]   Is learning from failure equal to learning from success?
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.720]   Is one more efficient than the other?
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.280]   Rachel, thanks for your question.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.160]   Well, on a trial-by-trial basis,
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.320]   we know that when you fail at an attempt,
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.440]   on the next attempt, your forebrain is in a position
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.040]   to engage better.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.560]   And this makes total sense, right?
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.640]   You feel that frustration, ugh.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.140]   You wanna get the next one right?
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.960]   Well, you're harboring, or I should say,
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.800]   funneling more neural resources.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.400]   Your focus, that aperture, tightens.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.740]   Now, you have to be mindful of that, too,
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.300]   because when you have a failure,
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.100]   and then you're, like, you're gonna hit the bullseye.
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.040]   I'm thinking about a dart board,
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.760]   'cause I'm terrible at darts.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.260]   You know, sober, I'm terrible at darts.
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:54.320]   And I don't even drink.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.320]   So that next trial, part of the problem is
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.080]   is that focus can narrow so much
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.540]   that you can start to lose access to information
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:05.280]   that might help you if you were just to relax a little bit
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.640]   and dilate that focus a little bit.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.480]   But in general, on a trial-by-trial basis,
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.680]   focus is the cue that your nervous system
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.880]   is going to be positioned to learn better on the next trial.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.520]   Now, in terms of life experiences,
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:20.380]   gosh, I wish for everyone fewer failures and more successes.
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.780]   But, you know, failures keep you humble.
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.320]   And I've had a lot of 'em.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.280]   I mean, if people ever wanted, and they, you know,
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.920]   I'd be happy to tell you about 'em.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.840]   I mean, I've made a ton of mistakes in life,
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.100]   a ton of mistakes.
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.440]   Some of those were mistakes of persistence,
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.880]   like dumb decisions, like it's gonna change,
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.520]   it's gonna change, and it's clearly never gonna change.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:43.600]   And then some were failures of misjudgment
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.960]   about other people or situations.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.360]   And a lot of them were just plain failures,
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.640]   like the experiment didn't work,
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:54.840]   or it just wasn't the right thing.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.120]   And you try and reframe those.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.520]   I do think that we owe it to ourselves
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.800]   and to the people that we know
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.180]   to try and generate some wins here and there
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.380]   and try and help other people generate wins.
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:08.580]   You know, in running a lab over the years,
[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:12.540]   and I still do, you realize that you want your students
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:16.240]   to publish a paper and feel that success pretty early
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.560]   so that they can experience, A, how much work it is,
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.160]   so they pick problems wisely,
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.280]   but B, so they can feel that, like, oh, I can do this.
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:27.000]   And I think that, you know,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.980]   this gets into the psychological as well.
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:33.280]   I think that, yes, failures help, but successes help.
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:38.280]   And there I think, you know, I function best in a team,
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.800]   and I think that for those of you
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.980]   that feel like you're fighting some challenge alone,
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:45.620]   I do think that there are great resources to be had
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:50.620]   in trying to access other people as sources of support.
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:54.400]   I think that that's a great tool.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.180]   There's this whole literature, scientific literature,
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:00.660]   around social connection and how that can help us
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.520]   reframe motivation and goals.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:05.520]   Anyway, maybe that's a topic to expand on another time,
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:10.520]   but failure is important on a trial-trial-based basis.
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.640]   People who don't experience enough wins
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.960]   for a long period of time,
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.880]   the brain is a prediction machine after all,
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.200]   and they start to predict failure,
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:22.660]   so it takes a bit more work to wedge oneself out of that.
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.380]   When are you gonna start training jiu-jitsu?
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.080]   Lex made me ask, Ryan Flores.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.140]   Okay, here's the story with that.
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.360]   Lex said, "Do you wanna try jiu-jitsu?"
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.600]   I said, "Sure."
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.380]   Lex said, "Okay, it'll be great
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.840]   "to show people a beginner's mind."
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.000]   Said, "Sure."
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.600]   We went and did a jiu-jitsu class.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.680]   He was very nice, nice, nice, Russian, nice,
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.200]   like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.720]   Then he puts it on the internet with me in a rear naked,
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.960]   him putting me in a rear naked choke.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.300]   It was actually Lex Friedman choking out Andrew Huberman.
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.300]   There, I just talked about myself in the third person.
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.940]   Damn it.
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:01.100]   Edit that one.
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.240]   I have not had the time for jiu-jitsu.
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.720]   I like my ears the way they are, you know?
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.980]   Have you ever seen these people that do jiu-jitsu?
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:11.620]   Their ears literally look like stomps.
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.000]   No, I should do it.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.440]   It looks like a great sport,
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.040]   and unlike the other sports I've been involved in in my life,
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:18.500]   boxing, please don't do it.
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.120]   It's not healthy.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.640]   Skateboarding, all those,
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.200]   you don't really damage your head doing jiu-jitsu, so no.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.960]   I'm gonna get you back for that one, Lex.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.420]   Okay.
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.320]   Can you go through, oh, wow, John Edwards.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.420]   There's a joke that my friends used to tell
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:35.820]   about the supplements I take.
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.780]   They used to say, someone would say,
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:38.900]   "What supplements do you take?"
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:40.960]   And they would just go, "All of them."
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.300]   (audience laughing)
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.200]   I don't take all of them,
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.660]   but I have been very systematic.
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:48.940]   For about 30 years, I've been interested in compounds
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:50.440]   that change the nervous system,
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:54.140]   and I do think that the events of the last few years
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.160]   have changed the way that people view supplements.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.520]   I think that more people are starting to think about
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.880]   how to take better care of their health,
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:06.060]   and people are realizing that, obviously, great sleep,
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:11.060]   mindsets, social connection, exercise, nutrition,
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:13.860]   and so forth are very important,
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.200]   but I actually don't know anybody,
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.780]   granted I run with a strange crowd,
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:19.360]   but I don't know anybody
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.260]   that doesn't take something nowadays.
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.380]   You know, I could go through the whole list,
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:27.340]   but I would say the most fundamental things,
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:28.620]   and there's no product pitch here,
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:30.620]   the most fundamental things are
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.100]   the things that are going to support
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:34.180]   your kind of foundational health.
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:37.020]   So that's going to mean mainly getting,
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:38.680]   either by food sources or supplements,
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:41.100]   is gonna be getting sufficient amounts
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:43.380]   of these essential fatty acids.
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:44.400]   So important.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.020]   For some people, that's taking liquid fish oil.
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:47.940]   For some people, it's capsule.
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:49.020]   For some people, it's eating fish.
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.020]   I don't like the way fish tastes, unless I'm in Seattle.
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.160]   By the way, the seafood here is amazing.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.620]   Not so much in California.
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:35:00.060]   So I think the essential fatty acids,
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:04.100]   and then I'm big on the data, dare I say, out of Stanford,
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.380]   Justin Sonnenberg's lab and Chris Gardner's lab,
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:08.700]   that these fermented foods,
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.820]   of which all these cultures have interesting fermented foods,
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.620]   kefir and sauerkraut and kimchi,
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:17.000]   and pick your fermented food,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.200]   that those seem to really encourage
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.540]   health of the gut microbiome.
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.900]   So I started eating a lot of those
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:26.740]   and taking no probiotics except in a few of the supplements
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.100]   that I was already taking.
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:30.420]   So I'm not trying to dodge the question,
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:33.620]   but I think, by and large, if you're eating well
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.820]   and doing the other foundational behaviors well,
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:39.420]   you can get away with a minimum of supplements.
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:42.340]   D3, it seems to be, a lot of people deficient in D3,
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:43.580]   but not everybody.
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:47.640]   So I think those are the main ones, however.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.380]   I do think that nutrition should be
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:50.780]   the primary entry point.
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.140]   Again, it should be behaviors first,
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:53.460]   then nutrition, then supplements,
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:55.420]   then prescription drugs, only if you need them,
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:36:00.420]   and then, for some people, their brain-machine interface,
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.460]   like TMS and things like that, are going to be useful.
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.140]   But behaviors change your nervous system.
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.540]   No supplement actually rewires you
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:08.820]   or changes your nervous system.
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.560]   Behaviors do that.
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.420]   I hope I didn't dodge that question entirely.
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.740]   I do take some of the things that we talk about
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.700]   on the podcast to do some focused work sometimes,
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.180]   alpha GPC, but lately, I've been doing this whole thing
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.680]   of cold water exposure to spike my adrenaline,
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.900]   'cause I hate it, and it spikes my adrenaline
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:28.440]   after learning, based on the McGaugh and Cahill data.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.320]   What would be your best one or two pieces of advice
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.460]   to recommend protocols for improving learning and retention
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.100]   for graduate students in science and medicine?
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.860]   We try to sleep sometimes.
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:37.860]   Thank you, JD.
[00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:40.620]   Oh, great, you're UW, JD.
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:43.860]   So, you know, I used to teach this course
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:47.380]   at Cold Spring Harbor on career development
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.700]   for scientists, and there's a lot in there,
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.980]   but the two things that are most important are,
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:56.380]   for sake of answering this question,
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:37:01.380]   I would say are find non-destructive ways
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:06.540]   to reset your dopamine and your energy levels
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:09.300]   and do those at least every three days.
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:12.840]   So for me, it was kind of a tough thing
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.980]   to take a long walk or to spend,
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.780]   I used to work really hard on Mondays,
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:19.900]   really hard on Tuesdays, and I would not go in
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:23.300]   until the afternoon on Wednesdays, and sometimes not at all.
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.900]   And then I'd go in Thursday, Friday,
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.340]   and work really, really hard,
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:27.700]   and then not at all on Saturday,
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.660]   and then maybe do a little bit of work from home on Sunday,
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.540]   and I was very productive that way.
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:35.340]   Those breaks are absolutely key,
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:39.340]   and it's not encouraged so much in academic or tech
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.940]   or maybe anything now.
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:43.060]   I hear about so much stress and overwork.
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.940]   I say you just do it and define the culture
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:49.380]   and let the results and your focus be the thing
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:52.060]   that defines you, not how many hours you're in there.
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.420]   But I realize there's a huge cognitive load
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.560]   and energetic load, and for that,
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.700]   I do think these non-sleep deep rest protocols
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:00.120]   are where it comes in really handy.
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.240]   There are at least two faculty I know at Stanford,
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.740]   one who's a so-called Howard Hughes Investigator,
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:08.160]   who is big, those are big deal appointments,
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.520]   they get tons of money, et cetera, et cetera,
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.780]   and they do amazing science most of the time.
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:15.220]   These individuals certainly do.
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:18.860]   And they take two 20-minute naps per day in their office.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.820]   When this guy came and visited me years ago
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.060]   when I was at a different university,
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.060]   he took the time that we were supposed to meet in my office
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.600]   and talk about data, he asked if he could take a nap.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:29.420]   And he gave a great talk that afternoon.
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:31.580]   So there you go.
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.460]   I do think you have to take control of your schedule
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.720]   and do those things, and I hope that helps.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.820]   And then, of course, for some people,
[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.840]   exercise and so on is the way they reset.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.060]   What research or work are you doing
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:43.900]   or that your colleagues are doing
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:45.100]   that you're most excited about lately?
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.620]   Glenn, yeah.
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:47.940]   One project in particular,
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.820]   I hope this paper gets accepted soon,
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:50.980]   it's been out for review forever,
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:53.260]   and if the viewers are in the audience, please,
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:56.460]   just tell us one way or the other, you know?
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:39:01.580]   We did a very large-scale study during the pandemic,
[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:04.060]   we meaning David Spiegel and I,
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:07.940]   and an amazing PhD named Malise,
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:11.380]   she now has two last names, excuse me, Balbon,
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.460]   Yilmaz Balbon.
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.920]   And Malise, we essentially equipped people
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.260]   with remote monitoring devices and measured sleep
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:19.300]   and heart rate variability and a bunch of stress
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.340]   and a bunch of other things,
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:25.800]   and we gave them a very brief set of breathing protocols.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.260]   And it turns out that this thing
[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:30.760]   that I'm talking about a lot on the podcast these days
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.460]   of this double inhale, long exhale,
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.380]   the so-called physiological sigh,
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.620]   was the most effective breathing practice
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:40.180]   for allowing people to control their heart rate variability,
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.620]   reduce overall heart rate, access better sleep,
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:45.140]   and these were extremely short protocols.
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.480]   So I'm very excited about this.
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.560]   I didn't discover physiological sighs.
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:52.080]   I love the idea that people can do a very brief protocol
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:55.240]   once a day, maybe even just while walking down the street
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.560]   or in a moment, and actually learn to control
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.280]   that autonomic seesaw better.
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:01.960]   So I'm very excited about that.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.980]   And then we are gearing up to do some studies
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.240]   on people who have more severe forms of anxiety
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:12.240]   and panic attack using mainly respiration,
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:17.160]   but also looking at some of these eye vision related ways
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.880]   of controlling the nervous system.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.720]   I love that stuff.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.560]   If I keep talking about it,
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.040]   I'm gonna give you a data presentation.
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.400]   So I'm gonna turn around.
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.040]   How does dopamine factor into neuroplasticity if at all?
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.560]   Colin, great question.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.560]   It's a very strong trigger of plasticity,
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:34.260]   so much so in fact that there's some work that shows
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.000]   if you stimulate with an electrode,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.640]   the brain area that releases dopamine,
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:41.440]   and you pair that with anything, anything,
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:45.260]   even just like an eight kilohertz tone,
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.200]   the brain remaps and it's like,
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:50.200]   "Oh, I love that eight kilohertz tone."
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:54.240]   Remember, dopamine is dumb, and it's just dumb.
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.920]   And it's just, you know, it's like Costello
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.560]   when he used to, this dog, I could hang a rope from a tree.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.880]   This dog was so lazy, it wouldn't cross a room for a stake.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.040]   You had to give the stake to him,
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.560]   but it would run across the field.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.720]   He would run and jump on and hold onto that rope.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.640]   And he would suddenly bite through his lip
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:13.760]   with blood dripping down.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:16.160]   I was like, "Oh my God, it's breaking my heart."
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.160]   He loved every set.
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.160]   That's dopamine.
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.580]   It turns us into idiots.
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:25.040]   He was smart about what he needed to be smart about.
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.920]   Dopamine, so if you trigger dopamine release
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:32.400]   with Ritalin, Adderall, to a lesser extent, L-tyrosine,
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.720]   and certainly, please don't do this,
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:36.440]   but cocaine, amphetamine, whatever you're doing,
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.800]   it seems super interesting.
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.720]   It's true, and that's why it's such a slippery slope.
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.060]   It makes anything you're doing
[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:44.760]   seem interesting and important.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.560]   And actually, I'll use this as an opportunity
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.960]   to say something about the psychedelic thing earlier.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.680]   One of the issues with MDMA,
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:53.000]   it's a very unusual brain state.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.140]   It's high dopamine, high serotonin.
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:57.460]   Completely synthetic compound.
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:00.000]   There are other things in there that it does as well.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.920]   One of the problems with people I see,
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:04.980]   with the problem with people taking MDMA,
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.920]   just at a basic level,
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.360]   is that if you're not pushing that
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:15.240]   towards some therapeutic outcome, music sounds amazing.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:18.160]   Everything feels and sounds amazing,
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:22.160]   but it's a very neurochemically severe state.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.720]   So that's why I think if people are going
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.240]   to explore those things, do it as part
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:28.680]   of one of the university-supported clinical trials.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:32.440]   Those drugs make everything seem interesting,
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:34.840]   even stuff that's not terribly interesting.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:36.240]   Now, they also have the potential
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.320]   for trauma-healing capacity.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.760]   These are the MAP studies and so on.
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.520]   So you have to be very careful
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:43.920]   with what you pair with dopamine
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.640]   and what you pair dopamine with.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.800]   And for those of you that are high-sensation-seeking,
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.940]   novelty-seeking, and everything's interesting to you,
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:55.060]   and you want more and more and more experiences,
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:59.420]   you basically have a eight-cylinder car in you,
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:01.540]   and you need to be very careful how you drive that thing.
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:03.400]   Like any high-performance automobile,
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.420]   it's gonna spend more time in the shop.
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:11.000]   So learn to drive appropriately.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.580]   What advice can you offer to future scientists
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:15.980]   who want to make an impact like you have?
[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:18.420]   Ryan O'Boyle, get tenure first.
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:19.260]   No, I'm kidding.
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:22.020]   (audience laughs)
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:24.700]   So I have this weird history in science,
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:26.340]   and I'm not looking for sympathy here,
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:30.580]   but my undergraduate advisor, who I adored,
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.620]   he's like a father to me, my graduate advisor,
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:35.340]   and my postdoc advisor, who I also adored,
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:36.700]   all three of them died.
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.420]   Suicide, cancer, cancer, really young.
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:40.580]   So the joke in my field is,
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:42.260]   you don't want me to work for you.
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:44.840]   But in all seriousness, all three of them
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.580]   had a really morbid sense of humor, all amazing people.
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:50.560]   But it is this kind of weird curse that I've had.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:54.040]   So what scientists, what advice?
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.140]   Well, Ben Barris, the late Ben Barris,
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:59.260]   died of pancreatic cancer, an amazing individual.
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.740]   They're actually making a documentary about Ben's life.
[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:04.380]   He was transgendered, he was totally irreverent,
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:07.380]   he said whatever he thought, he offended everybody,
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:10.400]   he was awesome, brilliant too.
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:15.160]   Ben and I had a conversation as he was dying,
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.800]   I recorded a lot of conversations with him,
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.960]   and I told him I was interested
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.940]   in doing public facing education,
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:23.540]   and he said, "Well, you're tenured now,
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:26.040]   "and people are gonna be upset,
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.260]   "and they're not gonna like it,
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:28.880]   "and your colleagues are probably gonna hate it,
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.580]   "so whatever you do, you better make it good."
[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:34.580]   And I was like, "Wow, that doesn't really help much, Ben."
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:38.180]   And he said, "You seem to have a compulsion for it."
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.820]   So he was right, I think that if you are excited
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:46.820]   about science and sharing what you know, then do that.
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:49.880]   And even if it seems super nerdy,
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.720]   I mean there are these, I think they call themselves
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.020]   entomologists, the insect people,
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:56.940]   they make insects seem really, really cool.
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:01.940]   And if you are excited about spindle kinetics or whatever,
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:06.620]   you know, tell people about it, I really mean it.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:10.020]   I think that the one caveat is that I do think
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:11.460]   it's important to get a formal,
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:13.780]   rigorous training in it first.
[00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:18.060]   I think that you will go further and faster in the long run.
[00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.540]   And there's some amazing people out there,
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:20.780]   there's a post-doc at Stanford,
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.100]   I think his name is Ben Reen,
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:23.560]   I think if you shorten it up on Instagram,
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:26.500]   it's actually Brain, Brain, 'cause he works,
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:27.660]   he talks about brain science,
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:30.900]   so that's why it's weird, B-R-E-I-N.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.060]   He does a great job, and he's a really good example
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:35.420]   of someone who's still on the ascent with his career,
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:38.160]   doing serious science and doing science communication.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:40.980]   But you have to be careful, it's time consuming.
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:44.980]   Look, people will dislike you for whatever.
[00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:48.300]   I made the mistake once of saying that I eat butter.
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:49.920]   Apparently that's a sin on the internet.
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.240]   I like little bits of, I actually like a lot of butter,
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.980]   but I try and eat little bits of butter.
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:55.580]   But somehow it's like there's this idea
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:56.740]   that I eat sticks of butter.
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:00.060]   So you have to be careful, the things I've heard,
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.980]   I heard I was dead, that was cool.
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:05.380]   So you have to be careful, and remember,
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:08.260]   everything is stamped into the cloud now
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:10.640]   and the metaverse or whatever it's called.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:15.180]   So I would say, here are the rules that we have
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:19.100]   at the podcast, here's the rules that I created for myself.
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.980]   I truly don't do it for me, I do it 'cause I think
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:24.060]   people wanna hear about it, but I've been telling myself
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:25.680]   that since I was six years old.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:30.420]   The other thing is never, ever, ever do it
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:33.300]   just for your own gratification.
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.460]   You should really try and think,
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:36.820]   is anyone gonna get anything useful out of this potentially?
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:37.660]   That's the goal.
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.620]   If you're doing that, it'll work out for you.
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:41.960]   If you are thinking about how to get followers
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:45.260]   or something like that, it ain't gonna work out.
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:47.140]   That's my advice.
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:48.900]   Is age 66 too old for neuroplastic?
[00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:51.860]   No, no, I'll cut myself off to begin learning
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:55.100]   with Sandra Tresari, no, did I pronounce that right?
[00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:57.300]   Thank you, Sandra.
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:01.780]   No, Richard Feynman, the great Richard Feynman
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:04.420]   taught himself to draw later in life.
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:07.300]   He was also really into flotation tanks, did you know that?
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:09.360]   Yeah, he was also into bongo drumming naked
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.060]   on the roof of Caltech.
[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:13.580]   Richard Feynman did so many things
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:15.620]   that would get most people fired nowadays.
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:18.300]   He's just lucky he was alive when he was.
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:21.580]   You can absolutely learn at 66 and way beyond.
[00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:24.820]   There's an amazing study from Rusty Gage's lab
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.980]   at the Salk Institute years ago showing
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:30.060]   that even people who are very late in life,
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:33.580]   terminally ill in fact, are still producing new neurons
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:35.740]   in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.540]   These people were gracious enough to allow researchers
[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:41.140]   to inject them with dyes that would label these neurons
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.060]   for analysis post-mortem after they died.
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:45.480]   Absolutely you can learn.
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.180]   What's harder is focus.
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:50.160]   Oftentimes what's harder is sleep as well,
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:51.760]   but the same mechanisms apply.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.040]   There's no evidence whatsoever
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:56.920]   that neuroplasticity disappears at any stage,
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:00.620]   despite what Hubel and Wiesel told the BBC.
[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:03.000]   How do you tackle reading research papers?
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.140]   Do you have a specific strategy?
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:06.180]   Yes, I do.
[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:11.820]   I take notes on everything.
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:15.000]   There's four questions that we teach students
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.680]   and that I think that I use.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.520]   The first one is what's the question they're asking,
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.780]   major and more specific.
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:23.980]   Second is what do they do, methods-wise, what do they do?
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:25.080]   You don't have to know all the details
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:29.320]   in the methods necessarily, but be versed in those methods.
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:32.160]   But you have to understand are they looking at mice?
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.420]   Are they looking at humans?
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:37.240]   Did they have people in two different conditions
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:38.220]   or just one?
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:39.320]   You have to understand what did they do?
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:40.440]   Then you ask what did they find?
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.640]   And then the last question is the most important one.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.280]   And you should write down the answer to this
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.160]   is what did they conclude?
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.040]   And then you look back at the first question
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:51.720]   and you go did they actually answer that question
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.040]   or is it something unrelated?
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:55.420]   And those four questions are essentially the way
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:57.140]   that I parse each paper.
[00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:58.660]   Learning to parse papers is tricky.
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:01.060]   For the podcast I use the telephone.
[00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:04.160]   I call people and I badger them and I ask them
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.080]   who's doing the really good work in this area?
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:07.700]   And I spend a lot of hours doing it.
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:11.260]   And then the best way to remember science
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:12.600]   is to tell someone about it.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.600]   So before each podcast I'll call someone and be like
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:18.120]   hey did you know that they used to throw kids in the river?
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.360]   I do this and my sister, my poor sister,
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:21.480]   and she's like yeah.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:24.400]   My sister by the way does not watch the podcast.
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.520]   She's a therapist and she's like hey,
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.940]   I learned this amazing breathing technique.
[00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:29.860]   I was like oh yeah, really?
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:30.700]   Tell me about it.
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:31.520]   And it's like someone else is there.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:32.560]   I'm like you know I have a podcast.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:34.700]   She's like I don't like your podcast.
[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:37.840]   Yeah, it's an older sister, older sister.
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:41.600]   She's not lying.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:45.000]   What is your favorite sauce condiment seasoning sauce?
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.040]   There's one in every audience.
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:51.740]   I like the spicy stuff.
[00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:55.000]   We've been fermenting our own food at home.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:55.840]   It's kind of cool.
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:57.540]   You put the cabbage in the stuff
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:59.480]   and the little ceramic thing outside
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:01.220]   and then it goes pop, pop.
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:03.020]   It makes this amazing sound and then you can like eat,
[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:05.060]   make your own sauerkraut with peppers
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:06.480]   and like fermenting that stuff.
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:07.840]   It's really good.
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.480]   Okay they're telling me one more question so we'll do two.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.560]   What's most important from your ADH?
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:17.560]   Ah, Gabriel, got a lot of questions about ADHD.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:23.540]   For people on medication or not on medication?
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:25.880]   So I'll answer both.
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:30.800]   For people on medication, I think work with somebody
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:35.280]   really good who's willing to work with you
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:38.520]   to allow you to find that minimal effective dose
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.320]   and also timing that dose.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.960]   One of the key things that we know now
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:46.840]   is that from that waking up point in your morning
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.120]   until about eight or nine hours later,
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:51.240]   we've sort of named that phase one of the day
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:53.840]   for lack of a better naming protocol.
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:58.760]   The systems that release cortisol, dopamine and epinephrine
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:02.880]   are essentially more effective at producing those
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:04.440]   than they are in the later periods of the day
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:06.400]   which makes sense if you think about the way
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:09.160]   that the autonomic nervous system works, et cetera.
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:10.440]   So there's an important question
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.960]   that I can't answer for you but you can answer for you
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:17.720]   which is if you're using Ritalin, Adderall, Vyvanse,
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.960]   these things that enhance dopaminergic transmission,
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.960]   modafinil or modafinil.
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:25.660]   By the way, for the people in the audience like me
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:28.740]   who didn't go to college when these things were all in use,
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:31.720]   the numbers of people that use these compounds
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:35.700]   on and off prescription is astronomical.
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:37.200]   It's incredible.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.000]   I didn't realize it, I think something like 80%
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.840]   of college students use these at some point, incredible,
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:45.600]   'cause they put you into a narrow aperture
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.280]   tunnel of concentration.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:51.240]   So you want to, with a physician's support of course,
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:54.280]   to help get permission or not,
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:59.280]   to figure out what time of day to take your medication.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:02.320]   Now for people who are not on medication,
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:04.060]   I'll just go right back to what I said earlier
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:07.780]   which is that you can train focus but it feels terrible
[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:09.740]   to train it, it is hard.
[00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:12.660]   Again, there are these large scale studies in China
[00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:17.460]   and elsewhere of people literally teaching themselves
[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:19.540]   and yes they blink although less often
[00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:22.340]   to focus their vision on a narrow aperture
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:27.100]   and to really battle through that agitation, stress
[00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:28.960]   and learn how to keep their focus.
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.580]   Now focus will drift, right?
[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:33.180]   Focus is not a constant, focus will drift
[00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:34.680]   and you pop out of focus states
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.420]   and then refocus and pop out and refocus.
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:38.140]   That's something that you can train up.
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:39.340]   I've heard from many people who've managed
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:41.000]   to train themselves off medication
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.640]   or to lower doses of medication
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:44.060]   and look, some people can't do that.
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.020]   They absolutely have to maintain
[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:48.180]   their standard medication protocols.
[00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:51.340]   This is a larger discussion obviously
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:52.620]   as it relates to ADHD.
[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:54.680]   We're gonna do another episode on ADHD
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:57.280]   because the data are coming out so, so fast.
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:00.980]   What future episodes are in the pipeline, David Nguyen?
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:02.540]   Okay, thank you for that question.
[00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:03.620]   We have one on grief.
[00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:06.840]   We have an amazing episode with a guy
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.900]   from the Rockefeller University on the,
[00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:10.380]   this is, am I allowed to say
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:11.840]   it's gonna be my favorite episode?
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:15.060]   I love all the guests but this episode just blew me away
[00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.700]   on the relationship between language,
[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:22.220]   speech, dance and music and I have no musical talent
[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:25.300]   and I'm not a very good dancer so that's being generous.
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:28.680]   Amazing interplay between those things.
[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:33.500]   Exercise in the brain, OCD, bulimia,
[00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:35.140]   binge eating disorder.
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:38.620]   Peter Attia's coming on.
[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:40.900]   He'll teach us about everything, medicine
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:46.700]   and longevity and I'm kind of blanking at the moment.
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:48.640]   David Anderson from Caltech on aggression
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:51.160]   and emotional states, amazing.
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.060]   And then there are a number of people,
[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:55.980]   Lisa Feldman Barrett or Barrett Feldman,
[00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:57.340]   I always get it backwards, sorry Lisa,
[00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:58.860]   on emotions in the brain
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:00.960]   and really we do take suggestions
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:02.900]   about who to bring on the podcast very seriously.
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:05.060]   What we're mostly looking for,
[00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:06.600]   what we're mostly looking for are the people
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:11.420]   that no one else has heard, that people haven't heard of
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:14.340]   who are not going on podcasts every week
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:17.240]   and that people should absolutely hear from
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:18.500]   and then I will tell you,
[00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:19.700]   they're gonna kill me for saying this
[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:21.640]   but I'm gonna do it anyway.
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:23.760]   We have some short series coming up
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.740]   with expert professionals.
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:28.660]   I'm gonna do a short series on trauma
[00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:30.620]   and my hope for this series
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:31.980]   is that you'll actually get to see
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:34.600]   an exquisitely skilled trauma therapist
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:38.140]   take someone through, excuse me, I seem so excited,
[00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:41.100]   I'm spitting on the audience, excuse me,
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:45.020]   so to take someone through actual trauma therapy,
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.220]   this isn't staged, this is somebody who's actually
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:50.300]   in a point of near suicidal grief and trauma,
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:52.540]   taking them through it in the course of the podcast
[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:56.140]   so people can see what this process actually entails.
[00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:58.220]   That's a very meaningful project to me
[00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:02.420]   for a number of reasons, so we're really excited about that
[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:04.900]   and to be honest, I feel like there's just
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:06.940]   such a treasure trove of information out there,
[00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:10.500]   I just wanna grab it all and tell you all about it until,
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:15.500]   I always say, if nothing else, I'll cure insomnia, so yeah.
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:18.560]   (audience applauding)
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:21.320]   Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:24.480]   (audience applauding)
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:37.080]   Thank you, appreciate it.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:47.920]   Thank you so much for your time,
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:50.000]   I really appreciate everyone coming out on the weekday
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.560]   and I'd be remiss if I didn't say,
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:54.520]   thank you for your interest in science.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:57.680]   (audience applauding)
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:00.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:02.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:04.200]   (upbeat music)
