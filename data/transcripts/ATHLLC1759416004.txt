[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   Hey everyone. In this episode, we discuss the crypto platform BlockFi,
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.440]   and since recording it, a lot has happened in the news. As of today, November 15th,
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.320]   2022, BlockFi is no longer allowing customers to withdraw their own crypto,
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.160]   so all users, myself included, are stuck in a very frustrating situation. Needless to say,
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.840]   I'm not happy with the company, and any recommendation you might hear for them in
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.200]   this episode should be ignored and considered outdated. Okay, on to the episode. A quick word
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.920]   from our sponsor today. I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money,
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.200]   and so much more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.440]   which actually gets harder as you build your wealth. So I want to introduce you to today's
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.880]   sponsor, Longangle. Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.160]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.040]   I'm a member of Longangle, I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.840]   of the founders, Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.880]   investments. Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.200]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn from
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.200]   each other in a confidential, unbiased setting. On top of that, members also get access to some
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.400]   unique private market investment opportunities. Like I said, I'm a member, and I've gotten so
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.480]   much value from the community because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.920]   similar situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your children's education,
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.200]   to finding a concierge doctor. So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.400]   online. So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their minimum
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.680]   for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle, and it's totally free to join.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.320]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more. And if you choose to apply,

[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:11.920]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life,
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.320]   money, travel, all while spending less and saving more. I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.800]   and I'm excited to have you on my journey. And today we're joined by my former co-founder
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.640]   and longtime friend, Kevin Rose. Kevin's a partner at True Ventures,
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.760]   a venture capital firm that invests in early-stage tech startups, and the host of two podcasts,
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.760]   Modern Finance, which focuses on crypto, DeFi, and traditional finance,
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.280]   and Proof, which is all about NFTs. Previously, he founded the social news site Digg,
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.760]   the intermittent fasting app Zero, and the meditation app Oak. He's also one of the most
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.200]   successful angel investors I know. He was early in companies like Twitter, Facebook, and Square.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.720]   And while he might be known for being an entrepreneur, an investor, a crypto NFT expert,
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.600]   amongst his friends, he's also known for how deep he's gone on health and fitness and mindfulness.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.400]   So in this episode, we'll dive into all those things, all the hacks he's learned. We'll talk
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.360]   about his investment philosophy, what led him to be so successful, and we'll dive into crypto,
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.000]   including answering some of the questions you guys have sent in.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.120]   So I know this will be a fantastic conversation. So let's jump in.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   Kevin, thank you for being here.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.000]   Dude, it's good to be on. I'm so glad that after probably what we were talking about,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.800]   you starting a podcast for maybe a year or so, and then you did it. And now, boom,
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.360]   you exploded because I knew how much great content you would bring to your audience. So I just love
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.560]   it. The most famous hack I would say that you pulled off on me is you were always my go-to
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.480]   person for getting the most out of travel points. And the one that you pulled off for me and Daria
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.200]   was a flight to Tokyo, all with points, first class, and it was on Singapore Air.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.040]   And that is the airline where if you fly first class, they combine the two
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.560]   seats together, close off the wall, get rid of the center divider, and you literally have
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.200]   a queen size bed. And they put rose petals on the bed. It's ridiculous. And then they close the door
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.080]   so you have privacy and you're flying in the air to Tokyo with a private room. It is insane. And
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.480]   it was free. So thank you. Thank you for that. Yeah. I'm jealous because that's one of the few
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.640]   things I've never experienced and I've helped you do it. I've helped other people do it. So
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.520]   that is on the list when the world opens back up for me.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.440]   Oh, 100%. You got to do that one.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.360]   Yeah. So we've got a lot of ground to cover. So I'm going to jump in. We're about to kick
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.200]   off a new year. Everybody listening is probably thinking, "How do I live a healthier life,
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.640]   a happier..." And you've gone so deep on all of these fitness and life and mindfulness and
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.600]   health hacks. I'd love to know, before we jump into specific ones, what do you think's driven
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   your interest to experiment and learn so much here? Yeah, it's a good question. I think that
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:59.440]   I was always at a young age interested in just what I could do, like you, but more on the health
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.760]   side, what I could do to improve my health. And so I started listening to and reading, actually,
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.840]   Dr. Andrew Wiles' printed, mailed journal that would be sent to my mother, of all things. And
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.760]   that got me into the world of "alternative medicine," but more with an eye towards real
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.440]   science backing it up. And so for me, it's always been about... My wife's a scientist.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:28.640]   She has her PhD from UCSF, and she can help me read through all the crazy published literature
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.000]   and understand it at a level that I cannot. But for me, it's always been just understanding that
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.920]   the stuff that your doctors are telling you, like your primary care physician, is often 10 years out
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.040]   of date or longer. And it's not their fault, it's just that they're not up to speed on all the
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.760]   latest and greatest things. So I always wanted to get directly to the source of what are the
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.720]   scientists finding out, what are they talking about, what has been published in credible journals
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:01.520]   that is placebo-controlled, peer-reviewed, the gold standard for science, not just any random
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.880]   published paper on a half-dozen mice, but real data. And then what can we learn from it, and
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.440]   what's actionable that we can do today that will probably... Our doctors will be telling us to do
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.840]   10 years from now. So it's more about just being on the forefront and the bleeding edge of that
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.800]   stuff and trying it out and seeing what impact it has on my life. And some things work and some
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.840]   things I discard, but it's something I've always just had a passion for.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.120]   - And how do you stay on top of all of this?
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.480]   - Well, I would say there's a couple things. I'm not a doctor,
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.240]   and so I can't be giving medical advice, but I will tell you what I do is I work with the
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:42.320]   best physicians and scientists in the world. And so something that people won't tell you,
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.160]   there's a saying that kind of the technology is already here, it's just not widely distributed,
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.360]   meaning that the next big thing, you'll just hear about it a ways out. And so,
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.360]   like I mentioned earlier, I try to put myself as close to that source of information as possible.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.040]   So to do that, there's a couple scientists that I pay pretty close attention to and a physician,
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:09.520]   Dr. Peter Tia is one of them. He is a concierge doctor, a longevity doctor at the insanely high
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.880]   end, meaning that his clientele are very high net worth individuals that for him,
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:21.760]   it's trying to extend healthspan for his clients. The secret that he has is that he has a dozen or
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:27.680]   so scientists and analysts that work with him to pour through all the research as it's coming in.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:33.440]   And Rhonda Patrick, another scientist, PhD, she's got a great podcast as well. So there's a Tia,
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.280]   those are the two kind of go-tos because I know they're actually looking and reviewing all the
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.880]   science. So a lot of the things that you hear me mention today are distillations of their findings.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:49.200]   So I would say that's what I use as a source of credible information. And then from there,
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.800]   it's trying out the different things that are the recommendations. And it's what's crazy is,
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.960]   and this is, I hesitate to say some of this stuff, but if you were to join a private practice like
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:06.160]   this, this is something a lot of people will never tell you, is if you are a fortune 100 CEO and you
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.120]   have a high end concierge doctor that is working with scientists to give you the latest and greatest
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:17.280]   tech and extend your life, you're probably going to be paying that physician, I would say around
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.400]   a hundred, maybe a little bit, 150,000 a year, somewhere around there, just to be a client of
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:28.640]   theirs. And that's per year. And a lot of these physicians are so popular, their practices are
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.320]   booked out and you can't, even if you had that kind of money, you couldn't get a seat at the
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:38.080]   table. So one of the things I love about Rhonda and the Tia is they both offer this information.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:43.200]   Even though a Tia does have clientele like that and has a practice that has a waiting list,
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.080]   he offers all the information out to individuals that subscribe to his podcast. And so the
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.920]   information is out there and you can get it, you just have to know where to look. And so that's
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.080]   been what I focus on, is just taking that information and turn it into actual things that I
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.200]   try. Yeah, I love it. So we'll put links to both those podcasts in the show notes. So how do these
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:06.160]   concierge doctors work and what are regular doctors actually missing? So I'll give you an
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.400]   insider kind of look at what these practices look like. The first thing that they do is they have
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:16.080]   you come in and you sit down. And it's so crazy because when, you know, growing up, when we went
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.640]   to a primary care physician, it was often like, "Okay, what are you here for? Oh, you got a cold.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.160]   Okay, I'll see you for five minutes. Okay, see you, peace out." Like on to the next patient,
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.840]   you're one of a thousand on their books. And so you never really get to spend any time with your
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:34.480]   actual physician. So his whole intake process is like a multi-day thing. And you start off by going
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.640]   through a lot of family history because the most important thing you can get at is what are my risk
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:44.560]   factors? Because everyone is different, right? We all have our own unique DNA. And that DNA has
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:50.480]   different what they call these things like genetic polymorphisms, which are different factors that
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.760]   we can look at our genes and have our genes analyzed. And that's something we can talk about
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.000]   to look at the different risk factors that are in our genes. But we'll do this whole intake. And for
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.800]   me, it was a cardiovascular disease. My father died of a heart attack. My grandfather died of
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:08.080]   a heart attack. Lots of risk there. I have some cancer risk a bit and that my mom has bladder
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:14.000]   cancer. So some risk there. And so once we figure out what those risk factors are, then we go deep
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   into that blood work. And so it's going in, taking a look at the blood work, knowing what to look for
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.320]   and so many times like the information that your primary care physician is going to give you is
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:29.440]   out of date. So for example, if you go into your doctor today, the number one thing they'll tell
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:34.960]   you when looking for your cholesterol numbers is triglycerides, HDL and LDL. Primarily, that's
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.520]   going to be your standard physician. The latest thinking there is yes, those numbers do matter.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:45.680]   But there's a blood test called APOB, which Atiyah does on all of his clients, that and he
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.760]   has multiple podcasts that address this with the scientists that are studying it. That is the most
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:55.600]   important predictor of heart disease. And so you with most physicians, you have to ask for that.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.200]   And they go, why do you want to know that? Like, yeah, I can order it for you, but why? And they
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:04.560]   just haven't read the latest science. So it's a matter of getting that particular number down.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.640]   So I have a buddy who is taking the highest statin out there is so proud and looks and says, Hey,
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:15.520]   look at my LDL, my HDL, like my triglycerides, I'm all good. And then went in for a calcium
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.360]   heart scan, which is the other thing that you can do, which is a very important thing to get done
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.120]   to look for calcification of the arteries. And it's this non-invasive heart scan that you can
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:28.000]   have done and had a bunch of calcification, which means that there's going to be a problem. Like
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.960]   that's a early predictor of heart disease. And he's like, why I don't get it. And then checked
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.520]   his APOB number. And it was like five times what it should have been. I was like, oh crap,
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.880]   like this isn't working. I need to do other dietary interventions or even the new classes
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.600]   of drugs. Like I'll give you another example. So many people, so many doctors will prescribe you
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.320]   statins, right? That's the standard treatment. But there are these things called PKS-9 inhibitors
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:57.920]   that are a better class of drugs that are better than statins for many people. And obviously talk
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.200]   to your physician, you wouldn't be able to even get this unless you talk to your physician, but
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:07.280]   it is a, it's a shot that I take every two weeks and it just hammers down my APOB number and puts
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.000]   me into a good place. So, you know, I'm in my forties. I've got a couple of kids. I need to
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.120]   take this stuff really seriously. So that's just a great example of one of the many things that
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.280]   a standard physician wouldn't tell you. And it's something you should demand of your physician is
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:24.400]   that they are paying attention to the latest science. - And if they're not, what do you think
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:30.480]   of the different tests you can run with WellnessFX? You could do like an advanced heart health blood
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.960]   panel. What do you think about going to companies like that? - Yeah, absolutely. You know, I've done
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.960]   that before I had one of these concierge doctors. I basically would listen to things like these
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:46.560]   podcasts from people I trusted and then go and do it on my own. So if your doctor won't do that,
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:51.120]   you can use a service like that. I've used that service. You can also just go on Life Extension
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:57.040]   and order labs directly from them that will pick up APOB as well. But honestly, even if you get
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:01.120]   these numbers back and you're listening to the podcast and you're comparing them and you're like,
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.200]   "Oh, I'm out of range." What are you going to do? Like how are you going to address this? You have
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:10.160]   to find a physician that believes in the latest science. And that is, and so that's going to take
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.320]   a little bit of calling around and talking to physicians and making sure you find someone
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:19.520]   that's following this. - Nice. Okay. So that's heart health. What about one that I know we've
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:24.560]   talked a lot about? And I know we went through a five-day fast together where it was water only,
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.480]   but I wouldn't say I've kept up as much. What's the latest on fasting? Is that something you're
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:34.320]   still practicing? - Yeah, absolutely. I mean, there's a few things to mention. One, we know
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:39.120]   that fasting can create something called autophagy, which means those weaker precancerous cells,
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.600]   the ones that could potentially go rogue when they are deprived of nutrients for extended periods of
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.640]   time, they self-destruct, which is a good thing. That's what you want. You want these cells to die
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:55.200]   off. Short periods of fasting can be great for that. That's why I created the app Zero. My friend
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:01.200]   Mike Mazur, who took the app over, he actually was battling cancer at the time, and there was
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.800]   some great research out of UC San Diego with Satchin Panda and one other physician. I'm drawing
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:13.920]   a blank right now, but out of essentially showing that when you take and incorporate fasting as part
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.600]   of your chemotherapy, it can even be more effective at killing off either of these cancer cells or the
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.480]   precancerous cells. So he was implementing, and obviously, if you have cancer, you have to talk
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:27.360]   to your physician about this, but he was implementing a fasting regimen in with his
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.560]   chemotherapy treatment, had a fantastic outcome. And then it was just clear to me that the other
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:39.040]   big thing that is just a no-brainer is anytime anyone is obese, it is linked to a whole slew
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:44.000]   of bad things, right? Whether it be heart disease or diabetes, or there's actually, I think it's a
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.600]   dozen or so, 12 or 13 different cancers that are linked with obesity. So just getting your body
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:55.440]   composition down and your visceral fat down into a place where it should be, fasting can be yet
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.240]   another tool for that toolkit in that it's just something to add, whether you decide to do
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:06.800]   intermittent fasting a few times a week, or do extended duration fasts once a quarter or every
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.200]   other month or something like that. So it's certainly something that I want to make sure I
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.160]   get at least a few days in per month of. I do the longer duration. Some people just do 16 hours a
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:22.400]   day or 18 hours a day. I'm more of a fan of just doing a couple of days of longer duration. It's
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:27.440]   things called like a monk fast, like a 36-hour fast, things like that. And Xero supports all
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.840]   of that. And there's a lot more data in there. It's also just, it is one of those things that
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:37.280]   you feel afterwards, you just feel like you've given your body and your gut some time to just
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:42.240]   take a break and kind of repair and heal and have some downtime there, which is also really nice,
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.920]   especially after the holidays, man. I'm definitely going to go back on the fasting train.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.320]   Oh, man. Definitely. So one other one I'll mention, and then I'll let you add any. We're
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:56.480]   both fans of sauna. I've been trying to figure out where in my house/driveway or somewhere I
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.080]   can put one. I know it's something really important to you. What kind of drove you to
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:07.120]   be so fascinated with sauna therapy in general? Yeah, it's honestly, it's just the studies that
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.440]   were being published. A lot of them are coming out of Finland and just a lot of the data that
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:16.480]   we were seeing. When you look at the studies, it is just, there's something that happens when
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:22.080]   essentially what it is, and I'm doing this off the top of my head, but I'm 95% sure it's accurate.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:29.360]   It's 174 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes. That is like the heat and the duration that you need to
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:34.240]   activate something in your body called heat shock proteins. And when these proteins are activated,
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:40.320]   they do all types of beneficial things in the body. And so out of these studies that came out
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:47.360]   of Finland and there's since been a few others, some of the effects were just insanely positive.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:55.520]   I'll give you an example. So men who saunaed two to three times per week were 27% less likely
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.280]   to die from cardiovascular related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:05.760]   And there was other benefits around, well, here I'll read the rest of it. Furthermore,
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.800]   the benefits they experienced were found to be dose dependent. Men who used the sauna roughly
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:16.560]   twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefit
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:21.360]   and were 50% less likely to die from cardiovascular related causes. In addition,
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:27.040]   frequent sauna users were found to be 40% less likely to die from all causes of premature death.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:32.080]   So all cause mortality. This even held true when they considered age, activity levels,
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:36.160]   and other lifestyle factors that may have influenced the men's health. So what they
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:41.520]   mean by that is they controlled for external factors. And this is really important because
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.400]   in some sense, you could say, if you're going to the sauna, you're probably already a healthy
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:49.040]   person. So of course they didn't die of cardiovascular disease, but they controlled
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:54.320]   for that as well. So people that had poor diets were included and they figure out how to compensate
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:59.840]   for that on the stats side. So the other really interesting fact is that men who use the sauna
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:06.800]   four to seven times per week had a 66% lower risk in developing dementia and a 65% lower risk in
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:11.280]   developing Alzheimer's disease compared to men that use the sauna only once per week.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:18.800]   So it's just some really interesting data around sauna usage. And it is a very pleasurable activity.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.280]   We're not talking about running marathons here. Like you literally just go in, sit down,
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:28.400]   and enjoy the sauna and sweat it out for 20 minutes. So it will take some ramping up to.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:34.640]   174 is, it took me probably a month to be able to just walk out there feeling good versus feeling
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:39.200]   like I was like heat exhausted, you know, in some sense. Obviously you have to hydrate a ton,
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:45.760]   but yeah, that's something where, you know, you can pick up a sauna. I like the traditional saunas.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.160]   I don't do the infrared ones, but it's a couple thousand dollar investment to get these standalone
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:55.520]   units, the very small ones that fit one or two people. And I would say, you know, what an
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.480]   investment in your health and your future. So it's certainly something that I think has a lot of
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:06.240]   strong data behind it and is also something that's relaxing and fun to do with your significant other.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:11.520]   - Any other things you've experimented with or you've heard about that are worth sharing on the
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:18.160]   kind of health mindfulness kind of side of things? - Yeah, there's a ton of little tiny hacks that I
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:24.000]   think would be good for just a little rapid fire ones. Like for example, lithium, the mineral,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.040]   they've shown, they did this study where they found that when lithium is present in drinking
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.880]   water, and this is like, they looked all across the United States and they found when it's
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.480]   naturally at a little bit higher levels, like microdose levels, that there was less depression,
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:45.520]   less suicides. It was just like this mineral that we typically don't get a lot of, and we don't need
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:50.560]   a lot of it. We actually just to microdose it will improve mental states and potentially protect
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.960]   against Alzheimer's disease as well. There's been some early data on that. So for me, I was like,
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:59.120]   okay, I don't have any lithium out here where I live here in Portland. I did the analysis of my
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:06.080]   local water and it was next to nothing. So how can you get this as a microdose? And I did some
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:11.840]   research and I found this sparkling water that actually has a little bit higher than the microdose
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.640]   levels that are found in drinking water that I actually love. It's this German sparkling water.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:21.760]   It's called, I'm going to butcher this one, Gerolsteiner. Okay, so Gerolsteiner sparkling
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:27.680]   water, they have it on Amazon and it's not cheap, but it will get you that kind of microdose of
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.480]   lithium. There have since been microdose of kind of lithium pills and things that you can try as
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:37.920]   well. But yeah, we can link to some of that data. I thought that was interesting. Another really fun
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:45.600]   one is chocolate. So chocolate we all know has this tasty treat, but in its purest form, meaning
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:52.880]   just like pulverized ground up chocolate, there has been just a ton of papers around the health
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:59.440]   benefits of chocolate, both in terms of vascular health and improving the flexibility of arteries
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:04.480]   and helping the heart and brain. And Cocovia is a brand, and I have no affiliation with any of
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:10.480]   the stuff we're mentioning today. Cocovia is a brand that actually is sponsored or created by
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.480]   the Mars company. So the Mars chocolate company actually poured a ton of money into this research,
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:20.160]   which one could argue it would be, you always worry who's backing the research. If it's a
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.360]   chocolate company, it's in their best interest to back this research. But everyone that's read
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.800]   the studies that I've looked at has said it's actually really solid data and they've just been
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:31.280]   a financial backer and didn't have any kind of vested interest in positive results here.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:37.120]   But they put out pills specifically for supplement for heart health and brain health that I've tried
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.440]   that I think are fantastic. You get a little hit of about 20 milligrams of naturally occurring
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:46.320]   caffeine. And so I'll take a couple of these little chocolate pills with my coffee in the
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:53.840]   morning, my plain coffee. And it's just, it's insane the quick mental boost I get. So they say
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:59.680]   it starts improving blood flow within two hours. And it just, I notice it, which is crazy. There's
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.720]   not many supplements I take immediately notice it. You take your multivitamin, your fish oils,
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:09.440]   your vitamin D or whatever, and you don't notice anything. But this is one where it's definitely
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:14.480]   worth picking up a bottle and check out the website, Cocovia. They link to a bunch of the
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:20.000]   different studies, published papers and 30 plus clinical studies with some of the leading research
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.200]   institutions they used. It's really interesting stuff.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:27.120]   - Yeah. You just mentioned vitamins. If you found out someone like me was not
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.480]   taking a multivitamin regularly, is your reaction, what are you doing? That's crazy?
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.880]   - It depends on your diet. If you're eating a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables and that's
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.760]   part of your kind of regimen, then it's not crazy. But I would say that historically,
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:45.520]   they've noticed that because of the kind of minerals in the earth going by the wayside,
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:51.040]   they're being less and they're being more, even organic farming can oftentimes produce less
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:55.600]   nutrients in their vegetables than even say a couple of decades ago, just because the erosion
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:00.960]   of nutrients in the soil, then yeah, you're not quite getting the same nutrient load that you
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.520]   were. So I don't know. I use it as an insurance policy. I don't think of it as a main primary
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:11.280]   source, but there's so many good brands at your local fancy grocery store that has all the...
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:17.440]   You want to pick something that isn't just your cheapest option, but really look into
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.840]   their farming practices and where they source their ingredients. I go for multivitamins that
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:27.360]   are derived from food versus that are made in the lab. So they don't say 100% food-based
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:32.560]   multivitamin and that's kind of my go-to. - Nice. Anything else in the rapid fire?
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:37.600]   - I mean, something on the, I would say on the early side that is probably worth paying
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:43.440]   attention to, there is a compound out there that's a prescription called Ozempic. And again,
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:49.920]   I listened to Tia's podcast on that one, but it is for glucose regulation. And one of the things
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:55.040]   that we noticed, and I encourage people to do this as well with their primary physician, is do
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:00.800]   something called a glucose tolerance test, where you essentially go in, they check your glucose,
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:07.040]   and then put through it via a blood draw. And then they make you drink a 100% pure sugar
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:13.040]   glucose, oral glucose drink. And then they measure your glucose in 30-minute intervals
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.040]   over the course of a couple hours. And they're also looking at your insulin levels as well.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:22.800]   And so you're looking for how high do you spike with a full drink like that on an empty stomach?
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:28.080]   And then also how quickly and how sensitized are your muscles and how quickly are they
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:33.280]   uptaking the glucose and how much insulin is being issued to combat the glucose. So you can see
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:38.720]   how good are you at glucose disposal as well. And so for me, this is where I had an issue.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:45.520]   And so Tia was first identified and said, "Hey, you're not pre-diabetic, but we don't like how
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.600]   long the glucose is sticking around in your system. You're elevated way too long. You should
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:55.200]   be about half that or less. So we can treat this a couple of different ways. And we need to get
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.840]   under control because any amount of elevated sugar in the bloodstream is just not good for
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.680]   inflammation and a whole slew of other different things. And eventually it does lead to pre-diabetes
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:09.600]   and diabetes. The ways you can do that are two primarily ways, one pharmacologically or two,
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:15.040]   sensitize the muscles more. And so that can be through weightlifting or zone two cardio.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:21.680]   On the actual medication side, the Azempic drug is just amazing. It's a subcutaneous shot that
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:27.200]   you take every couple of weeks and it really gets your glucose under control. And one big side
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.120]   effect is you actually lose weight while doing it as well. So I've had some friends that have
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:36.160]   been on it for a series of months and they've dropped 10, 15, 20 pounds just by taking this
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:41.920]   drug. The downside is that it's really expensive because it is so new. And if you can get it covered
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:47.520]   by your insurance, if you're a type two diabetic, then that's the way to go. If you don't have
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:52.960]   diabetes, which I don't, they won't cover it for your insurance. And so the best bet I found is
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:57.120]   going to that good RX site, getting one of those printable coupons. I don't know if you've seen
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:01.200]   those coupons sites that you can use for getting prescriptions that you can take into your pharmacy
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.440]   and those give you, I think, a hundred dollars off or something like that. And then Costco has
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:10.240]   the cheapest prices for Azempic, but it's still going to run you a little over 20 grand a year,
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:16.320]   somewhere around there. So it is not cheap, but for those of you that have true glucose issues
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:21.840]   like myself, and if it's within your budget, it's an option. But I will tell you, it's something to
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:27.120]   keep on your radar because just the PKS9 inhibitors I'm talking about, rather than statins that I was
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:31.680]   talking about earlier, that shot, it's another one that's not cheap. Your insurance may cover it,
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:37.520]   but if they don't, it's something where two, three, you check in every couple of years because
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:42.800]   as these things become wider and wider adopted, they can produce more, manufacturing processes
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:48.080]   improve, the price of these drugs can plummet. And when they do go down and you want to be able,
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.240]   and they are within striking distance of being able to afford them, then you want to jump on
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:57.520]   them right away. Yeah. And ask your insurance company. I was picking up something at the
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.680]   pharmacy the other day and the pharmacist said, "Oh, this is probably not going to be covered by
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:06.080]   your insurance." And I don't have anything fancy. I just have a standard employer insurance policy.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:10.880]   And they were like, "Oh, actually, most people don't cover this and yours does." So you might
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:16.320]   have luck sometimes with things just finding out if your insurance covers them because I just found
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.720]   out this random thing was. Fortunately, it was only $20. So it didn't... My copay was about exactly
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:25.440]   the same as the thing I was picking up. So it didn't matter much, but... Have you used GoodRx
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:31.440]   before? I haven't used GoodRx. We've used Alto Pharmacy as a pharmacy that delivers to your house
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:36.320]   for the same price as prescriptions. Basically, by not having a storefront, they can include
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.240]   the delivery. And I love that, but I haven't used GoodRx. Yeah. GoodRx is great. You can just go in
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:44.240]   there, type in a drug name, it'll find you the lowest price for it. It oftentimes just gives you
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:49.440]   a coupon and you can just print it out and literally just take it down to Costco or Walmart
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.720]   or CVS or whatever and they'll honor it and give you a better price. That's awesome.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:28:01.200]   The only other thing I would add is these stress gummies that my wife loves. They're really cool.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:06.320]   They're called Pym, P-Y-M. And you can pick these up on Amazon and you can obviously link them up
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:12.240]   in your show notes. They were created by a friend of ours, Zach Williams. And after his father passed
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:20.000]   away, he just wanted to focus on mental health and mood. And it's been something that he'd be
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.320]   the first to admit has just been something that he's struggled with and wants to help other people
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:31.040]   with as well. And he came up with a really awesome formulation of just very simple ingredients.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:36.640]   It's just GABA, L-theanine, and rhodiola. It's three just ingredients. They're these little
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:42.080]   chews. And my wife swears by them. She chews a couple when we're putting the kids down for bed
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.840]   at night. And she's like, "I don't even want to have a glass of wine after I have it." She's like,
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:50.320]   "It just helps me chill out." And they're not that expensive and you can get them on Amazon.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:55.600]   And Zach is really an awesome human. And I highly recommend them. And then also,
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.920]   the cool thing is if they do work for you, because it's only three ingredients,
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.760]   there's so many times you buy these things that are like, "Mood this or that." And it's like,
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:07.760]   "Proprietary formulation," it says on the back. And then it's 20 different ingredients. You're
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:11.280]   like, "Okay, how do I know which ingredient actually helped me here?" Because then maybe
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.560]   it's just the L-theanine you need, or maybe it's just the GABA you need, or you just don't know.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.960]   So with these three ingredients, you can then go off and buy individual components of it if
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:23.840]   you want to try different pieces and see how it makes you feel. But these are just really fun for
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:27.360]   when you feel just a little overwhelmed, a little anxiety, a little stress, and just pop a couple
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:33.040]   of these and they're my go-to for that type of stuff. That's awesome. Yeah. The only other one
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:39.200]   I want to share was something you shared with me, was that I'd done my 23andMe test. And I was
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:43.200]   telling you like, "I checked. There's not that much data." And you were like, "Were you looking
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.560]   at it on 23andMe?" And I was like, "Yeah, of course." And you were like, "You can't do that.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:51.360]   You got to download your 23andMe data and go look at it somewhere else." So I can't remember the
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:55.840]   exact process. Maybe you still remember it. But that was a total unlock, totally free if you've
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:02.240]   ever done 23andMe. Yeah, that's the whole thing. So the thing with 23andMe is, obviously, great
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:06.640]   place. You spit in a tube, you send it in $100, you get your whole genetic history. It's great
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:11.280]   at giving you maps of where you came from, where your ancestors came from, who your cousins are,
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:18.800]   things like that. But they are really a little bit gun-shy on giving you, as they should be,
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:24.240]   health advice around this type of stuff. The interesting thing about having your access to
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:30.880]   your genes is what they're showing you in your actual data are these little things, these little,
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:36.800]   they call them SNPs, which they're single nucleotide polymorphisms, where everyone
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:43.280]   has different SNPs, that is different genetic modifications or gene expressions that are unique
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:51.280]   to us. And sometimes you can look at that data, if you analyze it properly, and you can figure
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:55.120]   out what's going on and address certain health issues. So I'll give you an example. There's a
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:31:04.480]   very common genetic polymorphism called MTHFR. And if you have one or two of those SNPs, then
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:09.680]   you're probably going to be a pretty bad absorber of B vitamins. And if you're a bad absorber of B
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:14.720]   vitamins, there's probably going to be elevated homocysteine in your blood work. And that just
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:21.760]   is bad. It hasn't been shown. It's been shown as being correlated with heart disease in certain
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:26.720]   cancers, but not causal, if that makes sense. So it's there when they're there, but they can't
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:31.840]   prove. It might just be that it's apparent, but it's not actually causing the heart disease,
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.440]   if that makes sense. It just rides along with it. Something else is going on or is wrong.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:41.680]   But if you know that, you can take certain types of methylated B vitamins or higher-dose B vitamins
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:48.720]   and then beat down and reduce your homocysteine levels. So this is one example of a bunch of
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:53.360]   different things that you can figure out. I think that Rhonda has the best genetic analyzer out
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:32:00.640]   there. It's foundmyfitness.com. You can go on her site and just connect your, you'll have to go into
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:04.560]   23andMe. You have to go in the settings. And there's a secret little setting in there that
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:10.320]   says export your data to let you download the raw data file, which has all of your information. And
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:15.600]   then you take that to Rhonda's site, upload it. And then she does the analysis or her machine,
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.760]   the computer does the analysis in real time, spits you back your report. And then it gives you
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:24.720]   something you can go and talk to your physician about because they tell you what's going on with
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:32.080]   the different SNPs that you might have. Now, one thing that you should just know about is they have
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:37.280]   the SNPs in there for Alzheimer's disease. So some people get freaked out by this particular SNP. So
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:43.120]   they have these things called, the way they classify them is you're either a 3/3. This is
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:48.080]   just how they classify them, which means that you don't have it. You're a 3/4, which means you have
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:53.840]   one copy of it. Or you're a 4/4, which means you have two copies of this particular gene. So if
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:58.720]   you're a 3/3, which I am, then you're standard risk, just like anyone else. If you're a 3/4,
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:04.480]   which my wife is, then you have, I think, a 20% increased risk of getting Alzheimer's disease.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:08.320]   And if you're a 4/4, it's really high. It's something like, I don't know, I'm going to
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:13.600]   misquote it, but it's 60 or 70% increased risk of getting Alzheimer's disease. So the good news is
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.520]   that there's a great book called The End of Alzheimer's. There's a lot of things that if you
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:22.160]   know about this stuff, especially these genes early on, you can get in front of it. And you
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:27.200]   can get in front of it in terms of diet, low inflammation of diet, also a lot of exercise,
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:33.200]   sauna usage, like all the regimen that you can do that they have proven can delay the kind of
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:38.080]   onset of this stuff. If you take action now, some people freak out and they're like, "I don't want
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:42.080]   to see that. I just don't even want to know." Because there's not a whole lot of great treatments
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:48.080]   once you are actually diagnosed. So just be aware that it's going to expose that data. It shows you
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:52.480]   a lot of stuff that 23andMe won't show you. I prefer that. I think knowledge is power. And I
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:57.040]   think there's always something you can do here. So I'm fine with it, but just something to be aware
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:02.560]   of. That's awesome. We went through a lot. I know you mentioned Atiya and Rhonda's podcast.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:06.320]   Any other sources of information to follow for all this stuff?
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:12.160]   Yeah, Matt Walker, who runs the Berkeley Sleep Lab, he has a new podcast out there
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:17.600]   that I would say we are increasingly just understanding the importance of sleep and
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.640]   its role in repairing the brain and mental health and a whole slew of different things.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:28.880]   So I think definitely check out Matt Walker's podcast. Now, I will tell you, Peter Atiya,
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:34.640]   to get the most out of his podcast, it is a paid podcast. It's not a whole lot. You'd have to look
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:39.760]   it up, Chris. I don't have it in front of me. It's $50 a year or something. But this is a physician
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:47.440]   whose clients pay a ton of money for the same thing. It is worth every single penny, in my
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:53.360]   opinion. And I have no financial interest in anything he does. But the scientists that he
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:58.480]   has on the show and what they're telling you ahead of time that you'll learn about years before anyone
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:03.600]   else, it's just worth every penny. So anyway, yeah, check out Atiya's stuff.
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:04.100]   Awesome.
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:09.700]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and the cracks
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:14.340]   start to emerge. Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:19.220]   too many manual processes and there's no one source of truth. If this is you,
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:26.980]   you should know these three numbers. 37,000, 25, 1. 37,000. That's the number of businesses which
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:31.700]   have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle. And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.

[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:38.340]   I wish I could say that I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day, but the reality is
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:44.020]   that I am definitely not. So I love having an easy way to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:48.580]   which is why I kickstart my day with Athletic Greens, and I am excited to be partnering with
[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:53.380]   them for this episode. I started taking it because I wanted to see what all the hype was about,
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:58.900]   and I've kept it in my daily routine for months. Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:03.780]   add a few ice cubes, it tastes so good when it's cold, and I head to my office feeling
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:09.220]   focused and energized for the day, which is a feeling I absolutely love. I also love that
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:15.060]   it's made from 75 high-quality vitamins, minerals, and superfoods, and contains less than one gram
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:21.540]   of sugar. It also has no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything. To make giving it a try
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:27.380]   easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one-year supply of immune-supporting vitamin D,
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:32.340]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase. All you have to do is visit

[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:45.060]   to take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:48.900]   Okay, I know we got a lot of ground to cover, and I want to get to crypto and investing.
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:54.660]   Quick, before we get there, are there any other uncommon things you do in your routine,
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:59.300]   tools and services you use that might be worth sharing that kind of fall in the category of
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:02.500]   kind of hacks or optimizations? On the health side?
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:07.620]   Outside of the health side, just general life, things you do at work, on your computer,
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:11.700]   things you do professionally? I'm a security kind of nut, I would say,
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:15.780]   so there's probably, I think that when you, especially in the world of cryptocurrency,
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:22.420]   when you have to get serious about protecting your data, I do have a couple of little hacks
[00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:25.940]   there that I would say most people don't know about that I think are really important.
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:32.820]   So I guess it'd probably be a great way to move into our crypto talk, but I'll tell you one thing
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:38.660]   that I think is really important. So when you're creating and investing in crypto online, well,
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:46.420]   or anything, let's take a step back. Anytime you have online financial information,
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:50.580]   how do you access that? Well, you access it through putting in your email address and putting
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:54.100]   in your password. So when you log into your bank, when you log into your Coinbase account,
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.380]   when you log into any of these things, your Square Cash app, whatever it may be,
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:05.460]   it's almost always email address, password, right? Now, the issue with that is if that is compromised,
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:10.820]   then someone can, if your email is compromised, meaning someone gains access to your email,
[00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:14.100]   they can go and reset any of these passwords. They can go reset your Coinbase password,
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:18.820]   they can go reset all these different passwords, and they can log in. And in the case of
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:22.660]   cryptocurrency, we know it's a lot harder to recover those funds. Well, it's impossible to
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:25.540]   recover those funds once they're out of your wallet, they're sent to someone else.
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:32.340]   So one of the things I think people should consider is creating a second email address.
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:37.060]   So you have your email address that everyone knows that you talk to when you talk to strangers,
[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:40.180]   when you're selling something on eBay, when you're selling something on Craigslist,
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:45.060]   when you're doing all these things, you have a public email address. And of course, that's fine,
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:50.580]   but that's not tied to anything that you could be compromised with. So you want to create a
[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:54.260]   separate email address. Now, here's the thing. It's like, "Okay, yeah, sure, Kevin, I get it.
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:59.220]   Submit your email address, who cares?" There is something that Google has created
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:06.020]   called Google's Advanced Protection Security. So most people don't know about this. They don't
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:12.260]   publicize it directly on their website, but you can Google Advanced Protection Security.
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:16.900]   And what they'll do is they'll take your Gmail account, and this is completely free of charge,
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:24.900]   and they turn on extra security options that lock down a ton of stuff. So when you have advanced
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:29.540]   security turned on, they won't allow you to connect to third-party email clients, they won't
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:34.740]   allow you to access... I'm sure you've logged into those websites where it says, "Log in with your
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:40.420]   Gmail," and you try to log in with your Gmail. The scary thing back in the day was that some of
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:46.180]   those would ask for access to your email account and could see your emails and do all kinds of
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:52.100]   other things. So the advanced security just is probably a dozen or so things that they offer
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:58.580]   that really keep that account safe, including the requirement that you must have a hardware key.
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:05.540]   So they sell these little USB keys that require your actual finger to touch them in order for
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:09.540]   you to log into your account. And you can say, "Authorize this laptop forever," so you can just
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:13.620]   stick in the USB key, touch it with your fingers, pull it out, stick it in a drawer, and then that
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:18.900]   laptop will be authorized forever. But it will really prevent hackers from getting into your
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:24.740]   account. And you want to create a separate email address, use that for your Coinbase account,
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:29.860]   all your crypto stuff, your banking stuff, whatever that may be, and have that extra layer
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:35.300]   of security, and you'll sleep better at night. Yeah, I did that. We were actually hanging out
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:41.460]   in San Diego right after a piece came out about all my frequent flyer miles, and I just got
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:46.980]   rampantly attacked. I was getting calls from all the... Amex and Chase asking if I really wanted
[00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:52.180]   to transfer, if I really wanted to buy a MacBook, all this stuff. And so I moved every financial
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:58.180]   institution, every airline where I had frequent flyer miles, all to a new email address. No one
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:01.780]   has any reason to know that email address because I don't email on it, and it locked it down.
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:06.340]   And then the other one, I don't know if you do this, I've turned off everywhere possible
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:12.980]   two-factor auth with text. I put it to security keys. I put those security keys in one password,
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:18.420]   and I try to avoid that. I know there is this whole problem that I assume the carriers have
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:22.980]   gotten better, but people could pretty easily swap your phone number and get access to it,
[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:27.380]   and then they could verify things with your phone number. So I've tried to turn off two-factor auth
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:32.180]   as much as possible and rely on authentication keys. You can use Google Authenticator. I put
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:37.700]   mine in one password. Yeah, a hundred percent. I'm on the same train in that all it takes is
[00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:43.060]   someone trying to act as you, and then they could transfer your phone number to a different device,
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:49.220]   and then they can go to town and start working on all those accounts. There are a couple companies
[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:57.140]   out there that protect against SIM swapping fraud that are dedicated companies that they don't use
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:01.060]   the last four digits of your social or your date of birth or your anniversary to get access to
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:05.540]   here. Because oftentimes when you call your cellular provider, they're like, "Oh, you don't
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:08.580]   remember your password? Well, just give us the last four of your social." And of course, that's
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:14.820]   been hacked, and it's all over the internet these days. But there's a couple other services that
[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:22.980]   prevent SIM card swapping, and they're essentially... They act like an intermediary between
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:28.580]   you and your cell phone provider, so you don't have to swap cell phone providers, but they are
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:33.700]   the ones that protect your SIM. It makes it much harder for someone to try and steal it. So stay
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:37.780]   tuned. I'm going to try a bunch of those out and then let you know which ones I like, and I'll
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:41.860]   relay the information back to you, Chris, in a future episode you can mention on the show as a
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:48.260]   hack. Yeah. And this might sound so simple, but a hack that I learned is you don't have to use your
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:53.140]   real mother's maiden name as your mother's maiden name. Oh, for sure. So when I call into the bank
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:58.020]   and they're like, "What's your mother's maiden name?" I give them a word that is not my mother's
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:02.340]   maiden name, and you can do that. Yeah, your mother's maiden name can be pancakes, can be
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:09.140]   anything. Yeah, that's so true. So I've changed all of those things. "What's your favorite
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:15.300]   instrument?" is often a 15 random character string that I've saved in one password. It can be
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:19.940]   annoying if you're trying to use a computer and you don't have access to one password and you
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:24.340]   can't log in, but the flip side is it's much more annoying to have someone steal your money or your
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:29.620]   frequent flyer miles. So that's awesome. So knocked out security. I want to get to the thing
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:34.020]   you're spending all of your time in, or at least a lot of your time on right now, which is all about
[00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:39.140]   investing in crypto. And before we get in, I just want to highlight, I think one of your superpowers
[00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:45.380]   has to be your willingness to dive in, understand things and take risk. And it's probably the reason
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:50.420]   that you're so deep in crypto right now. But I just want to ask, what do you think made you so
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:56.340]   successful with your ability to take risks and make good investments? Well, I guess a couple
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:03.060]   things. One, it is, I've always had this feeling that when I was younger, that when I would look
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:08.500]   at kind of where things were going, especially on the tech side of things, it seemed obvious to me
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:15.620]   where things were moving. I could kind of more or less gauge these shifts in momentum. And then
[00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:22.180]   on the investment side, it is just taking that and applying some, a little bit of rigor around it,
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:25.860]   and more or less just investing what I call like investing in the inevitable.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:31.140]   So just when you see something that is a new idea that has some light traction on it,
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:38.180]   but you can close your eyes and fast forward and you understand that, of course, a decade from now,
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:44.420]   this is going to continue to grow and be a big market, then that takes a lot of the fear out
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:50.740]   of the equation for me and allows me to just pretend I'm living in the future, more or less,
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:55.620]   and just take the leap now. And so, you know, I remember there was one time when I was sitting in
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:46:00.820]   San Francisco, this was many years ago, and there was a garbage truck going up my hill because
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:05.780]   San Francisco is a very hilly city. And it was just struggling to even make it up the hill. I
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:09.540]   thought it was, I literally thought I was going to die and roll down this massive hill. And it was
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:15.380]   so clear to me at that point, Tesla's had just come out and just watch a Tesla just with like,
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:21.940]   effortlessly climb that hill. I was like, the future is not this loud, noisy, old,
[00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:26.260]   they're not going to be better versions of this that control the future. Of course,
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:32.020]   everything's going electric. And when e-commerce first started, Amazon really started getting to
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:37.300]   scale and offering cloud infrastructure, of course, everything's going to the cloud. So it's just,
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:42.580]   it's trying to find those moments that are true to you, that you internally can look at and say,
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:49.380]   we're early days here, let me get involved now. And then dollar cost averaged my way in. So it
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:53.860]   was never about me just putting in, it wasn't the angel side, because you place an investment and
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:58.900]   then you walk away and let the company go and run. But if it's already a publicly traded company,
[00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:04.500]   it's having some conviction, placing a small bet, and then maybe dividing up what your total
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:08.340]   investment is going to be and doing an investment at the same time every month for the next three
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:12.740]   months, just to kind of dollar cost average your way in. That's in my strategy. But that's not to
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:19.460]   say there's the obvious stuff that's already big. And for me, it's I kind of avoid that stuff.
[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:24.900]   Amazon's a great example today, fantastic organization in terms of scale, reach,
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:30.100]   just the products. Are they going to be a $10 trillion company in the next few years? I don't
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.860]   think so. I don't think that's going to be the world. So I don't know that there's another quick
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:38.740]   five to 10x in here over the next decade for a company like that. So for me, it's always been,
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:45.140]   I'm less interested in the kind of slow growth dividend stocks and more about where's the next
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:52.100]   10x, and placing a series of those bets, and knowing that a few of them will be flat to down,
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:57.460]   but some of them will be the 10, 20 plus Xers from there and make up for my losses.
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:02.020]   I mean, that's the way venture capital works. We know 80% of our investments are going to zero,
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:06.660]   but the ones that make it, some of them will be 100X, 500X, it'll just be,
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:12.340]   and that'll repay all of the ones that didn't work out. So it's having that conviction and
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:18.340]   not just betting on one horse, but knowing that some will not work out, and that's okay too.
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:22.260]   And knowing that helps you spread around the risk to multiple investments.
[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:27.700]   And is this your only investment or is this kind of, this is what you do with the risky stuff and
[00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:33.540]   there's safe stuff also? I would say that on the safe side, I'm sure you've mentioned your
[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:37.060]   involvement with Wealthfront. I was an angel investor in Wealthfront before you joined
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:43.300]   Wealthfront, which they were, Wealthfront's always been my set it and forget it. It is the,
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:47.940]   I just want to sleep at night and I know I'm just going to get a nice, more or less predictable
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:54.660]   return over the longterm. And that for me is the boring stuff. That's the stuff where I'm hoping
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:59.940]   for 5%, 7% year over year. And I know some years will be down, but others will make up for it over
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:06.020]   the next few decades. And I'm fine with that. The riskier stuff for me is I would say all of my
[00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:12.180]   crypto and NFTs. And that's where I want to take on a lot of risk. I actually don't hold individual,
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:18.020]   I used to hold individual stocks like when I had Square or the Amazons or Teslas or others.
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:24.020]   I've gotten out of that game. I think that a lot of the growth that I've enjoyed over the last few
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:28.580]   years has been on the crypto side. And I'm much more interested in the future of crypto than I am
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:33.860]   the future of publicly traded companies. Yeah. You've got two podcasts there. So I think that's
[00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:38.980]   a great place to go. I've heard so much talk. Crypto, Web3, it's the future of everything.
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:44.020]   It's going to change our lives like the mobile phone did. How big do you think this is?
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:49.860]   I would say that I believe it's very early innings. I think it's first pitch, first inning
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:53.940]   here when it comes to this stuff. And even though Bitcoin's been around for a while,
[00:49:53.940 --> 00:50:01.140]   and so is Ethereum, we haven't hit mass adoption by any sense. And again, that whole thing about
[00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:05.860]   investing in the inevitable, if you were starting a country today, and you're going to go out there
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:10.900]   and you just close your eyes and you say, "Okay, I've got this little island. I'm ready to start
[00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:17.140]   my country." You're not going to go and buy printing presses. The future isn't printing
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:22.020]   more physical paper. We all know that. We're paying mostly with Apple Pay and Android Pay
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:26.500]   now when we go to stores and things of that nature. So of course, a digital currency makes
[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:32.660]   a ton of sense. Does it make sense for a currency to be global? Does it make sense for a currency to
[00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:38.420]   be able to send something to someone halfway around the world in a few seconds? For it not
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:43.300]   to be controlled by a government, but to be completely decentralized, so it's not tied
[00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:48.420]   to any one country. I would say yes to all those things. And that's what gets me so excited about
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:54.500]   cryptocurrency. And that's just on the currency side, the "currency" side. The other use cases
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:59.380]   for cryptocurrency, whether it be decentralized finance, where you say, "Hey, guess what? Look
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:05.140]   how much money Wells Fargo makes per year and adds to their balance sheet." It's just insanity.
[00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:12.260]   And the bloat there, the number of employees that they have. What about a world where rather than
[00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:17.860]   all of the heads that you need to pay to push papers at Wells Fargo, most of that is written
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:22.500]   into smart contracts. That's actually code that lives on the blockchain. And the efficiency that
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:28.500]   comes from that type of operation produces better yields. And that, to me, is really interesting
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:33.380]   work. And I'm taking advantage of that today. That's why I go out and I take my stable coins,
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:39.380]   which are my dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, and I go out and I earn 8% or more interest on these
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:44.580]   coins at a handful of different places. And I just sit back, and every month, you just get that
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:50.580]   payment of that 8%. And it's a beautiful thing. Show me one bank that'll even get you 2% right
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:58.900]   now. It just doesn't even exist. So I love this idea that we're using the efficiency of technology
[00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:05.700]   to cut out the bloated old institutions and make this about giving and transferring the wealth
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:11.780]   back to the average consumer. That's really exciting. So I am quite comfortable right now,
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:16.660]   which is actually true almost every day. And that's thanks to Viore. And I'm excited to be
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:21.860]   partnering with them for this episode. They make performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:26.420]   Everything is designed to work out in, but it doesn't look or feel like it at all. And it's
[00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:31.140]   so freaking comfortable, you will want to wear it all the time. Seriously, I am pretty sure it's
[00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:35.220]   more comfortable than whatever you're wearing right now, unless you're wearing Viore, in which
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:40.580]   case you already know what I mean. And it's not just for men. My wife is as obsessed with Viore
[00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:45.780]   as I am. My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers. I think I have three pairs, and they
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:50.420]   are probably the most comfortable pants I've ever owned. Their products can be used for just about
[00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:55.460]   any activity, whether it's running, training, or yoga. They're also great for lounging, running
[00:52:55.460 --> 00:53:00.980]   around town, or their MetaPants can even work for a night out. Honestly, I think Viore is an
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:05.620]   investment in your happiness. And for all the Hacks listeners, they are offering 20% off your

[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:35.140]   on the planet. There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:40.340]   good for you, and nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea. It has so many health benefits,
[00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:45.620]   and I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:52.100]   Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from 250-year-old
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:58.660]   tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins. Then everything is triple toxin screened
[00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:04.660]   for pesticides, heavy minerals, and toxic mold commonly found in plants. And Peak's products are
[00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:10.420]   so easy and zero prep, because they're all in pre-measured quantities that dissolve in cold or
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:16.420]   hot water in seconds, and are so travel friendly. They have so many products, but lately I've been
[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:21.700]   alternating between the green Pu-Erh for mental clarity and energy, and the black Pu-Erh, which
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:27.620]   helps kickstart digestion and metabolism, with a rich earthy flavor that is so good, and probably
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:32.260]   one of my favorite things to drink. And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing
[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:37.220]   research-backed benefits of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more,
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:42.660]   and then be happy that Pu-Erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the world.
[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:47.460]   But you don't even have to take my word, or do any research, because Peak offers free US shipping,
[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:53.060]   free returns, and a money-backed guarantee. And for a limited time, you can get up to 15%
[00:54:53.060 --> 00:55:01.940]   off and a free quiver with 12 tea samples at my link at allthehacks.com/peak, that's P-I-Q-U-E,

[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:31.380]   who support us. Yeah, so you bring up a good point that it happens to be one of the most asked
[00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:36.420]   questions I've gotten recently from listeners, which is 8%, you're right, no bank's giving you
[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:41.460]   2%, most banks are giving you 0.0 something percent. It sounds too good to be true. I know
[00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:48.020]   you've dug into a lot of this. Is it too good to be true? I also keep a lot of my cash at BlockFi,
[00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:53.940]   I just talked about it in my newsletter. I believe that it isn't too good to be true and that I feel
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:58.980]   comfortable, but I know you've dug into this a lot more. What's your take on the risk associated
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:05.060]   with some of these high yield stablecoin crypto earning platforms? Yeah, I mean, let me just tell
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:12.820]   you the case for me, I was scared. Whenever you hear something is too good to be true, it oftentimes
[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:20.100]   is. When I was doing my research and I heard that you could go to BlockFi or Gemini, those are the
[00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:25.220]   two, I would say, big centralized exchanges that offer pretty high yield. I thought to myself,
[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:29.780]   "Crap, what happens if one of these defaults or I lose all my money?" It's a scary thing.
[00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:38.180]   What I did actually is I had the head of risk on over at Gemini, and then also the CEO of BlockFi
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:42.420]   come on my podcast, and I asked him these questions. Because honestly, it was personally,
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:46.660]   it was like, "I want to have my modern finance," which is that podcast. I said, "Tell me,
[00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:51.860]   what are you doing with my money? When I give you some serious dollars here to go off and deploy
[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:57.860]   them and earn me this interest, where is that going?" Both of them are more or less the same.
[00:56:57.860 --> 00:57:02.100]   What they do behind the scenes is they go and obviously, they lend it back out.
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:06.500]   There are hedge funds, there are traditional banks, there are a whole slew of just different
[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:12.180]   institutions that need access to these types of cryptocurrency coins for sometimes very short
[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:20.420]   duration, sometimes longer duration. They take out these loans. What these BlockFi and Gemini do is
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:26.260]   they go and they do an analysis, a pretty deep dive into their books, their cash flows, their
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:32.660]   investors, and they make sure that whoever they're lending out to has a credible book of business and
[00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:39.060]   is doing something where they believe they're going to get this money back. A couple different
[00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:45.140]   things. One, they set aside, I believe it was, and you'll have to go listen to the episode, but I
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:50.340]   think it was Gemini, they have a slush fund that they set aside in case there ever is a default.
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:56.660]   Then they also do these types of investments across dozens or hundreds of different companies.
[00:57:56.660 --> 00:58:02.980]   It's not like if one failed, you would lose your money. It's almost like an old-school
[00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:07.140]   computer rate array where you have so much fault tolerance because there's so many individuals
[00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:16.740]   underneath the hood. In hearing how both of them really go deep on, they have whole teams of people
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:22.340]   that dive in and look at the accreditation of each of the people they're lending out to,
[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:27.780]   to ensure that some of them are backed by real physical assets, to ensure that even if there
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:34.420]   was a default, their money back. It made me a lot more comfortable. Once I was able to wrap my head
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:38.660]   around that risk, and granted, obviously, there is risk here, there always is, because these aren't
[00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:44.100]   FDIC-insured investments. I was like, "Okay, I'm willing to take on that risk." That's when I
[00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:49.380]   decided to actually use both. I use both BlockFi and Gemini. You say why one versus the other.
[00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:53.540]   They're both around the same interest. At one point, Gemini was offering higher interest,
[00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:58.820]   and then BlockFi recently leaped them and now offers higher interest on stablecoins.
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:05.300]   But I'd rather spread my risk out, and they're both really credible exchanges. I decided to
[00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:10.340]   spread it across two of the big platforms. Yeah, that's awesome. Definitely, I'll link
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:15.220]   to the show notes. That episode, I listened to it. It got me comfortable using this as a place
[00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:20.580]   to store cash. Thank you for doing that. Crypto, there's so much more than just investing in
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:25.300]   stablecoins and earning a yield. How do you think about, if someone's listening and thinking about,
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:30.500]   "I believe in this future," how do you invest in that future? There's so many things going on.
[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:35.700]   There's not a wealth front or an index fund to just say, "Hold all the things happening in
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:43.140]   crypto, DeFi, NFTs, et cetera." Yeah, it is tricky because, in some sense, if you're not
[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:50.900]   doing this as your full-time job, there's just so many new coins coming out, and they're all
[00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:58.980]   trying to tackle a different problem. Whenever you see a new coin, the value proposition that
[00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:02.020]   they're trying to get out there is, "We are solving something that either consumers or
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:07.140]   enterprises need, and this is why we're useful, and this is why you should invest."
[01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:17.460]   Now, finally, there are a handful of these funds that are created as smart contracts that are
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:24.740]   bundling these coins together that you can buy and hold. One of the ones that's actually been
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:29.540]   out for a while, I have not personally used this one because I buy each individual coin myself
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:34.980]   because it is my full-time job to go and invest in these companies as a venture capitalist,
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:40.980]   but one that I've seen used a lot is something called TokenSets. It's tokensets.com,
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:46.340]   and if you go on there and you click on "Explore Sets," you'll see that they have these different
[01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:52.020]   indexes. You can say to yourself, "What am I interested in this world of crypto?"
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:56.580]   If you're interested in the metaverse, then there's an index for that. What that does,
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:02.420]   I'll just click on the first one here. It's the metaverse index. If you take a look down at what
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:06.980]   they're holding here, you'll see they're holding Sandbox, which is a big up-and-coming metaverse,
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:12.820]   Axie Infinity, which is one of the biggest games in the metaverse, Decentraland, the Wax Economy
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:18.820]   token, Guild Games, a few others here. They're holding around 20 or so different tokens at
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:26.420]   different weights, meaning they're holding some more than others. Then that could be an actual
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:33.540]   token that you buy, and then they go and they rebalance. You have to buy one token then versus
[01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:38.660]   having to figure out, "Oh, do I go buy these 11? Who are the 11 that I need to buy if I want to
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:45.060]   buy the metaverse?" It's very much how old-school mutual funds worked. You'd buy something based on
[01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:50.020]   an investment thesis and then go from there. I believe in the future of the metaverse. I think
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:56.180]   it's early. I also am a fan of decentralized finance. I think that's a fantastic use case
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:02:05.860]   for crypto. The DeFi Pulse Index, it's on set tokens. DeFi Pulse is probably one of the biggest
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:11.140]   sites out there that tracks decentralized finance. When we're talking about banks going away and
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:18.100]   tools around creating yield for individuals, in this particular set, if you were to buy this set,
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:23.780]   it holds Uniswap and Aave and Maker and Compound and Synthetix and Sushi and Yearn. These are all
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:33.460]   really popular plays in decentralized finance. The one thing I would say is I would recommend,
[01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:38.100]   and this is an investment advice because I can't give investment advice, but I'll tell you what I
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:43.300]   personally do. Then you could talk to your own folks on the investing side. What I personally
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:48.420]   do is I do not go and buy the top 10 coins weighted by market cap because I think there's a
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:58.500]   lot of garbage in there. When you buy the Fortune 500, you know that you're buying companies based
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:04.660]   on their success, based on cash flow and a whole slew of other economic indicators that you can
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:11.940]   track and peg to success. When you're looking at the top 20 currencies, there's meme coins in there.
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:18.260]   There's ones that are centralized exchanges. Shibu Inu is in there. There's a bunch of stuff
[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:23.300]   that... I'm not discounting meme coins because I think they're always going to have a place in
[01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:27.140]   this kind of economy because it's more about community in that point, but there's things
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:31.380]   in there that I look at. I don't want to badmouth any of the coins, but I look at it and I say,
[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:36.020]   "Gosh, that project is really stalled," or "It's really not going anywhere," or "It's not the
[01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:42.420]   future of cryptocurrency." So I wouldn't say just go buy the top 10 or top 20. It's better to find
[01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:45.380]   someone that you trust that's putting together an index of their favorite things.
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:51.780]   TokenSets is probably a fun place to kick the tires. And don't feel like you have to go in and...
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:57.380]   One great thing about this is you can go and experiment with relatively low dollars. Go in
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:03.940]   with $500 or $200 and just play and say, "Okay, what is this like if I were to invest in one of
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:08.980]   these tokens? How do I do it? How do I set up my wallet for the first time? What is MetaMask?"
[01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:17.860]   I'm a big fan of a try before you buy. And DeFi and Web3 and crypto should all be about
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:21.700]   taking a few hundred dollars and just going out and trying a bunch of different things and
[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:25.780]   learning. It's just an education. Even if you lose the money, it's worth the education value.
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:31.140]   Absolutely. Yeah. Two things I'll share. There's a company called Makara. They're actually an
[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:36.580]   investment advisor. So using them functions more like using a finance investing product.
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:41.540]   But they've put together a bunch of baskets like TokenSets. They have a universe one that's
[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:46.340]   not quite market cap weighted. But I did notice that they pulled out some of the meme coins. So
[01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:50.260]   they have their version and they have a few others. Something to check out. I haven't used it.
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:53.860]   I'm not an investor. Just something I've seen as I've explored the space.
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:59.460]   The other thing I noticed was that if you look at the charts of all the tokens on any given day,
[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:04.980]   we're still in a world where crypto is pretty correlated. So I would say if you're trying to
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:10.100]   decide which of the few tokens to have, when Bitcoin's down, a lot of other things are down.
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:13.220]   When Ethereum's up, a lot of other things are up. But you're probably not going to get the
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:19.620]   massive gains of picking an early token early on. But I will flag that there is still a lot
[01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:24.660]   of correlation in the crypto token investing space. So I don't know if you've seen that
[01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:28.020]   or share that belief, but I've noticed that the market moves together
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:33.860]   quite a bit more than it moves apart. Yeah. Certainly when there's big sell-offs,
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:38.500]   we see that impacts all coins and they all tend to dump at the same time.
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:43.140]   The other thing that I think is a really important piece of advice for people that are dabbling in
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:51.860]   crypto is the way I've seen the most damage be done to friends and family is when they put enough
[01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:57.540]   money in there that when something drops by 20, 30, 40 percent, they freak out and they sell.
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:01.620]   And they're like, "I'm out." And that means that you had too much money at risk. Because
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:06.340]   this is a world, when I mentioned earlier first pitch, first inning,
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:13.300]   it is so early on that to see a swing of 20, 30 percent in just a few days on your favorite coin,
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:18.100]   I don't care if it's Bitcoin or Ethereum, some of the bigger ones, it'll still happen. It's not
[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:23.460]   uncommon. And so that freaks a lot of people out, especially when it's a lot of their net worth
[01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:32.100]   that's in here. But the reason why that is awesome is because it's just a actual representation of
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:37.460]   risk showing itself. And we like risk. We like risk because that means there's reward on the
[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:43.620]   other side of that risk. And so if you can swallow that and get comfortable about it,
[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:47.940]   and even sometimes double down when you have enough conviction on something when it is down,
[01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:55.140]   then that is where I have made the majority of my money. I'll see something that I believe in,
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:07:00.580]   Ethereum drops 20, 30 percent. And I'm like, "Well, of course, I believe that this is the
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:06.340]   future for X, Y, and Z use case." And just putting in another buy, another smaller buy
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:12.660]   when it's down, that's definitely my game. That's how I play it. And always with this crazy world,
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:16.740]   it's oftentimes, this is what I tell my sister, I'm like, "Just uninstall the app. Invest in
[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:21.540]   Coinbase and just don't look at it for the next few years. Go in there, buy the two or three
[01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:25.940]   coins that you have a lot of conviction in and try not to check the prices every day." Drive you
[01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:31.460]   crazy. Yeah, this advice applies across all investing, right? The biggest reason consumers
[01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:35.780]   often lose money investing is because the market's crashing and they sell everything. And then the
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:39.620]   market's on the rise and they buy more. Totally agree. The one thing we didn't get to, I mean,
[01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:45.380]   you got a whole podcast on NFTs. It's something that I am not very involved in, but very curious
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:50.580]   how you think people can get started thinking about it. I love the concept and I feel like
[01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:54.580]   I don't know where to go. So I guess before we get started, for people that don't know what an
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:08:01.220]   NFT is, it's a non-fungible token. And actually my first episode on proof is one to listen to the
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:06.580]   very first episode because we go deep into a primer on what NFTs are. And it essentially is
[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:14.740]   a way to say that I own something on the internet that is uniquely mine. So in the case of art,
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:20.580]   it can be an artwork that is pressed into the blockchain. And I can prove on the blockchain
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:25.620]   and looking up my address on the blockchain that I am the only holder of that piece of artwork.
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:30.020]   And then if I send it to you, Chris, you would see in the records on the blockchain that can't
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:35.380]   be destroyed, that can't be altered, that it was transferred to you. So I guess an NFT,
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:41.860]   the best way to think of it is something that you buy or is given to you and then you hold it and
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:46.820]   you can send it around to people. You can lock it up and divide it into something called a
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:51.780]   fractional NFT. So if people want to sell bits of their NFT, say there's a really expensive piece
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:56.580]   of artwork that is a couple of million dollars, but you can't really afford it. Then people are
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:59.860]   taking things and they're locking them up and they're fractionalizing them into even smaller
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:04.980]   components and then selling those off. So it's a really crazy world because there's so many things
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:08.980]   that you can do with them. People think of NFTs, they hear about the Beeple sale where he sold it
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:13.940]   for 60 some million dollars for a single JPEG that's on the blockchain. But they represent so
[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:19.780]   many different things. One, they're a way for artists to get properly compensated over time.
[01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:26.500]   So an artist released a work of art, they sell it online. And if it's resold, they take part in the
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:31.700]   economics of that NFT being resold over time. So they get their 5%, 10%, 15%, whatever it may be,
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:35.700]   that's baked into the actual code. So as something is being resold, they're being
[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:39.620]   compensated. So we're seeing this kind of renaissance happen where artists are blowing
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:43.060]   up, their artworks are getting resold, they're making a ton of money as they're being resold,
[01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:47.380]   they're backing other artists, those artists are blowing up. And it's just like that whole
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:54.100]   flywheel just continues to operate. And I think there's just going to be, again,
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:10:00.340]   thinking about the inevitable, the next decade or so, or even the next couple of years, as these
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:04.980]   beautiful digital frames, I've seen a bunch of prototypes are being worked on, where you'll be
[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:09.460]   able to walk into someone's house and see what looks like a picture on the wall, you'll walk up
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:13.300]   to it, and it's a CryptoPunk, and you're like, "Oh, that's cool." And they're like, "Yeah,
[01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:17.220]   it's not actually a painting, that's an NFT, and that's a work of art, and I own that."
[01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:26.500]   It's going to become what seems awkward and seems odd, oftentimes becomes normal, and just
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:32.260]   something that is in a decade later, you're like, "Oh, of course that was the way it was always
[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:38.340]   going to be." Because it just feels right. You need time. Time is this great tool that
[01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:44.900]   removes the awkwardness of things. It used to be so strange to even think about sending someone
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:49.140]   cryptocurrency, but now when you do it on a daily basis, or you're in this world, you just get
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:54.180]   really comfortable doing it, and you're like, "How was I ever operating any other way?" And
[01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:59.380]   that's what's going to happen to art as well. It'll be a thing where when you walk into a bar,
[01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:02.740]   you'll see a beautiful artwork on the wall, and you'll walk up to it, and it's like, "That's
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:06.660]   really cool." And you'll be able to pull out your phone and actually take it off the wall
[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:11.860]   and transfer it to your phone, or rent it back to the bar and leave it up on the wall,
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:15.140]   or take it home and put it on your wall with just a few taps.
[01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:16.340]   Or buy a piece of it.
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:22.500]   Right, or buy a piece of it. It's fractionalized, right? Speaking of early days, this is a very
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:27.540]   exciting new world, and it's part of the reason why I created a dedicated podcast called Proof
[01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:31.700]   That's Just For This, because it applies to so many other things. It applies to utility
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:36.740]   NFTs, and what I mean by that is I had Mike Shinoda, one of the co-founders of Linkin Park,
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:40.180]   on the show the other day, and he just did a fantastic new drop called Ziggurats,
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:46.820]   which is a combination of this profile photos project combined with this generative music,
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:53.540]   which is just a really, really cool project. And Mike was just talking on the show about what he
[01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:58.980]   is doing in this world and the obvious stuff we talked about. He said in his mind, the obvious
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:05.860]   stuff is, "Oh, you attend five of my shows. You get NFTs at each show, and then the wallet tells
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:13.220]   you you have special access to a backstage meetup." It's going to be so cool to see how NFTs
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:20.500]   are used to unlock all of this additional things and functionality that you can do in real in-person
[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:26.020]   events. So there's so many different uses, and metaverses, too. NFTs are being used as wearables
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:30.980]   and skins and games and all those things that kids have been paying for a decade now. You'll
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:34.180]   be able to take them into other metaverses and other virtual worlds. It's just going to be so
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:39.540]   much fun. Yeah. So definitely check out the podcast. I know I've been listening. I have
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:44.180]   learned a lot. Talk a little bit about what you're doing. You're launching something on Saturday.
[01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:50.340]   Yeah. I've got a big announcement coming out for fans and people that are into NFTs.
[01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:56.180]   The name of the podcast is called Proof, P-R-O-O-F, and I'm launching something called
[01:12:56.180 --> 01:13:03.140]   the Proof Collective. The Proof Collective is essentially going to be an NFT that you collect.
[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:07.060]   It'll be the Proof Collective NFT, but it is one of these utility NFTs that I mentioned, where
[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:12.660]   when you hold it, it unlocks a ton of benefits. So you get access to a private members-only Discord,
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:17.540]   and there's only 1,000 people. I'm only doing 1,000 of these NFTs, and there'll be 1,000 people
[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:23.060]   that will be members that have access to this private Discord. Discord for people that don't
[01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:26.740]   know. It's a place where you can go and chat and hang out. But inside of there, we'll be talking
[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:31.700]   about all the latest new projects, new artists, upcoming drops. We'll have some tools for serious
[01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:36.340]   collectors. You'll also have early access to my podcast, so you get to hear them before anyone
[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:41.140]   else. And then I'm going to be doing a whole slew of different additional benefits and collaborations
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:45.460]   over the length of the utility. So when you own it, you get the benefits for three years. So
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:50.820]   there'll be some pretty wide-ranging benefits from simple stuff like local in-person meetups
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:54.900]   to some much wilder ideas and collaborations that we'll be revealing soon.
[01:13:54.900 --> 01:14:00.180]   So I would just say, yeah, I mean, to plug my own stuff, at a minimum, check out the podcast.
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:05.220]   It's just proof.xyz. If you're already into NFTs or you really want to get serious about collecting,
[01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:10.020]   you might want to consider joining the Proof Collective. And you can learn more. The sale
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:18.260]   of that NFT goes on sale at 12/11 on the 11th at 9 a.m. Pacific. And that's proofnft.xyz. It has
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:22.980]   that video explainer giving a lot more information and details there. And yeah, you can always
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:26.580]   collect one of those at launch or buy one in the secondary after they go live. And we'll see you
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:31.620]   in the private Discord. And it'll be a great place to learn a lot, make some new friends, and also do
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:36.580]   some fun stuff together over the years. And you've always been ahead of the curve on all this stuff.
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:40.820]   So this is something I'm excited about. Anywhere else people should check you out online? I know
[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:46.100]   we've covered a lot. Yeah, we'll have to go back and do a round two of this at some point and go
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:49.940]   even deeper. But if you're wanting to check out the Modern Finance podcast,
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:56.420]   you can check that out at modern.finance. And also, all my stuff is linked up over on my Twitter,
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:15:01.780]   which is just @KevinRose on Twitter. And yeah, thanks for having me on. This was a lot of fun.
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:07.380]   Yeah, thanks for joining. Wow, there was so much great stuff in this episode. So definitely check
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:11.540]   out the show notes for links to everything we talked about. We definitely ran out of time,
[01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:16.820]   so we'll have to do another episode like this sometime in 2022. Also, I've gotten so much good
[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:20.740]   feedback from you all on the newsletter I've been sending out. So if you're not subscribed,
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:27.140]   please do that at allthehacks.com/email. And finally, I love hearing from you all. So please
[01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:33.700]   send feedback, questions, ideas for shows, or even just reach out to say hi. I'm Chris
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:39.940]   at allthehacks.com, or you can find me on Twitter. I'm just @hutchins. That's it for this week. See
[01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:56.980]   you next week. I want to tell you about another podcast I love that
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:01.620]   goes deep on all things money. That means everything from money hacks to wealth building
[01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:06.500]   to early retirement. It's called The Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:10.980]   building generational wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is about
[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:16.420]   clipping coupons to save a dollar. It's hosted by my good friend Andrew, who truly believes that
[01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:21.460]   everyone in this world can build wealth, and his passion and excitement are what make this show so
[01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:27.780]   entertaining. I know because I was a guest on the show in December 2022, but recently I listened to
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:33.460]   an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind, and it was so crazy to learn
[01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:38.980]   things like 35% of millennials are not participating in their employer's retirement plan. And that's
[01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:44.420]   just one of the many fascinating stats he shared. The Personal Finance Podcast has something for
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:48.740]   everyone. It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with
[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:53.300]   your money and grow your wealth. So I highly recommend you check it out. Just search for
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:58.580]   The Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen to podcasts and
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:16:59.220]   enjoy.
