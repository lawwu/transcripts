[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   We're back with Randy Alcorn, an expert on what the Bible says about heaven.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.760]   Randy, thanks for joining us.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.200]   So here's a question near to my heart.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.580]   Will there be baseball in heaven?
[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.680]   In other words, we know that there will be play in heaven.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.980]   Isaiah 11, 8 and Zechariah 8, 5 seem to indicate this in scripture.
[00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.040]   But will competitive sports carry over from this world?
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.200]   Things like baseball and basketball and golf.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.040]   We know we're speculating on this, but I believe there's every reason to expect there would
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.040]   be.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.040]   There's continuity.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.720]   If we go back and we say, what will not, instead of asking the question, what will there be
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:54.680]   on the new earth that will be the same as on the old earth, we should kind of turn it
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.680]   around.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.200]   What would we expect to be different?
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.360]   Well, we know there won't be sin.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.280]   The new earth in which righteousness dwells, 2 Peter 3, 13.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.920]   I mean, we know that for sure.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.920]   So there won't be sin.
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.200]   So I actually had a pastor tell me, who was disagreeing with my comment that I would expect
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.960]   there to be sports on the new earth.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.960]   Now when we say sports in heaven, you know, there's the present heaven and the non, the
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.440]   pre-resurrection heaven.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.440]   So I'm not, not even talking about that.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.480]   I'm talking about the eternal heavens after the resurrection that will actually be centered
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.360]   on the new earth and new heavens, new earth, a physical realm.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.000]   And he said, well, yeah, but there couldn't be sports because sports bring out the worst
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.520]   in us.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.680]   Sports make us sin.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.400]   I said, well, first of all, sports don't make us sin, but certainly I know what you're talking
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.400]   about.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.520]   I coached high school tennis for many years and I have seen guys at their worst, but also
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.760]   I have seen them at their best in sports.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:02.200]   And he also said, well, yeah, but we can't have anybody lose ever in a game in heaven.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.240]   I'm thinking, well, why not?
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.440]   Why could we never lose?
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.920]   It's okay to lose.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.760]   It's okay to have a competition and not have it all be about you.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.720]   And I even use the illustration of when I play tennis with my guys that I'm coaching,
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.160]   I would want them to develop to the point where they were finally able to beat me.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.680]   And I celebrated with them, trying as hard as I could to win, but celebrated with them
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.880]   when they did beat me.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.240]   And this is, I think, is an example of even in this life, we can have vested interests
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.440]   in someone else's success, but certainly on the new earth, sin won't be there.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.720]   As Paul Helm says, we will not sin.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.080]   We won't want to sin.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.420]   We won't want to want to sin.
[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.560]   And so that just won't be part of our world.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.240]   So I would say, where did sports come from?
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.360]   Who gave us the ingenuity to even create them as human beings?
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.360]   Clearly it's from God.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.960]   We are made in his image.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.680]   Satan did not come up with the idea of sports.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.680]   Interesting.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.360]   So to lose does not mean one has sinned or been sinned against.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.360]   That's helpful.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.360]   Thank you for that, Randy.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.000]   I can't wait to see what my glorified fastball looks like.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.580]   But for more on this and so many other topics, see Randy's bestselling book simply titled

[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.700]   As in will we travel to see other cities and will we travel in space?
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.700]   We'll ask Randy that tomorrow.
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.700]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.940]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.

[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.440]   1.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.440]   What is heaven?
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.440]   It's a place where you can find answers.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.440]   It's a place where you can find answers.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.440]   It's a place where you can find answers.
