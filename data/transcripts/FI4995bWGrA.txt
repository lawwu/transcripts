[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   We come once more to a consideration of verses 12 and 13 in the eighth chapter of Paul's
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.920]   epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.560]   Verses 12 and 13 in the eighth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:26.160]   Therefore, brethren, we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh, for if
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:35.400]   ye live after the flesh ye shall die; but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.280]   of the body, ye shall live.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.400]   Now I want to read those verses again.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:49.000]   Therefore, brethren, we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh, for if
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.320]   ye live after the flesh ye shall die; but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.200]   of the body, ye shall live.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.480]   I say that we come back again to a consideration of these two verses because we began our consideration
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.800]   of them last Friday evening.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:21.680]   And there I was reminding those who were present, a number of you were not present, I gather,
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.840]   due to the circumstances, but you were faint-hearted, there was no traffic problem around this church
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.520]   at all.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:38.560]   However, for your sakes, I would remind you that I was indicating that this statement
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.880]   which is contained in these two verses is in many ways the crucial statement with regard
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.880]   to the whole of the New Testament doctrine of sanctification.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.760]   And therefore, we must look at the statement contained in the two verses very carefully.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.960]   It can indeed be quite safely said that these are the crucial verses with regard to this
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.040]   whole problem around which there is, and has been now for a number of years, a good deal
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.320]   of controversy.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.520]   So I took the statement in this way.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:29.080]   I reminded you of the two commonest and most popular theories with regard to sanctification.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.720]   The first is the theory, if you like, of perfection.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.640]   It's a theory which teaches that as a result of a second experience, a Christian may have
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.960]   sin taken entirely out of him.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.440]   Eradication, it calls itself.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.800]   By the baptism of the Spirit, they teach, sin is entirely eradicated out of a man's
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   nature.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.040]   The roots even are taken out.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.000]   There's nothing left.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.560]   He is made perfect.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.680]   They call it perfect love, entire sanctification.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.000]   They've got many terms for it.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.360]   That's one theory.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.960]   The other theory, the second one, and the more popular of the two, is a theory which
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.200]   teaches what it calls counteraction.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.000]   In other words, it says that sin is not eradicated.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.960]   It is still left in us.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:30.200]   But, we can live the victorious life on condition that we don't attempt to do so ourselves,
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.520]   but that realizing our own complete helplessness, we hand it all over to the risen Lord.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.480]   I read a number of statements, quotations, last week which expound that second view.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.960]   And there I've repeated what is the essential part of the teaching.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.920]   They say there are so many Christians who are living a defeated life, but they needn't
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.120]   go on like that if they but realize the teaching.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.120]   Well, what is the teaching?
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:05.480]   Well, it is this, that it is possible for one to be delivered from this power of sin.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.120]   And it happens, they say, not gradually, but in a sudden crisis.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:17.340]   It starts with a crisis, and then it leads on to a condition in which one goes on being
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.120]   maintained in this victorious position.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:28.080]   Here is a quotation again, "The crisis comes in the moment that a Christian gives up the
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:37.160]   struggle and comes out into the open and confesses that he is absolutely hopeless and hands it
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.160]   all over to the risen Lord."
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.080]   Now, that's the teaching.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.680]   And it's very fond of putting itself like this.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.320]   It says it is possible for a Christian to pass over and out of Romans 4 to 7 into the
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.320]   liberty of Romans 8.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.160]   Now, you're familiar with their teaching.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.360]   They say up until the end of Romans 7 you've got the picture of a defeated Christian.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.200]   But in Romans 8, here is the liberated, victorious Christian.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:13.360]   And the secret of his liberation and his success and his triumph is that he has come to realize
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.080]   that he must confess his failure to God, he must come out into the open, confess that
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:26.520]   he is absolutely hopeless, and he must hand it all over to the risen Lord.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.280]   He's got to give up this struggle.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.720]   His trouble has been that he's been trying to do it himself.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.920]   But the moment he realizes that and stops trying to do it himself and hands it all over
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:45.240]   to the risen Lord, he will be maintained by the Lord in a position of victory.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.040]   Now then, there are the two popular theories.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.880]   And we are looking now at what the apostle tells us in these two verses in the light
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.440]   of that background.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.320]   Well, what we found was this.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:07.840]   Here the apostle puts before us an argument.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.720]   It is a statement which is introduced by the word "therefore," and that links it with
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.720]   what's been going before.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:21.080]   He says, "In the light of what I've just been saying, brethren, you are not debtors to the
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.680]   flesh to live after the flesh," and so on.
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:30.600]   Very well, what we find here is not that the apostle is telling us about some experience
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.120]   which we can have, some crisis through which we can pass.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.160]   No, he is appealing to us.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.240]   He's asking us to be logical.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:45.240]   He is addressing an argument to our reason and to our understanding.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.480]   Not only that, he is calling upon us to do something.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:57.160]   He says, "But if you, through the Spirit, mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live."
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.680]   He's calling upon us to do something.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.240]   We've got to mortify the deeds of the body.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.400]   And thirdly, we saw that he's calling upon us to go on doing that.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.080]   He uses the present tense.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.840]   You could translate it like this, "But if you, through the Spirit, do go on and keep
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.720]   on mortifying the deeds of the body, you shall live."
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.360]   Not a critical action, but something that you have to keep on doing and go on doing.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.880]   Present, active, continuous.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.880]   Very well.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.880]   Let us now then follow what he says in putting it like that.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.880]   Let's work it out.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:42.280]   "Therefore," he says, "in other words, the way to live this Christian life," says the
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:48.560]   apostle, "is first and foremost to realize what is true of us as Christians."
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:55.760]   He's been reminding us of that from the second half of verse 4 right until the end of verse
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.760]   11.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.840]   He's given us nothing but an extended description of the Christian over and against the men
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:01.840]   who is not a Christian.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.720]   And then says Paul, "Realize that that's the truth about you.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.520]   Therefore, it's a deduction.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.600]   Realize what is true about you and then live accordingly."
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.360]   That's his way of putting it.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.560]   In other words, he draws this deduction.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.040]   And I ended by putting it like this.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.560]   He uses this word "debtor."
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:28.640]   "Therefore, brethren," he says, "we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh."
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:34.400]   He says we are under no obligation to go on living after the flesh.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.960]   For the flesh only got us into trouble.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.440]   The flesh got us into condemnation.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.040]   The flesh got us into misery.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:46.200]   We are under no obligation whatsoever to live after the flesh.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.880]   Well, to whom are we under any obligation?
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.920]   Well, we are under obligation to God and to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.760]   We are under obligation to grace.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.720]   So I ended by quoting well-known hymns.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.760]   "A debtor to mercy alone."
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.760]   Not a debtor to the flesh.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:06.560]   "I'm a debtor to mercy alone, and of covenant mercy I sing.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:15.440]   Oh, to grace," says another, "Oh, to grace, how great a debtor daily I'm constrained to
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.440]   be."
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.440]   That's where my debt is.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.480]   We are not debtors to the flesh.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.080]   We are debtors to mercy.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.000]   We are debtors to grace.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.920]   That's where the realm of our obligation lies.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:31.440]   Now then, I want to work that out now in detail.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.040]   You notice first that he's got a negative argument.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.160]   In the light, he says, of this which is so true of us.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.300]   We, he says, we are not debtors to the flesh.
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.720]   We mustn't live after the flesh.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.520]   The thing he says is ridiculous.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.640]   It's illogical.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.640]   It's inconsistent.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:10:03.680]   Now, I want to emphasize this, because that is how the New Testament always teaches sanctification.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.200]   It doesn't offer me an experience, but it does reason with me.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:13.120]   And it says, look here, for you to go on living after the flesh is just being utterly illogical.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.240]   You're being inconsistent with yourself.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.840]   You're contradicting yourself.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.000]   It reasons with me.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.440]   It doesn't say now realize you can do nothing, hand it all over to the risen Lord.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.440]   No, no.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.440]   It's a reasoned argument.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:29.480]   It says, don't be a fool if you're rejoicing in the fact that you're a Christian, or why
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.960]   do you go on living as if you were still not a Christian?
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.280]   It ridicules the thing.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.920]   Now, I'm going to give you an extended number of quotations before we finish tonight, God
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:43.240]   willing, in order to establish this most important point.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.360]   In the light especially of these other teachings, which would have us believe that we can do
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.720]   nothing and are not even asked to do anything, except to hand it all over, or that it's done
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.800]   for us in some experience.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:00.440]   Here is an argument to reason, to logic, and to understanding.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:05.840]   The negative ridicules a Christian who goes on living in the flesh.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.880]   Well, why is it ridiculous to do that?
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:13.240]   Well, here are some of the reasons that he's already been giving us.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.280]   "Therefore, brethren," what's he been saying?
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.920]   Well, here's one thing.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.320]   We are no longer in the flesh.
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:27.800]   Well, if we are no longer in the flesh, why do we go on living in the flesh, or after
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.800]   the flesh?
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:36.160]   And, you see, he's told us that in verse 9, he says, "But ye are not in the flesh, but
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.160]   in the Spirit."
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:42.680]   Well, very well, if you are proud of the fact as a Christian that you are no longer where
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:48.400]   you used to be, living that life after the flesh, and outside the life of God, and outside
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.400]   the Spirit.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.840]   But that you are now in the Spirit, well, why in the name of conscience are you going
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.160]   on living as if you were still in the flesh?
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.480]   That's how Paul teaches sanctification.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.740]   You are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit.
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.760]   If so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.080]   Now, if any men have not the Spirit of Christ, well, he is none of his, he is not a Christian
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.080]   at all.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.260]   By definition, the Christian is a man who has been taken out of the realm of the flesh
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.000]   and has been put into the realm of the Spirit.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.640]   Very well.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.540]   If you are there, live accordingly.
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.760]   If you are proud of the fact that you are a citizen of a certain country, well, live
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.760]   as such a citizen.
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.080]   Don't live as if you belong to another country.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.840]   That's precisely what he's saying.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.280]   Right, that's the first reason.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.240]   Let us look at the second.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:43.320]   The second reason is that the flesh has no longer any right over us.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.600]   We are no longer controlled by the flesh.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.200]   There was a time when we were.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.640]   It isn't just a question that we are no longer in the flesh, we are no longer controlled
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.640]   by the flesh.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.640]   Now, if you go back to chapter 7, verse 5, you will find the apostle says this, "But
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:06.600]   when we were in the flesh, the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.120]   members to bring forth fruit unto death."
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:18.000]   Or if you went further back to the fifth chapter, verse 21, you will find, "That as sin hath
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:25.320]   reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.520]   Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:37.040]   And take one more, 614, chapter 614, "For sin shall not have dominion over you, for
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.640]   ye are not under the law, but under grace."
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:46.080]   Now those are all, as we've seen when we were studying those verses, they're tremendously
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.640]   important statements.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.440]   You see, the position is this.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.360]   We are under an entirely new jurisdiction.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:01.920]   Every man born into this world is born under the power of sin, under the power of flesh,
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.720]   and under the power of the law.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.720]   Every one of us is born like that.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:10.680]   Behold, I was born in sin, shapen in iniquity.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.000]   In sin did my mother conceive me.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.960]   We've never been free at all.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:20.880]   We are born the slaves of sin, every single one of us.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.920]   That's why a child, when the first time it exercises its will, invariably does something
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.400]   it's told not to do.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.040]   We are born sinners.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:33.960]   We are under the power and the jurisdiction and the dominion of sin, showing itself in
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.080]   the form of the flesh.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.960]   And the law aggravates all that.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.920]   But we've been moved out of that.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.000]   We are not under the law.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.840]   We are not under sin.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.840]   We are not in the flesh.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.840]   Where are we?
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.640]   Well, we are under grace.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.200]   We are in the reign of grace.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.160]   We've been moved, as the apostle puts it in writing to the Colossians, you remember
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:15:00.760]   he puts it like this, "who has translated us," he says, "we've been translated from
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:06.980]   the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son."
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.760]   So his argument here is this.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.240]   Why do you go on living after the flesh?
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.760]   Because you don't belong to that jurisdiction any longer.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.760]   You're not in that kingdom.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.760]   Can't you see, he says, that you're a fool?
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:24.560]   You're going on living as if you were still there under that old power.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.560]   But you're not.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.480]   It has no right over you.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.880]   You are in this other kingdom, this kingdom of grace.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.560]   Now that's where Paul puts sanctification.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.280]   Let me use an illustration.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:45.200]   It is said that when, after the American Civil War, slavery was abolished, there were many
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:52.640]   poor slaves in the southern states who didn't realize that they were now at liberty, at
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.640]   freedom.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:16:00.640]   You see, they'd lived for such a long time in the old way, as slaves and the master over
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.760]   them, and they were in fear and so on.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.600]   But now as a result of that war and the Declaration, slavery was abolished.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.600]   They were free men.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.480]   Yes, but if they didn't realize that, they still went on living as if they were still
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.480]   slaves.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:18.040]   And what you did to such people was not to ask them to try and work up some experience.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:26.960]   All you needed to do to them was to say, "Look here, by law, by enactment of Congress, there
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.360]   is no longer such a thing as slavery.
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.720]   You're a free man.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.720]   Behave as a free man.
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.320]   Don't go on living as a slave now that you're free."
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.920]   Well, now that's the same argument here exactly.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:44.400]   "Sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law, but under grace."
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:49.120]   You see, he's reasoning it with us, putting it to us to understand this, that we may put
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.120]   it into practice.
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.120]   That's the second.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.120]   The third argument.
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:57.040]   He's just been saying it in verse 11.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:06.360]   "Now," says the apostle, "I've just been telling you that this problem of sin in your life
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.560]   is now only a kind of remaining problem.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.240]   It's a kind of remnant.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:19.120]   There was a time when you were completely and entirely under sin, body, mind, and spirit.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.920]   That's no longer true," says Paul.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:27.840]   He says in verse 10, rather, "If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.960]   the spirit is life because of righteousness."
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:35.760]   Now he says, "Realize that this is your position.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.200]   You yourself have been set free.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.120]   You're as free now as you'll ever be.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.040]   You're in Christ.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.840]   You've died with Christ, you've risen with Christ, you're seated in the heavenly places
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.840]   with Christ Jesus.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.880]   All right, now, that's the position about you.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.840]   Yes, but sin is still left in your body, and it's only in the body, in your mortal body."
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.560]   "Now then," says the apostle, "don't live for that, therefore.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.560]   Don't live for the relic, for the remnant.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.920]   Don't live for the body, for the flesh.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.440]   Live to the spirit, which is life and which is free.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.320]   Don't be inconsistent with yourselves.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:17.680]   Realizing as you do," he says, "that this fight that remains in you against sin is only
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.960]   a temporary and a passing one while you're still in this world, well, don't live for
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:22.960]   that.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:28.840]   Live, rather, for the man you are in Christ Jesus, this man who is in the realm of the
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:29.840]   spirit."
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.680]   And then his fourth argument is this one.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:40.720]   He says, "You know, that living to the flesh means that you are reverting again to the
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.680]   realm of death."
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:48.480]   He says, "For if you live after the flesh, you shall die.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.440]   That life of the flesh always leads to death."
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:19:00.320]   Well, he says, "You mustn't do that because you don't belong any longer to the realm
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.760]   of death.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.040]   The spirit is life because of righteousness.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:11.360]   And not only that, you know that even your body, which still belongs to the realm of
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.760]   death, the body is dead because of sin."
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:19.520]   Yes, but he says, "I've just told you that even your body is going to be delivered if
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.880]   the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:31.600]   He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.600]   that dwelleth in you."
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.520]   The whole thing, he says, is only temporary.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.000]   Don't give in to the body, therefore.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.800]   It's only for a while, it's a mortal body, but even that's going to be delivered.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:47.720]   And the day is coming when the whole man, body, mind, and spirit, shall be entirely
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:54.840]   free from sin and perfectly glorified, even as the Lord himself.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:00.240]   And therefore I would suggest his last, his fifth argument is this.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:07.040]   To live after the flesh is to grieve the spirit who dwells in us.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.760]   You notice, you remember how he's gone on repeating that.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:15.760]   "You are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.160]   If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.160]   righteousness.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:28.000]   But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you," and he does,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.160]   "he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.840]   spirit that dwelleth in you."
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.560]   The spirit of God is in the Christian.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:44.840]   And he says, "If you go living that life after the flesh, you are grieving the spirit,
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.840]   for the spirit and the flesh are opposed to one another.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:53.400]   The spirit lusteth against the flesh and the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and these
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.000]   are opposed to one another.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.720]   They're great antagonists.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:03.440]   And therefore if you realize that the spirit of God is in you, you will realize at once
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:10.920]   that to go on living after the flesh is to grieve this holy spirit of God that dwells
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:11.920]   in you."
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.400]   He says you can't do that.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.240]   The thing is ridiculous.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.240]   That's what he's arguing.
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:23.400]   "Therefore, brethren, therefore, in the light of all these things I've been saying to you,
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:31.080]   we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh, for if you live after the flesh,
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.080]   you shall die."
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.000]   He says the thing should be impossible to you.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Realize it.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Reason it through.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Be logical.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Work it out.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.520]   Be consistent with yourselves.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.720]   That's his method.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:50.000]   There's not a word here about waiting for some experience, or going in for an experience.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.200]   There's not a word here of handing it all over to the Risen Lord.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:58.240]   But it's all an argument addressed to my mind and to my reason, and he's telling me to do
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.240]   something.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.800]   So that brings me to the positive.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:05.040]   The positive is this.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:14.240]   That not only must we not live after the flesh in that way, for the reasons given, but positively,
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:21.400]   we must actively mortify the deeds of the body.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.440]   Now, I'm not going into that in detail this evening.
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:30.560]   I'm keeping that back because I'm anxious to establish this big general principle first.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.520]   I'm hoping to show you in detail what to mortify the body means.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:40.880]   It means to put the deeds of the body, it means to put it to death, to throttle it.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.720]   That's what he tells us to do.
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.200]   Mortify the deeds of the body.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:49.920]   I've got to do it through the Spirit, of course, but I've got to do it, if you, through the
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.280]   Spirit, to mortify the deeds of the body.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.240]   Now, why does he tell me to do this?
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:59.080]   Well, it's the same argument that Therafore still obtains.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:03.600]   He says you are to do this because of what is already true of you.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.320]   It's the only consistent thing for you to do.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.320]   How?
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.000]   Well, put it like this.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   What is a Christian?
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Well, the obvious, basic thing about a Christian is this.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.240]   He's a man who's come to a realization that he was a sinner.
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.720]   He may have thought that he was a good fellow, everything all right, living a good, clean,
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:31.160]   moral life, doing good, and there was no trouble at all.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:36.160]   But the first thing that happens to a man when he becomes a Christian is that he is
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.000]   convicted of sin.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.440]   He realizes that he's in a desperate condition, that all that he'd been relying on is of no
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.640]   value at all in the sight of God.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.400]   Now, we needn't go over all that.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:55.040]   The Apostle Paul has spent the first three chapters of this great epistle to prove that,
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:59.120]   that there is none righteous, no, not one, that all have sinned and come short of the
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.600]   glory of God.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:05.720]   Even this man, the Apostle Paul himself, he was a most religious man as a Pharisee, he
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:11.520]   was a most moral man, he was a most dutiful man, and yet he says that all my righteousness
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.160]   was but of dung and refuse, no good at all.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.080]   That's the first thing he came to realize.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:21.080]   Well, now, the Christian is a man who realizes that.
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:27.280]   He realizes the truth about himself, that he's a sinner in the sight of God.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:32.840]   Not only that, that his whole nature is twisted and perverted, that there's a principle of
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.200]   evil in him.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:40.240]   He comes to see what I've just been saying, that he was under the dominion of sin.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.320]   He didn't know it.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.480]   He was blinded by the God of this world.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.800]   He was the dupe of the devil, didn't believe in the devil.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.920]   That proved that the devil had duped himself perfectly.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.880]   He was innocent of all this, he didn't know anything about it, but now he realizes, his
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.880]   eyes have been opened.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.640]   He's been a slave of sin.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.320]   His whole nature is twisted and perverted.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:04.280]   That's why he held his own views about God, and said he didn't believe this and that about
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.240]   God, set up his own opinion.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:11.240]   He now realizes what a terrible thing all that is, the enormity of it all.
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:15.960]   He's profoundly convicted of his sin, and he realizes that he was in a terrible danger
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.520]   therefore.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:24.280]   The danger of hell, if he died like that, is outside the life of God.
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:28.680]   Nothing awaits him but hell.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.800]   The Christian is a man who believes that and realizes that you can't be a Christian without
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.200]   believing that.
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:38.000]   But then of course, he goes on to the positive thing.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.120]   He realizes what God has done for him in spite of death.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.120]   That's the gospel.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.560]   I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.560]   Why?
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:50.760]   It is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes it.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.800]   He is a man who believes what Paul has put before us at such great length again in the
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:26:01.040]   first three chapters, that God, though men had sinned against him, though the whole world
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:07.600]   had rebelled and deserved nothing but perdition, God in his infinite love and grace and mercy
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:15.160]   and compassion, not only sent his only Son into this world in the likeness of man, but
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.240]   even sent him to the cross.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:24.960]   Those great verses 25 and 26 in chapter 3, "He hath set him forth as a propitiation for
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.960]   our sins."
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:33.200]   God, in his love, this man believes as a Christian, has taken his sins and put them on his own
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.880]   Son and punished him.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.520]   That's the message.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:43.560]   He believes that, that God in his great love has done that for him.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:50.480]   That because he has punished his sins in Christ on the cross, that he, the believer, is freely
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:55.840]   forgiven, not only that, he is born again, he is given a new life and a new nature.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:01.000]   He becomes a child of God, he is adopted into God's family, he has been transferred into
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.920]   this new kingdom, he is in this new realm of grace, he was in Adam, he is now in Christ.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.360]   He knows all this, he believes all this.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:15.320]   And he believes that when he dies he is going on to be with God and with Christ.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:20.880]   And he has got proof of that because God has put his Spirit, his own Spirit within him,
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.920]   the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:31.320]   And he realizes that the Spirit has been given in order that we may be made ready for our
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:37.060]   eternal home in the presence of God, when the body and everything else shall be entirely
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:43.080]   purged and delivered of sin, and we shall be holy and blameless, absolutely righteous
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.680]   and glorified in the presence of God.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.480]   That is what a Christian believes.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:51.880]   "Well, very well," says Paul.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:59.200]   If you believe that, and that's what you say you believe as a Christian, how can you possibly
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.680]   go on living after the flesh?
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:06.440]   It was living after the flesh that brought you into this terrible state.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:11.320]   It was because Adam fell and became a man in the flesh and passed it on to all his progeny
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.740]   that you have been what you have been.
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.000]   Are you to go on living like that?
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.680]   You say you rejoice in Christ, you rejoice in your salvation.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.160]   You say, "The love of God was marvelous that he sent his Son to deliver me," and yet you
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:30.000]   deliberately go on living the old life which made all that necessary.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.840]   You say, "The cross is a terrible thing.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:38.800]   It was my sin and the sin of mankind that caused him to endure such pain and agony and
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.800]   suffering."
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.520]   You say you believe that, and yet you go on doing the very thing that led to that.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.520]   "No," says Paul, "the thing's impossible."
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:51.880]   Therefore, brethren, we are debtors not of the flesh to live after the flesh.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.880]   No, no.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:58.600]   If you really believe what you say, if you mean what you say, if you're honest, well,
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.520]   you'll say, "I want to have nothing to do with that old life, and therefore I will mortify
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.760]   the deeds of the body, which lead me ever to live after the flesh.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:10.280]   I'm going to kill that, I'm going to throttle that, I'm going to put all that to death."
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.880]   It's inevitable, says the apostle.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:19.280]   If you really mean what you say, and if you believe what you say, be consistent, be logical,
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.280]   be positive.
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:25.840]   "That's what you are at the moment," says the apostle, "but then consider what you're
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:26.840]   going to be."
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:32.520]   "Yes," he says, "I've just told you that if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:38.760]   from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:43.200]   your mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in you."
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.360]   "That's going to happen to your body even," writes, says the apostle.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:52.320]   If you believe that, are you going to allow what is still left in the body to control
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:56.280]   your life and living for the remaining few years that you're in this world?
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.280]   Of course you're not.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.760]   You're going to say, "All right, I'll aid this process.
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.840]   I know it's going to happen finally to me perfectly, but I'm going to start it here
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:05.840]   and now.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.520]   I'm going to mortify the deeds of this body.
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:11.120]   I'm not going to let this old body control me, this dead body.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.800]   I'm going to keep it down."
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.800]   That's his argument.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:18.360]   He says, "Now, do that, therefore brethren."
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.280]   You see, there's nothing here at all about a second experience that's possible.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:27.840]   When I get a sudden crisis and I realize I'm utterly impotent and I hand it all over to
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:31.480]   the risen Lord, there's not a word about that here at all.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.480]   Nothing of the kind.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:40.360]   But rather, is it a reasoned argument addressed to my understanding which leads to my taking
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.360]   action?
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:48.960]   I have got, through the Spirit, to mortify the deeds of my body for those reasons.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:57.000]   Now then, there I suggest to you is the Apostle's teaching with regard to sanctification.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.060]   That is how the Christian becomes sanctified.
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:06.500]   But now I want to anticipate a possible objection, or rather, there is a certain difficulty which
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:12.200]   certain people have found in the way in which the Apostle puts his argument.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.440]   You see, what about that "if"?
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:23.120]   "If you live after the flesh you shall die, but if, through the Spirit, you do mortify
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:27.560]   the deeds of the body, you shall live."
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:35.360]   This "if," says somebody, surely, isn't the Apostle teaching there that my possession
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:42.720]   of eternal life is ultimately contingent upon what I do?
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:49.960]   Is not the Apostle teaching there, says somebody, that if I do mortify the deeds of the body,
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:55.080]   I shall have eternal life, but if I don't and go on living after the flesh, that I shall
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.400]   die?
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.680]   In other words, whether I have eternal life or not depends upon what I do.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.960]   Isn't he saying that?
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.880]   It's a perfectly fair question to put.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.880]   But the answer, of course, is no.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.320]   He is not saying that.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.800]   Why is he not saying that?
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:18.600]   Well, he is not saying that for this reason.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:23.160]   That the Apostle here is not talking about cause and effect.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:31.360]   He is talking about means and ends, which is something very different.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.040]   He isn't saying, "If you do this, that will happen."
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.160]   That would be cause and effect.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:41.520]   No, he says, "The means to that end is this."
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.560]   Now, why do I say this?
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.480]   Why am I arguing about this?
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:48.120]   Why do I say that we must say that?
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:51.960]   Well, here are my reasons.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:58.320]   If the Apostle was saying here that my possession of eternal life were dependent upon my mortifying
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:06.360]   the deeds of my body, he would then be contradicting what he teaches everywhere and what the whole
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.840]   of the New Testament teaches.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:15.080]   Because that would be to be teaching justification by works.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:20.200]   That would mean that my works of mortifying the deeds of the body is the thing that gives
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.520]   me eternal life.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:27.000]   But this Apostle himself has told us in the last verse of chapter 6 this, "For the wages
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:39.600]   of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:46.640]   And as we know perfectly well, the whole point of this great epistle, especially in the first
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:54.760]   five chapters, is to teach us that justification is by faith only and not by the deeds of the
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:56.560]   law.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:02.320]   The glory of the gospel, says Paul, is this, that it is by grace, that it is the free gift
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:06.480]   of God, that when men could do nothing, God gave it to them.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:12.120]   The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:17.760]   Well, patently, obviously, he cannot suddenly in two verses contradict what he teaches everywhere
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:22.160]   else, not only in this epistle, but in every other epistle and what is taught by all the
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.920]   other Apostles also.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:30.640]   But not only that, the very term "you", "if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die."
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:31.840]   Well, who are "ye"?
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:37.840]   Well, we are the people who have already been made alive by the Spirit, what he has already
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:44.400]   told us in verse 2, "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.280]   from the law of sin and of death."
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:55.880]   So that clearly he is talking about those who are Christians as the result of the operation
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:35:01.120]   of the Holy Spirit upon them in their regeneration and all that follows from it.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:07.760]   But not only that, if this is to be interpreted as cause and effect, well then we say goodbye
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:11.640]   once and forever to the doctrine of assurance.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:16.720]   Because if the future, if my eternal safety and future depends upon what I do, well then
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:20.240]   I say I am lost.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.320]   No man can keep himself.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:28.440]   The Apostle never teaches that our assurance, which is the great theme of this whole chapter,
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:35.280]   is due to the fact that we are in Christ under this influence and power and realm and government
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.800]   of grace.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.360]   And that is the thing that makes it quite safe.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.080]   Well very well then, says somebody, what is he saying here?
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:46.920]   Well what he is saying here is this.
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.640]   It's a general statement.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:53.940]   We often use the same form of speech, don't we?
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:36:00.600]   You say to a man, "You know, if you put your finger into that fire you will be burned."
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.800]   We often put it like that, don't we?
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.800]   You say it to a child.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:10.040]   You don't come to the child and say, "Now, a person who puts his finger into the fire
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.640]   is likely to get burned."
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.640]   You put it more directly.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:17.240]   You say, "Now look here, if you put your finger into the fire you will be burned."
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.600]   That's a form of speech.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.200]   That's the way in which we put it.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:24.880]   That's exactly what the Apostle is saying here.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:30.360]   He says, "You and I are not debtors to live after the flesh," because, he says,
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:34.960]   people who live after the flesh are the people, as I've already been telling you, who belong
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.400]   to the realm of death.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:42.440]   He's already said it in verse 6, for instance, where he says, "For to be carnally minded
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:49.440]   to live after the mind of the flesh is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace."
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.400]   He's just saying that in a slightly different form.
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.960]   "If ye live after the flesh ye shall die."
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.960]   A man who's living a life after the flesh is a man who's not a Christian.
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.120]   He's not alive.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.680]   He belongs to the realm of death.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.680]   "Very well," says Paul.
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:08.760]   You realize that that's not true of you, and therefore you in no sense go on living
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.320]   that kind of life.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.600]   On the other hand, you make your positive statement.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:18.040]   "If you do the right thing, well, certain results will follow.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:22.320]   Take exercise, plenty of fresh air, eat good food, and you'll be a healthy man.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.520]   If you do that, you will be a healthy man."
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.520]   Quite right.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.520]   It means and ends.
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.160]   It isn't cause and effect.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.320]   "Well, very well then, or if you like, we can put it like this."
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:38.000]   The apostle, in a sense, is saying in a different way what he said in chapter 6 in verses 21
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   and 22.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   Listen to it.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.920]   He says, "What fruit had he then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?"
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:49.360]   In other words, when you were the servants of sin, you were free from righteousness.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:53.840]   "What fruit had he then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.680]   For the end of those things is death.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:04.040]   But now, being made free from sin and become servants to God, you have your fruit unto
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:08.120]   holiness and the end everlasting life."
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:14.600]   And then immediately, lest somebody might think that he inherits or gains everlasting
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:19.840]   life as the result of his holiness, he says, "For the wages of sin is death, but the
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.240]   gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:31.360]   In other words, God sees to it that those who are his people are brought to that ultimate
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:39.000]   end and object through the means which God himself is thus using through the Spirit.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.120]   Very well.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:49.160]   Here then we arrive at this big general conclusion that the apostle here is teaching quite plainly
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:59.160]   and clearly that the way of sanctification is the way of realizing the truth about ourselves
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:06.520]   as Christians and then our putting it into practice.
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:09.680]   It is not handing it over to the risen Lord.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:13.760]   It is not receiving something in a critical experience.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:20.040]   It is an argument, it is a deduction leading to an action of the will on our part which
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.320]   must be continuous and which must go on.
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.120]   That is what the apostle is teaching here.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:31.720]   Now, then I want finally, before I let you go, to show you that this is not only his
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.440]   teaching here, but it is his teaching everywhere.
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:38.840]   Not only his teaching, but the teaching of all the other apostles also.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:41.480]   Let me then put it like this to you.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:45.360]   You see, we hear a great deal, don't we, of passing over from the bondage of Romans
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.960]   7 into the liberty of Romans 8.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.320]   In Romans 7 we were trying to do it.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.400]   Ah, I realize now that was the mistake.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:56.640]   I hand it all over to the risen Lord, he does it.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:05.880]   But you know it is in Romans 8, in Romans 8, verse 13, that the apostle says, "If
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:14.680]   you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live."
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.240]   I am still here, I have still got to do it.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.600]   I haven't handed it all over.
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:22.560]   I have got to go on mortifying, in Romans 8.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:29.080]   It is almost incredible that people can talk as they do, so glibly about making this leap.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.680]   There is no leap here at all.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:35.520]   The apostle, as I have reminded you from the beginning, is rarely repeating what he
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:40.320]   has been saying in chapter 6, especially in verses 11 to 14.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:44.920]   But now let me show you very hurriedly that this is his teaching everywhere else with
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:49.800]   regard to sanctification.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:55.920]   If those other theories were true, well then I say that the apostle would never have written
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:00.400]   the second half of every epistle that he ever wrote.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:04.880]   Because in the second half of every epistle, he does exactly what he does here.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:09.720]   He starts with the word "therefore" and then goes on to reason with them and to appeal
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:13.560]   to them and to exhort them to work it out.
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.520]   He does it in this very epistle.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:21.120]   You take chapter 12, "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:28.760]   present your bodies a living sacrifice, and you must not be conformed to this world, but
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:31.720]   you must be transformed by the renewing of your mind."
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:35.880]   And then he goes on in detail to tell them how to live, what things they have got to
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.840]   do and what things they must not do.
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:40.860]   There it is.
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:45.120]   But then go on to the next epistle, the first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:49.040]   And there you will find him saying something like this in chapter 6, beginning to read
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:56.280]   at verse 13, "Meats for the belly and the belly for meats, but God shall destroy both
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.280]   it and them.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:02.440]   Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:07.560]   And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power."
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.280]   That's Romans 8, 11 again, you see.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.600]   "Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ?"
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.600]   He's reasoning.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:19.200]   "Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of an harlot?
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.200]   God forbid!
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.920]   What, know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body?
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:28.640]   For to useth he shall be one flesh, but he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit."
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.640]   Flea fornication!
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:32.480]   Don't hand it over to the Lord.
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.480]   Flea fornication!
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.720]   You've got to take to your heels, get away from it.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.720]   It's something you've got.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:40.040]   You don't say, "I'm tempted by this, what can I do?
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.040]   Oh, I mustn't struggle.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.440]   I hand it over to the risen."
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.440]   No, no.
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.440]   Flea fornication!
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:50.400]   "What, know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which dwelleth in
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.840]   you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.680]   For you are bought with a price.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:00.960]   Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's."
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:01.960]   You've got to do it.
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.800]   He's addressing it to you.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:07.160]   And you've got the same thing at the end of the ninth chapter of this first epistle
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.920]   to the Corinthians.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.200]   Let me read it to you from verse 24.
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:17.000]   "Know ye not," he says, "that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   prize?
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.880]   So run that you may obtain."
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.880]   He's saying that you run in such a way that you may obtain.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.240]   You're not handing it over.
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.240]   You've got to run.
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:33.720]   "And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things."
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:39.240]   If a man goes in for the races, he abstains from too much food, he abstains from alcoholic
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:40.800]   drinks, he stops smoking.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:44.760]   A man, he says, "who striveth for the mastery is temperate."
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.000]   He controls himself.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   He disciplines himself.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   He's doing it.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.840]   He's got to be temperate.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:54.440]   Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we are incorruptible.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.440]   Then listen.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:01.960]   "I therefore so run, not as uncertainly, so fight I," he's talking about boxing here,
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:05.160]   "not as one that beateth the air," what does he do?
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:08.440]   "But I keep under my body."
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:09.760]   That's the apostle Paul.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.640]   He didn't hand it all over to the risen Lord.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:15.880]   He says, "I keep under my body and bring it into subjection."
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.880]   He's mortifying his body.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:25.040]   "Lest by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway."
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:28.760]   Then go on to 2 Corinthians chapter 6.
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:33.560]   I haven't time to read all these to you in detail, but there it is beginning at verse
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:36.920]   14 in that most important chapter.
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:39.920]   "Be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers."
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:40.920]   Why?
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.400]   Well, what fellowship of righteousness with unrighteousness?
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.040]   He's giving you reasons.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.400]   He's giving you arguments.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.920]   He's not telling you to hand it over.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:53.320]   He's telling you why you mustn't do this, and he's fortifying your will as he does so.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:58.040]   And then he winds it up in a most important statement, the first verse of chapter 7 of
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.040]   2 Corinthians.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:04.800]   "Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved," therefore you notice again, "having therefore
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.200]   these promises," what?
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:17.480]   "Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.320]   in the fear of God."
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:23.720]   You see, not only does he not tell us to hand it all over to the risen Lord who will do
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:31.580]   it for us, he deliberately tells us to cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:37.080]   and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.000]   You go on to the epistle to the Galatians.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.160]   I'm leaving out many quotations, but I'm bringing out the salient ones.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.720]   Galatians 5, 16.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:51.960]   "This I say then, walk in the spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh."
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.520]   Then go to verse 24.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:46:01.740]   "They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts."
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:03.180]   They've done it.
[00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:06.860]   They have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:10.500]   If we live in the spirit, let us also walk in the spirit.
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:13.100]   We've got to walk in the spirit.
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:16.060]   Well, there it is perfectly clearly there.
[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:18.940]   You go on to the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:22.580]   The transition is in chapter 4.
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:23.580]   Verse 1.
[00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:29.780]   "I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, therefore, you see, beseech you that you walk worthy
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:35.100]   of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness, with long suffering,
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:39.540]   forbearing one another in love, endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond
[00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:40.540]   of peace."
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:42.540]   And then particularly from verse 17 on.
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:48.500]   "This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you henceforth walk not as the
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:53.180]   other Gentiles walk, not after the flesh, you see, in the vanity of their mind, and
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:55.620]   having their understanding darkened, etc.
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:56.620]   What am I to do then?
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:47:00.140]   Put off concerning the former conversation the old men.
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:02.140]   Be renewed in the spirit of your mind.
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:03.460]   Put on the new men."
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:05.580]   And then he comes down to details.
[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:12.140]   He tells me, putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour.
[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:15.180]   He doesn't say to the man who says, "I'm awfully tempted to lie, you know.
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:16.180]   What am I to do?"
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:18.500]   "Ah," says somebody, "don't struggle about that.
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.060]   Hand it over to the Lord.
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:21.060]   Ask him to deliver you.
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:22.060]   Ask him to keep it free."
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:25.500]   "No, no," says Paul.
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:28.420]   Putting away lying.
[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:33.220]   Because you're a Christian and a new-born man, put away lying.
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:35.140]   Speak every man truth with his neighbour.
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:37.020]   Be angry and sin not.
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:41.700]   Let him that stole not ask the Lord to deliver him from stealing.
[00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:49.580]   Let him that stole steal no more, but rather let him labour, working with his hands the
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:53.020]   thing that is good, that he may give to him that needeth.
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:56.880]   Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:57.880]   You are to do this."
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:01.940]   And on he goes, right away through to the end of that great epistle.
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:08.460]   It's all along doctrine deducing his practical conduct from it.
[00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:14.780]   Philippians 2, 12 and 13, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:17.180]   it is God that worketh in you both the will and to do."
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:18.180]   Of course.
[00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:21.100]   It is because God has worked in us, we can work it out.
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:22.920]   And we are called upon to do so.
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:24.180]   We are to do it.
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:32.260]   Philippians 3, 16 to 20, "Nevertheless, whereunto we have already attained, let us
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:34.160]   walk by the same rule.
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.300]   Let us mind the same thing.
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:40.740]   For in be followers together of me."
[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:43.380]   Not handing it over to the Lord, but be like me, he says.
[00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:47.420]   "Mark them which walk so that he have us for an ensemble.
[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:51.220]   For many walk of whom I have often told you, and now tell you even weeping, that they are
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:56.340]   the enemies of the cross of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose gob is their belly,
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:59.940]   and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:03.060]   For our conversation is in heaven.
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:07.300]   From whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus, who will change our vile body,
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:08.300]   etc."
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:10.540]   You see, it is always the same argument.
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:14.420]   Take the epistle to the Colossians, chapter 3.
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.860]   The first ten verses, I haven't time to read them.
[00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:23.060]   "If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:25.420]   sitteth on the right hand of God.
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:29.620]   Set your affections," you've got to do it, "on things above, not on things on the
[00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:33.900]   earth, for you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:36.820]   Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth."
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:37.820]   The same thing, you see.
[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:40.060]   It is the same thing everywhere.
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.220]   You've got to do it, I've got to do it.
[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:47.420]   Go on to the first epistle to the Thessalonians, chapter 4, the first five verses.
[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:53.300]   "Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:59.420]   you have received of us how you are to walk and to please God, so you would abound more
[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:00.420]   and more.
[00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:04.460]   For you know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus?
[00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:05.460]   Commandments.
[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:12.460]   For this is the will of God, even you as sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication,
[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:17.100]   that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor, not
[00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:22.140]   in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God."
[00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:26.180]   You see, it's still the same kind of argument addressed to us.
[00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:31.980]   And go on to the first epistle to Timothy, in chapter 6, in verses 11 to 16.
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:37.580]   "But thou, O man of God," what are you to do?
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:38.820]   What are you to do, O men of God?
[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:42.700]   Are you to confess, come out into the open and confess, admit that you're a complete
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:45.380]   failure and hand it all over to the risen Lord?
[00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:46.780]   No, what I read is this.
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:55.580]   "But thou, O man of God, flee these things and follow after righteousness, godliness,
[00:50:55.580 --> 00:51:03.060]   faith, love, patience, meekness, fight, you fight, the good fight of faith, lay hold,
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:08.260]   you lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called and hast professed a good
[00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:11.900]   profession before many witnesses," and so on.
[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:14.820]   Still you see, it is something that we've got to do.
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:19.740]   And then go to the second epistle of Timothy, and there you'll find it very clearly in the
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:22.860]   second chapter, beginning at verse 19.
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:28.700]   "Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, the Lord knoweth them
[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:35.700]   that are his, and let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:39.340]   But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and of
[00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:42.220]   earth, and some to honour and some to dishonour.
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:49.900]   If a man therefore purge himself," purge himself, he doesn't hand it over to be done for him,
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:56.180]   "if a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified,
[00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:59.780]   and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.
[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:05.540]   Flee also youthful lusts, but follow after righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with
[00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:08.180]   them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:11.380]   But foolish and unlearned questions avoid," and so on.
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:13.280]   Still you see exactly the same argument.
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:16.020]   Then go to Titus 2, and verse 11.
[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:21.900]   "For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us," what?
[00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:29.740]   "Well, that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously,
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:36.020]   and godly in this present world, looking for that blessed hope," etc.
[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:39.300]   When you go to the epistle to the Hebrews, you've had the same thing.
[00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:41.500]   I read it at the beginning in chapter 12.
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:46.260]   "It is an exhortation to me to lay aside every weight and the sin that doth so easily
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:48.820]   beset me, looking unto Jesus," what for?
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:49.820]   "To do it for me?"
[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:53.260]   No, no, but to follow his example, to do what he did.
[00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:54.700]   That's his whole argument.
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:59.100]   I don't look to the Lord in the sense of doing nothing and let him do it all for me.
[00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:02.100]   No, I see what he did, I must live in the same way.
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:07.180]   I must have this understanding, and therefore purge myself from all these things and live
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:09.580]   only unto God, as he did.
[00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:14.900]   That's the argument, hence all the warnings and the threatenings in that great epistle
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:15.900]   to the Hebrews.
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:19.220]   If it's just a question of handing it all over, why the threats?
[00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:20.220]   Why chapter 6?
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:21.220]   Why chapter 10?
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:25.220]   It's all quite meaningless, and the apostles would never have written.
[00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:28.140]   You go to the epistle of James, you get the same thing.
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:35.340]   Chapter 1, verses 22 to 27, "Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving
[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:40.820]   your own selves," and right on to the end of that first chapter.
[00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:44.900]   But listen to James 4, verses 7 and 8.
[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:52.500]   "Submit yourselves therefore to God, then resist the devil."
[00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:54.100]   You and I have got to do it.
[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:58.420]   You know, I know many Christian people who are spending their lives in trying to surrender,
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:01.780]   trying to hand it all over, and they're being defeated constantly.
[00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:02.780]   Why?
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:05.860]   Because they don't resist the devil.
[00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:06.860]   Resist.
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:11.820]   "Submit yourselves therefore unto God, resist the devil, and he will flee from you."
[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:13.900]   You needn't pray about this.
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:16.260]   Resist him, and he'll flee from you.
[00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:20.300]   "Draw nigh unto God, and he will draw nigh unto you."
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:21.300]   Then listen.
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:27.620]   "Cleanse your hands, ye sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded."
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:29.020]   You've got to do it.
[00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:33.820]   You've got to wash your hands, and you've got to wash your own heart.
[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:38.820]   You go to the first epistle of Peter, in the first chapter, verse 13, he tells you, "Gird
[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:46.900]   up the lines of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace which is to be brought
[00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:53.820]   unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ, as obedient children, and not fashioning yourselves
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:55:00.540]   according to the former lusts in your ignorance, but as he which hath called you is holy, so
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:04.620]   be ye holy in all manner of conversation."
[00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:09.020]   And he goes on to give them reasons and arguments for doing that.
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:17.060]   In the second chapter he says, in verse 11, "Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers
[00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:23.820]   and pilgrims not to go on struggling against sin any longer, but to hand it all over to
[00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:24.820]   the risen Lord.
[00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:34.620]   No, dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts which
[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:41.180]   war against the soul, having you a conversation honest among the Gentiles, that whereas they
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:47.340]   speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works which they shall behold,
[00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:51.620]   glorify God in the day of visitation."
[00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:57.140]   And then you've got the same thing again from verse 21 to the end.
[00:55:57.140 --> 00:56:02.140]   And in the third chapter he says the same thing in verses 10 and 11.
[00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:03.140]   Listen to him.
[00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:08.660]   "He that will love life and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and
[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:15.060]   his lips that they speak no guile; let him eschew evil, let him shy from evil as a frightened
[00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:16.060]   horse does."
[00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:18.300]   That's what eschew means.
[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:22.100]   Let him eschew evil and do good.
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:26.540]   Let him seek peace and ensue it.
[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:29.980]   Then in chapter 4 he's still more explicit in verse 1.
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:36.620]   "Forasmuch therefore as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise
[00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:42.420]   with the same mind; for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin, that he
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:46.940]   no longer should live the rest of his life in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the
[00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:47.940]   will of God."
[00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:49.140]   And then listen to this argument.
[00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:54.980]   "For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles,
[00:56:54.980 --> 00:57:00.700]   when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, banqueting, and abominable
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:05.180]   idolatries; wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:09.580]   of violence, speaking evil of you, who shall give account to him that is ready to judge
[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:10.580]   the quick and the dead."
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:13.220]   That's how the apostle Peter puts it.
[00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:14.460]   He doesn't tell you to hand it over.
[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:16.020]   He says, "Look here, don't be a fool.
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:20.620]   You spent sufficient of your time in this world doing that when you were a Gentile and
[00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:22.020]   when you were living in the flesh.
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:24.060]   You spent more than enough time in doing that.
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:25.700]   Don't go on doing that.
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:31.460]   Live to this God who has loved you and to this Christ who has died for you."
[00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:37.460]   It's an argument always, it's a reason, it's understanding, and then putting it into practice
[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:42.820]   by our own will and by our own effort, because the Spirit is in us and is enabling us to
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:44.300]   do all this.
[00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:49.220]   And therefore in the fifth chapter, in verses eight and nine, he says, "Be sober, be vigilant."
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:50.220]   You've got to do it.
[00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:55.700]   "Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about
[00:57:55.700 --> 00:58:01.020]   seeking whom he may devour, whom resists steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions
[00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:04.540]   are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world."
[00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:09.300]   Well, there it is, and finally you get in the first epistle of John, chapter two, verses
[00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:10.300]   three to six.
[00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:12.300]   We've got to keep his commandments.
[00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:17.940]   And lastly, in the third verse of the third chapter, "Every man that hath this hope in
[00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:26.500]   him purifieth himself, even as he is pure."
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:33.060]   And it's in the very last chapter of the Bible, the twenty-second chapter of the book of Revelation,
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:34.660]   verses twelve to fifteen.
[00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:41.620]   "Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his
[00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:43.580]   work shall be.
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:48.460]   I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.
[00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:55.220]   Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life,
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:59.500]   and may enter in through the gates into the city.
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:09.940]   For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:15.420]   liveth and maketh a lie."
[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:22.180]   What the Apostle Paul teaches us about sanctification in Romans 8, 12, and 13, he teaches everywhere
[00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:24.020]   else.
[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:33.380]   So does James, so does John, so does Peter, so does whoever wrote the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:39.820]   It is the universal teaching of the whole of the New Testament scripture.
[00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:47.620]   God willing, we'll go on next Friday to adduce further arguments to substantiate this interpretation
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:53.940]   of the Apostle's teaching, which I am setting before you.
[00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:57.860]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
