[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.080]   classical education that odd and antiquated custom
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.320]   setting generations of bewildered youth to suffering the
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.240]   Inky travails of learning greek and latin two languages. They would never speak
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.300]   Can hardly be defended or even explained without a long look at the nature of liberal education
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:45.300]   Nor can we neglect to tap the roots of that distant descendant of humanistic learning the modern humanities
[00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.260]   Where we now find classics nestling obscurely in college catalogs
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.740]   For at the pinnacle of both sat the classical curriculum
[00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:02.320]   But while granting that once upon a time classical learning might have borne some relation to professional skills
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.360]   Surely we think it has failed to remain useful in an age. No longer requiring the services of
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.840]   scholastic monks courtiers and imperial civil servants
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:22.420]   So does this curriculum remain at all relevant in a world that measures success in stock averages and megabytes?
[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.740]   for as classical scholar gilbert murray once conceded
[00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.960]   Even if we neglect merely material things and take as our standard the actual achievements of the greeks in conduct and knowledge
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.800]   The average clerk who goes to town daily idly glancing at his morning newspaper is probably a better behaved and
[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.520]   infinitely better informed person than the average athenian who sat spellbound at the tragedies of aeschylus
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.820]   That clerk cannot be too badly off. He gets along
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.700]   And if education is not to promote material success
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.340]   What should it do?
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.620]   Must we lend any legitimacy to an older idea that education exists primarily to form the inner man
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.860]   As well as to impart those all important skills for making a living
[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.620]   Have we in fact grown out of that ideal?
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.940]   Or have we fallen so far short of it that we cannot even spy its majestic peaks?
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.140]   We praise liberal education
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.900]   zealously
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.240]   It's a term of marble grandeur
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.020]   But few of us know what it means
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:40.480]   It has become grist for commencement addresses and high-flown commentary expounding the true mission of our schools and universities
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.460]   Best used by people removed from the rough and tumble of life
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.460]   As with pornography we cannot define it, but we think we know it when we see it
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:57.680]   Liberal education rests comfortably in a haze where it no longer calls us to commit to anything exemplary
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.380]   hard or heroic
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.920]   For some liberal education has become synonymous with the humanities
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:14.380]   That free-for-all of open curricula where the dazed and confused spend irreplaceable years browsing among
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:22.640]   Survey courses taking ant bites out of whatever nuggets randomly lie among the crumbs learning little or nothing in particular
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.120]   The humanities provide a direction for the directionless a path for the pathless
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.140]   certifying ignorance in the guise of a knowledge too easily acquired
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.660]   This wandering listlessness can envelop teachers of the liberal arts as well
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:47.100]   The average figure being according to Mark Van Doren too often quote neither lay nor learned
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.020]   But a bored fellow who mixes prescriptions wherein all tastes are flat or bad
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.500]   So much knowledge about one thing and another and never the tincture of wisdom
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.900]   close quote
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.040]   To others liberal education has become wedded to the propounding of social grievances
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.820]   Freedom studies we might call them
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:18.400]   To others still it marks an expenditure of time and effort largely wasted when a technological world wants technologists
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:25.820]   liberal education in short means today whatever we wish it to mean in all our idealistic or
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.980]   disputatious moods
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.180]   It is like a loose constitution open to any fanciful interpretation of the moment
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.500]   But some contemporary thinkers have tried to spy its essence
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:45.660]   philosopher Leo Strauss wants to find a liberal education nebulously as one in culture or toward culture
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.720]   In doing so drawing on the ancient metaphor of agricultural husbandry
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:59.100]   Culture means chiefly the cultivation of the mind the taking care and improving of the native faculties of the mind
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:06.780]   In accordance with the nature of the mind just as the soil needs cultivators of the soil. So the mind needs teachers
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.820]   further liberal education
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.980]   consists in reminding oneself of human excellence of human greatness
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:22.860]   and in listening to the conversation among the greatest minds as heard through the channel of great books an idea owing more than a
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:29.660]   little to Matthew Arnold's ideal of culture as trumpeting forth the best that has been thought and said
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:37.820]   A Bartlett Giamatti a staunch defender of the principles of liberal education as he saw them described it again
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:44.300]   Not too clearly as an attitude of the mind toward knowledge the mind explores and creates
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:51.500]   Such education occurs when you pursue knowledge because you are motivated to experience and absorb what comes of thinking
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:58.060]   Thinking about the traditions of our common heritage in all its forms thinking about new patterns or designs
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.800]   Whether in philosophic texts or financial markets or chemical combinations
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.640]   Thinking in order to create new knowledge that others will then explore
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.480]   Here the new presides
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:17.740]   Knowledge is not to be learned so much as created indeed. It exists almost for what it produces
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:26.220]   Broad claims like these typify the rhetoric of liberal education and such definitions can be both revealing and helpful
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.580]   But somehow they smell of formaldehyde. They seem just a bit sterile
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:38.860]   We are still daunted and challenged though by Everett Dean Martin's spirited declaration many decades ago
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.420]   That the best education is the organization of knowledge into human excellence
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:51.500]   An education he said is not the mere possession of knowledge, but the ability to reflect upon it and grow in wisdom
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:57.920]   Liberal education ought to aim not just at furnishing the mind with serviceable knowledge and information
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.060]   Nor even at habituating the mind to rational methods
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:09.280]   But at leading it to wisdom to a quality of knowledge tempered by experience and imbued with understanding
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.380]   It should in a word
[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.520]   humanize
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:22.540]   unguided by such an aim education loses its true character and finds itself degraded to servile training for the world's
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.540]   daily drudgeries
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.200]   Liberal education
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.460]   Civilizes it transforms us
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.100]   We are better for having run its course
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:37.500]   Nonetheless, these flourishes of eloquence glow within the light of dying embers
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.780]   The case must be made but hope for the cause has long since waned
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.060]   We lose an opportunity if we accept defeat too quickly
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:53.260]   Not in decades perhaps at a time when our schools have lost the capacity either to kindle a passion for history
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.840]   Or even to teach it intelligently
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:02.220]   Has there been a better time to search out our roots and recover our identity as citizens of the west?
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.700]   By reasserting an intellectual training that reminds us who we are
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:12.700]   Where we came from and the heights to which we have aspired and which we might aspire again
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.780]   We have a large and many branched family tree to trace
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:20.880]   So before we explore the history of a classical education
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.920]   Let's examine further the meaning and growth of liberal education
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.420]   And the subsidiary curriculum known as the humanities
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.920]   Winging a few theoretical flights along the way
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.520]   Take a classroom example
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:42.320]   Imagine we are teachers trying to define liberal education for students
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:48.900]   We may do so by shaving off its political barnacles and drilling down to its etymological source
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:54.400]   We say that liberal derives from a latin word for freedom
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.360]   So what makes an education liberal we plead our target in the scope
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.240]   It's an education that makes us free an education that liberates us
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.120]   Then we roll in the big guns
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:13.440]   Robert hutchins once explained that the liberal arts are the arts of freedom to be free
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.080]   A man must understand the arts of freedom
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.080]   much along these lines martin contended that
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.320]   Education is a spiritual re-evaluation of human life
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:31.700]   Its task is to reorient the individual to enable him to take a rich and more significant view of his experiences
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.780]   Yes education must be liberalizing
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:42.240]   But not in the political sense as if it meant half measures, but in its original sense
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:49.940]   Meaning the kind of education which sets the mind free from the servitude of the crowd and from vulgar self-interests
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:55.660]   Education is simply philosophy at work. It is the search for the good life
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.860]   Education is itself a way of living
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:04.860]   Giamatti addressed the freshman class at yale in 1983 with much the same spirit
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:10.700]   I believe a liberal education is the liberty of the free mind to explore itself
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:17.020]   He said to draw itself out to connect with other minds and spirits in the quest for truth
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:23.180]   Its main goal is to train the whole person to be at once intellectually discerning and humanly flexible
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:30.640]   Tough-minded and open-hearted to be responsive to the new and responsible for values that make us civilized
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:37.740]   Although later proclamations may lack the older definitions strident vigor they agree
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.620]   Liberal education we tell our class
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.320]   fosters a mind that struggles against insularity
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.740]   It aims to make us better than our untutored natures lead us to be
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:55.420]   But usually at this point the discussion so usefully begun breaks down
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.460]   What do we need liberating from?
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.820]   Ignorance is the hackneyed answer
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.540]   But of what exactly are we ignorant?
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:11.980]   Here the teacher confronts the often willful confusions of the immature easily suggestible mind
[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:17.340]   we might strategically avoid Strauss's idea that education should act as a
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.860]   counterpoison to the corroding effects of mass culture
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.500]   one thing at a time
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.500]   But we have raised questions
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.220]   questions
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:33.180]   We hope will set patterns of inquiry and steer the students energies away from slavery to intellectual fashion
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.160]   and sense impressions to careful self-examination
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:43.740]   For whatever else it seeks to do a liberal education seeks not only to instill essential knowledge
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.720]   But also to prompt the asking of questions
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.180]   It both provides a content and confers a method
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:57.580]   And ideally the search will be for hard and hard-won answers which those students
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.740]   pupils of life
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.420]   can use
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.840]   For such an education is eminently practical
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.180]   So far we sail the stratosphere
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:13.900]   The air is thin and rarified. We have yet to utter those great names of the western tradition
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:22.860]   Homer, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Virgil, Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, Dr. Johnson
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.340]   Which shine as distant lights
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.580]   But something is happening
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:32.780]   Students learn that maybe answers are possible and that there may be ways of getting at them
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:40.880]   Keys available to all who find within themselves the humility to learn and are determined to search beyond sentiment and circumstance
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.620]   To a common base of truth about human life and history
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.220]   In this one crucial way will they adjust?
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.340]   They will become responsible agents
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.060]   They will tap intellectual depths
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.520]   They will also learn to use words more responsibly
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.720]   They will learn how to paw an abstraction
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:05.040]   The concept of freedom for example is a stick of dynamite
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:11.580]   Books and life both teach that a freedom without discipline may not only be useless
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:16.000]   But a hindrance to grasping something true beyond the veil of illusion
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.340]   they may come to see with Milton that
[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:24.860]   Liberty hath a double edge fit only to be handled by just and virtuous men
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:30.380]   To bad and dissolute it becomes a mischief unwieldy in their own hands
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.840]   Further the idea of equality
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.400]   held with catechetical reverence in a democratic society
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.860]   They begin to view as yet another social and political ideal that
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:48.060]   However good has nonetheless been created by minds that came before theirs
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:52.380]   minds formed by ethical and intellectual ideals
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:57.840]   Themselves handed down from still other minds and they will begin to spot complications
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:06.700]   Not everything is democratic in the modern sense of being equally accessible to or achievable by all
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.480]   They will begin to see what C.S. Lewis meant when he said that equality
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.420]   Has no place in the world of the mind
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.380]   Beauty is not democratic
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:23.420]   She reveals herself more to the few than to the many more to the persistent and disciplined seekers than to the careless
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:29.980]   Virtue is not democratic. She is achieved by those who pursue her more hotly than most men
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:37.900]   Truth is not democratic. She demands special talents and special industry and those to whom she gives her favors
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:43.120]   Political democracy is doomed if it tries to extend its demands for equality
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.820]   into these higher spheres
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.640]   ethical
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.100]   intellectual or aesthetic democracy is death
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.980]   These words
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:59.500]   merely elitist at first sight to the unseeing or electively blind
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:04.480]   Point us to a difference between those who view education as a matter of equal attainment
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:11.420]   And those who regard it as a result of highly individual and strenuous labor guided by logic
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.460]   experience and wisdom of former ages
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:22.000]   A search for the objective and knowable over the subjective and unknowable an assertion of the common over the eclectic
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:29.760]   The first more leveling view would seem the mandatory one today among those who teach and among those who teach the teachers
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:38.200]   Tis education forms the common mind wrote Alexander Pope just as the twig is bent the trees inclined
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:47.440]   At the heart of liberal education stands the conviction that the well-touted freedom of mind comes only by submission to standards
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.100]   external to oneself
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:57.160]   That the discipline precedes the freedom and that this kind of freedom can only be earned as a reward
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.600]   Not conferred as a right
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.200]   openness to new experiences the
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.920]   Experiential heresy is not sufficient
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:13.740]   One needs to know how to respond to experience not simply with an enlightened intellect
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.880]   But with an enlightened heart
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:23.240]   Understanding like this must be achieved. It does not come without effort and it certainly cannot be assumed
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.740]   If only it were otherwise
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:31.100]   The struggle shown here in simple terms is not new it points up age-old
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:36.900]   Divergences in the theory of education and indeed radically differing notions of human nature
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:41.520]   These lead us into robust philosophical hair-splitting
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:49.380]   Philosophy stands on the doorstep bidding us to enter and make choices to make distinctions to discriminate
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:55.080]   generations of students have been taught that the very word education means the
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.420]   bringing out of children their native genius
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:02.260]   the word can just as easily sustain the opposite idea of
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:08.600]   Building up and even putting in of course any education worthy of the name will do all
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:15.600]   But at least the claims served place these ideas on their proper philosophical playing field
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.960]   Where we can begin to carve out a clear and defensible idea of what education
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.700]   Liberal or not is supposed to do
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:31.160]   For the true liberal ideal despite fulsome praise has found few buyers in the modern marketplace of ideas
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:37.200]   John Henry Newman a 19th century cleric and fount of crystalline clarity
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:43.800]   Bestowed the seminal statement of the aims of liberal education in his idea of a university
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:48.440]   He trusted a religious upbringing to inculcate virtue
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.520]   Formal education though is a different thing
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:58.160]   Perfection of the intellect he wrote is an object as intelligible as a cultivation of virtue
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.240]   while at the same time it is absolutely distinct from it and
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:09.240]   He described with axiomatic sagacity what the liberally educated mind looks like
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:14.080]   Instruction is one thing it has little or no effect upon the mind itself
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:21.660]   But education is a higher word it implies an action upon our mental nature and the formation of a character
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:28.120]   It is something individual and permanent and is commonly spoken of in connection with religion and virtue
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.760]   For Newman a proper education forms a habit of mind that
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.480]   Lasts through life of which the attributes are freedom
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:45.880]   Equitableness calmness moderation and wisdom all of which add up to what he called the philosophical habit
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.840]   Knowledge is to be sought for its own sake
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:56.600]   Irrespective of immediate and material gain any other attitude to knowledge betrays the servile mind
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:02.000]   All inquiry springs from the curious and rationally formed sensibility
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:09.920]   The principle of real dignity and knowledge its worth is this germ within it of a scientific or a philosophical process
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:16.560]   This is how it comes to be an end in itself. This is why it admits of being called liberal
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:21.500]   By this kind of knowledge we come to know the relative disposition of things
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:29.720]   Such as the constitution of the human mind that any kind of knowledge if it be really such is its own reward
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:36.160]   For only liberal knowledge stands on its own pretensions is independent of sequel
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:41.320]   expects no compliment refuses to be informed by any end or
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:46.840]   Absorbed into any art in order duly to present itself to our contemplation
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:55.760]   liberal education is simply the cultivation of the intellect as such and its object is nothing more or less than
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.000]   intellectual excellence
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.300]   The bar is high, but we can reach it with straining effort
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:09.040]   Here is a definition as fine as we are likely to find in this or in any other life
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:16.880]   Forming intellectual virtue is not the only task that liberal education has sought to perform
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.920]   along with imparting knowledge and
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:26.960]   Inculcating the ways of sound thinking it has also tried to transmit culture in both senses of the word
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.800]   This task often gets neglected now
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:37.960]   Unless its object be to raise the self-esteem of a particular minority and then of course the emphasis lies no longer on a common culture
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.840]   but on discrete separate ones
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:47.360]   Furthermore we have over time quietly adopted a truncated utilitarian notion of education
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.280]   As serving solely to help students get ahead
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:58.400]   So inured have we become to public demands to teach skills for tomorrow as though education has never done anything else
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:05.520]   Yet it was also largely to transmit culture that the brands of education we dub liberal and
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.080]   humanistic evolved
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:13.240]   Prior generations believed that citizens should know the meaning of justice for instance
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:18.880]   Not only so they might practice it in the streets, but so they might raise their children to practice it as well
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:24.840]   Thus perpetuating one more social ideal one both felt and enacted
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.680]   They also judged human instinct
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:32.480]   appetite unchecked by reason to be a perennial danger and
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.400]   Insufficient mental equipment to take through life
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:42.560]   We should certainly teach young people practical skills, but they must also take in our values
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.520]   ethical
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.520]   intellectual and aesthetic
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:53.920]   As we have already noted no system of education formal or informal can exist value free
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.400]   Even if children and adolescents were taught only technical know-how
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.520]   Such teaching would reveal the parts in the play we have assigned them
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:08.000]   The Greeks and Romans made sure to teach their offspring not only practical skill for getting along
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:14.400]   They made them memorize poetry commemorating the deeds of their mythological and historical heroes
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.880]   They filled their children's minds with useless
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:25.640]   Information by rote with one purpose among others to make them members of a people to make them one
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:31.720]   We cannot view classical education a right unless we factor in this element of culture
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.520]   classics served the role of
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.200]   To use the denigrated term of the day
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.840]   cultural gatekeeper a preserver of collective memories
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.720]   Where do we stand today?
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:53.180]   This idea of conserving culture has not been lost on all modern minds nor have all those minds been politically conservative
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:58.520]   journalist Walter Lippmann an influential voice for political and social liberalism
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.400]   spoke to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:07.160]   1940 and described what he believed to be the state of American education
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.480]   His perceptive words raised to a higher power
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:16.260]   Likewise speak to our immensely greater shiftlessness today
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:20.520]   There is an enormous vacuum where until a few decades ago
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:27.280]   There was the substance of education and with what is that vacuum filled it is filled with the elective
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:32.000]   eclectic the specialized the accidental and incidental
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.400]   improvisations and spontaneous
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.680]   Curiosities of teachers and students there is no common faith
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:43.680]   No common body of principle no common moral and intellectual discipline
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:47.960]   Yet the graduates of these modern schools are expected to have a social conscience
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.480]   They are expected to arrive by discussion at common purposes
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.820]   When one realizes that they have no common culture
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:24:01.440]   Is it astounding that they have no common purpose that they worship false gods that only in war do they unite?
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:06.000]   That in the fierce struggle for existence they are tearing Western society to pieces
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:13.480]   Lippmann observed that the modern world had established a system of education where everyone must be educated
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:17.640]   Yet where there is nothing in particular that an educated man should know
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:24.220]   Whether or not we agree with Lippmann's diagnosis let alone his presuppositions
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:29.880]   We can see that he saw a society that had already reached a critical fork in the road
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.760]   We ought to mark the spotlight on
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.820]   commonality
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:41.360]   The emancipated democracies have renounced the idea that the purpose of education is to transmit Western culture
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:48.200]   Thus there is a cultural vacuum and this cultural vacuum was bound to produce in fact has produced
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.680]   progressive disorder
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:58.480]   Lippmann described in effect the deliquescence of liberal education and the liberal intellectual ideal in America
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:04.080]   The consequences of which could not be foreseen easily before America's entry into World War two
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:13.820]   T.S. Eliot a poet and critic with much to say about education was convinced that any culture worthy of survival must work
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.080]   unstintingly to preserve itself and resist the modern
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:23.560]   Ideologically driven tendency to create bodies of men and women of all classes
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.000]   detached from tradition
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.680]   alienated from religion and susceptible to mass
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.640]   Suggestion in other words a mob
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:38.540]   Which is no less a mob if it is well fed well clothed well housed and well disciplined
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:46.480]   he addressed the prickly matter in his notes towards the definition of culture a book written in an
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.880]   uncertain post-war England
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:53.160]   He too noted how much the fervor for educational reform
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:58.520]   Assumed education to be an instrument for the realization of social ideals
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:02.120]   Which are not always the same as cultural ideals
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:09.260]   Quoting a leading thinker of the time who said that the ideal most to be served is full democracy
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:14.000]   But education Eliot said has even more pressing tasks
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.960]   Ignored by many would-be reformers were the higher purposes informing the liberal and humanist
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:25.360]   Traditions in which Eliot himself had been nurtured and to which he appealed
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:30.760]   It would be a pity if we overlooked the possibilities of education as a means of acquiring
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:37.000]   Wisdom if we belittled the acquisition of knowledge for the satisfaction of curiosity
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.040]   Without any further motive than the desire to know and if we lost our respect for learning
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:51.120]   Most tellingly and most damning to the scheme of course electives obtaining in American schools and universities
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:27:00.400]   Eliot did not believe students competent to decide for themselves what they needed to learn the lights of tradition and reason must guide them
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:07.880]   No one can become really educated he wrote without having pursued some study in which he took no interest
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:14.720]   For it is part of education to learn to interest ourselves in subjects for which we have no aptitude
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:22.280]   Eliot advocated a prescribed curriculum out with the cafeteria style of course selection
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:28.200]   We should not tailor our courses simply to our ease and ignorance or laziness
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:32.880]   But strive to grow into a state of mind, which is the object of a more rigorous
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:38.760]   Commonly directed course of study set by minds more mature and wise
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:47.200]   This was for Eliot the sanest of conservative tenets the conviction that a debt is owed to the past and that
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:52.600]   Conversely the past bestows a legacy on the present by teaching its lessons by a
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:56.000]   vicarious and finely sifted experience
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.280]   All of this of course violates dearly held modern beliefs in our self-sufficiency
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:07.920]   As well as the spirit of relativism in which all curricula are now arranged or left
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:15.040]   Unarranged on a level plane one course is as good as another all are valid in their own way
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:21.600]   Rejecting set curricula though ravages not only the older regime of classical education
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:30.160]   Which prescribed heavily but also any traditional form of liberal learning that has taken upon itself the splendid burden of
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.920]   Pointing up the knowledge most worth knowing
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:38.040]   Yet this curricular flea market also poses an aberration in the West
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:46.160]   It is we not they who have gone before us who cut a poor and disjointed figure in the eyes of history
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:54.080]   Indeed Eliot blamed the disintegration of Western culture on a form of cultural liberalism that
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:59.600]   Tends to release energy rather than accumulate it to relax rather than to fortify
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:07.120]   It is a movement not so much defined by its end as by its starting point away from rather than towards
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.160]   something definite
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:16.880]   By destroying traditional social habits of the people by dissolving their natural collective consciousness into individual
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:24.020]   constituents by licensing the opinions of the most foolish by substituting instruction for education
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:30.860]   by encouraging cleverness rather than wisdom the upstart rather than the qualified by
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:34.980]   Fostering a notion of getting on to which the alternative is a hopeless apathy
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:40.820]   Liberalism can prepare the way for that which is its own negation the artificial
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.740]   mechanized or
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.460]   brutalized control which is a desperate remedy for its chaos
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:53.900]   Here we have in one dose many of the modern world's ills told with vivid
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.580]   discomforting simplicity and
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.900]   This is not to repeat a matter for political partisans only
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:07.560]   Many political conservatives today fit the bill four square. We are all liberals of this kind now
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:12.380]   Hardly, can we avoid being so this is the air we breathe
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.940]   The Greeks and Romans yearned for a common culture
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:22.040]   Paideia is the Greek word customarily translated to mean
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.780]   education but
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.860]   Enculturation better approximates its essence
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:31.340]   Paideia was about instilling core values
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:35.300]   enunciating standards and setting moral precepts
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:41.500]   H.I. Moreau a French historian of ancient education held that Paideia
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:47.820]   Signifies culture not in the sense of something active and preparational like education
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:55.260]   But of something perfected a mind fully developed the mind of a man who has become truly man
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:31:04.000]   Modern views of education neglecting Paideia scarcely would have been recognizable to the ancients. They would not have deemed them complete
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.380]   education applied a social glue a common set of ideals and
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:16.700]   Expectations the larger culture carried supreme weight with the Greeks and Romans often at the expense of the individual
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:25.200]   Paradoxically though they thought the surest path to the healthy society to be a course of instruction that appears to us the most
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.920]   Individualistic because it is inner directed and speculative
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:35.380]   Played to its finest pitch that course seeks to foster contemplation
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:43.340]   which is according to Aristotle the highest form of activity because the intellect is the highest part of our nature and the things
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.460]   Apprehended by it or the highest form of knowledge
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:54.260]   The vitality of any culture can be achieved only if there be enough souls to apprehend the beautiful and the good
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:58.860]   Cohesion by other means risks Eliot's mob
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:02.980]   The object was to educate autonomous men and women
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.820]   citizens not robots
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:13.100]   one historian has said that the history of education has been an interplay between conceptions of freedom and
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.900]   conceptions of value and
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:20.260]   That by these conceptions we place ourselves within our society
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:26.440]   Schools and their curricula have always reflected the values of the society they serve
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:30.260]   They still do and this should concern us
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:34.200]   If a society be rigid and authoritarian
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:38.200]   Children are taught obedience if it be
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.760]   Equalitarian they are taught first of their rights as citizens
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.580]   secondarily of their civil obligations
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:47.080]   likewise a
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:54.460]   vocationally minded commercial society will betray its priorities by placing training for jobs above all else
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.920]   Getting on is the goal
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:01.720]   the ancients recognized that a sound culture must strike a balance between
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:05.340]   rival claims of authority and liberty
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:09.140]   Whenever we talk about education we do well to keep this in mind
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:14.500]   Any curriculum presupposes a vision of the good well-run society
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:21.000]   Sir, Richard Livingston a profoundly astute observer of cultural requisites wrote
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:28.680]   Along with Elliot and Lippmann amid the dislocations of World War two to apprise Britons of the vast challenges
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:32.500]   Political and social awaiting them at the end of the war
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:36.740]   Much of what he highlighted applied only to the Great Britain of his day
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:40.920]   But we can see that most of what he had to say impinges upon us now
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:48.280]   We can also see how much Livingston understood Paideia from the inside and could transpose it for modern life
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:53.340]   What purposes should education at its most enlightened serve?
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:58.920]   Livingston listed three functions to it to teach us to earn a living
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:04.940]   To teach us to be good citizens and to help us to understand the meaning of the good life
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:12.240]   The first objective he wrote we understand all too well and the second is treated with growing neglect
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:15.660]   But the third is almost irretrievably lost
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:18.140]   He was right
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:23.540]   When we peruse today's jargon laden manifestos that would tell us what we ought to teach and learn
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:26.520]   We search in vain for the third criterion
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.220]   But Livingston realized that
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:31.940]   philosophical even
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:37.140]   Spiritual formation is not extraneous to the task. It is central
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:44.520]   Robert Hutchins wrote that a system that denies the existence of values denies the possibility of education
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.400]   relativism
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.280]   Scientism skepticism and anti-intellectualism
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:58.060]   The four horsemen of the philosophical apocalypse have produced that chaos in education, which will end in the disintegration of the West
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:02.920]   Though this was an outcome that Livingston thought we can counteract
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:11.020]   Spiritual matters press upon the secular world just as irresistibly as they do upon the sacred. They just go by different names
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:13.960]   Spirituality
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.960]   embracing the entire personality
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.180]   cannot be severed from education
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:24.660]   As we are about to see the spiritual motive found an a special home in humanism
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:28.760]   Which had evolved to meet Livingston's second and third criteria
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:34.160]   Humanism seeks to help us understand our rights and duties as citizens
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:39.800]   but it also seeks to help us grasp the nature of human existence as it has been celebrated and
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:45.520]   implemented through time and perceived through literature philosophy and history
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:54.600]   Livingston said that the finest education before it can be judged complete must give everyone or
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.840]   everyone mentally able an
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.560]   intellectual attitude to life and a philosophy of life
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:06.080]   It must foster a right intellectual attitude
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:13.160]   seeking to find the world and life intensely interesting to wish to see them as they are and
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:18.560]   To feel that truth in Plato's words is both permanent and beautiful
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.760]   Not that we mustn't work for a living
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:25.920]   The efficiency of a community will depend on its technical and vocational education
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:31.120]   Its cohesion and duration largely on its social and political education
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:38.680]   But the quality of its civilization depends on something else. It depends on its standards, its sense of values
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.960]   Its idea of what is first-rate and what is not
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:47.960]   Words that swerve further from current dogmas of educational theory would be hard to imagine
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.600]   We don't speak the same language
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:58.640]   Yet any man of learning of the last several centuries would have found himself simpatico with the ideals even while finding them hard to live by
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.600]   What about the role of moral training in formal education?
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:07.040]   It's there in theory as it remains today in secular practice
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:14.800]   Though moral concerns now creak with the weakened politically approved language of tolerance and respect for diversity
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:21.120]   But even these aims critical as they may be for the building of character still fall short of another
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:26.800]   One is apt to think of moral failure Livingston wrote as due to weakness of character
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.840]   More often it is due to an inadequate ideal
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:36.520]   We detect in others and occasionally in ourselves the want of courage of industry of persistence
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:43.080]   Which leads to defeat but we do not notice the more subtle and disastrous weakness that our standards are wrong
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.160]   That we have never learned what is good
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:49.480]   Here is the crux of Livingston's critique of modern education
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:55.960]   It is leery of seeking out and acknowledging distinctions between good and bad
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:01.560]   Better and worse it does not teach the arts of discrimination
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:05.320]   We suffer from an atrophy of the judging faculty
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:11.320]   The most indispensable viaduct for the journey of life is a store of adequate ideals
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:16.120]   And these are acquired in a very simple way by living with the best things in the world
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:23.040]   The best pictures the best buildings the best social or political orders the best human beings
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:29.720]   The way to acquire a good taste in anything from pictures to architecture from literature to character
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:35.240]   From wine to cigars is always the same be familiar with the best specimens of each
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:39.120]   We must educate the head and heart alike
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:45.240]   The sight of goodness in life or in literature or history gives a standard at a challenge
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:48.920]   If anyone has been able to compare the first rate with the second rate
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:55.880]   His criticism will not be merely bitter and barren but creative born of a vision perceiving the good
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:59.320]   Dominated by it and desiring to bring it to birth
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:06.920]   We must train the intellectual and aesthetic judgment without which life for reflective
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:14.560]   educated people cannot be deemed whole without which we cannot awaken the mind of a man who has become truly man and
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:20.760]   any judgment presupposes a standard a guiding principle external to oneself a
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:27.760]   Principle in Robert Frost's words to stay our minds on and be stayed
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:36.200]   Common culture common standards those standards show us where we stand on the grid of human experience
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:42.800]   Livingston and TS Eliot both stood at a crossroads in the cultural and intellectual history of the West
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:47.680]   For theirs was the last generation to receive stout drafts of the old
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:55.080]   humanistic rigorous liberal schooling bestowed as a matter of course on those privileged to attend the better schools
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:58.240]   they would live to see that tradition dissolve and
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:03.440]   With the passing of that tradition a cultural ideal began to lapse as well
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:10.840]   here again as we did before we must distinguish in Werner Jaeger's words between culture as an
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:17.160]   ecological concept which means the entire way of life or character of a particular nation and
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:21.880]   culture as the conscious ideal of human perfection a
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:29.440]   Worthy compliment we find in a phrase from Alfred North Whitehead who wrote that moral education is impossible
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.080]   without the habitual vision of greatness
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:40.200]   Both the conscious ideal of human perfection and the habitual vision of greatness speak to those acts and thoughts
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.520]   betokening the acme of human achievement
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:47.480]   Especially those so judged by successive generations of discerning spirits
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:53.320]   These are the seeds of humanistic endeavor to climb the heights of human possibility
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:57.800]   To reflect on man's will to know and understand himself
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:05.800]   Placed as he is in a turbulent world made all the more violent and chaotic by his passions and by his perpetual
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:08.320]   Fight to free himself from their fetters
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:12.120]   We are on this planet to rise above lower nature
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:15.160]   So far so good
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:22.920]   But what do we mean by humanism if we crack this nut Greek and Latin in the age of Microsoft might begin to make some sense
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:28.800]   Humanism has never enjoyed a sure definition
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:35.560]   Nor has its anti religious press earned and unearned done the word any favors
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:41.880]   But if classical education is hard to understand without grasping the goals of liberal education
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:47.240]   It is absolutely incomprehensible without a firm hold on this idea of humanism
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:50.040]   So what is it?
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:57.000]   To some it's an optimistic belief in the capacity of human beings to solve those problems uniquely theirs or
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.720]   as Livingston once wrote
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:05.960]   humanism is the belief that man is more important than his environment or his possessions and
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:10.240]   That his fundamental business is not to understand physical nature
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:15.560]   Though that is one of his problems nor to earn a livelihood though
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.080]   That is one of his duties
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:23.120]   but so to lead his life is to make the best of human nature and above all what is characteristic of
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:30.760]   peculiar to and highest in human nature or as the Greeks put it to achieve the arete or
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:33.680]   excellence of man
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:41.640]   Critics have asserted its profaneness as a philosophy of secular power in defiance of a divine creator
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:49.000]   Those especially who espouse certain religious tenets have made humanism in full dress as
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.960]   secular humanism a term of pure denigration
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:59.600]   Both understandings bear traceable roots yet none exhausts the word or the idea
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:05.920]   the Fowler's concise Oxford Dictionary sums up the meaning most usefully as a
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.760]   devotion to human interests a
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:16.920]   System concerned with human not divine interests or with the human race not the individual
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:19.640]   religion of humanity
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:25.400]   literary culture especially that of the humanists who are themselves defined as
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.560]   students of human nature or human affairs
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:32.740]   they are students, especially in the 14th to 16th centuries of
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:36.200]   Roman and Greek literature and antiquities
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:40.640]   The devotion to human interests endures in the popular mind
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:47.680]   However, little that idea can be said to mean certainly as does the idea of humanism constituting a kind of religion
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.920]   But the emphasis on the human race not the individual
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.520]   represents the predominant modern view
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:58.240]   Conditioned I believe by the more outward-looking
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:01.360]   humanitarian impulse
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:06.840]   We can look back a couple millennia though and amuse ourselves to see that the confusions
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:10.760]   Stretch back all the way to the classical world itself
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:18.260]   The 2nd century AD Roman Aulus Gellius himself keen to capture the meaning of the Latin root
[00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.040]   humanitas
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.560]   Noted that common people understood it broadly
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:27.600]   while those who spoke pure Latin the educated elite
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.280]   restricted its meaning
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:35.200]   Those who have spoken Latin and have used the language correctly do not give to the word
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.860]   humanitas the meaning which it is commonly thought to have
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.200]   Namely what the Greeks call philanthropia
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:49.280]   Signifying a kind of friendly spirit and good feeling towards all men without distinction
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:56.060]   But they gave to humanitas about the force of the Greek paideia. That is what we call
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:45:00.520]   eruditionem institutionemque in bonas artes or
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:03.880]   education and training in the liberal arts
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:08.880]   Those who earnestly desire and seek after these are most highly humanized
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:15.880]   For the pursuit of that kind of knowledge and the training given by it have been granted to man alone of all the animals
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:18.280]   And for that reason it is termed
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.800]   humanitas
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:24.000]   He went on to clarify the related humanior as
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   Meaning not good-natured and amiable and kindly which was its usual sense
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:35.200]   But is applying to someone of some cultivation and education
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.440]   eruditiori doctorique
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:44.280]   Someone that is who has learned not only from books possessing knowledge of letters
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:49.480]   But also one who has taken on the cultivation that comes of the contemplative life
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:54.280]   Thus wrote modern philosopher and man of letters Irving Babbitt
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:46:01.640]   Humanitas really implies doctrine and discipline and is applicable not to men in general
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:04.640]   But only to a select few it is in short
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:11.280]   Aristocratic and not democratic in its implication it faces outward but inward first
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:15.960]   Humanitas seeks to amend the self before amending the world around
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:21.160]   Babbitt's pivotal distinction arose out of the jumble he spotted between
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:23.800]   humanism and
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:28.440]   Humanitarianism two words that had come to mean and still mean a century later
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:31.600]   practically the same thing in the popular mind and
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:34.240]   his division illuminates a
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:40.040]   person who has sympathy for mankind in the lump faith in its future progress and
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:45.400]   Desires to serve the great cause of this progress should not be called a humanist
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:49.880]   But a humanitarian and his creed may be designated as
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:52.800]   humanitarianism
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:58.640]   Peculiar mischief crops up from the muddle the humanitarian lays stress almost solely upon
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:04.480]   breadth of knowledge and sympathy the poet Schiller for instance speaks as a
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:11.000]   humanitarian and not as a humanist when he would clasp the millions to his bosom and
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.680]   Bestow a kiss upon the whole world
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:19.940]   But the true humanist Babbitt said is more as selective in his caresses
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:27.680]   For he like the eminently humanistic Cicero knows that what is wanted is not sympathy alone nor again
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:32.920]   discipline and selection alone, but a disciplined and selective sympathy
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:40.600]   Sympathy without selection becomes flabby and a selection which is unsympathetic tends to grow disdainful
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:44.200]   set over against the humanitarians the
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:52.280]   Humanists concern lies in perfecting the individual rather than in schemes for the elevation of mankind as a whole
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:59.380]   And although he allows largely for sympathy. He insists that it be disciplined and tempered by judgment
[00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:08.000]   Tellingly when Babbitt contradicted Bruntier who believed he had found the perfectly apt definition of humanism in the Roman poet
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.360]   Terence's assertion that I consider nothing human alien to me
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.160]   Babbitt did so because of the entire absence of the idea of selection
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.920]   for here stands the
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:27.600]   Humanitarian busybody with whom we are all so familiar nowadays who goes around with schemes for reforming almost everything
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.200]   except himself
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:36.020]   Selection was both a cultivated ideal and a counterweight to mere sympathy
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:38.760]   Here the difference is sealed with wax
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:41.760]   humanism selects
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.400]   humanitarianism doesn't
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:49.600]   Liberal education and the humanities then are not synonymous terms
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:53.040]   Though the source of their confusion is not hard to spot
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:49:01.040]   The goals of humanism and the goals of any curriculum fairly called liberal have shot at neighboring targets
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:03.440]   They aim to broaden
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.520]   enlighten deepen
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:09.480]   Although humanism did not dawn its familiar clothing until the Renaissance
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:17.040]   Its ideals took shape 2,000 years before in the hands of the Greeks. They drew the blueprints for right education
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:22.320]   The Romans finally codified the system which they dubbed the liberal arts
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:25.400]   That legacy has been maintained to this day
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:31.120]   Though the muddy accretions of bad teaching and misdirected good intentions have covered over the roots
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:36.960]   liberal arts derives directly from artes liberales and
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:40.560]   Designates those activities promoting freedom and leisure
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:48.600]   But we must add that for Greeks and Romans leisure carried none of our overtones of idleness
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:53.180]   leisure referred to those arts even techniques
[00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:56.240]   reckoned conducive to the contemplative or
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:59.960]   reflective life to an expansive freedom of mind
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:07.040]   Opposed to the artes liberales were the artes serviles the obligatory
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:10.800]   backbreaking work performed to earn bread and ale
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:15.160]   Artes serviles were necessary for any society
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:19.200]   Artes liberales for a higher more varied culture
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:25.520]   the venerable seven liberal arts of the trivium grammar rhetoric logic and
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.360]   quadrivium
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:34.000]   astronomy music geometry arithmetic were enshrined in the Middle Ages as those mental arts
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.280]   promoting leisure
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:42.520]   But prior to leisure or the liberal arts came the articulation of the virtues
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:49.720]   Moral muscle being not inborn must be firmed up before the good society can be achieved
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.080]   goodness in the polis
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:59.120]   But first goodness in individuals the ancients knew that any society marked by unbridled
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:01.640]   appetites competing for control and
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:05.400]   Satisfaction would quickly reduce itself to barbarism
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:14.040]   the morally sound state was a prerequisite to the fruitful practice of the liberal arts and the liberal arts required a measure of
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:16.120]   social tranquility
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:22.000]   Now for the sinews the gristle of those liberal and humane ideals
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:27.680]   The Greeks and Romans while capable of great superstition
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:36.040]   Nonetheless placed great faith in the power of reason and it was the object of the artes liberales to discover truth
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:39.960]   Yet they did not live solely in their brains
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:45.040]   Plato believed in the fundamental unity of the good all
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:47.880]   the virtues amounted to a rate
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:55.120]   excellence which signified the best quality appropriate to any act or actor thought or thinker it
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:58.920]   Pointed toward the best of anything to its perfection
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:04.920]   Conduct should be informed by knowledge of the virtues and evil comes naturally of ignorance
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:13.280]   Morality is rational. It can be divine by the instructed mind. It isn't purely subjective. It is discoverable
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:17.520]   Evil is a disease a cancer of the mind and soul
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:20.160]   healable by philosophy
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:27.760]   One healed the soul by leading the mind to knowledge of values which in turn leads to aletheia or truth itself
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:35.880]   Nothing short of this would produce the virtuous life for the quality of life could be neither more nor less than the soul made it
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:41.960]   How strange said Socrates on the eve of his execution that any citizen of Athens?
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:45.560]   The greatest of cities and the most famous for wisdom and power
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:51.080]   Would not be ashamed to care for the acquisition of wealth and for reputation and honor
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:55.980]   When you neither care nor take thought for wisdom and truth and the perfection of your soul
[00:52:55.980 --> 00:53:02.320]   Socrates claimed his life's mission to be nothing else than urging you young and old
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:06.800]   Not to care for your persons or your property more than for the perfection of your souls
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:12.960]   The Western mind elevated this mighty philosophical aim into an ideal
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:21.080]   The inner takes precedence over the outer the mind and soul compose an inseparable whole and both are fed or
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:23.080]   starved together
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:29.840]   No option exists to train the mind alone without producing soul deep consequences
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:33.680]   But how is the inner to be instructed?
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:41.960]   Here was the question posing the greatest challenge to Greek education to Piedia. How best to fit theory to practice?
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:45.640]   The Greeks also knew the tension between teaching for skills
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:50.240]   training and teaching for cultural and intellectual strength
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.840]   liberal education
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:54:00.840]   Aristotle on the heels of Plato by a generation admitted that it is not clear whether pupils should practice pursuits that are practically
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.440]   useful or
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:04.360]   morally edifying
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:11.160]   Still the Greeks reached an impressive accord on the role of education in promoting virtue
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:15.480]   One we see spun out richly in the works of Plato and Aristotle
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:20.080]   they came to believe that education ought to change who the learner is an
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:25.280]   Operation such as this and an analogy to surgery doesn't come amiss
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:27.960]   Must be undertaken with care
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:30.920]   but the rewards were great and
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:33.240]   indelible
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:40.960]   Protagoras had proclaimed man to be the measure of all things and an exploration into man's nature was proclaimed the highest pursuit
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:44.200]   We can make along our journey through life
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:50.560]   Certainly the most sublime work ever penned on Piedia and the building of common culture is
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:55.520]   Plato's Republic said by French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:55:00.480]   to be the finest treatise on education ever written and
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:08.640]   indeed one cannot talk intelligently about education without having sat at the feet of Socrates and his companions as
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:12.600]   They wrestle with ways and means to build the well-run state
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:18.160]   We need not detain ourselves with a detailed précis of Plato's thoughts
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:25.000]   But we would serve our purposes with a glance at his view of the ideal state for that is what the Republic describes
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.040]   Not so much a feasible political program
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:36.600]   Socrates gave his name to the Socratic method a teaching device seeking as its object to make all knowledge personal
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:42.320]   By rigorous questioning to make it more than a nod of lazy assent
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:49.360]   The novices thereby led through the bracken of his assumptions and biases to the clear light of knowledge
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:53.900]   The teacher holds him responsible for all words and ideas. He utters
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:59.720]   Pressing him to define them with greater exactitude. Just what do we mean by justice?
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:01.480]   freedom
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:02.600]   courage
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:10.600]   Virtue are they achievable in this life or are they beyond the grasp of even the most righteous and this method remains a cardinal?
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.680]   means of testing intellectual metal
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:18.800]   the pupil isn't so much taught as guided first to recognize his own ignorance and
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:23.560]   Second to spring from this illumination to true knowledge and understanding
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:29.240]   Thus does knowledge rise out of ignorance thus can knowledge lead to wisdom
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:33.440]   How our human relations structured in this ideal world?
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:37.600]   Plato's view of humanity reveals distinctly hierarchical
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:43.000]   Scaffolding the Republic of Plato's fancy is composed of three tiers
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:50.360]   Living on the bottom are most of us the great mass of people from the poor through prosperous farmers
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:55.720]   Artisans and merchants they put food on the tables and keep the wheels of commerce turning
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:57:01.400]   But by dint of their desire merely to make a living untroubled by higher aspirations
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:08.520]   They are to exercise no political power over others because they have not been taught to wield power with justice and
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:10.800]   magnanimity
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:18.520]   next up come the administrators and the military those charged with carrying out the policies set by the rulers on top and
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:26.160]   The rulers of course are the philosopher princes who alone possess the knowledge and wisdom to rule
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:34.040]   This is not a democratic vision. It is guided by an assumed inequality throughout the populace
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:36.440]   It is therefore shamelessly
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:40.200]   aristocratic the rule of the best and most able
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:46.280]   One abiding difference though from the more familiar and historical sense of aristocracy
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:49.920]   Lies in the absence of any belief that the aristocrats
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:56.240]   Those who man the upper tiers gain their ascendancy from inherited privilege
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:03.040]   Rulers rule only after their characters have been judged meritorious
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:05.760]   This idea wrote Jaeger
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:13.760]   Plato thought to be a principle in harmony with nature and which is therefore absolutely inevitable in the state of divine perfection
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:18.960]   The poor and laboring masses haven't had the education for enlightened rule
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:26.000]   Yet more significantly the plutocrats out for nothing beyond lucre are also expressly forbidden power
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.720]   Souls like these are also unequal to the task of ruling
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:39.280]   What curriculum must one complete before he is deemed worthy to rule over others in this theoretical state?
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:46.040]   Primary schooling stipulates a course of mathematics literature music and gymnastics
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:52.480]   Later students learn logic as adults some set off into the upper reaches of philosophy
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:57.080]   Significantly not till they reach their 30s are they fit for leadership
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:59:01.240]   Not till 50 or so will they be asked finally to turn
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:06.480]   Upwards the vision of their souls and fix their gaze on that which sheds light on all
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:10.440]   For when they have thus beheld the good itself
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:15.880]   They shall use it as a pattern for the right ordering of the state and the citizens and themselves
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:23.120]   Throughout the remainder of their lives each in his turn devoting the greater part of his time to the study of philosophy
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:28.520]   Philosophy is not a fine thing but a necessity
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:33.200]   Plato claimed another tripartite split in human nature
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:37.640]   One not surprisingly reflecting the three classes of the state
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:40.400]   first appetite all
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:46.480]   physical and sensual wants including avaricious desires for material gain
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:53.320]   then the spirited element which is formed by habit and will and
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:55.200]   finally the
[00:59:55.200 --> 01:00:00.560]   philosophic element which can perceive virtues like sympathy and selflessness and
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:06.280]   If it's properly formed can apprehend goodness beauty and truth
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:09.320]   order of whatever kind is
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:13.600]   Hierarchical all this may strike us as fanciful
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:19.600]   But the value of these ruminations to us resides in the theory not the applicability
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:22.360]   they crystallize
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:26.400]   CS Lewis best summarized this model for the modern mind as
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:32.760]   The king governs by his executive he wrote so reason and man the
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:39.280]   Philosophic element must rule mere appetites by means of the spirited element
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:43.920]   the head rules the belly through the chest the seat of
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:51.840]   Magnanimity of emotions organized by trained habit into stable sentiments the chest
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.960]   magnanimity
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:01:00.400]   sentiment these are the indispensable liaison officers between cerebral man and
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:07.280]   Visceral man it may even be said that it is by this middle element that man is man
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:13.080]   For by his intellect he is mere spirit and by his appetite mere animal
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:22.200]   For devotees of this classical Greek view of the human mind and human nature the supreme goal of education was happiness
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:30.000]   which was conceived of as health of soul the ultimate good man can hope to attain during his lifetime and
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.840]   From this health of soul they believed would come eudaimonia
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:37.520]   literally the good God within a
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:42.900]   Harmonious balance of the whole personality, but once more how to achieve it
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:49.160]   early humanistic education began with the cultivation of character
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:57.040]   Whatever intellectual feats a man might bring off they were of scant value if he had not first achieved a goodness and
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.920]   tranquility of soul
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:01.760]   Socrates had said that
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:07.260]   According as the sons turn out well or the opposite will the whole life of their father's house be affected
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:10.280]   depending for better or worse on their character
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:17.600]   Character determined the health of the state in this sense the purposes behind education were also political
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:23.280]   each man and woman would be of either the rulers or the ruled and
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:31.240]   Here the aristocracy must carry its own weight a ruler must be distinguished from a subject by his superior character
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:34.440]   Not merely by the accidents of birth and wealth
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:41.720]   Therefore his education must differ from theirs. He must care about supra intellectual qualities
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:44.560]   Jaeger explained the goal
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:49.880]   Distinction between the two kinds of training extends even to food and regimen
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:56.680]   The infant prince must learn to ignore physical needs and desires in order to fulfill urgent duties
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:03.320]   Must be master of his own hunger and thirst must be used to short sleep late to bed and early to rise
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:08.400]   Must not be afraid of hard work must not be lured by the bait of sense
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:12.720]   Anyone who cannot do all that is a subject not a ruler
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:19.160]   Socrates gives this education in self-control and abstinence the Greek name for training
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:21.280]   ascesis
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:26.440]   There can be no happiness without this idos this training in self-control
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:30.840]   modesty and reverence for that judged worthy of revering
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:34.080]   Education began with principles such as these
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.760]   People must first achieve the good
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:40.520]   Individually before going on to serve the larger social good
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.640]   the healthy society begins with healthy souls and
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:51.160]   The healthiest souls are not formed without intellectual and most of all spiritual labor
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.280]   We approach the heart of the matter
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:58.280]   the souls quest for health began with the
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.120]   inculcation of right habits
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:08.160]   Read book three of the Republic. We see that the platonic scheme far from being over
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:15.160]   intellectualized approached the task with sobriety the child is to be reared on music and
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:20.720]   Gymnastics both corresponding roughly to the training of the mind and body
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:26.240]   Many of us now tend to think of music merely as diverting entertainment
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:29.880]   But to the Greeks music formed the spirit
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:37.240]   Plato believed that the soul needs training in the aesthetic and spiritual good and that music reflects those
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:44.440]   microscopic spiritual states with melody harmony and rhythm more readily than any other activity
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:47.120]   it will either purify or
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.480]   corrupt the soul
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:53.600]   The rhythms of a life must be orderly and brave
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.560]   Why?
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:05:02.000]   Because in just this way does good speech and good grace and good rhythm wait upon a good disposition
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.800]   Not that weakness of head which we euphemistically style goodness of heart
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:10.760]   But the truly good and fair disposition of the character in the mind
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:16.000]   for in all these there is grace or gracelessness and evil rhythm and
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   Disharmony are akin to evil speaking and the evil temper, but the opposites are the sober and the good disposition
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.680]   one speculation holds that
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:35.160]   education in music is most sovereign because more than anything else rhythm and harmony find their way to the inmost soul and
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:38.400]   Take strongest hold upon it imparting grace
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:43.680]   so anyone so trained would praise beautiful things and take delight in them and
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:49.000]   Receive them into his soul to foster its growth and become himself beautiful and good
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.240]   The results for the student are indelible
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:59.080]   The ugly he would rightly disapprove of and hate while still young and yet unable to apprehend the reason
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:06.280]   But when reason came the man thus nurtured would be the first to give her welcome for by this affinity. He would know her
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:12.180]   Near the end of his life Plato expounded more broadly upon the theory of right education
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:17.600]   when pleasure and love and pain and hatred spring up rightly in the souls of those who are
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.720]   Unable as yet to grasp a rational account
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:27.200]   They will consent thereunto through having been rightly trained in fitting practices
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:30.400]   this consent viewed as a whole is
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:36.640]   Goodness, the student is rightly trained in respect of pleasures and pains
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:44.040]   So as to hate what ought to be hated right from the beginning to the very end and to love what ought to be loved
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:49.960]   This isn't just reading and writing and counting. This is paideia
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:57.600]   Likewise Aristotle saw the cultivation of virtue first as a matter of encouraging habits of
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:03.120]   Learning to like what is worth liking and reason and habit alike have roles to play
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:09.920]   He thought of virtue as a mean a midpoint a balance of competing appetites and claims
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:12.400]   Which the well-directed mind develops over time
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:18.720]   moral virtue is concerned with emotions and actions in which one can have excess or
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.120]   deficiency or a do mean
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:27.400]   for example one can be frightened or bold feel desire or anger or pity and
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:33.680]   Experience pleasure and pain in general either too much or too little and in both cases
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:38.240]   Wrongly whereas to feel these feelings at the right time on the right occasion
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:45.040]   Towards the right people for the right purpose and in the right manner is to feel the best amount of them
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:49.440]   Which is the mean amount and best amount is of course the mark of virtue
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:56.480]   At the same time Aristotle sensed as do we the muddle of nature and nurture
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:59.320]   Can such virtue be inborn?
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.960]   He had an answer
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.680]   Some thinkers hold that virtue is a gift of nature
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:09.520]   Others think we become good by habit others that we can be taught to be good
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:12.920]   Natural endowment is obviously not under our control
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:18.720]   It is bestowed on those who are fortunate in the true sense by some divine dispensation
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:23.200]   Again theory and teaching are not equally efficacious in all cases
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:29.840]   The soil must have been previously tilled if it is to foster the seed and the mind of the pupil must have been prepared by the
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:33.700]   cultivation of habits so as to like and dislike a right
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:41.740]   For he that lives at the dictates of passion will not hear nor understand the reasoning of one who tries to dissuade him
[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:46.720]   Passion seems not to be amenable to reason but only to force
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:55.560]   Education is often compared to the cultivation of soil in ancient writings as well as in those of the Renaissance as
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:09:00.620]   Plants are cultivated to grow strongly so as to be fruitful or beautiful
[01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:06.920]   So must the human mind be pruned and weeded if it too is to become cultivated
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:13.060]   Right habits once planted are not expected to form the soul on their own
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:16.980]   Those habits are products of vigilant husbandry
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:21.560]   Saying much the same thing in a slightly different way four centuries later
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:25.760]   Plutarch wrote of the responsibility of a tutor in this way
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:30.440]   Just as nurses mold a child's body with their hands
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:33.560]   So tutors by the habits they inculcate
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:39.640]   Train the child's character to take a first step as it were on the path to virtue
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:47.400]   So the Spartan when he was asked what he affected by his teaching said I make honorable things pleasant to children
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:52.000]   the Roman Emperor Vespasian described the best teachers as those who
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:56.540]   Train the souls of the young to gentleness and civic virtue
[01:09:56.540 --> 01:10:00.480]   Aristotle said there are two kinds of virtue
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:03.240]   intellectual and moral
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:11.080]   intellectual virtue is for the most part both produced and increased by instruction and therefore requires experience and time
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:16.840]   whereas moral or ethical virtue is the product of habit ethos a
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:22.260]   Natural faculty like sight and hearing serves us without our exertion
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:29.160]   There's nothing natural though about the virtues they come by effort and must be reinforced by habit
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:34.560]   We acquire them by first having actually practiced them just as we do the arts
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:39.660]   We learn an art or craft by doing the things that we shall have to do when we have learned it
[01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:42.680]   Men become builders by building houses
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:45.480]   harpers by playing the harp
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:52.480]   Similarly we become just by doing just acts brave by doing brave acts
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:56.280]   Here the political implications become most acute
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:59.640]   This truth is attested by the experience of states
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:04.600]   Lawgivers make the citizens good by training them in habits of right action
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:10.440]   This is the aim of all legislation and if it fails to do this it is a failure
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:14.800]   This is what distinguishes a good form of Constitution from a bad one
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:19.920]   What was to be the result of all this strenuous philosophical effort?
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:25.960]   The wise citizen fit to govern first himself and then and only then to govern others
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:30.360]   Precisely in this way does one become free through liberal learning
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:33.520]   first by acquiring right habits
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:40.080]   second by intellectual strain by learning to apprehend the beautiful and the good with the mind and
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:43.920]   The mind then confirms what the soul has already learned
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:51.040]   One can become intellectually powerful of course without those right habits, but what good is that?
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:55.280]   The object of the ancients was not a programmable
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:00.880]   Ratio-sensitive machine it was the cultured man or woman
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:05.080]   The Romans taking their cues from the Greeks built on this legacy
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:11.200]   While they were a practical people they also came to revere the philosophical bent
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:16.840]   But within their milieu orators replaced philosophers as the cultivated ideal
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:22.240]   men of speculative ability who yet matched that ability to a high sense of civic duty of
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:25.040]   enlightened service to the state
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:29.680]   Quintilian was the ultimate authority on creating the perfect orator
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:33.600]   the first essential for such a one is that he should be a good man and
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:38.160]   Consequently we demand of him not merely the possession of exceptional gifts of speech
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:41.000]   But of all the excellences of character as well
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:47.960]   For I will not admit that the principles of upright and honorable living should be regarded as the peculiar concern of philosophy
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:54.680]   The man who can really play his part as a citizen and is capable of meeting the demands both of public and private business
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:13:00.080]   The man who can guide a state by his councils give it a firm basis by his legislation
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:03.880]   And purge its vices by his decisions as a judge is
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:08.080]   Assuredly no other than the orator of our quest
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:12.840]   Once more we find a tall order for the ideal citizen
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:18.320]   And once more we find that skills are not placed above learning and moral rectitude
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:25.840]   Character still helps to form the liberal mind the mind that is with the ability to reflect upon its assumptions and sense
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:29.600]   Impressions a mind able to make sound judgments
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:37.960]   When describing this ideal orator Quintilian says he is compelled to speak of such virtues as courage justice
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:44.280]   Self-control in fact scarcely a case comes up in which some one of these virtues is not involved
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:49.480]   This ideal orator this renewed paragon of the cultured mind
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:54.920]   Was to be placed on par with a philosopher because of his predilection and ability to reflect
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:14:01.240]   To contemplate this Roman synthesis stands in some ways as an even greater
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:09.080]   Affirmation of the Hellenic vision than the schemes of the Greeks for life is no longer framed within Plato's ideal garden
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:15.720]   Walled off from the world's squalor and chaos the ideal takes on the trappings of a practical program
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:18.440]   Philosophy gets brought down to the street
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:24.120]   Meanwhile though how fair the purpose of perpetuating culture in the Roman world if
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:27.560]   We can answer this we can also answer the question
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:33.120]   Why Greece and Rome and then why Greek and Latin?
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:38.080]   As the Sun set on the Roman Empire during the long decades of the 5th century AD
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:46.320]   The upper classes still possessed the confidence of a matured culture. They knew they had something valuable enough to preserve
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:53.880]   Education throughout the vast bulk of the Mediterranean and in the distant northern places ruled under the eagle was
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:59.480]   despite unevenness in practice marked by extraordinary uniformity a
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:02.800]   Uniformity that had arisen out of the Hellenistic world
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:09.640]   The civilizing net was cast widely during the latter years of the Roman Republic and stayed that way for centuries
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:17.160]   Throughout the breadth of the Empire even as the world grew more and more unstable politically the educated man was still honored
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:20.200]   Just as important he was recognizable
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:26.160]   Culture held enough people agreed on what was vital to a thriving civilization
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:32.800]   There was still a cultural faith a belief in that intricate web of value and association
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:35.680]   Drawing together diverse peoples and making them one
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:42.480]   Perhaps the greatest legacy of the Greeks was their belief in the goodness of what they were and what they had to give to the
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:48.400]   Rest of the world, but it was the Romans not the Greeks who ensured the survival of that intellectual heritage
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:56.400]   Underlying liberal learning and classical education the Romans created much of the intellectual tradition. We appeal to today
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:02.000]   Rome too had emerged with a massive confidence in the strength and integrity of that tradition
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.440]   Inherited from the Greeks and the Greeks had no doubts about their cultural superiority
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:11.680]   They could be skeptics, but they were not tormented by self-doubt
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:15.580]   Something new had entered the cosmos with them and they knew it
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:24.000]   later the Roman world was filled with many clashing nations the unity the Romans achieved out of that diversity is amazing to
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.280]   ponder as
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.160]   Maru has observed
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:31.360]   Unity could come only from sharing a single ideal a common attitude
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:39.120]   Towards the purpose of existence and the various means of attaining it in short from a common civilization or rather culture
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:42.980]   Fighting armies alone did not create this unity
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:47.240]   Unity was also engendered in those far-flung schools
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:53.400]   Early on in their history the Romans had no cultural center of gravity capable of attracting other peoples
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:17:02.320]   They had little to envy they were a rural people living close to the soil and deriving their ideals of virtuous action from it
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:09.200]   Although they would eventually dominate the Greek lands politically and militarily they knew of their cultural shortcomings
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:15.400]   Centuries passed before Romans could sport their own first-class literature and culture
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:19.720]   But even as they did they remained under the long shadows of Hellas
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:26.880]   Cicero once asked is there in fact a man among those Greeks who would credit one of the Romans with understanding?
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:33.760]   Rome assimilated Greek things the Roman poet Horace would one day famously concede
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:40.560]   Captive Greece took captive her savage conqueror and brought civilization to barbarous Latium
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:46.860]   The historian Arnold Toynbee wrote without exaggeration that the Romans were Greek cultures
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:50.840]   most celebrated converts and most effective disseminators and
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:54.880]   This conversion brought with it a profound linkage of the two cultures
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:59.960]   All educated people were to be versed in the treasures of both their languages
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:07.140]   Whereas the Greeks had learned only Greek the Romans went on to learn both Latin and Greek and the pattern was set
[01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:12.060]   To be a fully educated and culture aided man in the Greco-Roman world
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:14.480]   One had to know both tongues
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:20.480]   It was not Petrarch in the 14th century who first insisted on a mastery of both Latin and Greek
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:23.320]   Cicero did that over a thousand years before
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:31.120]   Quintilian later codified this proviso as holy writ promoting this formal bilingualism pragmatically
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:31.840]   I
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:36.840]   Prefer that a boy should begin learning with Greek because Latin being in general use
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:39.640]   Will be picked up by him whether we will or not
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:45.020]   While the fact that Latin is derived from Greek is a further reason for his being first instructed in the latter
[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:48.280]   this linguistic approach to acculturating
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:56.080]   Assimilating diverse peoples spread throughout the Roman provinces making the classical world a truly cosmopolitan one
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:59.920]   the learning of language leads to literature and
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:05.600]   Melding the high literary achievements of both the Greeks and the Romans helped to create a cultural unity
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:08.400]   Letters are the beginning of wisdom
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:11.960]   So one Greek Maxim had it with letters
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:18.840]   Standing for knowledge of language the ability to convey the complexity and subtlety of thought and sense with words
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:26.060]   the Hellenistic Age strengthened the consensus that mastery of language defined the highest reaches of cultivation as
[01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:31.300]   Maru has reminded us when we speak of classical education today
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:36.900]   We really mean Hellenistic education for it was during the Hellenistic Age
[01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:41.940]   Roughly from the death of Alexander in 322 to the first century BC
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:45.500]   That curricula throughout the Mediterranean congealed
[01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:53.140]   The word was in the ascendant the cultivated man was in a real sense the literary man the man of words
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:58.140]   It was during this period too that the conscious ideal of human perfection
[01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:02.820]   Made itself felt more widely as a culturally shaping force
[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:11.100]   One was moved Maru wrote to recreate oneself from unmolded clay and to produce from the childish
[01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:18.580]   Material and from the imperfectly formed creature one is born the man who is fully man whose ideal
[01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:20.740]   proportions one can just perceive
[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:26.300]   Such became every man's life work that one task worthy of a lifetime's devotion
[01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:29.740]   Living contemporaneously with Plato
[01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:33.740]   Isocrates might well be called the father of rhetorical or
[01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:38.820]   oratorical culture as opposed to philosophical culture
[01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:46.020]   It was Isocrates who had pressed the importance of one cohesive Hellenic culture in a multicultural age
[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:53.100]   Instructing people of his time that a culture must be built and maintained it does not materialize out of ether
[01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:59.980]   Images of building and tilling were native to his way of thinking for him culture was a matrix of conventions
[01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:01.820]   points of agreement
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:03.980]   delicately woven and easily torn apart
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:10.140]   Civilization itself emerges from a web of myriad laws written and unwritten
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:13.180]   creating unity out of disunity
[01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:15.660]   social cosmos out of chaos
[01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:21.660]   to live as an educated being in any higher culture is to act both as a builder of the house and
[01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:24.020]   as a weeder of the garden
[01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:32.700]   Isocrates thought we must do two things primarily as a people we must consolidate culture and we must educate our rulers
[01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:38.940]   We need rulers armed with a body of knowledge a basis for common discourse and common sentiment
[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:41.700]   creating again in Maru's words a
[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:47.900]   common devotion to a single ideal of human perfection from the fact that they had all received the same kind of
[01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:50.020]   upbringing devoted to the same end
[01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:52.980]   We need in a word an elite
[01:21:54.060 --> 01:22:00.460]   Reflexively disparaged today an elite to the Greeks and Romans was not only inevitable in a sound society
[01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:04.620]   But the desirable fruit of the highest thoughts words and deeds
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:08.700]   Thoughts words and deeds to which most of us are simply not equal
[01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:12.180]   Again, a high culture reaches upward to the better and best
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:19.380]   Distinctions arise. They are sought not derided as signs of intellectual and cultural health
[01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:28.220]   Isocrates carried the day and in a not too fanciful sense set Hellenistic and thus classical education on its way
[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:32.620]   He stamped the template. It was Isocrates
[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:37.460]   Significantly who gave traditional Western education its literary tenor
[01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:42.340]   Some wise or clever sophists could teach without writing a word
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:46.320]   Their thoughts and spirits be held forever through the prisms of others
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:49.140]   after Isocrates though
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:53.860]   Intellectual culture became scribal it depended on books written words
[01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:58.740]   Collections of which over time would form an authoritative list of best works
[01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:04.140]   Culture meant books because from books we learn about what is best
[01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:11.500]   William James once wrote epigrammatically that the purpose of education is to help us to know a good man when we see him
[01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:14.500]   Isocrates had some standards of his own
[01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:22.940]   What does the man know? How has that knowledge changed him? And how common is that knowledge to that which is held by other knowledgeable people?
[01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:29.540]   Discovering the books that that man had read would tell us much other expressions of culture fade away
[01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:31.740]   They're fragile
[01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:35.940]   But the artifacts of culture enduring the longest come adorned with words
[01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:43.660]   With those fleeting yet hard missiles of meaning that can keep alive a thought or feeling for millennia
[01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:47.060]   Sometimes a word is worth a thousand pictures
[01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:55.420]   We too keep our memories until very recently generations of American schoolchildren were made to memorize the Gettysburg Address
[01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:57.940]   mainly for two reasons
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:06.260]   One reason was the potency of the words themselves for the speech is a masterpiece of eloquent brevity. It has literary value
[01:24:06.260 --> 01:24:09.780]   But another reason was the belief that those words
[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:17.460]   Furnishing the minds of young people would confirm their citizenship serving as a living reminder of what their country stood for
[01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:21.180]   memorizing them made for better citizens
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:29.860]   Reflect on the fortunes and accidents which befall men and kings for if you are mindful of the past you will plan better for the future
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:32.980]   History keeps the tablets
[01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:35.180]   Tell me what eloquence
[01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:41.340]   Socrates had said could be more righteous or more just than one which praises our ancestors in a manner
[01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:44.460]   worthy of their excellence and of their achievements
[01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:50.380]   This routine wasn't just political. It was cultural it claimed an
[01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:55.340]   Inheritance for even then the idea was not just the free-thinking man
[01:24:55.340 --> 01:25:00.500]   but the truly cultured man one who had earned by knowledge and loyalty a
[01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:06.380]   Place within the ranks of those fit to be citizens and perhaps even a seat among the rulers
[01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:11.580]   Once again, are we reminded that one cannot be born into a culture of the higher kind
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:19.140]   Automatically equipped with all its watchwords and prerogatives one grows into it and is formed by it
[01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:25.820]   All of this is the stuff of humanistic culture if we wish to discover the genesis of the West's
[01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:32.240]   Civilizing ideal as well as the origins of classical education. We look more profitably perhaps to
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:34.700]   Isocrates than to Plato and Aristotle
[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:42.760]   For it is Isocrates who represents the original fountainhead of the whole great current of humanist scholarship
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:47.820]   He is the source as Werner Jaeger said of this humanistic culture
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:54.260]   calling attention to the preserved verbal artifacts of his day as both defining and
[01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:56.020]   informative
[01:25:56.020 --> 01:26:03.340]   He taught all who came after that anyone before he can be called civilized has to read his culture's books
[01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:08.300]   The curriculum of humane schooling began to take shape with Isocrates
[01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:13.180]   the idea of a canon arose for the first time that is a
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:20.740]   Body of written works acting as passwords to culture with which all of the educated were expected to be familiar
[01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:26.820]   Ideals became less idiosyncratic and more public for the Greeks and Romans both
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:31.320]   Education was essentially an initiation into the Greek way of life
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:39.540]   Molding the child and the adolescent in accordance with the national customs and submitting him to a particular style of living
[01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:42.800]   The style that distinguished man from the brutes
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:45.340]   Greeks from the barbarians
[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:52.140]   Theirs became a bookish culture and neither brutes nor barbarians can read
[01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:55.680]   here we see that a key purpose of education is a
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:58.460]   fundamentally conservative or
[01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:00.980]   preservative one
[01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:06.900]   education should preserve and transmit the past so that cultural memory is lengthened and
[01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:14.900]   So that descendants will not be left to rediscover human truths already endured and expressed by eloquent forebears
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:18.220]   this was the spirit of the Hellenistic age a
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:25.780]   Preservative epoch when men's aim everywhere was to keep poetry alive rather than to challenge the great masters
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:30.580]   Originality was not prized so much as reverence
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:33.820]   Great libraries were established at Rhodes
[01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:38.580]   Antioch and Pergamon the greatest one at the Greek city of Alexandria in Egypt
[01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:41.980]   containing hundreds of thousands of papyri rolls
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:46.400]   Philology the science of language was launched at Mytilene
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:51.780]   Textual criticism at Ephesus the Alexandrians put in place the rules of Greek
[01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:59.540]   Accentuation that continued to ease our reading of the texts men studied the admired works of the past and strove to imitate them
[01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:07.180]   Here in this period of assimilation the difference between learning for culture and learning for skills is most sharp
[01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:13.460]   It's not that the ancients cared nothing for practical skills or for what we call critical thinking
[01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:20.140]   But anyone systematically exposed to the best that's been thought and said will also analyze it
[01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:23.620]   Cutting his intellectual teeth on the minds that brought it forth
[01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:30.500]   Acquiring culture under this rigid regime though comes by the avenue of literary learning
[01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:35.180]   Universal agreement did not obtain on all vital matters
[01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:40.180]   Isocrates argued with some in the Socratic school over whether virtue can be taught entirely
[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:42.980]   Plato thought it could
[01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:44.820]   Isocrates did not
[01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:48.380]   Believing a sound judgment to be the proper and realistic aim
[01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:53.860]   The best one could hope to do is to point up the finest examples in the annals of virtuous thoughts and deeds
[01:28:53.860 --> 01:29:00.740]   Later the Roman philosopher Seneca took Isocrates side the teacher cannot instill virtue
[01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:02.740]   He can only prepare the mind for it
[01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:07.660]   Isocrates plan though best perpetuated the memory of culture
[01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:13.540]   It came to be called rhetorical as it aimed to train men who would lead people not by force
[01:29:13.540 --> 01:29:15.940]   but by moral suasion
[01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:18.380]   This was a new aristocracy
[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:25.300]   The aristoi of the knowing and eloquent the orators set out in turn to train
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:33.020]   Logographers writers of speeches it is speech after all that separates man from the beasts by speech
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:37.380]   Man is able to reflect and to relate his reflections
[01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:45.060]   The power of words suits him for a life lived sub specie a eternity tis for all time
[01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:53.660]   Knowledge was not for him a matter of Gnostic exclusivity, but the sum of contemplated experience and it was there to be told
[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:58.780]   One finds Isocrates said that among our public men who are living today
[01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:05.220]   those who give most study to the art of words are the best statesmen who come before you on the rostrum and
[01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:12.300]   Furthermore that among the ancients it was the greatest and the most illustrious orators who brought to the city most of her blessings
[01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:14.980]   the word reigned
[01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:20.580]   The Greeks and Romans not only gave birth to Western civilization
[01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:25.180]   They bequeathed to us their categories of thought and models of action
[01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:32.980]   They bestowed a vocabulary for the inquisitive and just mind they laid the foundations of culture and Jaeger's second fuller sense
[01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:38.660]   the conscious ideal of human perfection by defining more sharply the good life
[01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:44.380]   Worthy of a free man a man unfettered by servile obligations to other masters
[01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:51.260]   One who had been trained to use his mind by ordering his affections and by learning to ask the right questions of the world around him
[01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:56.540]   This man at once independent and civilized became the model of the humanist
[01:30:56.540 --> 01:31:00.620]   liberal education and its rational humanizing ideal
[01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:05.940]   Traces its roots back to the rocky soil of Attica and the straightways of Rome
[01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:12.460]   Man is an ideal forming animal wrote historian WG de Burgh
[01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:18.700]   stirred at every stage of his development by aspirations which transcend the level of his actual attainment and
[01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:24.380]   His civilization at any given epoch comprises also the world of his religious
[01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:31.740]   Moral and economic values his intellectual outlook upon life his personal beliefs as to his function and destiny
[01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:35.260]   His standards of moral goodness and social welfare
[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:42.080]   It is in the light of such ideals determining our conception of human progress that we distinguish civilization
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.300]   from barbarism
[01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:46.580]   or at least we used to
[01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:49.900]   Life is unknown and unknowable without
[01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:57.700]   Intellectual depth and despite the changes wrought by centuries the education of the free mind has changed little in form
[01:31:57.700 --> 01:31:59.940]   It has kept its anchorage
[01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:06.180]   Objectives have shifted through time man is the measure of all things in one century God in the next
[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:13.580]   Yet two elements of this cultural legacy one mental one material have been handed down to us in trust
[01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:18.940]   first the belief that the human mind is capable of apprehending the truth and
[01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:26.860]   Second though much was lost a solid corpus of ancient writing that has ensured the survival of classical learning
[01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:34.780]   It's all there for us to enjoy and pass on this heritage has kept before our eyes the habitual vision of greatness
[01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:42.500]   The beacon shines still though it flickers. We are not especially keen to preserve anything nowadays
[01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:49.860]   Culture is cheap. We're not completely degraded. We can only guess what the ancients might think of us
[01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:57.700]   With our rockets shooting off to moons planets and other pieces of celestial driftwood. We might assume their breathless wonder
[01:32:57.700 --> 01:32:59.300]   but
[01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:02.100]   Wh out and might have been on to something when he wrote that
[01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:09.340]   The bewildered comment of any fifth century Athenian upon our society from Dante's time till our own would surely be
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:13.860]   Yes, I can see all the works of a great civilization
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:19.940]   But why cannot I meet any civilized persons? I only encounter specialists
[01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:22.620]   artists who know nothing of science
[01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:25.220]   scientists who know nothing of art
[01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:27.700]   philosophers who have no interest in God
[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:30.540]   Priests who are unconcerned with politics
[01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:33.980]   politicians who only know other politicians
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:39.500]   For anyone who knows the Western tradition and the bright lights emanating from it down the centuries
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:42.420]   Oudens guess would seem as plausible as any other
[01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:48.660]   Somehow we are no longer large enough or whole enough to embrace so much of the world
[01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:53.060]   Diogenes Laertius writing in the third century AD
[01:33:53.060 --> 01:34:01.500]   celebrated the value of a civilization that exalts the feat of individual cultivation as the highest earthly attainment in
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:06.020]   his oft repeated tale of the Magaran philosopher Stilpo
[01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:08.140]   Demetrius
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:15.420]   Polyorsites wished to restore Stilpo's fortune after the pillage of Magara and he asked Stilpo to count up what he had lost
[01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:19.980]   Stilpo replied that he lacked nothing that had belonged to him before
[01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:28.020]   For he retained his culture his paideia and he was still clothed with learning and eloquence
[01:34:28.020 --> 01:34:30.220]   To see him through life
[01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:38.220]   Quiet confidence such as that our anxious age seeks in vain. It's an echo from a stronger
[01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:41.180]   clearer bracing age and
[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:43.700]   it haunts us our
[01:34:43.700 --> 01:34:47.660]   curious view that changing times must always alter or
[01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:55.260]   Overtake hard-won wisdom, of course would have amused a man like Stilpo who saw man's short
[01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:58.900]   sojourn on earth primarily as a time for cultivation
[01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:04.020]   We're here to tend our gardens. He would have looked quizzically upon any epoch
[01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:11.220]   Endlessly reinventing the wheel searching for happiness where better minds and spirits have already discovered. It cannot be found
[01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:15.620]   Stilpo might see in ours an accomplished world
[01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:23.100]   But not a wise one. He might see a comfortable people a smart and ingenious people
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:26.060]   but perhaps not a
[01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:28.660]   free people
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:31.660]   That reading was taken from
[01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:39.500]   Chapter one of the book called climbing Parnassus a new apology for Greek and Latin by author Tracy Lee Simmons
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:44.340]   The book was published in the year 2002 by ISI books
[01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:50.740]   The book itself is dedicated to making the argument as to why students should acquire
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:55.020]   The classical languages of Greek and Latin that's less my intent
[01:35:55.540 --> 01:36:01.340]   I'm not seeking to persuade you of that particular position rather to expose you to
[01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:07.340]   Some writers ideas on what is a good education
[01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:11.140]   One of my long-standing
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:14.700]   Frustrations with the term is that we don't ever
[01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:19.500]   Acknowledge that it needs to be defined very carefully. It needs to be discussed
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:22.340]   People will say oh my child is in a good school
[01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:26.740]   Great what is a good school? What does that mean?
[01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:30.100]   Right, or I want my children to get a good education
[01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:38.900]   agreed, but what is a good education and so by exposing you to some of the history of classical education and
[01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:40.900]   liberal arts education
[01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:45.500]   I'm hoping to inspire in you your own thinking and
[01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:50.540]   Contemplation upon the actual definition of a good education
[01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:55.380]   So that in the days to come as you're making decisions for your own children, you would know how to guide them
[01:36:55.380 --> 01:37:02.060]   Jack Cassie's la temporada de fiesta cien JCPenney tenemos de todo para ti tu familia
