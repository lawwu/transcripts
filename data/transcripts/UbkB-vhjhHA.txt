[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   You probably need to have multiple agents running in your head.
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.600]   So one agent is how do I play good chess?
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.760]   Second agent, how do I play not too good of chess?
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.720]   And third agent is how do I help Lex move correctly?
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.320]   Okay.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.640]   We have five minutes each.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.000]   Uh, it looks like I've got, you've given me white Lex, which is nice of you.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.920]   Uh, we'll, we'll start the clock.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.400]   So my clock's counting down.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.760]   Okay.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.600]   Non-standard.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.280]   The English opening, you know, I'm English, so I have to do that.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.480]   So, you know, you press the clock when you're, when you've done your move.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.680]   That's a good starting move.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.680]   Very solid Lex.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.840]   Oh, that's not good.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.080]   No, this is good.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.960]   This is very solid.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.400]   Okay.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.760]   We're quite far away from the, uh, from the board.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.720]   I'll press your clock for you.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.160]   Don't worry.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.440]   Are we far away from the English opening at this?
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.960]   No, this is a, this is a good line.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.840]   You're playing very, um, very standard.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.240]   You have to get used to the one.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.680]   They always do the funny thing where, uh,
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.640]   very nice.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.120]   You have to take, uh, you have to take notes of actually what move you've taken.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.600]   Yes.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.800]   Uh, yeah, that's a good, always a good plan.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.960]   Keeping the King safe.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.320]   I'm going to do the same.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.760]   Play very well so far.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.400]   We just, we just say, I mean, you made your mistakes at this point.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.280]   Nothing so far.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.760]   This is, I'm not gonna, I'm like, Oh, here's the Bishop Knight swap that we
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.880]   were talking about earlier, right?
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.640]   The tension you creating the tension in the creative tension in the game,
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.120]   the tension, relieving the tension.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.640]   Exactly.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.960]   All right.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.160]   Now it gets harder.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.360]   Now you have to come up with your middle game plan.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.200]   Would you say you did a very good opening, but you're in a, you're
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.000]   in a, you're in a fine position so far.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.160]   Very nice.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.640]   Very nice.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.440]   What's your strongest opener opening game or end game?
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.320]   Well, I would say probably the middle game middle game.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.160]   So this kind of, this kind of point.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.800]   Very good.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.400]   Very good.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.240]   Very aggressive.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.280]   Very aggressive.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.720]   Lex.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.000]   If I could sacrifice pieces, I really would.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.520]   That's not a good move.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.760]   Is it?
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.720]   No, that's a good move.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.120]   That's a very nice move.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.160]   Are you afraid of using the Queen?
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.400]   Yeah, the Queen, you know, you've got to be careful when you use the Queen.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.080]   I need to complicate the game a little bit for you.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.400]   You're doing too well.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.720]   Lex.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.560]   Oh, am I losing a piece here?
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.240]   No, you're not losing a piece.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.000]   You're doing okay.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.480]   Actually.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.680]   I'm going to take it anyway.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.600]   It's only a pawn.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.200]   It's how it starts.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.560]   Only a pawn.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.120]   That's how it starts, but it's only a pawn.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.600]   Very good.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.800]   This is not.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.400]   Still a pawn.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.080]   Only a pawn.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.760]   Sorry.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.080]   I have to.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.720]   I don't feel comfortable with you having a Queen on the board.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.560]   Takes the Queens off.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.360]   Less dangerous.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.680]   Makes you feel safer.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.840]   So now we're in the end game now.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.240]   So you're on better territory.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.720]   What's the definition of an end game?
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.160]   Well, the Queen's coming off is usually the beginning of the end game.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.360]   It's not the only part of the end game, but it's one bit of the end game.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.920]   See, that's a pretty cool idea what you've done there.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.000]   I'll take off your knight now.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.360]   I think the internet's going to disagree with that.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.360]   Now you see this is an interesting dynamic position with your Bishop and my
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.720]   knight, but my knight's in a good, good strong spot there.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.800]   So you're attacking the Bishop, my, the Bishop is not.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.240]   So what do I do with this Bishop?
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.640]   Maybe I need some other kind of way.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.080]   All right.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.720]   But then you're going to attack there.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.320]   I don't know.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.160]   I think I'm just running scared.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.960]   You're running scared now.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.880]   Fear can't run.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.320]   Can't run it.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.960]   Um, okay.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.280]   Yeah, that's not, is that, that's the only one.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.240]   All right.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.760]   It feels like there's not much to do here.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.320]   Well, you've got to, you have to have to come at something good here.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.240]   Oh boy.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.440]   And the time is running out.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.320]   Time's running out.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.080]   Escape.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.360]   That's a good escape for your King.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.480]   I'm going to come here now.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.680]   There's nothing else.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.560]   There's nothing else.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.320]   Take another, get another one of your Pawns.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.840]   I feel like there's some smart move that I'm totally missing.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.640]   That seems reasonable.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.080]   But I'm not going to take a second Pawn.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.000]   Okay.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.800]   That's what you mean?
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.520]   I'm going to go here.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.720]   Maybe just eat away at the, eat away at your stuff.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.480]   All right.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.200]   This is not, this is slowly, slowly constricting you.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.760]   It's like, you're going to take all your Pawns.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.000]   You play very well though.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.400]   Lex, you haven't made any major mistakes, but it's just slow, slow, slow death.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.280]   The internet, honestly, we'll very much disagree, but, um, let's see this.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.880]   A slow death is better than, than a fast death.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.640]   Embarrassing.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.200]   In the beginning, I said, didn't get checked.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.040]   Well, I'm going to go for it.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.720]   I'm going to go for it.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.360]   I'm going to go for it.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.000]   I'm going to go for it.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.560]   I'm going to go for it.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.080]   I'm going to go for it.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.600]   I'm going to go for it.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.080]   I'm going to go for it.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.880]   I didn't get checked in the first few minutes.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.360]   This feels very constrained.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.880]   You're very uncomfortable.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.480]   Constrained.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.840]   I feel like Alpha zero.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.400]   Um, is that, that would be the defined?
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.360]   Kind of controlled, uh, controlled end.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.600]   You know, the interesting thing is the willingness to sacrifice pieces by Alpha zero.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.560]   That's so beautiful.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.400]   It is beautiful.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.560]   See, so now I'm going to make use of all these Pawns I've taken.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:46.920]   Um, would you say your Alpha zero is much better than you?
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.160]   At sacrificing pieces?
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.560]   Oh yeah.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.080]   Intentionally.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.600]   I sometimes, you know, lose them by mistake, but Alpha zero is planning to lose them.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:01.080]   It feels extremely constraining.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.240]   How close are you to checkmate?
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.760]   Is there any way for me out of this?
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.360]   No, really?
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.600]   No.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.960]   So these pieces can't.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.360]   I'm getting basically all your pieces are getting constrained.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.360]   I'm just going to march these Pawns down here or bring this Rook to help out.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.120]   Okay.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.560]   So if I take this Knight with the Rook.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.480]   Yeah, you could do that.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.680]   That would be a final sort of hope.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.600]   My Knights, you see how strong my Knight's been in this game compared to your Bishop.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.840]   As we were talking earlier.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.480]   He's already done the damage.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.680]   Yeah.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.680]   It's done all the damage.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.360]   You can get rid of him now, but I think he's already, it's already done all the damage.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.680]   Oh, and my time ran out.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.760]   And your time ran out.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.880]   We're going to finish this anyway.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.880]   Finish the game anyway.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.480]   It's time ran out.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.800]   So you've lost once, but we can, we can lose two times.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.280]   Um, yeah.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.200]   Take that.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.440]   But now I'm going to get, take advantage of your back rank weakness.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.960]   Right.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.600]   And, uh, right.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.120]   And then this Pawn structure, and you're going to bring out the other Rook.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.000]   I'm going to bring the other Rook.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Finally going to swing the other Rook into the game.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.760]   Check.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.480]   I'm just going to keep writing.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.600]   How many moves would you estimate here?
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.760]   Uh, it's going to be about 10 from here.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.880]   I'm going to swap your Rook off.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.120]   Your final defensive piece.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.880]   I'm going to take.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.520]   Is that?
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.920]   No, that's, that's fine.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.960]   Well, you can, I'll check you here.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.040]   Oh,
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.920]   yeah.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.520]   And he's just marched that.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.200]   I'm going to march this Pawn to the end now.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.640]   Well, I think this is a good, you played well.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.600]   Honor to have been defeated so gracefully.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.000]   You played very, very well.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.880]   I was impressed.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.680]   I was impressed.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.880]   You, you did, you did great.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.080]   I didn't ask you, what do you think is the most beautiful thing you've seen?
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:50.880]   AlphaZero do?
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.520]   Oh, yes.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.080]   Personally.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:52.400]   Yes.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.680]   So there was actually.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.960]   The most beautiful game that I've seen AlphaZero plays is being dubbed the
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:03.880]   Immortals Zogzwang game by, uh, uh, Akadamato on the, one of YouTube, brilliant
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.520]   YouTube, uh, commentators.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:13.480]   Uh, uh, and he, it was, uh, AlphaZero playing Stockfish and, um, sacrificing
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.520]   a load of pieces to, uh, get Stockfish as all of the Stockfish's major pieces,
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.600]   Queen and two rooks stuck in the corner, basically seal them up like in a two.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.640]   And Zogzwang means, uh, that, uh, any move that the player makes will
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.080]   make their position worse.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.400]   And, um, it's never been done to Stockfish before and AlphaZero
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.520]   did it super elegantly.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.920]   Through sacrificing.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.960]   Sacrificing pieces.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.640]   It's a beautiful video online on it.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.600]   And thank you for giving me and signing this book.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:40.880]   Game.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.000]   You're welcome.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.200]   Uh, what's, what is the book?
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:50.000]   The book was written by, um, the British chess champion and, uh, and, uh,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.720]   woman international master, Natasha Reagan and Matthew Sadler.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.280]   Uh, and we get, I known them both for years, for my chess days as a kid.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:03.440]   And, um, when they heard about AlphaZero, uh, before we released it, they, they,
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.920]   they wanted to come in and try it out and we gave them full behind the scenes access
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.280]   to it.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:12.240]   And then, um, Matthew Sadler said to me, it's like discovering the notebooks of a,
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.120]   of a, of a hidden champion that no one knew about.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.760]   And he then wrote this book about all of the different ideas that AlphaZero had.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.360]   And the cool thing is in there, in that book, so this is, it's a chess book, but
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.520]   also the first few chapters about, about how we built AlphaZero, our journey towards
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:27.680]   it.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.240]   And then Magnus Carlsen was one of the first people we gave the book to.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:36.720]   And he, uh, he sort of publicly said it was very useful to him and he's incorporated a
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.240]   lot of the ideas into his own play.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.920]   The new ideas, you could say created by AlphaZero.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:42.000]   AlphaZero.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.560]   Tilex, a fellow explorer of the mysteries of the universe.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.320]   Demis, that, thank you so much.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:48.880]   You're very much.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.120]   Thank you for everything you do.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:55.120]   Thank you.
