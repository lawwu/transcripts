[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.040]   An unidentified woman who listens to the podcast writes in, "Pastor John, I had an abortion.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.720]   That is the one and only thing I knew I would never ever do, but I did it.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.160]   I can't begin to detail here the grief and damage it has caused me, and I know I deserve
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.960]   every bit of it.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.480]   I feel as though I will always be a low-class Christian because of what I've done.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.800]   I was a believer when I committed this sin, and I didn't do it to avoid disruption in
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.320]   my life but because I had no confidence that I could offer any quality of life to this
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.160]   child at the time.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.780]   In my twisted mind, I felt I was doing the child better by preventing him or her from
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.360]   having to suffer in a broken family or a foster home.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.200]   I understand that way of thinking is absurd.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.120]   I just didn't understand that at the time.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.360]   I grew up in a family that was split before I was born, and I feared that my child would
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.880]   have that kind of life.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.240]   I just couldn't handle the thought of this.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.680]   Now, I feel this is something I should always be punished for.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.840]   I haven't been back to church in the years since this happened.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.320]   I know I don't belong there.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.000]   I don't deserve to go.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.440]   I know I can be forgiven, but does God even want to forgive me for this?
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.380]   Does he want me and still have the plans for me that he did before?
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.800]   Or are those plans gone?
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.800]   I am disgusted with myself.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.240]   I just hope that there's still hope for me, which I know that even wanting that is selfish
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.680]   and unwarranted at this point.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:40.480]   When I hear this question that's so filled with self-recrimination and doubt and fear
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.080]   and guilt, I want very much to introduce this woman.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.080]   I wish I knew her name.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.800]   I could call her by name.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:57.280]   I want to introduce this woman to what I have for many years called gutsy guilt.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:07.800]   I base that term, gutsy guilt, on Micah, the prophet Micah, chapter 7, verses 8 and 9.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.560]   "Rejoice not over me, O my enemy.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.940]   When I fall, I shall rise.
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.120]   When I sit in darkness, the Lord will be a light to me.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.360]   I will bear the indignation of the Lord because I have sinned against him.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:33.560]   Until he pleads my cause and executes judgment for me, he will bring me out to the light.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.000]   I shall look upon his vindication."
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.240]   Micah owns his sin.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.040]   He owns his guilt.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.640]   And the fact that he's in darkness, he's sitting there, it's under the Lord.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.360]   The Lord is disciplining him.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.000]   He's under God's judgment.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.840]   He knows it's because of his sin.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.120]   He says, "I sit in darkness.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.920]   I will bear the indignation of the Lord because I have sinned."
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.760]   He's not making any excuses.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.800]   He's not pretending this is from the devil.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.400]   He knows this is from the Lord and it's awful.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.560]   So he owns his sin.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.560]   He owns his guilt.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.640]   And then he says that, "I will sit in this darkness under the Lord's displeasure until
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.800]   he pleads my cause and executes judgment for me."
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.400]   Not against me, for me.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.520]   "He will bring me out to the light.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.080]   I shall look upon his vindication."
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.160]   Now that's amazing.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.600]   This is incredibly gutsy.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.880]   I am under the Lord's dark judgment and I still trust him to be my God and vindicate
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.880]   me.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.120]   "So rejoice not over me, O my enemy.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.200]   When I fall, I shall rise."
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.520]   That's the only way I know how to survive as a saved sinner.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:07.080]   Real guilt, real sorrow, real pain, real darkness under God's discipline and real gutsy faith
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:14.880]   that the very God who is disciplining me and displeased with me is on my side and will
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.680]   vindicate me.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.360]   So that's the basic truth I'd love to build into her life.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.800]   And with that as a background, what I'd like to do, and I think might be helpful, is to
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:35.640]   just take, I don't know, maybe six or seven of her little statements about herself and
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.160]   make a comment about them.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.680]   Number one, "I feel this is something I should always be punished for."
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.120]   Well, yes, it is.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.440]   Abortion and every other sin is something we should always be punished for.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:00.760]   And there is a universe of difference between "should be punished for" and "will be punished
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.760]   for."
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.920]   Gutsy gospel guilt says, "I am guilty.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.000]   I should be punished now and forever."
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.960]   That is the very meaning of sin and justice.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.560]   And gutsy gospel guilt says, "But I will not be punished.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:26.000]   I will not be punished because Jesus bore my punishment for me.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.520]   And I have forsaken all my self-reliance and I throw myself wholly on his mercy."
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:40.280]   I think of Isaiah 53, 5, "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.280]   curse for us."
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.360]   Now that's Galatians 3, 13.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.640]   And then here's Isaiah 53, "He was pierced for our transgressions.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.960]   He was crushed for our iniquities.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.040]   Upon him, upon him was the punishment that brought us peace.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.760]   And with his wounds, we are healed."
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:03.160]   So yes, you should always be punished for your abortion.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.760]   Own that guilt and then be gutsy and embrace the gospel.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.460]   And that Christ bore our sins on his body, on the cross.
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.480]   And now in him, God is for me, not against me.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.520]   I should be punished and I won't be punished.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.080]   That's my response to that first comment.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.160]   Here's the second one.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.520]   I know I don't belong at church.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.600]   I don't deserve to go.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.080]   If the only people who belong at church are those who deserve to be with God's people
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.200]   in his presence, worshiping and growing in him, nobody would belong to church.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.720]   Nobody would go to church.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:51.960]   When Paul described the members of the church in Corinth, he listed their sins like this.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:07:02.320]   The sexually immoral, the idolaters, adulterers, men who practice homosexuality, thieves, greedy
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:09.080]   drunkards, revilers, swindlers, none of them will inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.240]   And such were some of you.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.040]   But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.040]   Jesus.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:27.160]   The only people who belong in church are sinners who are washed and justified by faith.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.160]   So no, you don't deserve to go to church.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:39.040]   That's why you should go, because church is the one institution in the universe designed
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.560]   for people who don't deserve to be there.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.920]   That's the meaning, that's the meaning of gospel churches.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.840]   Number three, I'm disgusted with myself.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.800]   Well that's fine.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:58.360]   To look back on abortion and not be disgusted would be a sign of sickness.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.040]   To see it with disgust is a sign of health.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:07.920]   Unless there is gutsy disgust, you'll collapse.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:13.080]   See, gospel disgust is not paralyzed.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:18.920]   It gives up on self and walks into the power of grace.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:28.400]   All of us are disgusting and we should not run from it, but through it into God's grace.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:34.160]   Number four, I just hope that there's still hope for me.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.320]   Good, because there is hope for you.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:44.160]   Paul says in Romans 15, "For everything in the scriptures is written so that sinners
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.680]   might have hope."
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:53.040]   Hope is the one thing you can always be sure pleases the Lord.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.560]   I love Psalm 147.11.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:02.600]   The Lord takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope in his steadfast love.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:08.880]   He loves people, he delights in people who turn away from themselves and hoping in the
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.880]   strength of the horse or the legs of a man and hope in him.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:20.200]   Number five, hoping that there is hope is selfish.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:29.720]   Well, it would be selfish if you just wanted to use God to get a relieved conscience.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:34.880]   But if you want forgiveness because you want God, that's not selfish.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.160]   That's what you were made for.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.000]   And it honors God, not you.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.160]   It honors God.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:46.760]   God is glorified when you want to be satisfied in God.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.520]   Number six, hoping that there's hope is unwarranted.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.000]   No, that's false.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.640]   That's just false.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.400]   Hope is not unwarranted.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:09.360]   It is infinitely warranted, but not by your goodness, but by the blood of Jesus.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:17.320]   If you stand before God and hope to get into his presence with joy forever, and he says
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:24.600]   this, "What warrant can you have for hoping that I would receive you?"
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:31.200]   The answer is the blood and righteousness of your son.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.520]   My Savior is my only warrant.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.960]   That's true.
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.720]   There is no warrant for hope in us.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.660]   There is infinite warrant in the blood of Jesus.
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.800]   So that's a false statement that your hope is unwarranted.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.320]   It is not unwarranted.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.880]   And here's the last statement.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:59.320]   Does God want me and have good plans for me?
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:04.840]   And the answer is in the last chapter of the Bible, as though God wanted it to be the last
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.440]   thing ringing in our ears.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.400]   Last chapter of the Bible, verse 17, Revelation 22.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:20.920]   The Spirit and the bride say to you, "Come, and let the one who is thirsty come.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:26.560]   Let the one who desires take the water of life without price."
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.400]   So if you're thirsty for God, he invites you.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.360]   He wants you.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.920]   And when you come to him, he has plans for you.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:42.440]   Your life will not be wasted if you come to him.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.840]   I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:52.600]   Plans for welfare, not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.600]   Amen.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.080]   Gutsy, gospel, guilt.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.360]   This is so very relevant for every single listener of this podcast.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.640]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that, and to the woman who was brave enough, really, to write
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.320]   it in and to share this story from her life.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:12.840]   We thank you for asking this question and for being honest with how you worded what
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.920]   you're struggling with.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.960]   This is the type of situation we address in the podcast.
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.640]   We deal with things honestly and with gospel hope.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.120]   And of course, we publish three times a week.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.040]   You can subscribe to our audio feeds to keep up with what we're talking about, and you
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.560]   can search our episode archive, even reach us by email with a difficult question you
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.800]   might be facing in life.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.160]   You can do all of that through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:40.960]   Well, we're going to break for the weekend, and we return on Monday to look at 1 Corinthians
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.800]   chapter 7, verse 5.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.960]   The passage says that a husband and wife should, quote, "not deprive one another except perhaps
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.600]   by agreement for a limited time that you may devote yourselves to prayer."
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.080]   End quote.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.800]   So a listener has a gutsy question from that passage.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:02.200]   Does that mean that a sex life can intrude on our prayer life?
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.200]   You've asked the question, and it's worth taking a closer look.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.200]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
