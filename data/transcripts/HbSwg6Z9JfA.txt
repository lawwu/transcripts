[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.040]   What is the secret to having an incredible vacation?
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.840]   Look, I've planned thousands of vacations for hundreds of people,
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.320]   and I'll tell you that it all boils down to one thing.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.400]   Is this trip choosing you or are you choosing this trip?
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.400]   And what do you mean by that?
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.080]   What I mean by that is how organized are you for the trip that you want to have?
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.120]   Is this something you've been dreaming about for years you've thought about?
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.880]   Or is this a spontaneous pop-up that maybe you didn't have planned for,
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.520]   but you're going to go on it anyway because the flight's worked out,
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.240]   or there's a great hotel, or you're going to stay with friends or
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.320]   whatever, and you're just going along for the ride?
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.600]   Are you in control?
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.080]   And have you planned this thing and you've been meticulous about it?
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.120]   Or are you deciding, "Oh, hey, this sounds fun. Let's go do this."
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.040]   When people set out to do something and they go accomplish that trip that they've been thinking
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.680]   about, dreaming about for years, whether it's a honeymoon or a bucket list trip or whatever,
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.960]   then it's incredible.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.520]   But there's also this openness for spontaneity and the opportunity that comes with, "Oh, yeah,
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.400]   this sounds like this could be pretty cool. Let's do this too."
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.720]   And that can be an incredible pathway too.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.320]   Now, look, both can be fraught with danger, and we'll talk today about
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.440]   some classic examples of where people fail in both those cases.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.160]   But as long as your mindset is open to, "Yeah, let's go plan and do this thing we've been
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.920]   dreaming about for years," or, "Oh, hey, this popped up. This looks cool. Let's go do this,
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.400]   and let's be open to it," you'll have a great time.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.480]   And so you have to know which one you're going into.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.840]   Exactly. And know how to handle both scenarios,
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.120]   because there's obviously very different levels of planning involved with both.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.280]   Okay. So I think let's start with someone who's trying to plan the trip, trying to be in control,
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.000]   but doesn't actually know what the trip is. Because the goal today is to walk people through,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.120]   I don't know, like a masterclass on how to plan a trip all the way from the beginning of,
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.080]   "Where do I want to go?" to booking things, to planning things, and actually what you do when
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.600]   you're there and what you need to know before. So that's what I want to accomplish.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.680]   Well, first, let's start with how are you organizing yourself? Because if you have
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.360]   that openness mindset to, "The world's my oyster. There's a blue sky out there.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.880]   I can go see anything," you have to start with organization to make sure that all the
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.720]   things you do want to do are captured in the right place. So for a lot of our clients that
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.360]   are the online folks, they're working with a Google Sheet, or they're working with a spreadsheet of
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.200]   some sort where their travel inspiration lives. They're sending themselves emails,
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.320]   they're tagging it in their inbox. Maybe they're saving things on Instagram or Pinterest or
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.560]   somewhere digitally that they can go back and reference and say, "Hey, this looks like a cool
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.200]   destination," or, "Hey, let's add this to our list." What we do with our clients is we check
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.880]   in with them on a quarterly basis. We say, "Hey, every 90 days, what else is on that list that we
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.800]   should be aware of?" Or, "What's popped up that's been inspiring to you?" Maybe your friends have
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.840]   been. Maybe you've seen it in a magazine that you're really excited about. For the analog people,
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.840]   people who are not so online, maybe they're a little older or older school, or maybe they just
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.480]   love to journal, we actually have a written list that folks will keep and keep prizing us of and
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.920]   letting us know, "Yeah, this is now on my list," or, "This is something exciting."
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.560]   So it first starts with organization. Writing down and keeping your inspirations in one place
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.160]   that you can reference, super important. Later on, we're chatting about something that I think is
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.920]   very important around organization, which is checking in with your organizational list,
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.960]   making sure that you're doing the things you want to do, that you've set out to do,
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.000]   and cross-referencing them, and then keeping notes on what you've done.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.640]   So I think if you can be digitally inclined and do things in Google Spreadsheets and set up your
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.280]   right digital organization to capture all of your inspiration and all of your notes,
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.120]   you're going to be great. Okay. But what if that organization
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.760]   expands so much? So I imagine there are people listening. They're like, "Okay. I saw a cool
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.320]   Instagram video about Japan. I want to go there. The Olympics are happening in Paris. I want to
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.240]   go there." And then all of a sudden, they've got a thousand things on their list. How do they start
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.440]   to think about, "Where should I take this next trip?" Or, "I've got some vacation this year.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.120]   Where should I go now?" Yeah. Great questions. So first,
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.880]   check in with yourself. What is that really inspiring, exciting trip for you and why?
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.120]   And write down the qualities of it, right? Olympics. I've always wanted to go to a major
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.200]   sporting event. I want to be where the people are. I want to do something really exciting.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.960]   Those characteristics of that trip, where the people are, exciting, sporting, those things
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.200]   are valuable and important to you. And maybe you look at Japan and you say, "Oh, I've always wanted
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.960]   to go to a cultural place with history and a deep connection to self," right? You circle those words
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.200]   and you say, "Okay. For this trip, I'm looking for more activity. So maybe I won't go to Japan now
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.800]   because I don't want to have the introspective, quiet, slower trip. I want to have the fast-paced,
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.800]   loud Paris trip for the Olympics." And so that's what decides you on this one. It doesn't mean
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.880]   you have to get rid of Japan altogether or say that any destination that would be introspective
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.720]   or slow isn't exciting for you. Instead, it's that, "Okay, this trip, this time is this experience.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.040]   And I know I can come back to this list and look for inspiration and the qualities I want for my
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.960]   next trip." Also, it's interesting to see as you gather all these destinations and you get all this
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.320]   inspiration, what is it that really does motivate you to travel and why, right? It's a nice check-in
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.880]   and this is why I recommend people do this on a 90-day, on a quarterly basis. But why do these
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.960]   destinations matter to you, right? What are the things you're seeing online, whether it's an
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.760]   Instagram or Pinterest or wherever your inspiration is, that's motivating you to say, "Hey, I want to
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.960]   go to this destination." And what does that mean for you? What's alive in you, right? When we plan
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.520]   trips for people, there are so many different levers or so many different reasons people are
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.640]   going to different destinations. And it could be the same destination but three different trips
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.600]   because they're going with different people, they're taking their kids, they're taking their
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.880]   parents, they're traveling to eat this time, next time they're going on a spa relaxation time where
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.080]   they don't want to eat at all. Who knows? So, it's interesting to see how those themes pop up
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.480]   for people. So, let's say someone's done some thinking about what kind of trip they want. They
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.440]   say, "I want a little bit of culture, but I want to do it a little bit slower. I need a relaxation.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.520]   I want to get away from work. So, I don't want it to be too high-paced." Lots of places out there,
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.720]   maybe they haven't set up this inspiration for years. Where can they go to start to get
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.360]   inspiration and how do they narrow the list down? Great question. So, the first thing is,
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.240]   talk to your friends. Talk to your social circle and see who's been places that might match those
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.840]   characteristics you're looking for. Get their feedback. What do they love? What do they not
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.320]   love? How do they do it? How do they plan it? Get an understanding of what has worked for other
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.160]   people that you know because you've got a great filter in knowing them. That's going to work for
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:18.400]   you. Second is, look at places like magazines, blogs, articles recently, and local papers,
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.160]   whatever it is that fit your style and see where the inspiration lies for you with them. Again,
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.120]   I love reading Rod Report or Travel and Leisure. Not all those destinations,
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.760]   not all those experiences they talk about match my style. So, I have a filter when I look at those
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:40.080]   media outlets to know that, okay, I'm learning here, but I'm not also applying every bit of
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:47.200]   knowledge to my own life. With those two filters and with friends, with media, and with online
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:52.960]   inspiration as well, and do be careful online because there's so much out there that you can
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:59.680]   learn about from blogs, from newsletters, from ChatGPT, which we'll talk about, that we have
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.840]   to take all that with a grain of salt. If you've been reading a blog for years and you know the
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:09.760]   style and the preferences of that traveler, then great. Apply that filter as well. But if not,
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.520]   maybe you want to be a little bit wary because you might be reading someone's experience,
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.920]   maybe they were paid to go there, maybe there's something else happening on the back end that
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:25.280]   you don't know about, and it might be tainting your kind of perspective trip. So, I say when
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.640]   you're reading media that you're not comfortable with or not familiar with, take it with a grain
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:36.080]   of salt because it's good for inspiration, good for fact-checking, but maybe not good for being
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.280]   the sole source of inspiration for you. So, with those filters, take a look back at your lists and
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.520]   the qualities that you're looking for for this trip and come up with a couple of concentric
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:51.600]   circles, right? This destination has the qualities I'm looking for, people I know, media I've read,
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.000]   talked about why this would work well for me. Great. Now I've got a destination, let me start
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.080]   planning. Let me start building some scaffolding around this trip and test it and see, is this the
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.320]   trip that I want to have? A couple of things you didn't mention that I'll flag that we've done. So,
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:11.600]   one, I really like the New York Times 52 places list. It's great. There's a couple publications
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.480]   that do an annual kind of inspiration gathering thing. If you're going to go somewhere this year,
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.360]   here are some great places. I like that for inspiration. If you have a region in mind,
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:28.560]   I think the first 20 pages of any Lonely Planet guide, they have the top 20 experiences or 30
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.000]   experiences or 15 experiences. And so, sometimes if you're like, "Oh, I'm thinking of going to
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.920]   Southeast Asia," go get the Lonely Planet Southeast Asia. And by the way, you don't
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:40.320]   have to buy it. Oftentimes, those pages are in the preview on Amazon before you buy it.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.280]   A lot of libraries let you have access to downloadable eBooks for free. So, that's one
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:51.120]   way I've gathered inspiration that we didn't mention. And the other is thinking about seasonality.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:56.640]   So, you mentioned what kind of trip do you want, the intersection of where might be fun.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:04.320]   So, maybe you decide that a Caribbean vacation is for you, but the only time you have off is in
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.640]   August. Right. North American summer in the Caribbean. Sounds like a dream. Yeah. So,
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:14.720]   how do you think about weather and seasonality when it comes to some of these things and going
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.920]   during the time when it's best or going during the time where it's maybe on the shoulder season?
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.920]   Yeah. Well, that comes back to the idea of, is this vacation choosing you or are you choosing
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:29.600]   it? Seasonality really plays very heavily into this. Sometimes we're time-bound by school years
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.880]   and other vacations where we really can't take off in that season that would be ideal to go in.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:40.560]   And sometimes, actually, we want to be traveling in shoulder seasons because pricing is lower,
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.800]   experiences might be more accessible, there might be just fewer people, and it might be better.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:52.320]   So, two things that I will chat about. One is those 52 lists, the top list,
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.880]   top 20 this year, whatever, are great lists to help you discover a destination to reinforce
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.760]   questions or ideas you might have around an inspiration. They're also very good at driving
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.240]   people this year and next year. So, if you find something that's really good on that list,
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:11.360]   maybe you might want to put it on your list for three years down the road. Let people come in,
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.520]   kind of cycle through, and then you can go check it out because it might be a little quieter
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.680]   seasonally to go two years later than it is to go this year or go next.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.600]   When it comes to seasonality, I tend to think that shoulder seasons are the best times to go
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.880]   places because A, fewer people, B, lower pricing, and C, you get sometimes even better weather or
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:36.640]   better experiences without having to deal with all the madness. Case in point, the Amalfi Coast.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:41.600]   As you've probably heard me say on this podcast before, I love Italy, I've been there so many
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:47.040]   times. I love the Amalfi Coast. It's truly incredible, but in July and August, it's a zoo.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:54.640]   It's crazy. In fact, it's so busy and nuts that many local Amalfitani leave the coast and go
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:00.000]   elsewhere and come back in September because it's just so overwhelming. So, you should do that too.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.160]   You should come back in September. Now, granted, if you've got a school schedule where you've got
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:10.320]   to be back in school August 20th and you have to be in Amalfi that summer, well, maybe you go in
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:16.800]   May. Another great shoulder season when crowds are a little slower and a little quieter, still busy,
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:23.120]   but great time to go. But September, October, perfect. Perfecto. Same thing in Rwanda. We were
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:28.800]   just in Rwanda in March. Traditionally, it's not a space or time of year to go because it's a lot
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.520]   rainier than the rest of the year, but for us, it was perfect. We were one of very few people
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.240]   out on the gorilla tracks those days and we had the gorillas all to ourselves. It just felt so
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.200]   magical to be in those misty mountains. Yes, there was rain, no doubt, but it was just us and the
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:49.200]   gorillas and the experience was much different than people I know who had been three weeks prior
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.400]   in February when they had hot, bright, sunny days and it was a zoo.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:59.040]   Also, pricing was a lot cheaper. Just going into March, we were actually able to save about half
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:04.320]   of the money we would have spent on permits for February just because of a seasonality program
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.480]   that the Rwandan government has. So, as you research these destinations and you look at
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:14.320]   seasonality and timing, think about where am I flexible and could I go a month later, a month
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.560]   earlier? Maybe I change the weather a little bit. I change the logistics a little bit,
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:23.760]   but I get a little bit better of an experience, maybe a lower price, maybe fewer people.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.840]   I like it. So, I put together a notion table where we put all the destinations that we wanted to go.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.960]   So, I filled them out. My wife, Amy, filled them out and we had a bunch of columns and I went in
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:38.240]   and I actually, with the help of Chat GPT, was kind of like, "Here's 20 places. Help me figure
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.560]   out when the prime season is for weather." Love it.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.640]   "Figure out the shoulder season." And we tagged, "Here are the seasons that are good for this
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.640]   place." And then she and I each ranked the destinations one to five.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.240]   Love your organization. I hope you'll share this in the notes here today.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.880]   Yeah. And then we had an average. So, now when we wanted to take a trip, we're like, "Oh,
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.160]   we're going to think about where to go in the summer." Well, we already looked at the
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:05.040]   30 or 40 places we want to go. Let's look at those places, filter by summer,
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.600]   sort by average rating for Amy and I. Love it.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.600]   And we have some sense of some inspiration. So, that's where we're collecting our inspiration.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.840]   And people always ask on the show like, "Oh, you talk about notion a lot. How do you use it?"
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:22.000]   That's one example of building a table that we can add to. And then each item in a table,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.160]   this is where I think Google Sheets lets down and a database wins, is that each item in that table
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:33.280]   might be called Italy or might be called the Amalfi Coast or Sweden. And then each item is a
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.680]   page. So, you can open that Sweden page. And go in-depth there.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.440]   And start clipping things to it and clipping things.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.520]   Totally. And if you use... There's a couple of
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.160]   notion bookmarklet tools or browser extensions. "Oh, here's a cool article. Send it there. Here's
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:49.360]   something. Send it here." And you start to gather all your ideas on an Italy page or a Sweden page,
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.800]   but that page is actually just part of a database of inspiration.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.640]   I love that. And let me add a couple other bits to that too, right? You can add additional
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:01.120]   filters on top of that because Amalfi might be great for you and Amy just by yourselves.
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.960]   But when you add in a couple of young toddlers or you add in older people,
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:09.680]   it may not be the great multi-generational destination you want it to be, right? So,
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.280]   you could say, "Here's a filter for kids. Here's a filter for my parents. Here's a filter for all
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:19.600]   of us together." Again, taking that same idea and other filters, what about how crowded you
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.840]   want things to be, right? If everybody else finds that it's a 4.5 to go to Amalfi in October,
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:30.320]   maybe you guys go in February and you're not going to the beach, you're not going on the water,
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.960]   but you're getting the true essence and the character of those towns because that's what
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.080]   you're looking for, right? So, those filters are really, really important.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:42.000]   One other item that I would call out is that you guys have gotten way advanced at this,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.960]   which I love, but check in with yourselves on that list. Right now, Japan might be super hot
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.920]   for you because everybody else has been there and all of your friends have been talking about it,
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:56.240]   and maybe you're really hunkering to go back, but maybe in a year Japan's lost its luster and
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.400]   Malaysia's the new thing for you. I don't know. Check in on it every quarter and see, "Is this
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.480]   rating still true to me and do I really want to do this?" It takes five minutes, but it just helps
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.040]   you guys check in with, "Okay, should a pop-up trip become available and now I can go here,
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.960]   do we actually want to do this?" Right? The last thing we'll say is chat GPT.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:19.520]   Big fan of accessible information at our fingertips. Double-check the validity of that
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:24.640]   information as often as possible. Maybe they said that March was a great season to go to Rwanda
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:29.520]   because the weather's not that bad. Yeah, the weather wasn't that bad, but the weather definitely
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:35.280]   was not as good as February or as good as June. You really want to double-check that
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:42.000]   what data you're getting out is actually valid for the purposes you want. We were looking at it a
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.600]   couple of weeks ago and said, "What are the best things people should do in Paris this summer for
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:50.240]   the Olympics?" They said, "Go inside Notre Dame." I was like, "Whoa, I'd love to do that too, but
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:55.920]   it's still under construction from the fire." Why are we getting this hallucination kind of data?
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:01.200]   Can you really validate everything you're getting from chat GPT?
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:08.640]   Or whatever AI tool you want to use. A couple of tips there. One, I tried to get specific data
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:14.640]   instead of opinion. Instead of saying, "Where should we go with good weather?" I said,
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:20.720]   "Can you give me the average highs and lows for these cities in this month?" Or, "What is the
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:27.360]   percent chance of rain in this month?" But still, we have this trip to Europe planned in the summer
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:32.160]   and we have no actual agenda. We just have flights. We'll get to that right after this about
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:39.840]   when the trip finds you. I said, "Where could we go that doesn't get warmer than 85?" We don't want
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.200]   to go somewhere where it's 90s in the summer. Humid and you're suffering.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.640]   Yeah. It might be fun for kids. And they
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.400]   came up with all these destinations. And then I was like, "What about Portugal?" And they're like,
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.520]   "Oh, that would be a great idea." But it's not a human. So I'm like, "Why did you put it on the
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:56.560]   list?" And they're like, "Oh, sorry. I'll add it now." And so sometimes I've found myself just
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:02.720]   asking after every response, "Are there any places you forgot about?" And unfortunately,
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:07.520]   90% of the time, it's like, "Well, yeah, here are three more." So you're right. You can't trust it.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:13.760]   However, I go back to people I know that don't fall into this optimizer's curse, which I do,
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.000]   and maybe you do a little bit less, which is they're like, "Oh, we want to take a trip.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.240]   Let's just go to Italy." They don't try to pick the best trip. And so I like timeboxing this,
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.480]   and it's something that we're working on. And I won't say we do a perfect job at it,
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.960]   but the idea being, "Okay, we're going to take a trip. And this week, we're going to figure out
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:37.280]   where we're going." And you know what? We have a lot of years and a lot of trips ahead of us.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.760]   But this one doesn't have to be the only one. And a friend of mine actually took a trip to,
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.040]   I think, Australia. And they'd always said, "We can't go to Australia because we need two weeks.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.840]   We need two weeks." And then finally, they're like, "Well, we have one week." They found a
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.480]   deal. They went. And they're like, "Yo, we can always go back if we need two weeks."
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:50.960]   Yeah. Totally.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:56.720]   And so every trip will be great if you aren't too stressed out planning it.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.200]   Agreed.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.440]   And I think sometimes we fall into that boat. In many cases, this trip is that
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:08.080]   because I think kids add this X factor where one day, your kids are super well-behaved,
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.640]   and you're like, "You know what? We should take them on this trip." And then the next day,
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:15.040]   you're like, "The kids are monsters." And you're like, "Are we biting off too much?"
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:20.320]   So if the trip found you, and you know where you're going because you've got these great flight
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.400]   deals, or if you've used one of these flight discovery tools we talked about to find this
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.480]   amazing idea, that's one case. The other case is you've decided where you're going,
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.400]   and you need to book the flight. And at the end of both of those scenarios,
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:37.440]   we're ready to start planning. So any quick tips on the, "I know where I want to go. I'm
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.440]   being intentional. I've got to book the flights that maybe we haven't covered before." Flights
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.960]   for my trip that I've decided is in Italy or is somewhere.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:51.360]   Yeah. Or sometimes there's a connection where maybe they'll have... In your connecting flight,
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.640]   they'll change the flight times. And now you have too short or too long of a connection
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:59.440]   or schedule change of any other sort, keep monitoring them. And what you can do is sign
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:04.400]   up for alerts from the airline to make sure that they notify you for every change that happens to
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.640]   your flight. But also you can use monitoring tools that are out there. TripIt has some of them.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.440]   Other tools have these automatic monitoring to make sure that you're getting the right flights
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.080]   and that changes don't occur. In terms of how else to book,
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.000]   I would always keep an eye on optimizing your flights to see if maybe the price you've paid
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.280]   does drop. With points and miles in particular, you can usually get a rebate back of whatever the
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:31.440]   flight difference is. You were very lucky this summer. I think you've booked flights for 45,000
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.440]   miles per person. That's incredible. You're probably not going to optimize around that.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:40.240]   But if you'd booked them for 120,000 and maybe flights on the same day had dropped to 45,
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.160]   you'd be getting that huge chunk of miles back. So you do want to keep searching or
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.560]   keep monitoring automatically with tools to see if there's an advantage to take there.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.720]   Yeah. And sometimes the same thing's true with fares. So TripIt's great as a monitoring tool.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.000]   It'll say, "Hey, the flight you booked has gone down in price. You should go rebook it."
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.680]   And then you can. Exactly.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:02.880]   And yes, now I might get a credit on whatever airline that was. And who knows how easy that
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.880]   credit will be to use. But it was free to get the credit. So might as well keep track. And we'll
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:12.800]   talk a little bit about organizing everything on a trip as we go. Any advice? This is a question
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:18.240]   from a listener who said, "When I'm planning these big trips, how do I think about layovers?
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.720]   And do I think about them differently than if I'm flying domestically and I have a sense of
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.800]   how travel works?" Yeah, that's a great question. So generally speaking, when you're flying from
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:31.440]   the States to Europe or to Asia, you're flying on the first segment on a very long-haul flight
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:35.280]   to a hub in that continent. And then from there, you're going to connect onwards.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:40.160]   So what's nice about landing in a hub is that if, God forbid, you did miss your connection because
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.480]   your inbound flight was delayed, generally speaking, from hub to endpoint, there are
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:49.600]   other flights that are out there. Awesome. What you may want to do when you've booked your flight
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:54.240]   is just double-check, okay, what would be the next flight if, for some reason, we were delayed by an
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.040]   hour and a half, we miss our two-hour connection, right? What's the next flight from Frankfurt
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:04.080]   onwards to Vienna, right? And then you can kind of have a sense for how many more flights there
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.040]   are that day or if you're going to end up sleeping in the Frankfurt airport that night.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:12.880]   Now, what I always like to do whenever I go into Europe or Asia, for this matter, is I like to have
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.360]   at least a two-hour layover. Why two hours? Because you're going to end up most likely having
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:23.360]   a clear immigration and you'll have probably to go through security again. Most European airports,
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:29.200]   a lot of Asian ones too, require another layer of security. And that's security without pre,
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.080]   without clear, whatever you're used to in an American security system, out the window.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:38.640]   Out the window. So get used to that. And also, you're going to be groggy. You may not have slept
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:43.680]   the last 10 hours. Your kids might be super grumpy. It's a bit of an experience. So don't make it too
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:48.800]   rushed for yourself. On the flip side, maybe you do want to pack in a really long layover. Maybe
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:54.080]   you want to spend eight hours in the Frankfurt area, not necessarily airport. What I would do
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:59.840]   in that case is leave my bags at the airport. There's a left luggage sort of compartment desk.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:05.120]   When you do pass through customs, you can leave your luggage there, your carry-on luggage,
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:09.200]   and then you can go explore the city and come back. And so last summer, our family flew to Europe and
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:15.040]   we actually did just that. We left our bags at the sort of checked baggage area in the Frankfurt
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:20.320]   airport, took the train, the U-Bahn into town, hung out, had a great little tour by ourselves
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:25.520]   of different districts of Frankfurt, had a wonderful meal, came back to the airport in time,
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.280]   got on our next flight. And so I would highly recommend that if you do have longer than let's
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.760]   say a four or five hour layover, take a look at what's in that area. Can you get into that town?
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.120]   Can you go explore before coming back to the airport and connecting onwards?
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:41.360]   The other thing you can do too if you have the budget for it and it's of interest is get a
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:46.880]   greeter. Oftentimes there are connection greeters. Amsterdam Schiphol airport, great example of this,
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:51.600]   it's only like 160 bucks to get a greeter. I think it goes up per person from there,
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.440]   not too much though. And that greeter will take you from your origination gate to your departing
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.760]   gate through all the formalities, security, whatever. There's a lounge, they'll give you
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:04.720]   access to that lounge as well. And it's a great way of taking what would be normally a stressful
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:11.200]   time and making it as stress-free as possible. So whatever you can do to make those layovers count,
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.440]   I would do it, but I wouldn't just disregard them. When you book your ticket, be intentional,
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:19.920]   check your backups, take a look at if you can extend your layover and make an experience out
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:25.440]   of it. Oftentimes, by the way, airlines will let you extend a layover up to about 24 hours without
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:30.800]   actually repricing your ticket. And some airlines, if you're flying through their hub, like if you're
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:35.360]   flying Emirates through Dubai or flying Iceland air through Reykjavik. Or Turkish through Istanbul.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.440]   They'll let you stay for days at a time without any extra fees. Might only be 24 hours, but it
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.280]   could be two or three days. Absolutely. And in those cases, by the way, it is useful to see,
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.600]   do I need a visa to enter the country even temporarily? In the case of Turkey, yes,
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:52.720]   but you'll go and experience something that you weren't counting on doing. If you're using Turkish
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.880]   to get from the States down to North Africa, well, all of a sudden now you have a great time
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.000]   spending 12 hours in Turkey. It's pretty awesome. It's a bonus.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.800]   Let's say the layover is pretty short and you don't see any other flights the rest of the day
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:09.760]   on the airline that you're flying or any of their partners, but you do see some cheap flights on
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:14.800]   other airlines that maybe are cheap now, three months out, six months out, but are probably not
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:20.880]   going to be cheap day of. Do you factor that in at all? Or are you only looking for other flights
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:27.200]   that day on the carrier you're flying? That's a great question. The unfortunate part is carriers
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:32.160]   who would then be responsible for rebooking you should there be a big delay. If they don't work
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:36.240]   with the other carriers, they don't care that there's other flights. Even though there are
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:40.400]   flights from Istanbul to wherever you might be going on other airlines that are not Turkish,
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.440]   if you flew Turkish into Istanbul and they were responsible for your delay,
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:50.560]   you're spending the night on Turkish time till the next day. You could, if you're just carrying on,
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:55.360]   you could risk buying your own last minute ticket and flying outbound and then maybe working with
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.960]   your credit card company later on to see if they'll reimburse for some of that, but Turkish won't.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:05.760]   Turkish would not do that at all, actually. Unfortunately, if it's a different carrier,
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:12.240]   they may not care. You may be able to get somebody at the Istanbul airline counter,
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:16.560]   the transfer desk, who would look upon you humanely and say, "Oh, you were just carrying
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:21.920]   on a bag and you're missing a wedding. We'll get you there," but I wouldn't always count on it.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:26.960]   It is helpful to look at that research ahead of time and know that you might be risking it a little
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:32.640]   bit. Maybe build in an extra bit of time if you can, a day on either side so that it's not like
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:37.680]   you're taking the last flight in and the first flight out. Yeah. One other option. If you're
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:42.640]   looking at these flights and there's three Lufthansa flights from Frankfurt to Amsterdam,
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.880]   wherever you're going, maybe you're fine. If there's not, maybe you add a little more buffer.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.640]   If you can't add a little more buffer, maybe that's where a greeter comes in to help make
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.080]   sure that goes smoothly. Absolutely.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:57.760]   If there are flights on another airline and it's not a discount airline that's not part
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:04.320]   of some airline alliance you can use points with, it's surprising that in some regions,
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:08.560]   the short regional flights can be very, very inexpensive. Yeah.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.880]   If you book those through a program with free cancellation, even better if it's a program you
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:18.160]   already have points on. Maybe if there is a really important thing and you're flying on Air France
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:22.400]   and you're flying through Paris and you're worried you're going to miss that connection to, let's say,
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:28.880]   Frankfurt or Munich, you could see if you can use United Points to book that flight later in the day
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.880]   knowing that you could cancel before, but it's really important to understand the cancellation
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.440]   rules. I will link to a post that someone else, not me, has written about all these cancellation
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:42.640]   rules because some airlines you can cancel 10 minutes before and some you cancel 24 hours before,
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:46.240]   but I think that's a decent option. Yeah.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:51.440]   The little hack here, though, is obviously if you're too late and you miss both those
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:56.640]   flights in air and you can't cancel it, that's a problem. I would say find someone on the ground.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.760]   Who can help you out. Give them your record, locator, itinerary number and say, "Hey,
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.840]   if you haven't heard from me before this plane takes off, just cancel it for me so I get my
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.160]   points back." Right. Well, the one other thing I'll call out there, too, is make sure you don't
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.160]   double book yourself on the same airline because if you have an Air France connecting flight from
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:17.840]   Paris and you book yourself a later flight from Paris on Air France or on KLM, they will cancel
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:21.120]   that flight for you because they see you as double booked and they don't want to do that.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:25.440]   They don't want to have a double booked passenger. So be creative, but not too creative.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:31.920]   Yes. Although I currently am double booked on a United flight, but one is booked through United
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:38.400]   and one is booked through Air Canada. And I did not put the same frequent flyer number in,
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.680]   but I did put the same birthday and they have not canceled either. So...
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:47.680]   Fingers crossed. I'm not... I knew there would be a risk doing this. So if I do get canceled,
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.960]   no one should feel... It's on you.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:54.960]   It's on me, but that sometimes works. Okay. So, all right. We've got some flight tips.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.680]   We figured out where we're going. For all intents and purposes, we now have a plan to where we're
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:05.760]   going for this trip. Let's talk a little bit about the itinerary because before you could go to book
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:11.520]   hotels, let's say you decided it is a summer vacation in France, you need to figure out where
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:17.840]   to go. Do you have a general rule of thumb on how many days to think about spending in a place?
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:23.680]   If you have two weeks, is that one destination, two, three, four? Is there a minimum?
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:28.640]   Well, Chris, I appreciate you asking that because so many people have this idea that they're going
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:33.760]   to go on a two-week holiday in Europe and they're going to see 16 things. And this has been their
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:38.480]   mindset, their vision for so long. They're going to go see all of Europe in two weeks. And I'm like,
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:42.240]   "Guys, you're going to be day three exhausted and you're going to hate yourself for having done
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:48.240]   this. So please don't do that." So I think it's really important to temper your expectations with
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:56.160]   the realism of what feels great. What is too much? What is just enough? Taking that and applying it
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:00.640]   to an actual real trip, we like to build a scaffolding for people. They have their flight
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:06.640]   in, their flight out. We know what their big purpose of going on this trip is. It's relaxation,
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:10.400]   it's seeing the sights, it's eating these meals, it's going to a Taylor Swift concert.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:15.920]   And then we put that centerpiece, that capstone somewhere in that trip. Everything else around
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:22.160]   that, we ask a few questions. How much activity and motion do you want to have? How many different
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:29.360]   things each day do you want to be doing? If you had to cut all of this out and just focus on one
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:33.760]   thing, what's the thing that matters the most? So as you look at this trip scaffolding and you
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:39.040]   figure out the amount of activity and the motion that you want to have, you then can start to slot
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:44.320]   in, "Okay, well, maybe I've been to Paris before. I've spent five days there in the past. Maybe I
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:48.960]   just need three days this time. And I'm okay splitting it up to do two days upon arrival
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:54.000]   and one day before departure so that I can get my bearings set when I land and I can
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   feel back into Paris. But then as soon as I'm set, I can scoot off and go somewhere else,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.280]   do the thing I want to do, come back to Paris the night before my flight to make sure that I'm not
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:09.200]   going to be freaking out about a 9 a.m. departure from Paris when I'm still two hours outside of
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:14.080]   town on the last day." So maybe that's the way that you feel like the motion and the movement
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:19.840]   could be right. But I like to have people draw this out on a piece of paper. "These are the days
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.760]   I'm in town. These are what I'm doing. This is the amount of motion. Does this feel right?"
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.280]   And ask themselves those questions. "Hey, I'm going to be spending three hours on the train
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:32.800]   this day. Do I really want to have a museum the moment I arrive and then go to a nice three
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:38.560]   Michelin star dinner?" That's a lot in one day. Maybe we chunk that out and now instead of
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:43.200]   spending two days in town, you're spending three because the next day you'll go to the museum and
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:49.040]   the final night you're there, you'll do the big Michelin star meal. So when people can see things
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:53.600]   visually, I think it really helps them. Adding things to a digital calendar, very important.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:57.680]   Putting it on a spreadsheet, day by day, breakfast, lunch, dinner, what are my activities,
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:04.000]   where am I going, super helpful. But scaffolding it out so that people know how much motion and
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.120]   activity, that matters the most. Yeah, when we look at itineraries, we do something similar.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:16.160]   And I think you often forget how much packing and traveling adds to the day. So you might be
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:21.200]   thinking, "Oh, we're just going from Paris to London. It's a short train ride." But that whole
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.560]   day is probably pretty close to written off because you wake up and you're like, "Well,
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:29.680]   now I want to make sure I'm all packed." And maybe this is different if you're a solo traveler and
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:36.560]   you just have a backpack. But when we have two kids, that day's gone. And so I try to make sure
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:41.200]   we're in each place for at least three nights. Because otherwise, as soon as you get there,
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:47.360]   you're starting to think about, "Now we got to go to this next place." And depending on the density
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:55.280]   of a destination, or how easy transportation is, might dictate whether you're taking on too much
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:59.760]   or not. In a place like Japan, where you could hop on a train and be somewhere. Or Europe,
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:04.880]   within a country, that's often true. Great. In a place where you've got to drive an hour to get to
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:10.800]   an airport, and then land, and then drive another. It could just feel like two destinations in two
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:18.240]   weeks is the max. Yeah. And honestly, if you're in Paris, it doesn't mean you can't take a day
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:22.160]   trip up to Normandy while you're there, right? Or you can't go out to Champagne for the afternoon.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:26.240]   It's a long day, a long afternoon, but you can do those things, right? And still return back
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.480]   to Paris and have a base there. You don't need to pick up and move every two days or three days.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:34.400]   And I think that's a common misconception for a lot of, especially North American travelers,
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.880]   is that if they have their two week vacation every year, and this is it, they got to pack it all in,
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:43.280]   they got to see everything. Scaffold your trip out, put it all out there and say,
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:46.640]   "What does seeing everything actually look like?" And then come back to me and we'll talk.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:51.520]   Yeah. And I've never actually been someone that's tried this, but let's say you rent an Airbnb in
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:56.320]   Paris for a week, or in Tokyo. You could choose anywhere in the world, it doesn't matter. And
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:01.520]   you've got this place for a week, or even two weeks. The savings you probably get booking
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:07.280]   something for that long probably would afford you the ability to even do a little overnight
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.160]   someplace. Totally.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:13.840]   So you could leave all the bags for your two week vacation in that place, pack a little overnight
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:20.240]   bag. Maybe more work with kids than not, but it could be a way to see a place that's maybe a
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:26.320]   little too far for a day trip, but not feel like you're having to pack it all up and move. And I
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:31.040]   know people have done this, we have not done this, but it's something that I think might be in the
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:36.400]   future, especially when kids are out of diapers, able to carry their own bags, not sleeping in
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:40.080]   cribs. Yeah. We do this all the time ourselves, and we do it for our clients obviously too,
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:43.840]   where you have a home base and then you explore for that night or two nights even. I'm going to
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:49.040]   be in Europe later this summer and we're going to take a 48 hour trip from our rented apartment up
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:53.920]   to Switzerland and then we'll come back. And it's great to be able to literally take a backpack
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:58.000]   with us and that's it. You have everything you need contained for the next 48 hours in that
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.600]   backpack. And you don't have to worry about schlepping everything, unpacking, repacking,
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:06.880]   ah, it's just simple, right? So highly recommend it. Yes. Are we paying for two hotel rooms for
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.880]   the same night? In essence, we are, right? Because we've got our hotel in Switzerland and we've got
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:16.240]   our rented apartment in Europe or in Italy, but it's worth it. It's great. Once you've figured
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:19.280]   out where you want to go and you're starting to book things, in the U.S. it might be more
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.800]   straightforward sometimes where it's like, well, you just go look online. There's lots of sites
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:27.680]   that have hotels. Does that apply everywhere else in the world? Or are there places where
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:33.680]   looking for a place to stay isn't as simple as going to booking.com, Google hotel search?
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:40.080]   Sure. I think when you look at the big booking engines like booking.com, Expedia, Airbnb,
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:44.480]   others, hotels.com, they've done a great job of trying to gobble up most of the available
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:51.440]   inventory that's out there for rent in private homes, apartments, etc. throughout these cities.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:56.160]   So when you're looking online on those sites, you're probably going to find most of what's
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:01.120]   out there. I think the question and sort of hack angle here is, are you getting the best deal by
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:06.320]   looking on those sites? Oftentimes, I've found that if I actually find a suitable accommodation
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:12.160]   and I either Google the name of that accommodation and do a reverse image search to find if they have
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:17.360]   got their own website for that villa or that apartment, or if they're managed by an apartment
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:22.400]   rental company, if I can find that rental company, or even find sometimes that the hotels themselves
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:28.560]   are directly bookable and they're cheaper. If I just book on their website, I can save some bucks.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:33.280]   And so I definitely do that and highly recommend that for our clients. What you're also asking
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:40.480]   about is, are there like hyper-regional Paris apartment rentals in the 14th that you can just
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:45.520]   find a website dedicated to that? And the answer is yes, there are. There's rental agencies that
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:51.680]   specialize in certain areas, certain neighborhoods, and those guys usually will have a website that
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:57.920]   will catalog what's available for them, but they may not be in English or they may not be consumer
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:03.200]   friendly to a North American audience. So it's worth doing your diligence and understanding,
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:07.680]   am I getting the best deal? Am I in the right area? Is there a specialist who just focuses in
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:14.000]   on this area? Where we go in Northern Italy often, there's a little real estate agency,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:20.160]   basically, that has summer rentals for Italians. And so we negotiate directly with them on what
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:26.320]   apartments are available through them. And they send us Airbnb-like listings for their apartments.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:30.640]   It's all in Italian and we sort of negotiate it and figure it out.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.600]   And would those have shown up on Booking.com if you've looked?
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:39.520]   They might have. In fact, that agency is listed on Booking.com. The pricing is a lot higher and
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:44.320]   the terms and conditions are very different. So I wouldn't recommend booking there unless that was
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:50.080]   the sort of safest and easiest thing for you. We're fine navigating and negotiating in Italian.
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:54.960]   Not everybody can do that or not everybody wants to do that. So Booking.com is a great
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.040]   avenue for that. But if you're willing to sort of noodle around, especially in Paris,
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:03.280]   especially in some other European cities where neighborhoods really, really matter,
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:07.760]   Madrid is one of them, there's local real estate agencies that can help with this.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.520]   That are going to be a better deal going direct.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:13.120]   Yeah. And again, I wouldn't do it for a three-night stay or maybe even a week-long stay,
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:17.920]   but a multi-week, month-long, etc. stay, absolutely.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:24.000]   Okay. And then we've also covered, just like on flights, hotel points, deals. Similarly,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.880]   lots of alerting tools, lots of search tools that we've covered in past episodes. And like flights,
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:36.640]   keep an eye on it. A lot of hotels and flights have pretty flexible cancellation policies.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.560]   I know it can give a little bit of anxiety when you think, "Okay,
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:45.360]   we haven't fully committed." So I'd encourage people to say, "No, we're committed to this."
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:50.400]   Right. And turn off the alerts for things that you're not so excited about that it would be an
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.520]   easy switch. Right.
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:55.680]   Because what you don't want is here are three okay hotels. You picked the one that was available or
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:00.480]   the best deal. And then the other one's a similar deal. And now you're like looking at the nuance
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:04.080]   of, "Oh, what kind of soap do they use in the shower?" Or like, "What hours is the breakfast
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:07.280]   open?" And you're kind of reviews of the breakfast and like, "Oh, the croissants were stale this
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:12.960]   morning." Yeah. Now you're back at the optimizer's curse. But if you're looking for points in a city
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:20.720]   and you've booked a standard double tree hotel, and you've got your eye on an amazing deal using
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:25.120]   your Hilton free nights at a Waldorf, and that pops up, no brainer.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:25.760]   Scoop it. Yeah.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:29.920]   Take it. Well, one of the things they'll say that's a pitfall around this optimizer's curse
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:34.560]   and holding options is that people often forget to cancel the things they've booked
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.640]   as a hedge or sort of as a backup. And so I would do whatever you can in your scaffolding,
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:42.560]   in your remindering of yourself, in your calendaring to make sure that you know that,
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:46.480]   "Okay, if July 30th is the last date, you can cancel this." Like cancel on the 28th just to
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:50.400]   be safest, right? You've got time zone differences, all that. Because the last thing you want is to
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:55.200]   have to beg your way out of a hotel booking or to have it be non-refundable and you're in trouble.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:58.560]   So set yourself alerts and reminders for that.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:02.400]   You joined me for episode one and we talked about this email path.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:06.480]   For anyone who hasn't been here for all the years,
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.720]   what do you like to do every time you have a hotel book?
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:12.880]   Well, I want to introduce myself. I want to let the hotel know who I am and why I'm staying there,
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:18.000]   how long I intend to come in. Maybe I'm checking in the first thing in the morning once my flight
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.440]   lands and I booked for the, of course, afternoon. They're not expecting me at 9.30 AM, but I'd love
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:28.320]   to get in there, right? So I want to let them know, "Hey, I'm Chris, traveling with my wife,
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:31.760]   Amy. Here are our kids. We're coming in from a red-eye. We're going to hopefully sleep on the
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.520]   plane, but we'll be exhausted by the time we get there. We know we will. Any chance you could let
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:40.160]   us in? By the way, yes, there are four of us and here's how we normally do bedding in our rooms.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:44.480]   Would it be possible if we need to adjust the reservation, if there's a $50 a night rollaway
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:50.160]   fee, whatever, please let me know." Explain more about your family, who you are, what are you doing
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:53.680]   in town, right? "Well, the day we arrive, we're going to be exhausted. We're going to take a nap.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:57.920]   We want to take a shower. We'd love to have a 5 PM dinner, even though they don't do dinner in
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:02.160]   5 PM in Europe, but we'll be exhausted. Is there any way you can help us out with a reservation
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:07.840]   at the bar or at the downstairs restaurant? The next day we're going to Montmartre. We'll be up
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:13.600]   at 7.00. Is breakfast served at 7.30?" Whatever the questions are you want to ask, ask them there.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:18.720]   Give that hotel all that information they need to know about you to make your stay there special.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:22.880]   Why does that matter? Because this is their shot to shine, right? They want to really make
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:27.200]   your stay dazzle. And if they do, they know that you're going to come back, you're going to go
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:31.680]   home and tell friends. So that's their whole goal for while you're there. So the more information
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:35.360]   you can give them, the more responsive they can be to that information and take better care of you.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:40.400]   So I would highly recommend emailing them ahead of time. Then I'd recommend a couple of days prior
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:44.880]   to your arrival, re-emailing them in case anything's changed. Plans do change, right?
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:50.880]   "Hey, our youngest has been a little snotty lately. So we might need a local pharmacy."
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:57.840]   Just alerting your concierge just in case, right? Or, "Hey, we really love... Our five-year-old's
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:02.000]   into giraffes. Can you put a giraffe balloon in the room when we get there? I've seen it all."
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.440]   Whatever. But let the hotel know who you are and how they can make your stay special.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:12.160]   And you'll see it's night and day what happens. Yeah. I would say of the listeners that have
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:18.400]   written in, 50-plus percent at something happening. Someone's gone and said, "Oh,
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:22.000]   it's my daughter's birthday." And there was a massive birthday celebration. "Oh,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.520]   we're celebrating this thing. There was an upgrade." Someone had their initials monogrammed
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:31.760]   on pillows. Right. Thought that was a bit strange. But they do it. They do it sometimes.
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:36.000]   And it's memorable and they share that experience. And that's what the hotel wants you to do. So
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.560]   empower them to help you. Great. And you talked about the concierge. Let's talk about
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:46.240]   what you do when you're in a place. Yeah. You're now decided, "OK, we've got our hotel. We've got
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:51.920]   our scaffolding. We know we're going to spend four days, Tokyo, Paris, Cartagena, wherever it is in
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:57.520]   the world." How do you start to fill out the day and make sure you're doing the most but not
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:01.440]   overwhelming yourself? Yeah. So I think it goes back to that mindset. Right. And using that as
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:05.920]   the ultimate filter of what is it that we want to accomplish on this trip in this place. By the way,
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.600]   your stay in Paris may be very different from your stay out on the beach. Right.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:15.600]   And so noting that ahead of time and optimizing for that is really important. Then I'd go back
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:18.800]   to that concierge if you're staying at a hotel. Right. And go back to that concierge and say,
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:23.440]   "Hey, you know, we're in Paris for three nights. We want to have an action-packed three days here.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:27.520]   What do you recommend? Here's our family profile, as you know. What do you recommend we do? Can you
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:31.440]   give me some sample itineraries that other families have done that you've helped them with?
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:36.480]   We will review that itinerary and we'll come back to you with the areas that we want you to help us
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:42.320]   reserve, whether it's museums or car services or whatever. Right. So that's one avenue to do it.
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:48.320]   Second is to take a look at literally Googling child-friendly activities Paris. Right. Or like,
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:52.320]   is the Musée d'Orsay the best for a five-year-old? Like those kinds of questions,
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:56.000]   Google and chat GPT. Of course, your friends can help inform that as well.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.840]   But I think when you start with the mindset, you apply it to the scaffolding of your trip and you
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:07.040]   say, "These are the amounts of activity each day that I want to have. And these are the key
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:12.400]   capstones in each day that I want to have." I like to look at it as one key activity per day,
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:17.280]   one museum visit, one meal, one whatever it is that you're trying to accomplish for that day.
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:23.520]   And then build kind of the day around that. So maybe you've got Musée d'Orsay tickets at 11
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:28.880]   a.m. Maybe your hotel is an hour walk away from the museum or a 15-minute metro ride.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:34.640]   Take the hour walk, right? Enjoy walking through town and make that hour walk an hour and a half.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:39.760]   So now you know you have to leave at 9.15 because you want to beat the museum 15 minutes early to
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:45.040]   make sure you're in there on time, in case of security lines, whatever. So that's now your
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:49.040]   morning activity leading up into the museum. Or maybe you know that your kids are terrible
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:54.400]   getting out the house in the morning and you need to budget some extra time. So what you want to do
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:45:00.240]   is optimize for metro there, walking back. And maybe along the walking path on the way back,
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:05.440]   you'll stop for lunch and you'll enjoy yourselves. So we apply a little different version of this to
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:10.880]   whenever we plan Japan because people who go to Japan always want to go to the Toyosu fish market
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:16.400]   and they want to be up at 5 in the morning to go see the 4 in the morning to go see the auction
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:22.560]   activity. When you fly from the U.S. to Japan, you end up having the first night that you're in town.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:26.800]   You usually go to bed right as you get there and you wake up at the crack of dawn because
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:31.920]   your body is still all jet lagged. One of the things we do is we book that Toyosu fish market
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:36.160]   for either the first or the second day you're in Japan. And we make sure that that's built
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:40.800]   into your itinerary as your capstone that day. And that kind of the rest of the day is at leisure or
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:45.680]   chill because you'll come home, you'll want to have a little nap, you'll have a nice lunch.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:50.240]   Maybe you'll go to a park in the afternoon and that'll be your day. Right. So we try to use
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:57.200]   logistics and that scaffolding intelligently for what that traveler experience is going to be.
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:02.800]   And again, not packing too much into one day. You don't want to go to Toyosu and then,
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:07.680]   you know, a shrine right after that, and then a big market tour in the afternoon,
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:10.880]   and then go to a giant three mission star meal that evening. You'll be exhausted.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:16.480]   Right. Dorset with kids. That's your activity for the day. You're walking around parks,
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:20.080]   walking around neighborhoods, you're doing some shopping, some eating. That's your day.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:25.760]   And where do you go to find some of these things that aren't as obvious as, you know, a museum,
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:31.440]   you could just book tickets online. But whether it's an experience, a tour, how do you think about
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:39.600]   sites like Airbnb Experiences, Viator, and any other ones as avenues to find things to do?
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:43.920]   Yeah, I love them. I mean, look, I think Airbnb Experiences is a really interesting marketplace.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:48.080]   Sort of currently they've paused it. It's still active. You can book things,
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:52.480]   but they're not adding a lot of inventory to that space just yet. But I think that will be
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:47:00.240]   a very big arena for them to play in. Viator is great because if you can think of a tour,
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:04.640]   Viator probably has it in that city. And so you can know, okay, this is a thing to do,
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:08.800]   or maybe not to do. You can also read great reviews on the tour guide or that experience
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:13.840]   from other people. If you're totally blue sky and new to a city and you're trying to plan it out,
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:20.960]   I like to look at context tours. They're an amazingly sort of higher range, both
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:28.320]   private as well as small group tour. And they tend to have the sort of more specialist tours
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:33.520]   in each town. And they give you a really good sense of how much time I'll need in this town,
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:40.960]   right? So they might have the same experience sort of across seven or eight different of their tours.
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:45.120]   So you kind of know, okay, this is one thing I have to experience while I'm there. Or it might
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:48.880]   be not that exciting to you and you're like, well, I want to do everything that doesn't include that
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:54.800]   piece, right? And you don't have to book a context tour. At all. But use them as a good curated
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:48:01.120]   tour site. Correct. Correct. And I would say on the whole, we've never had a client book a context
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:05.120]   tour and be like, "Oh, this is terrible." People are really appreciative of the experience,
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:10.160]   the knowledge of those guides, et cetera. So it's actually a great resource to use to study,
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:14.320]   but also if you did want to splurge for one, it's great to do as well.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:18.000]   Yeah. We've definitely booked some, I can't remember all the sites. There was
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.640]   one that was like show around. There was one where it was like individual tour marketplaces.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:25.760]   I remember we went to Greece and we went to the Acropolis and we went on this tour and we thought,
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:31.680]   "Oh, it'd be cool to get a little history." But this was like the driest, most boring history
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:35.760]   tour ever. That's tough. And it's hot. And I think there are some people who would really want that.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:41.680]   That wasn't us. And I think just trying to figure out what it is you're looking for
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:46.720]   in the tour versus it being the highest rated might apply the same lessons you said. Make sure
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:54.240]   you know what you want out of this. But I do love the experience of booking a local... If you find
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:49:00.880]   marketplaces for things like that, you remove the middleman, maybe get a better deal, but a little
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:05.040]   bit of a mixed bag sometimes. Well, I think for the key things that are the most important ones
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:11.280]   for your trip, those capstone events each day, if you don't have a confident feeling that this is
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:15.280]   the place I want to go, I want to go to Context or I want to go to Viator, go to your hotel concierge
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:21.120]   if you have one and ask them and say, "Look, I'm looking for a young person who will guide me
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:25.440]   through the local markets as a local person. I don't want to go to a tourist market. I want to
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:29.040]   go to the vintage market and I want to have somebody who knows the vintage market walk me
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:35.120]   through." Who do you know? And just ask them for a bio on that tour guide. Confirm the availability
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:40.160]   of that person. But understand who would it be who'd be walking me through this experience and
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:44.880]   am I willing to pay for that? And if you are, then scoop it up through whichever channel you can get.
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:49.920]   The last thing you want is to go on a generic, boring, dry, tasteless tour where that's your
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:55.040]   capstone of the day and that's the thing you came to do in that town. So I pay keen attention to
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:00.400]   that. When we fill out the scaffolding for people, we highlight and circle what's the most important
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:04.640]   thing they're doing that day and how do we make sure it's a success and then everything else from
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:10.720]   there flows. I wouldn't recommend this for children or at least young children. But the
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:16.640]   free walking tours in almost every city are so good. I don't think we've ever been on one we
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:23.280]   didn't enjoy. They are all free. And then, of course, work for tips. So you really have to be
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:27.440]   good in order to make money doing it. Otherwise, you wouldn't be doing it. And so I love that
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:32.640]   they are not usually private. So the challenge there is if you bring kids and they want to slow
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:38.800]   down or take a break, you're kind of you're kind of lost. But I highly recommend free walking tours.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:43.280]   I imagine almost any city in the world, you type city name, free walking tour, and you will find
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:49.520]   it. And they run almost every day, multiple times a day in some cases. I love doing that on the
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:55.040]   first day. Yeah, because you often get a good sense of what is this city? What is a local like
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:51:01.680]   what's going on? You know that it's a pretty low key activity. Yeah. So that's something we do a
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:06.160]   lot. Well, and also, if you know that you connect with that vibe of that tour guide, then you can
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:10.240]   ask them at the end of that tour. Hey, listen, we're looking for like these things these next
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:13.920]   couple of days. What would you recommend? What's the best park for kids? What's the best place for
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:17.840]   us to go buy X, Y and Z? Hey, we want to really mellow restaurant tonight. What do you recommend?
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:22.720]   And they have the answers to that. Right. What's also great is that you can then amplify that to
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:28.160]   your friends and family and your social crowd. So as you post a selfie with them on Instagram tag,
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:32.640]   you know, Stanislaus touring me around Warsaw today was the most amazing guy X, Y, Z. Here's
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:37.040]   his Instagram handle. Right. And now when people are knowing in the future, they're going to put
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:40.000]   that in their travel inspiration folder. They're going to read it to Stanislaus to be like, when
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.200]   are you touring? I want to tour with you. Right. Happens all the time. Love that. I also think
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:53.600]   one thing that has been interesting is. Short form video on the Internet for long form activities
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:58.320]   can be a little deceptive, and so it's interesting because we're planning this trip to Iceland for
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:03.840]   listeners, and I remember planning the entire thing with Brandon, who's the tour guide and who
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:08.000]   I interviewed on an episode about Iceland. And I would find these videos. I'm like, well, this looks
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   really cool. Like we get to go inside a volcano. Like, why are we doing this? And he's like, you
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.200]   just watched the like 30 second video of it. He's like, why don't you go look on YouTube and find
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:23.440]   someone who painstakingly took a GoPro on like this long version of the entire adventure? And
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:28.160]   you'll be like, that wasn't actually that exciting. And so as much as some of the content can be
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:33.920]   boring, there seems to be no shortage of people who have recorded every second of almost every
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:39.760]   activity in every city. It's true. And you will find that some activities might have made your
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:46.720]   inspiration list in a one minute clip. And then when you watch the 10 minute, 20 minute, 45 minute,
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:51.040]   90 minute version, you're like, that's not how I want to spend my day. So when it comes to
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:56.880]   inspiration for activities, YouTube has a lot of good options that cover a little bit longer form.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:01.680]   Sometimes people share their highlights, and I found it really easy to quickly be like, actually,
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:05.280]   I don't want to do that. Yeah, I do want to do that. Totally. And that's important in this sort
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:10.080]   of like mood board for your trip. Put a negative space in there where you're like, I would really
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:15.520]   like to avoid these things. I don't want to go to St. Mark's Square in the middle of the day when
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:20.160]   50,000 people are there, and it's a zoo, and I'm just claustrophobic and agoraphobic at the same
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:26.320]   time, and it's too much. But I do want to go at 11 o'clock at night when there's a tango musician
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:29.840]   playing, and there's somebody dancing, and it's quiet, and there's pigeons, and me, and the sea.
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:35.200]   By the way, you may want the exact opposite of that. You may want to go see All Colors of Life
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:42.720]   showing up to check out midday St. Mark's. Who knows? But put that out there. Circle what you
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:46.560]   do and don't want to do, and make sure you come back to that as you finalize your trip plans.
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:51.920]   And you said this, though not explicitly, the wandering and getting lost in a city
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:58.240]   is so incredible. Yeah. Even in a small little village, right? That's where you see the true
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:03.600]   essence of life in that. Look, I love St. Mark's Square in Venice, but the best parts of Venice
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:10.240]   are little canals and bridges into the smallest neighborhoods where you hear a woman singing as
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:16.880]   she's cooking sofrito in her kitchen, right? And you see a guy who's fixing part of his boat
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:21.040]   in a little canal, and that's what he's been doing all morning. And it's not like the tourist
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:26.320]   hubba-bubba. It's just life, right? And that's, for me, why I travel. I love to get lost and
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:33.760]   explore, but you got to build time in to do that. And if you're hoping to find the right spot,
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:38.560]   and maybe you're lost along the way, and maybe you're running late to your activity or otherwise,
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:43.440]   it might be hard for you to take in the moment and appreciate that this is a gift that you're
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:49.920]   getting to experience, right? But I would highly recommend that anytime you can purposely build in
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:54.720]   getting lost, you do. Yeah. I did an episode with Rolf Potts, who wrote this book, Vagabonding,
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:55:01.680]   and we talked about flaneuring, which is basically a term for just kind of getting lost and being.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:05.680]   And I would encourage you, when you see that person tinkering on that boat, go ask them what
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:10.080]   they're doing. Maybe they speak English, maybe they don't, but it never hurts to ask. And I've
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:17.040]   had some really interesting conversations just talking to people on random streets. I remember
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:23.440]   in India, someone invited us into their workshop. That was so great. So lots of tips there. You
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:28.800]   mentioned concierge a lot. And for someone not staying at a hotel, they might be thinking, "Oh,
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:33.040]   well, my credit card comes with a concierge." Is that a concierge you can trust for a lot of
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:38.720]   these kind of local activities? No. So I would trust a local for those local activities. I
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:44.880]   would not trust somebody who's a generalist, right? And so I'll tell you very honestly,
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:49.680]   when we work in a market that we don't know so well, we work through a destination management
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:56.560]   company, a destination expert, right? Who really knows that little village, that little town,
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:56:04.000]   and how to make things happen. And the reason for that is that the internet and chat GPT now
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.480]   can kind of answer generic questions for you on a very high level about something.
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:12.480]   But when you want to know what is the best bakery in a certain town and why,
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:16.080]   you need to go to a local. You need to go to somebody who has on-the-ground experience. And so
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:21.680]   if you're staying at an Airbnb or a Verbo, I've all the time reached out to those hosts and said,
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:25.120]   "Hey, hi. This is who I am. This is my family. This is what we're coming to do.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:29.360]   What do you recommend for X, Y, and Z, right? We want to wake up in the morning and go to do this.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:33.520]   Is this a good idea?" We're staying in Monaco at the end of the month just for one night.
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:37.840]   And I'm like, "We've got five hours basically to see all of the highlights of Monaco
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:42.320]   from a local's perspective. I don't want to go to the casino only. I want to do what a local would
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:48.320]   do, what a Monegasque person would really enjoy. How do you do that?" I have an awesome itinerary
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:54.640]   back 24 hours later, right? So you ask a local for what their experience is. Take it with a
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:58.480]   grain of salt. It may not be you, right? He might've said, "Oh, but watch shopping and
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:05.200]   not into watches." That's fine. Filter it. But definitely start with somebody who is on-the-ground
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:11.760]   or close to. And nowadays, there are travel content people who are beyond just kind of like
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:18.320]   Instagram video stuff. And so when I did an episode on London with Jess Dante, she runs this
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:25.200]   Love in London blog. And she actually has these neighborhood-specific guides where she's reviewed
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:31.440]   everything that she sells for reasonable prices. I don't know the directory of all of those people,
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:36.400]   but I imagine in almost every city in the world, major cities at least, there's someone who has
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:42.400]   some content that you could book. And I imagine if you booked that through their site and you
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:45.760]   emailed them with some questions, they would probably answer them. Oh, in a heartbeat.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:49.840]   If you don't have a hotel concierge or you booked an Airbnb, but it's really through a property
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:54.800]   management company run in another city, I would look for that or I would go on the free walking
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:58:01.760]   tour, ask the local there or walk into a restaurant or a bar on the first day and ask someone working
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:08.400]   there. One thing Amy and I realized was we just don't love going to art and history museums. And
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:14.320]   if we do, it's like one in a trip. And so there are cities that we've been to where we ask people
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:19.040]   what to do. And we look at the guidebooks and they would say, "If you're there for a week,
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:24.960]   spend three or four days going to museums. Or if you're in Cambodia, go to Angkor Wat, but go for
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:30.560]   four days. Get the four-day pass." And we loved going to Angkor Wat for a day. But at the end
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:35.360]   of the day, I was sure that we didn't wanna go for three more. It just wasn't our type of travel.
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:42.880]   We'd much rather go get lost and eat food in some local village. And so don't let the guidebook,
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:49.120]   the recommendations influence you to do something that you know isn't what you want. So those notes
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:54.160]   you like to take after a trip, keep those in mind. Well, to add to that, Chris, if you go,
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:59.600]   you build three days in your itinerary of museums each day. And on day one, you're like, "I'm pretty
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:03.840]   museumed out." Great. You don't have to go to day two and three if you don't want to. You can have
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:07.920]   that flexibility built into your itinerary that you can just take a left turn here and decide to
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:11.680]   do something totally different and be okay with that. Again, it's all about mindset. It's all
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:15.840]   about the flexibility of building your trip the way you want it to be, but also not feeling like
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:20.960]   you're stuck in that trip that you have to check every single box on that itinerary. If after day
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:26.080]   one, you're over museums, write down on your itinerary, "Pretty done with museums." And then
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:30.560]   now what you know in the future, when you come back to look at that trip review, "Okay, I'm going
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:35.760]   to book way fewer museums in the future because this was enough for me." Yeah. Love that. So I
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:40.160]   think we've covered a lot of the things that you need to do. We talked about itinerary management.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:44.640]   So now you've got this whole trip put together. We talked about TripIt. Anything else you think
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:49.680]   about when you're organizing all of this in advance? Well, look, we keep coming back to the
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:53.840]   word "scaffolding," but it's so important because you want to visually look at your entire trip to
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:56.960]   understand what are the elements that go into it, what are the key things you need to know,
[00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:01.920]   key times, et cetera. I love to copy that and make sure it's on my calendar. One key note here is
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:07.760]   that if you're using a Google Gmail address and you're using Google Calendar, you may get these
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:11.840]   automatic updates to your calendar where Google's like, "Oh, we noticed you've got a train ticket,"
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:16.960]   and they'll plop it into your calendar. Sweet. Just double check that those times are actually
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:22.400]   correct. Oftentimes, I've seen that trains, sometimes even flights, will end up at the wrong
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:28.480]   time zone, which is mind-blowing, on my Google Calendar. So it might be 9 or 10 or 12 hours off,
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:33.600]   which is like no bueno, right? So you can just edit the event in your Google Calendar and bring
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:37.440]   it to the right time. That's great. But definitely put things on the spreadsheet,
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:42.240]   put things on the calendar, and then go back and take a look at what are you referencing from your
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:49.040]   original trip planning, ideation, dreaming, visioning, to what is actually happening,
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:54.640]   and are you living the trip of your dreams? Is this trip something that you wanted to do
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:59.360]   when you thought of it originally and it's evolved, or are you sort of like shoehorning
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:03.520]   yourself into a trip? And just be present with that for a minute, right? Nothing's wrong,
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:07.680]   but it's interesting to look at what you're dreaming of and what actually you've planned.
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:11.360]   And then post-trip, I like to go back and kind of figure out, "Okay, well, what worked and what
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:16.720]   didn't and why?" And use that same organization, make notes on, "Okay, this transfer time was too
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:22.240]   short. I needed longer here. I need to have a longer layover. I didn't like this hotel because
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:26.640]   it was in a crappy location, and I thought it was better because of the research I did online, and
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:30.720]   next time I'll do different research," right? So kind of have like a post-trip notes that you can
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:34.960]   take that you can then use every time you're future planning all your other travels.
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:40.480]   A lot of my clients like to have this in TripIt, right? Because TripIt for them is their sort of
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:45.440]   single source of truth. I think it's a great tool. As you said, it monitors for changes and delays,
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:50.160]   and that's awesome. TripIt can be a little clunky sometimes for some people. They don't like it.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:55.520]   They'd rather have it in Google Sheets or a printable PDF, which we do a lot for people.
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:02:01.200]   But whatever system works for you, make sure you do and make sure you file that somewhere so you
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.600]   can go back and reference it later or share it with friends later.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:10.160]   One thing that I was surprised about was when I first started traveling years ago is that,
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:13.840]   for example, if you've never been abroad, when you go through customs, they're like,
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:17.440]   "Where are you staying? What's the address? What's the phone number for the hotel?"
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.560]   And you can be caught off guard. "Well, I don't know all these things." And so
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:24.560]   having some place where you're like, "This is the hotel we're staying at. This is the
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:28.240]   address and the phone number." That's where TripIt can become a lot of handy.
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:34.320]   It comes back to another point, which is being able to access all of this. You need data. Now,
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:40.400]   I think nowadays, it's a lot easier to find a free Wi-Fi or just have data that travels with you
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.520]   if you're on T-Mobile or Google Fi. It just works internationally.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:51.600]   If you're on carriers like Mint Mobile, you can actually now buy international plans or you could
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:56.320]   buy eSIMs from sites like AirAllo where you can just get local SIM cards for data. And you could
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:00.160]   do it electronically so you don't even need the physical SIM card anymore. But just make sure you
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:05.760]   have that information and make sure you can access it because you'll always be surprised when you
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:10.480]   might need to know where you're going, what the address is, what the phone number is, or something
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:15.360]   like that. Totally. And I will call out that it's very important to send your itinerary to somebody
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:19.840]   who's not traveling with you just to be safe. You never know what might happen, God forbid,
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:24.560]   overseas or what might be going on in your life. And you might need somebody else's eyes on
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:29.360]   your safety or your security at certain points. So, definitely share that around. Does that mean
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:34.480]   you need to tell everyone where you are or make sure that everybody has your confirmation numbers?
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:39.120]   No, don't post it online. Just share it with friends or family. And if you do come into
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:44.880]   problems, we've had multiple people send the advice in that you would be surprised at how
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:47.680]   helpful your local embassy can be abroad. 100%.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:54.880]   And similarly, you can be very surprised at how unhelpful local police stations can be.
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:59.200]   Yes. You hopefully don't have to visit either of those places. But if you do lose a phone,
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:02.400]   for instance, and your phone's your single source of truth that has all of your data on it,
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:08.240]   you need to go to your local police office, talk to them, make sure that they have a filed police
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:15.840]   report so you can claim insurance later on. The downside is there's crookedness sometimes and
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:19.920]   there's bureaucracy and red tape and that could take you a whole day just to file that police
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:24.240]   report, but it's very important to do. But if God forbid there's a real issue, go to your embassy
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:28.720]   or consulate and there are the people who can really help you. And make sure that the people
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:33.360]   at home who know where you're traveling know that you've gone to the embassy or consulate
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:37.840]   to be helpful as well. They may be called upon to provide backup data or whatever that you might
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:42.240]   need. Yeah. But for things like I'm having a medical emergency, obviously go to a hospital,
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:46.320]   but I'm having a medical situation that I'm not sure what to deal with, or we lost our passport.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:49.680]   Yeah. Embassy is a great place to go. We've planned our trip. We've mapped it out. We know
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:54.160]   where we're going, what we're doing. We're going to have a great time. What are other little details
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:05:00.560]   of things to figure out? One that comes to mind for me is accessing money. I think a long time
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:06.000]   ago, people would try to exchange money at home. Now, I think the only thing that you should be
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.120]   doing is taking money out of an ATM, unless you've learned that ATMs don't work in this
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:16.640]   country. And then in which case you'll probably be better off bringing larger denomination US
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:23.680]   dollars. Correct. Clean. Yeah. Clean, not ripped. In the US, everyone takes every dollar. Overseas,
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:27.920]   some places don't take $1 bills. Some places don't take old crumply dollar bills,
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:34.560]   but there are a handful of banks, Fidelity, Schwab that reimburse overseas international ATM fees.
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:39.600]   I talked about a whole episode on bank, the best banks and listed a lot of these,
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:45.680]   but ATM is where I get currency. At the airport right away, no problem. Don't care about the
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:49.440]   whatever fee to take it out because I have a bank that's going to reimburse that fee anyway.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:54.000]   Exactly. In addition to banking is travel insurance when it makes sense for their needs.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:00.800]   And I would say that for most people, they're okay risking it, but you have to take a look at
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:05.920]   what is refundable, what is non-refundable, what are the costs that if you were to cancel last
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:10.880]   minute, you would basically have to eat, right? So those are museum tickets. Sometimes they're
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:15.600]   non-refundable hotels, but like airfare, if you booked on points and miles and you can cancel
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:19.840]   last minute, great, good for you. You're getting your refunds back. If you've booked with cash,
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:25.840]   are you able to use that same airline in the future and use the credit you have as a canceled
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:29.520]   ticket on that airline? Ask yourself these questions, understand what's the right amount
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:35.200]   that you should be insuring for in the event that something were to spur you to cancel,
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:41.280]   and then take a look at the ways you bought those tickets, paid for those airline tickets or hotels
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:46.800]   or experiences. If it's on a credit card that carries some travel insurance benefit, great,
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:51.120]   but understand what the limitations of those benefits are so that you know if insurance
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:55.360]   really makes sense or not. Yeah. And I was surprised it's not actually as expensive as
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:02.880]   I had thought. No. And in many cases, it covers medical related things that you might not know
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:09.440]   about even though your insurance might cover it. I don't know whether Cigna is going to cover my
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:13.600]   health insurance situation abroad, but I know that even if they are, it's going to be a pain
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:17.120]   in the ass. A giant pain in the ass. So God forbid you got to go to a hospital, at least you're
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:22.400]   covered to start and you can go from there. Yeah. And so there's probably plenty of companies out
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:26.960]   there. We've used Trawick before and we've used World Nomads before. I'm not going to say that
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:30.480]   there aren't better ones. Maybe there's ones you've used, but those are two I've looked at.
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:33.920]   We tend to look at a dozen different insurance options depending on who the travelers are and
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:38.640]   what their needs are and where they're going, obviously. I wouldn't highlight one over the
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:43.280]   other. I would say that do your diligence and spend a few minutes. If you're insuring $1,000
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:47.360]   of value, that's one thing. If you're insuring $15,000 or $20,000, it's a little different. I
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:52.000]   would do a different level of diligence on those kinds of companies. But it's very important to
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.720]   understand what you can expect to get back out of insurance and why you're buying it to begin with
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:01.280]   before you start. So highlight what does medical coverage look like and why does that matter to me?
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:05.760]   Is it first payer or second? That's important. And then also take a look at what are the
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:10.240]   eventualities that I want to be covered for? If I lose my $1,000 iPhone while I'm over there,
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:15.280]   okay, well, does that get replaced? Is it a check? Do I buy it and then they reimburse me?
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:19.280]   How does all that work? It's helpful to know so that you can be prepared if God forbid you have
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:23.200]   to face that eventuality. So another thing that I recommend to people is about a week before each
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:28.240]   trip, I sit down with my spouse and we go through each of the trip elements that we have coming up.
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:32.480]   We make sure that obviously all of our passports haven't changed from what we thought. They have
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:37.040]   the right expiration dates and we have the right visas if we need them. Sometimes when you're doing
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:41.120]   a visa on arrival, by the way, they're either going to be requiring you paying local currency,
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:45.200]   which can be tricky if you haven't exchanged money ahead of time, or they're going to give
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:51.280]   you a usurious rate at the airport to exchange to be able to do that. So that's one good callout.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:56.160]   Another is sometimes those visa fees are required to be paid in US dollars. Again,
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:59.600]   crisp, clean, newer US dollars. They don't have writings or markings on them.
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:05.120]   But I would highly recommend doing that trip review ahead of time and kind of walking through
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:10.000]   scenarios like, "Hey, do we know where our ATM card is? Do we know where our credit card is?
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.120]   Do we have a backup credit card somewhere in a different spot in case our wallet gets stolen?"
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:18.240]   Right? "Have you called your bank in case you need to, if you're going to a destination that
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:23.840]   might be a little bit dodgy or might not be so easy to be banking in?" Right? Make sure that
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:28.720]   somebody else is aware of your itinerary. And then the final thing that I always like to do
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.200]   is double check for the things that are flexible in our itinerary. Kind of highlight them,
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:37.040]   recircle them and say, "We know that we could trade this out if we needed to." Right? "We know
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:42.160]   that we can cancel this if we had to because it doesn't matter to us or it's not locking us in."
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:46.160]   So if we look at an itinerary a week out and we're like, "Whoa, this is a lot and this isn't
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:50.880]   matching the vision we set nine months ago when we had this idea," kind of circle and create some
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:55.920]   space for you to be flexible with this trip because you never know what might happen. Friends of ours
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:00.960]   were just in Lisbon and Morocco and the moment they got to Lisbon, their four-year-old developed
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:06.080]   an ear infection. And so the next three days of the Lisbon plans were out the door. Doctor was
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:12.320]   on the phone, local house call doctor, all of that. You can't plan for that. So circle those
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:16.000]   things that don't really matter in the end and know that you have some flexibility going into
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:22.080]   your trip and then go have amazing, amazing times. Document the hell out of it. Live in the moment.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.480]   Don't be on your phone looking at what everybody else is doing on Instagram. Be present. Eat that
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:31.200]   thing. Eat another one of them and have a great time. I love it. That was a great way to wrap.
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:35.840]   I hope anyone planning a vacation at least got a handful of tips here so that they can make their
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:41.840]   next trip awesome. Amy's not here or otherwise we probably would have had a real-time breakdown
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:46.320]   of the trip and we would have figured out everything we're doing. But I now have a plan
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:50.160]   for how we're going to finalize our trip. Lee, thanks for being here. Thank you, Chris. It's
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:53.600]   always a pleasure. It's great to see you in this beautiful space. Congratulations to you and thank
