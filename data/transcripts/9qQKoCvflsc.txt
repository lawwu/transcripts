[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.560]   Good Monday morning, everyone.
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.120]   It's a big week ahead for us
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.120]   because today we launch week number 500 in the podcast.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.800]   500 weeks.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.960]   Incredible, that's a lot of sustaining grace
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.420]   and it's not possible without you.
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.400]   So thank you for your prayers and your support
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.860]   and your questions and your listens.
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.560]   We don't take any of this for granted.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.000]   So thanks for listening while you wait in airport terminals,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.440]   while you ride in subways or do your daily mundane chores,
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.680]   the dishes, the laundry, walking the dog,
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.480]   or when you're driving to work or shuffling kids around town
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.880]   or even through your iPhone speakers as you end your day.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.200]   However, and whenever you listen,
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.120]   thank you for listening and making this podcast
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.280]   a part of your busy life.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.000]   And now for 500 weeks, humbly.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.240]   And we begin week number 500
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.960]   with a question from a listener named Joe.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.280]   Pastor John, hello and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.280]   What would you say is the difference
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.920]   between the kind of love that is produced
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.840]   in the Christian's heart for others through the new birth?
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.200]   1 John 4, 7, 1 Peter 1, 22 to 23,
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.080]   compared to the charitable and often self-sacrificial love
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.780]   that we often see demonstrated in the world
[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.680]   among non-Christians.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.200]   Pastor John, how would you explain this difference?
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.160]   The difference between secular love and Christian love
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.120]   is that secular love is not rooted
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.320]   in the cross of God's son
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.800]   and is not sustained and shaped by the power of God's spirit
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.660]   and is not acted for the glory of God the Father.
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.440]   So the source of it is different
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.240]   and the sustaining power of it is different
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.360]   and the goal of it is different.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.680]   So let's think about each of these one at a time
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.840]   and see if we can fill it out.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.940]   First, there's a different source for these two loves.
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.940]   1 John 4, 19, we love because He first loved us.
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.920]   1 John 4, 19.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.040]   And how did He first love us?
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.440]   Well, John says in 1 John 3, 16,
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.440]   "By this we know love, that He laid down His life for us.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.480]   And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers."
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.480]   So Christian love is rooted in Christ's sacrifice
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.960]   for me, for you.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.900]   By this, our sins are forgiven.
[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.740]   We're justified, accepted, loved by God.
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.880]   We have the hope that everything in life
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.340]   will work together for our good
[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.960]   and bring us to everlasting joy
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.960]   so that fear and greed, the great barriers to love,
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:01.800]   are taken away as we trust what God is for us in Christ.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.840]   And when Paul calls Christians to have compassion
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.560]   in Colossians 3, 12, he prefaces that command
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.540]   with three identifiers of who we are.
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.600]   He says, "Put on then as God's chosen,
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.660]   God's holy ones, God's loved ones,
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.760]   compassionate hearts."
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.640]   Now, this is the root of the source of compassion.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.760]   God chose me, God consecrated me,
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.600]   made me holy, set me apart for Himself.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.760]   God loves me.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.040]   And all of this is provided for us
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.560]   because of Christ's death in our place.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.700]   No other way.
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.040]   That death for us provided the hope
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.880]   from which love flows.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.700]   Colossians 1, 4, "We heard of the love
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.920]   that you have for all the saints
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.960]   because of the hope laid up for you in heaven."
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.960]   And that hope is purchased by Jesus on the cross.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.380]   Christ's death also provided the joy
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.860]   from which love flows.
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.200]   2 Corinthians 8, 2, "In a test,
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.580]   a severe test of affliction,
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.300]   their abundance of joy overflowed
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.020]   in a wealth of generosity."
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.240]   In other words, joy overflows in love.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.040]   Christian love is the overflow of joy in God
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.520]   that meets the needs of others.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.520]   And that joy is a blood-bought joy
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.860]   from the death of Jesus.
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.260]   So the first difference between secular love
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.260]   and Christian love is that our love is rooted in
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.440]   and is the overflow of the work of Christ
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.820]   and its effects in our lives.
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.820]   Second, Christian love is sustained and shaped
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.100]   by the work of God's spirit,
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.820]   whereas secular love isn't.
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.860]   Paul calls it the fruit of the spirit.
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.440]   Galatians 5, 22.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.460]   It is the spirit that takes the death of Christ
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.900]   and causes it to be real for us
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.660]   and gives us new hearts so that the death of Christ
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.640]   has a love-producing effect on us.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.540]   John says, "We know that we have passed out of death
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.180]   into life because we love the brothers.
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.740]   Whoever does not love abides in death."
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.180]   Love in our lives is the evidence
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.180]   that the spirit of God has brought us from death to life.
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.540]   And the spirit not only gives us life
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.740]   at the beginning of our Christian walk in new birth,
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.740]   but he sustains our faith and life as we go along,
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.740]   moment by moment, depending on his power
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.660]   so that we can make the sacrifices necessary
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.020]   that love demands.
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.640]   It's the Holy Spirit that sustains our faith
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.140]   so that we can continually lay hold of the promises of God
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.300]   for hope, for joy that free us for love.
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.720]   And we could go on and on how the spirit forms
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.100]   and sustains our capacities to love
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.740]   by overcoming the great love killers
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.780]   of fear and greed and selfishness
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.020]   and directing our hearts over and over again
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.380]   to the truth of God's commands and promises
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.780]   where we get the wisdom and boldness we need to love
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.780]   and humbling our pride so that we don't need to be somebody
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:58.600]   and instead can take thought for the interests of others
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.380]   and not just our own and on and on
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.440]   that the work of the spirit sustains
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.620]   and shapes Christian love, but not the love of the world.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:14.700]   Third, finally, Christian love has a different goal,
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.540]   not an entirely different goal,
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.540]   but a radically different goal.
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:26.540]   It's not entirely different from the unbeliever who loves,
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.540]   not entirely different because secular love often aims
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.420]   at the physical and emotional and psychological
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:40.420]   and relational and economic well-being of other people.
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.420]   And Christians care about these things.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.620]   There's this overlap.
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:50.980]   But when Christians ask, what is good for people
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.360]   in all those areas, what's really good?
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.360]   The answer is always essentially different
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.720]   from the answer of secular people.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.720]   Because for Christians, what's good for human beings
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:15.080]   is always defined so as to include their relationship
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.420]   to God in Christ.
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.580]   What is good for people is that they trust Christ
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.300]   and depend on his spirit and walk in obedience
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.740]   and live for the glory of God.
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.260]   Therefore, when Christians talk about seeking
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.280]   the physical good of a person, for example,
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.200]   we do so in the hope that they will experience
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.220]   this physical good as a gift of God
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.740]   and receive it in the name of Jesus
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.560]   and rely on the Holy Spirit to use it for his glory.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.560]   If all those Godward dimensions are missing,
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.880]   our love is falling short of its goal and we grieve.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.400]   Christian love is keenly aware that life on earth
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.800]   is a viper followed by an eternity,
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.720]   either of exquisite happiness in the presence of God
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.280]   or eternal suffering cut off from his presence.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.040]   And therefore, Christians care about all suffering,
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.280]   but especially eternal suffering.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.480]   The Bible tells us to do everything to the glory of God.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.480]   So we should love people for the glory of God.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.560]   And when someone asks, is it truly love for a person,
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:43.440]   love for a person, is it truly love for a person
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.440]   if we are motivated by the hope that God will be glorified
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.380]   through our love for this person?
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.000]   I know people ask that question.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.520]   I've heard it recently.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.960]   And the answer is, it is love, the greatest love.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.120]   And the reason the answer is yes,
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.060]   it is love when you love someone
[00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.420]   in order that God would be glorified.
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.620]   The answer to the question why goes like this.
[00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:18.720]   Love is doing whatever it takes
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.360]   to enthrall the beloved
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.620]   with the greatest and longest happiness,
[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.740]   even if it costs you your life.
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.500]   And what will enthrall the beloved
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.260]   with the greatest and longest happiness
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.000]   is the glory of God.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.460]   All that God is for them in Jesus.
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:47.460]   Therefore, love for people means doing all we can
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.840]   at whatever cost to ourselves, like Jesus did,
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.280]   to help people be enthralled with the glory of God
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.520]   now and forever.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.240]   When they are enthralled
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.120]   with all that God is for them in Jesus,
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.920]   then they are satisfied fully and forever.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.640]   And God is glorified in their being satisfied in Him.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.080]   That's what makes us tick at desiring God,
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.500]   this glorious, profound biblical insight.
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.520]   Therefore, loving people and glorifying God
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.480]   are not alternatives.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.040]   They're not at odds.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.920]   They are profoundly one thing.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.000]   So in those three ways,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Christian love is different from secular love.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.400]   Different source, the death and resurrection of Christ,
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.080]   different sustaining power, the work of the Holy Spirit,
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:52.080]   different goal, full and everlasting joy in God.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.760]   - Very helpful distinction here, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.160]   And thank you for the great question today.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.760]   That's why we're here 500 weeks later,
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.760]   because you are perceptive Bible readers.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.680]   You are articulate with the challenges of the Christian life
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.320]   and you send us some great articulate questions.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.080]   And if you have one of those on the brain,
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.360]   type it out and send it to us
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.360]   through our online home@desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.840]   Speaking of Christian love,
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.920]   another key factor in genuine Christian love
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:26.020]   is dying to the love of money.
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:26.880]   That must happen.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.960]   We must die to the love of money
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.400]   for our love to be genuine
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.720]   and for our worship to be genuine.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.600]   It's a great connection.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.340]   Pastor John, we'll make it next time
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.220]   as we work through week number 500 on the podcast.
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.060]   I'm your host Tony Reiki.
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.060]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:13:00.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
