[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   I think it's actually not that hard to imagine we are the only civilization in the galaxy
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:04.880]   right now.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.720]   Yeah, that's current extent.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.680]   But there may be very many extinct civilizations.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.820]   If each civilization has a typical lifetime comparable to, let's say AI is the demise
[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.360]   of our own, that's only a few hundred years of technological development, or maybe 10,000
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.280]   years if you go back to the Neolithic Revolution, the dawn of agriculture.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.400]   Hardly anything in cosmic time span.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.400]   That's nothing.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.400]   That's the blink of an eye.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.480]   And so it's not surprising at all that we would happen not to coexist with anyone else.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.040]   But that doesn't mean nobody else was ever here.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.800]   And if other civilizations come to that same conclusion and realization, maybe they scour
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.760]   the galaxy around them, don't find any evidence for intelligence, then they have two options.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.200]   They can either give up on communication and just say, "Well, it's never going to happen.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.800]   We just may as well just worry about what's happening here on our own planet."
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.280]   Or they could attempt communication, but communication through time.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.120]   The following is a conversation with David Kipping, an astronomer and astrophysicist
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.440]   at Columbia University, director of the Cool Worlds Lab.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.120]   And he's an amazing educator about the most fascinating scientific phenomena in our universe.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.800]   I highly recommend you check out his videos on the Cool Worlds YouTube channel.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.440]   David quickly became one of my favorite human beings.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.480]   I hope to talk to him many more times in the future.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.080]   This is the Lex Riedman Podcast.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.880]   To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.480]   And now, dear friends, here's David Kipping.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.160]   Your research at Columbia is in part focused on what you call cool worlds, or worlds outside
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.400]   our solar system where temperature is sufficiently cool to allow for moons, rings, and life to
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.080]   form and for us humans to observe it.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.120]   So can you tell me more about this idea, this place of cool worlds?
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.680]   The history of discovering planets outside our solar system was really dominated by these
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.680]   hot planets.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.840]   And that's just because of the fact they're easier to find.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.160]   When the very first methods came online, these were primarily the Doppler spectroscopy method,
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.960]   looking for wobbling stars, and also the transit method.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.920]   And these two both have a really strong bias towards finding these hot planets.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.160]   Now hot planets are interesting.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.280]   The chemistry in their atmosphere is fascinating.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.280]   It's very alien.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.560]   An example of one that's particularly close to my heart is TrES-2b, whose atmosphere is
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.360]   so dark it's less reflective than coal.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.480]   And so they have really bizarre photometric properties, yet at the same time they resemble
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.820]   nothing like our own home.
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.640]   And so it's said there's two types of astrophysicists.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.500]   The astrophysicists who care about how the universe works.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.560]   They want to understand the mechanics of the machinery of this universe.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.560]   Why did the Big Bang happen?
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.080]   Why is the universe expanding?
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.640]   How are galaxies formed?
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.100]   And there's another type of astrophysicist which perhaps speaks to me a little bit more.
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.160]   It whispers into your ear, and that is, "Why are we here?
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.160]   Are we alone?
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.880]   Are there others out there?"
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.120]   And ultimately along this journey, the hot planets aren't going to get us there.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.560]   When we're looking for life in the universe, it seems to make perfect sense that there
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.360]   should be planets like our own out there.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.120]   Maybe even moons like our own planet around gas giants that could be habitable.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.700]   And so my research has been driven by trying to find these more tricolours globes that
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.600]   might resemble our own planet.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.560]   - So they're the ones that lurk more in the shadows in terms of how difficult it is to
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.560]   detect.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.560]   - They're much harder.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.560]   They're harder for several reasons.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.760]   The method we primarily use is the transit method, so this is really eclipses.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.320]   As the planet passes in front of the star, it blocks out some starlight.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.260]   The problem with that is that not all planets pass in front of their star.
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.960]   They have to be aligned correctly from your line of sight.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.120]   And so the further away the planet is from the star, the cooler it is, the less likely
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.280]   it is that you're going to get that geometric alignment.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.120]   So whereas a hot Jupiter, about 1% of hot Jupiters will transit in front of their star,
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.440]   only about 0.5%, maybe even a quarter of a percent of Earth-like planets will have the
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.760]   right geometry to transit.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.800]   And so that makes it much, much harder for us.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.880]   - What's the connection between temperature of the planet and geometric alignment, the
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.880]   probability of geometric alignment?
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.480]   - There's not a direct connection, but they're connected via an intermediate parameter, which
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.480]   is their separation from the star.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.840]   So the planet will be cooler if it's further away from the star, which in turn means that
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.720]   the probability of getting that alignment correct is going to be less.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.720]   On top of that, they also transit their star less frequently.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.520]   So if you go to the telescope and you want to discover a hot Jupiter, you could probably
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.360]   do it in a week or so, because the orbital period is of order of one, two, three days.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.200]   So you can actually get the full orbit two or three times over.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.160]   Whereas if you want to detect an Earth-like planet, you have to observe that star for
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.080]   three, four years.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.680]   And that's actually one of the problems with Kepler.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.760]   Kepler was this very successful mission that NASA launched over a decade ago now, I think.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.080]   And it discovered thousands of planets.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.680]   It's still the dominant source of exoplanets that we know about.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.640]   But unfortunately, it didn't last as long as we would have liked it to.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.040]   It died after about 4.35 years, I think it was.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.480]   And so for an Earth-like planet, that's just enough to catch four transits.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.080]   Four transits was kind of seen as the minimum.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.320]   But of course, the more transits you see, the easier it is to detect it, because you
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.640]   build up signal to noise.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.560]   If you see the same thing, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, the more ticks you get, the easier
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.600]   it is to find it.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.600]   And so it was really a shame that Kepler was just at the limit of where we were expecting
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.960]   it to start to see Earth-like planets.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.840]   And in fact, it really found zero.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.360]   Zero planets that are around stars like the Sun, that orbit similar to the Earth around
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.480]   the Sun, and could potentially be similar to our own planet in terms of its composition.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.920]   And so it's a great shame, but that's why it gives astronomers more to do in the future.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:10.040]   - Just to clarify, the transit method is our primary way of detecting these things.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:18.240]   And what it is, is when the object passes, occludes the source of light just a tiny bit,
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.440]   a few pixels, and from that we can infer something about its mass and size and distance and geometry
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.080]   and all of that.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:33.880]   That's like trying to tell what, at a party, you can't see anything about a person, but
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.920]   you can just see by the way they occlude others.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.920]   So this is the method.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.640]   But is this super far away?
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.160]   How many pixels of information do we have?
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:50.560]   Basically how high resolution is the signal that we can get about these occlusions?
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.640]   - You're right in your description.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.720]   I think just to build upon that a little bit more, it might be almost like your vision
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.720]   is completely blurry.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.920]   Like you have an extreme eye prescription, and so you can't resolve anything.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.440]   Everything's just blurs.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.120]   But you can tell that something was there because it just got fainter for a short amount
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.120]   of time.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.520]   Someone passed in front of a light.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.880]   And so that light in your eyes would just dim for a short moment.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.360]   Now the reason we have that problem with blowness or resolution is just because the stars are
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.360]   so far away.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.160]   I mean, the closest stars are four light years away, but most of the stars Kepler looked
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.560]   at were thousands of light years away.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:30.120]   And so there's absolutely no chance that the telescope can physically resolve the star,
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:35.120]   or even the separation between the planet and the star is too small, especially for
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.120]   a telescope like Kepler.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.760]   It's only a meter across.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:43.480]   In principle, you can make those detections, but you need a different kind of telescope.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.720]   We call that direct imaging.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.920]   And direct imaging is a very exciting, distinct way of detecting planets.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.040]   But it, as you can imagine, is going to be far easier to detect planets which are really
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.120]   far away from their star to do that, because that's going to make that separation really
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.120]   big.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.360]   And then you also want the star to be really close to us, so the nearest stars.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.080]   Not only that, but you would prefer that planet to be really hot, because the hotter it is,
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.840]   the brighter it is.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.120]   And so that tends to bias direct imaging towards planets which are in the process of forming.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.440]   So things which have just formed, the planet's still got all of its primordial heat embedded
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.380]   within it, and it's glowing.
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.020]   We can see those quite easily.
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.360]   But for the planets more like the Earth, of course they've cooled down, and so we can't
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.360]   see that.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.980]   The light is pitiful compared to a newly formed planet.
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.240]   We would like to get there with direct imaging.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.640]   That's the dream, is to have the pale blue dot, an actual photograph of it, maybe even
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.760]   just a one pixel photograph of it.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.040]   But for now, the entire solar system is one pixel, certainly with the transit method and
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.440]   most other telescopes.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.520]   And so all you can do is see where that one pixel, which contains potentially dozens of
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:51.120]   planets, and the star, maybe even multiple stars, dims for a short amount of time.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.360]   >> KOREY: It dims just a little bit, and from that you can infer something.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.720]   >> ALISTAIR: Yeah, I mean it's like being a detective in the scene.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.440]   It's indirect clues of the existence of the planet.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.320]   >> KOREY: It's amazing that humans can do that.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:08.640]   >> ALISTAIR: We're just looking out in these immense distances, and looking, you know,
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:14.520]   if there's alien civilizations out there, like let's say one exactly like our own, we're
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:21.640]   like, would we even be able to see an Earth that passes in the way of its sun and slightly
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.640]   dims?
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:28.240]   And that's the only sign we have of that alien human-like civilization out there, is it's
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.480]   just a little bit of a dimming.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.480]   >> KOREY: Yeah.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.520]   I mean, it depends on the type of star we're talking about.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:37.920]   If it is a star truly like the sun, the dip that causes is 84 parts per million.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:44.760]   I mean, it's like the same as a firefly flying in front of a giant floodlight at a stadium
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.760]   or something.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.760]   That's kind of the brightness contrast that you're trying to compare to.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:54.520]   So it's extremely difficult detection, and in the very, very best cases we can get down
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.520]   to that.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.360]   But as I said, we don't really have any true Earth analogues that have been in the exoplanet
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.880]   candidate yet.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.040]   Unless you relax that definition, you say it's not just, doesn't have to be a star just
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.040]   like the sun.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.440]   It could be a star that's smaller than the sun.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.240]   It could be these orange dwarfs or even the red dwarf stars.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.260]   And the fact those stars are smaller means that for the same size planet passing in front
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.360]   of it, more light is blocked out.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:23.020]   And so a very exciting system, for example, is TRAPPIST-1, which has seven planets which
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.560]   are smaller than the Earth.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.640]   And those are quite easily detectable, not with a space-based telescope, but even from
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.640]   the ground.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.840]   And that's just because the star is so much smaller that the relative increase in or decrease
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.440]   in brightness is enhanced significantly because of that smaller size.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.840]   So TRAPPIST-1e, it's a planet which is in the right distance for liquid water.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.040]   It has a slightly smaller size than the Earth.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.760]   It's about 90% the size of the Earth, about 80% the mass.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.720]   And it's one of the top targets right now for potentially having life.
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:59.480]   And yet it raises many questions about what would that environment be like?
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:04.720]   This is a star which is one-eighth the mass of the Sun.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.040]   Stars like that take a long time to come off their adolescence.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.680]   When stars first form, like the Sun, it takes them maybe 10, 100 million years to sort of
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.480]   settle into that main sequence lifetime.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:20.040]   But for stars like these late M dwarfs, as we call them, they can take up to a billion
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.760]   years or more to calm down.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:28.360]   And during that period, they're producing huge amounts of x-rays, ultraviolet radiation
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.360]   that could potentially rip off the entire atmosphere.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.280]   It may desiccate the planets in the system.
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.840]   And so even if water arrived by comets or something, it may have lost all that water
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.960]   due to this prolonged period of high activity.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:47.600]   So we have lots of open-ended questions about these M dwarf planets, but they are the most
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.600]   accessible.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:54.760]   And so in the near term, if we detect anything in terms of biosignatures, it's going to be
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:59.360]   for one of these red dwarf stars, it's not going to be a true Earth twin, as we would
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.040]   recognize it as having a yellow star.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.000]   LB: Well, let me ask you, I mean, there's a million ways to ask this question, I'm sure
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.280]   I'll ask it, about habitable worlds.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.160]   Let's just go to our own solar system.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:18.560]   What can we learn about the planets and moons in our solar system that might contain life?
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:25.440]   Whether it's Mars or some of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, what kind of characteristics,
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:30.760]   because you said it might not need to be Earth-like, what kind of characteristics might we be looking
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:31.760]   for?
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:37.240]   CB: When we look for life, it's hard to define even what life is, but we can maybe do a better
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.720]   job in defining the sorts of things that life does.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:46.720]   And that provides some aspects to some avenue for looking for them.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.560]   Certainly classically, conventionally, I think we thought the way to look for life was to
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.520]   look for oxygen.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.440]   Oxygen is a by-product of photosynthesis on this planet.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.440]   We didn't always have it.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:02.280]   Certainly if you go back to the Archean period, you have this period called the Great Oxidation
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.760]   Event where the Earth floats with oxygen for the first time and starts to saturate the
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.240]   oceans and then the atmosphere.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:13.320]   And so that oxygen, if we detect it on another planet, whether it be Mars, Venus or an exoplanet,
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:19.360]   whatever it is, that was long thought to be evidence for something doing photosynthesis.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.520]   Because if you took away all the plant life on the Earth, the oxygen wouldn't just hang
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.600]   around here as a highly reactive molecule.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.480]   It would oxidize things, and so within about a million years you'd probably lose all the
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.760]   oxygen on planet Earth.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.960]   So that was conventionally how we thought we could look for life.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.280]   And then we started to realize that it's not so simple because a) there might be other
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.720]   things that life does apart from photosynthesis.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.080]   Certainly the vast majority of the Earth's history had no oxygen, and yet there was living
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:50.200]   things on it, so that doesn't seem like a complete test.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:55.000]   And secondly, could there be other things that produce oxygen besides from life?
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   A growing concern has been these false positives in biosignature work.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.160]   And so one example of that would be photolysis that happens in the atmosphere.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:09.600]   An ultraviolet light hits the upper atmosphere, it can break up water vapor, the hydrogen
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.120]   splits off to the oxygen.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:15.320]   The hydrogen is a much lighter atomic species, and so it can actually escape certainly planets
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.920]   like the Earth's gravity.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.960]   That's why we don't have any hydrogen or very little helium.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.880]   And so that leaves you with the oxygen, which then oxidizes the surface.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:29.280]   And so there could be a residual oxygen signature just due to this photosynthesis process.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:34.520]   So we've been trying to generalize, and certainly in recent years there's been other suggestions
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.280]   of things we could look for in the solar system beyond.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:42.280]   Nitrous oxide, basically laughing gas, is a product of microbes.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.520]   That's something that we're starting to get more interest in looking for.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:51.280]   Methane gas in combination with other gases can be an important biosignature.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:55.080]   Phosphine as well, and phosphine is particularly relevant to the solar system because there
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:59.000]   was a lot of interest for Venus recently.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.680]   You may have heard that there was a claim of a biosignature in Venus's atmosphere, I
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.680]   think it was like two years ago now.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.760]   And the judge and jury is still out on that.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:18.240]   There was a very provocative claim and signature of a phosphine-like spectral absorption, but
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.800]   it could have also have been some other molecule in particular, sulfur dioxide, which is not
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.800]   a biosignature.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:28.600]   LB: So this is a detection of a gas in the atmosphere, Venus.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:33.120]   And it might be controversial in several dimensions.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.640]   So one, how to interpret that?
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.040]   Two, is this the right gas?
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.120]   And three, is this even the right detection?
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.000]   Is there an error in the detection?
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   CB: Yeah.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.620]   I mean, how much do we believe the detection in the first place?
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.560]   If you do believe it, does that necessarily mean there's life there?
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.120]   And what gives?
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.840]   How can you have life in Venus's atmosphere in the first place?
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.880]   Because that's been seen as like a hellhole place for imagining life.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:01.880]   But I guess the counter to that has been that, okay, yes, the surface is a horrendous place
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.880]   to imagine life thriving.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.560]   But as you go up in altitude, the very dense atmosphere means that there is a cloud layer
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:14.080]   where the temperature and the pressure become actually fairly similar to the surface of
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.080]   the Earth.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:20.840]   So maybe there are microbes stirring around in the clouds which are producing phosphine.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.240]   At the moment, this is fascinating.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:28.640]   It's got a lot of us reinvigorated about the prospects of going back to Venus and doing
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.640]   another mission there.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.920]   In fact, there's now two NASA missions, Veritas and Da Vinci, which are going to be going
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.940]   back before 2030, or the 2030s.
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.160]   And then we have a European mission, I think, that's slated now.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.120]   And even a Chinese mission might be coming along the way as well.
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.880]   So we might have multiple missions going to Venus, which has long been overlooked.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:51.600]   I mean, apart from the Soviets, there really has been very little in the way of exploration
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.600]   of Venus.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.240]   Certainly as compared to Mars.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.880]   Mars has enjoyed most of the activity from NASA's rovers and surveys.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.480]   And Mars is certainly fascinating.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:06.360]   There's this signature of methane that has been seen there before.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:11.680]   Again there, the discussion is whether that methane is a product of biology, which is
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.640]   possible, something that happens on the Earth, or whether it's some geological process that
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.080]   we are yet to fully understand.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:23.640]   It could be, for example, a reservoir of methane that's trapped under the surface and is leaking
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.640]   out seasonally.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:29.720]   - So the nice thing about Venus is if there's a giant living civilization there, it'll be
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:34.520]   airborne, so you can just fly through and collect samples.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:41.360]   With Mars and moons of Saturn and Jupiter, you're going to have to dig under to find
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.640]   the civilizations, dead or living.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.640]   - Right.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.240]   And so maybe it's easier then for Venus, because certainly you can imagine just a balloon floating
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:54.080]   through the atmosphere, or a drone or something that would have the capability of just scooping
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.840]   up and sampling.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:02.920]   To dig under the surface of Mars is maybe feasible-ish, especially with something like
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:08.760]   Starship that could launch a huge digger basically to the surface, and you could just excavate
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.360]   away at the surface.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:16.200]   But for something like Europa, we really are still unclear about how thick the ice layer
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:22.960]   is, how you would melt through that huge thick layer to get to the ocean, and then potentially
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.560]   also discussions about contamination.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:29.040]   The problem with looking for life in the solar system, which is different from looking for
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:34.080]   life with exoplanets, is that you always run the risk of, especially if you visit there,
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.400]   of introducing the life yourself.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:42.920]   It's very difficult to completely exterminate every single microbe and spore on the surface
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:48.520]   of your rover or the surface of your lander, and so there's always a risk of introducing
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.520]   something.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:54.480]   I mean, to some extent there is continuous exchange of material between these planets,
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.840]   naturally, on top of that as well, and now we're sort of accelerating that process to
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.840]   some degree.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:04.360]   And so if you dig into Europa's surface, which probably is completely pristine, it's very
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:10.160]   unlikely there has been much exchange with the outside world for its subsurface ocean,
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:15.560]   you are for the first time potentially introducing bacterial spores into that environment that
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:19.840]   may compete or may introduce spurious signatures for the life you're looking for.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:26.720]   And so it's almost an ethical question as to how to proceed with looking for life on
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:32.520]   those subsurface oceans, and I don't think we really have a good resolution for it at
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:33.520]   this point.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.520]   - Ethical.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:41.800]   So you mean ethical in terms of concern for preserving life elsewhere, not to murder it,
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.040]   as opposed to a scientific one?
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:48.120]   - I mean, we always worry about a space virus coming here or some kind of external source,
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.080]   and we would be the source of that potential contamination.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.640]   - Or the other direction.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:20:01.320]   - I mean, whatever survives in such harsh conditions might be pretty good at surviving
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.320]   in all conditions.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:06.280]   It might be a little bit more resilient and robust, so it might actually take a ride on
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.120]   us back home.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.120]   - Possibly.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.760]   I mean, I'm sure that some people would be concerned about that.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:18.000]   I think we would hopefully have some containment procedures if we did sample return, or you
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.560]   mean you don't even really need a sample return.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.800]   These days you can pretty much send a little micro laboratory to the planet to do all the
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:28.480]   experiments in situ, and then just send them back to your planet, the data.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:33.120]   And so I don't think it's necessary, especially for a case like that where you might have
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.360]   contamination concerns, that you have to bring samples back.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.280]   Although, probably if you brought back European sushi, it would probably sell for quite a
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:45.000]   bit with the billionaires in New York City.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   - Sushi, yeah.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:51.520]   I would love from an engineering perspective just to see all the different candidates and
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:57.320]   designs for the scooper, for Venus and the scooper for Europa and Mars.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:03.040]   I haven't really looked deeply into how the actual engineering of collecting the samples,
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:10.480]   because the engineering of that is probably essential for not either destroying life or
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.480]   polluting it with our own microbes and so on.
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.000]   So that's an interesting engineering challenge.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.040]   I usually for rovers and stuff focus on the sort of the mobility aspect of it, on the
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:26.040]   robotics, the perception, and the movement and the planning and the control.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:31.040]   But there's probably the scooper is probably where the action is, the microscopic sample
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.040]   collection.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:37.240]   So basically you have to first clean your vehicle, make sure it doesn't have any earth
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:42.800]   like things on it, and then you have to put it into some kind of thing that's perfectly
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.800]   sealed from the environment.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:49.760]   So if we bring it back or we analyze it, it's not going to bring anything else externally.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.440]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.720]   That would be an interesting engineering design there.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:59.520]   - Yeah, I mean Curiosity has been leaving these little pods on the surface quite recently.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:05.200]   There's some neat photos you can find online and they kind of look like lightsaber hilts.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:11.000]   So yeah, to me, I think I tweeted something like, you know, this weapon is your life.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.760]   Like don't lose it Curiosity, because it's just dumping these little vials everywhere.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.960]   And it's yeah, it is scooping up these things.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:21.120]   And the intention is that in the future there will be a sample return mission that will
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.640]   come and pick these up.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.960]   But I mean, the engineering behind those things is so impressive.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:30.600]   The thing that blows me away the most has been the landings.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.080]   Especially I'm trained to be a pilot at the moment.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.440]   So that's the sort of, you know, watching landings has become like my pet hobby on YouTube
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:40.440]   at the moment and how not to do it, how to do it with different levels of conditions
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.440]   and things.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:46.760]   But when you think about landing on Mars, just the light travel time effect means that
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:51.280]   there's no possibility of a human controlling that descent.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:56.880]   And so you have to put all of your faith and your trust in the computer code or the AI
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:01.760]   or whatever it is that you've put on board that thing to make the correct descent.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:07.120]   And so there's this famous period called seven minutes of hell, where you're basically waiting
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.000]   for that light travel time to come back to know whether your vehicle successfully landed
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.520]   on the surface or not.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:17.080]   And during that period, you know in your mind simultaneously that it is doing these multi
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:23.760]   stages of deploying its parachute, deploying the crane, activating its jets to come down
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.640]   and controlling its descent to the surface.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.940]   And then the crane has to fly away so it doesn't accidentally hit the rover.
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:35.600]   And so there's a series of multi stage points where any of them go wrong, you know, the
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.560]   whole mission could go awry.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:44.920]   And so the fact that we are fairly consistently able to build these machines that can do this
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:51.080]   autonomously is to me one of the most impressive acts of engineering that NASA have achieved.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:57.280]   - Yes, the unfortunate fact about physics is the takeoff is easier than the landing.
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:03.040]   And you mentioned Starship, one of the incredible engineering feats that you get to see is the
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:09.200]   reusable rockets that take off but they land and they land using control and they do so
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.320]   perfectly and sometimes when it's synchronous, it's just it's beautiful to see.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.480]   And then with Starship, you see the chopsticks that catch the ship.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:22.400]   I mean, there's so much incredible engineering, but you mentioned Starships is somehow helpful
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.400]   here.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.760]   So what's your hope with Starship?
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:29.360]   What kind of science might it enable possibly?
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.360]   - There's two things.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.520]   The launch cost itself, which is hopefully going to mean per kilogram, it's going to
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.200]   dramatically reduce the cost of it.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.880]   Even if it's a factor of 10 higher than what Elon originally promised, this is going to
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.760]   be a revolution for the cost to launch.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.080]   That means you could do all sorts of things.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:50.320]   You could launch large telescopes, which could be basically like JWST, but you don't even
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.320]   have to fold them up.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:55.920]   JWST had this whole issue with its design that it's six and a half meters across.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:00.120]   And so you have to, there's no fuselage, which is that large at the time, the Ares 4 wasn't
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.120]   large enough for that.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.760]   And so they had to fold it up into this kind of complicated origami.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:10.400]   And so a large part of the cost was figuring out how to fold it up, testing that it unfolded
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.640]   correctly, repeated testing.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:17.800]   And there was something like 130 fail points or something during this unfolding mechanism.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.480]   And so all of us were holding our breath during that process.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:26.080]   But if you have the ability to just launch arbitrarily large masses, at least comparatively
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:31.680]   compared to JWST, and very large mirrors into space, you can more or less repurpose ground-based
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.680]   mirrors.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:37.600]   The Hubble Space Telescope mirror and the JWST mirrors are designed to be extremely
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:41.760]   lightweight and that increased their cost significantly.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:46.360]   They have this kind of honeycomb design on the back to try and minimize the weight.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:51.600]   If you don't really care about weight because it's so cheap, then you could just literally
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:57.320]   grab many of the existing ground-based mirrors across the world - 4-metre, 5-metre mirrors
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:02.960]   - and just pretty much attach them to a chassis and have your own space-based telescope.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:08.920]   I think the Breakthrough Foundation, for instance, is an entity that has been interested in doing
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.520]   this sort of thing.
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:15.760]   And so that raises the prospects of having not just one JWST, that just - you know, JWST
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:19.160]   is a fantastic resource, but it's split between all of us.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:24.520]   Astronologists, star formation astronomers, those of us studying exoplanets, those of
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:29.280]   us wanting to study the ultra-deep fields and the origin of the first galaxies, the
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.920]   expansion of the universe - everyone has to share this resource.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:39.760]   But we could potentially each have one JWST each that is maybe just studying a handful
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:44.160]   of the brightest exoplanet stars and measuring their atmospheres.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:50.200]   This is important because if you - we talked about this planet Trappist-1e earlier - that
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:56.080]   planet, if JWST stared at it and tried to look for biosignatures - by which I mean oxygen,
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:04.680]   nitrous oxide, methane - it would take it of order of 200 transits to get even a very
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.840]   marginal - what we'd call two and a half sigma detection - of those, which basically nobody
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.040]   would believe with that.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.920]   And 100 transits - I mean this thing transits once every six days, so you're talking about
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.880]   four years of staring at the same star with one telescope.
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:22.640]   There'd be some breaks, but it'd be hard to schedule much else because you'd have to continuously
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:26.920]   catch each one of these transits to build up your signal-to-noise.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.600]   And so JWST's never going to do that.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:34.080]   In principle, technically, JWST could technically have the capability of just about detecting
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:40.480]   a biosignature on an Earth-like planet around a non-Sun-like star, but still, impressively,
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.720]   we have basically the technology to do that.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:47.200]   But we simply cannot dedicate all of its time, practically, to that one resource.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:53.320]   And so Starship opens up opportunities like that of mass-producing these kinds of telescopes,
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:57.480]   which will allow us to survey for life in the universe, which of course is one of the
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.720]   grand goals of astronomy.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:06.040]   - I wonder if you can speak to the bureaucracy, the political battles, the scientific battles
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.840]   for time on the James Webb telescope.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.880]   There must be a fascinating process of scheduling that.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.040]   All scientists, they're trying to collaborate, figure out what the most important problems
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:24.400]   are, and there's an interesting network of interfering scientific experiments, probably,
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.360]   they have to somehow optimize over.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.680]   - It's a really difficult process.
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:31.520]   I don't envy the TAC that are going to have to make this decision.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:36.480]   We call it the TAC, the Time Allocation Committee, that make this decision.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.480]   And I've served on these before, and it's very difficult.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:43.560]   I mean, typically for Hubble, we were seeing at least 10, sometimes 20 times the number
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.960]   of proposals for telescope time versus available telescope time.
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.340]   For GDST, there has been one call already that has gone out.
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:58.200]   We call it Cycle 1, and that was oversubscribed by, I think, something like 6 to 1, 7 to 1.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:03.600]   And the Cycle 2, which has just been announced fairly recently, and the deadline is actually
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.040]   the end of this month, so my team are totally laser-focused on writing our proposals right
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.760]   now.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:14.280]   That is expected to be much more competitive, probably more comparable to what Hubble saw.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.360]   And so, it's hard.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.320]   - More competitive than the Cycle 1, you said, already?
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.320]   Because that's already super competitive.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.480]   - More competitive than the first cycle.
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.920]   So I said the first cycle of James Webb was about 6 to 1, and this will probably be more
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.800]   like 20 to 1, I would expect.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:31.440]   - So these are all proposals by scientists and so on, and it's not like you can schedule
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.200]   at any time, because if you're looking for transit times...
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.640]   - Yeah, you have a time-critical element.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.640]   - Yes, time-critical element.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:43.480]   - And they're conflicting in non-obvious ways, because the frequency is different, the duration
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:48.960]   is different, there's probably computational needs that are different, there's the type
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.560]   of sensors, the direction pointing, all that.
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:52.560]   - Yeah, it's hard.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:57.080]   And there are certain programs like doing a deep field study, where you just more or
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.280]   less point the telescope, and that's pretty open.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.160]   I mean, you're just accumulating photons.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:05.200]   You can just point at that patch of the sky whenever the telescope's not doing anything
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.280]   else, and just get to your month, let's say a month of integration time is your goal over
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.480]   the lifetime of JWST.
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.160]   So that's maybe a little bit easier to schedule.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:18.360]   It's harder, especially for us looking at cool worlds, because as I said earlier, these
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.720]   planets transit very infrequently.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.720]   So we have to wait.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:26.520]   If you're looking at the Earth transiting the Sun, an alien watching us, they would
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.640]   only get one opportunity per year to do that observation.
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.040]   The transit lasts for about 12 hours.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:37.000]   And so if they don't get that time, it's hard.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   That's it.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.440]   If it conflicted with another proposal that wants to use another time critical element.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:47.760]   It's much easier for planets like these hot planets or these close in planets, because
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:51.460]   they transit so frequently, there's maybe 100 opportunities.
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:56.440]   And so then the TAT can say, okay, they want 10 transits, there's 100 opportunities here,
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.680]   it's easier for us to give them time.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.080]   We're almost in the worst case scenario.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.780]   We're proposing to look for exoplanets around two cool planets.
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:09.520]   And so we really only have one bite of the cherry for each one.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:14.360]   And so our sales pitch has been that these are extremely precious events.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:22.120]   And more importantly, JWST is the only telescope, the only machine humanity has ever constructed,
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:26.240]   which is capable of finding moons akin to the moons in our solar system.
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.320]   Kepler can't do it, even Hubble can't do it.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.180]   JWST is the first one.
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:35.280]   And so there is a new window to the universe, because we know these moons exist.
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.120]   They're all over the place in the solar system.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:42.080]   You have the Moon, you have Io, Callisto, Europa, Ganymede, Titan.
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:45.840]   Lots of moons of fairly similar size, sort of 30% the size of the Earth.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:49.920]   And this telescope is the first one that can find them.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:54.800]   And so we're very excited about the profound implications of ultimately solving this journey
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.480]   we're on in astronomy, which is to understand our uniqueness.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.080]   We want to understand how common is the solar system.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:06.200]   Are we the way, are we the architecture that frequently emerges naturally?
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.120]   Or is there something special about what happened here?
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.400]   - I think this is not the worst case, it's the best case.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.160]   It's obvious, it's super rare.
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:17.240]   So you have to like, I would, so I love scheduling from a computer science perspective, that's
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.400]   my background.
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:22.960]   So algorithmically, to solve a schedule problem, I will schedule the rarest things first.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:28.200]   And obviously this is, the JWST is the first thing that can actually detect a cool world.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.520]   So this is a big new thing, you can show off that new thing.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.840]   Happens rarely, schedule it first, it's perfect.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.520]   - You should be in the talk, this is perfect.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:39.800]   - I will, I'll file my application after we're done with this.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.680]   This part of me is the OCD, part of me is the computational aspect, I love scheduling
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:50.360]   competing devices, 'cause you have that kind of scheduling on supercomputers, that scheduling
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.360]   problem is fascinating.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:56.920]   How do you prioritize computation, how do you prioritize science, data collection, sample
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.920]   collection, all that kind of stuff.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:03.520]   It's actually kind of fascinating, because data, in ways you expect and don't expect,
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:09.240]   will unlock a lot of solutions to some fascinating mysteries.
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:14.400]   And so collecting the data and doing so in a way that maximizes the possibility of discovery
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.120]   is really interesting, from a computational perspective.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.640]   - I agree, there's a real satisfaction in extracting the maximum science per unit time
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.960]   out of your telescope.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.240]   That's the TAC's job.
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:31.200]   But the TAC are not machines, they're not a piece of computer code.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.640]   They will make their selections based off human judgment.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:39.080]   And a lot of the telescope, certainly within the field of exoplanets, 'cause there's different
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:42.840]   fields of astronomy, but within the field of exoplanets, I think a good expectation
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:49.080]   is that most of the telescope time that JWST have will go towards atmospheric retrieval,
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:53.960]   which is sort of alluded to earlier, like detecting molecules in the atmospheres, not
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:58.720]   biosignatures, 'cause as I said, it's really not designed to do that, it's pushing JWST
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.960]   probably too far to expect it to do that.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:05.920]   But it could detect, for example, a carbon dioxide rich atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1e.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.800]   That's not a biosignature, but you could prove it's like a Venus in that case, or maybe like
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:13.440]   a Mars in that case, both those have carbon dioxide rich atmospheres.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:19.000]   Doesn't prove or disprove the existence of life either way, but it is our first characterization
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.200]   of the nature of those atmospheres.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.240]   Maybe we can even tell the pressure level and the temperature of those atmospheres.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:28.280]   So that's very exciting.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:33.200]   We are competing with that, and I think that science is completely mind-blowing and fantastic.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.840]   We have a completely different objective, which is in our case to try and look for the
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:41.160]   first evidence of these small moons around these planets.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.840]   Potentially even moons which could be habitable, of course, so I think it's a very exciting
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.040]   goal.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:52.840]   But ATT&CK has to make a human judgment, essentially, about which science are they most excited
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:58.200]   by, which one has the highest promise of return, the highest chance of return.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:03.360]   And so that's hard because if you look at a planetary atmosphere, well you know most
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:07.880]   of the time the planet has an atmosphere already, and so there's almost a guaranteed success
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.640]   that you're going to learn something about the atmosphere by pointing judiciously at
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.640]   it.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:15.060]   Whereas in our case, there's a harder sell.
[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:19.860]   We are looking for something that we do not know for sure exists yet or not.
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:25.360]   And so we are pushing the telescope to do something which is inherently more risky.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:33.840]   - Yeah, but the existence, if shown, already gives a deep lesson about what's out there
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:34.840]   in the universe.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:40.020]   That means that other stars have similar types of variety as we have in our solar system.
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:43.560]   They have an Io, they have a Europa, and so on.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:51.920]   Which means there's a lot of possibility for icy planets, for water, for planets and moons.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:36:00.240]   That's super exciting because that means everywhere through our galaxy and beyond, there is just
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.680]   innumerable possibility for weird creatures.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.680]   - I agree.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.680]   - Life forms.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:06.680]   - You don't have to convince me.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:11.840]   I mean, NASA has been on this quest for a long time and it's sometimes called Eater
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:12.840]   Earth.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:18.080]   It's the frequency of Earth-like, usually they say planets, in the universe.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.880]   How common are planets similar to our Earth?
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.760]   In terms of, ultimately we'd like to know everything about these planets in terms of
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.560]   the amount of water they have, how much atmosphere they have.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:32.380]   But for now it's kind of focused just on the size and the distance from the star, essentially.
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:35.440]   How often do you get similar conditions to that?
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:39.960]   That was Kepler's primary mission and it really just kind of flirted with the answer.
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.000]   It didn't quite get to a definitive answer.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:50.160]   But I always say, look, if that's our primary goal, to look for Earth-like, I would say,
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.160]   then moons has to be a part of that.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:57.880]   Because we know that Earth-like, from the Kepler data, the preliminary result is that
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:01.520]   Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars is not an inevitable outcome.
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.560]   It seems to be something like a 1-10% outcome.
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.840]   So it's not particularly inevitable that that happens.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:13.720]   But we do often see about half of all Sun-like stars have either a mini-Neptune, a Neptune
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:16.680]   or a Jupiter in the habitable zone of their stars.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.640]   That's a very, very common occurrence that we see.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:24.520]   Yet we have no idea how often they have moons around them, which could also be habitable.
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:31.160]   And so there may very well be, if even one in five of them has an Earth-like moon or
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:35.720]   even a Mars-like moon around them, then there would be more habitable real estate in terms
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:39.560]   of exo-moons than exoplanets in the universe.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:47.080]   Essentially 2x, 3x, 5x, maybe 10x the number of habitable worlds out there in the universe.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.480]   Our current estimate, like the Drake equation.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:57.280]   So this is one way to increase the confidence and increase the value of that parameter.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.600]   And just know where to look.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:03.560]   We would like to know where should we listen for technosignatures, where should we be looking
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:04.560]   for biosignatures.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:10.400]   And not only that, but what role does the Moon have in terms of its influence on the
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.840]   planet?
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:15.640]   We talked about these directly imaged telescopes earlier, these missions that want to take
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:20.720]   a photo to quote Carl Sagan, "the pale blue dot of our planet, but the pale blue dot of
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.440]   an exoplanet".
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.760]   And that's the dream, to one day capture that.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:29.800]   But as impressive as the resolution is that we are planning and conspiring to design for
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:34.200]   the future generation telescopes to achieve that, even those telescopes will not have
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:37.080]   the capability of resolving the Earth and the Moon within that.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:45.440]   It'll be a pale blue dot pixel, but the Moon's grayness will be intermixed with that pixel.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.600]   And so this is a big problem, because one of the ways that we are claiming to look for
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:53.000]   life in the universe is a chemical disequilibrium.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.020]   So you see two molecules that just shouldn't be there, they normally react with each other.
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:01.800]   Or even one molecule that's just too reactive to be hanging around the atmosphere by itself.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:07.080]   So if you had oxygen and methane hanging out together, those would normally react fairly
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.220]   easily.
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:12.840]   And so if you detected those two molecules in your pale blue dot spectra, you'd be like,
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.280]   "OK, we have evidence for life.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.680]   Something's metabolizing on this planet."
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:21.480]   However, the challenge here is, what if that Moon was Titan?
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.120]   Titan has a methane-rich atmosphere.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:28.840]   And what if the pale blue dot was in fact a planet devoid of life, but it had oxygen
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:33.800]   because of water undergoing this photolysis reaction, splitting into oxygen and hydrogen
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:34.800]   separately?
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:40.200]   So then you have all of the hallmarks of what we would claim to be life, but all along you
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.200]   were tricked.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.920]   It was just a Moon that was deceiving you.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:51.900]   And so we're never going to, I would claim, really understand or complete this quest of
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:58.340]   looking for life by signatures in the universe, unless we have a deep knowledge of the prevalence
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.380]   and role that Moons have.
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:02.680]   They may even affect the habitability of the planets themselves.
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:05.520]   Of course, our own Moon is freakishly large.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.960]   By mass ratio, it's the largest Moon in the solar system.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:08.960]   It's a 1% mass Moon.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:13.360]   If you look at Jupiter's Moons, they're like 10 to the power of minus 4, much smaller.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:17.040]   And so our own Moon seems to stabilize the obliquity of our planet.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:20.880]   It gives rise to tides, especially early on when the Moon was closer, those tides would
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.840]   have covered entire continents.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:27.600]   And those rock pools that would have been scattered across the entire plateau may have
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.280]   been the origin of life on our planet.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:34.400]   The Moon-forming impact may have stripped a significant fraction of lithosphere off
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.800]   the Earth, which without it, plate tectonics may not have been possible.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:41.520]   We'd have had a stagnant lid because there was just too much lithosphere stuck on the
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.120]   top of the planet.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:50.400]   And so there are speculative reasons, but intriguing reasons as to why a large Moon
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:57.080]   may be not just important, but central to the question of having the conditions necessary
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:58.080]   for life.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:04.480]   So Moons can be habitable in their own right, but they can also play a significant influence
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.200]   on the habitability of the planets they orbit.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:13.600]   And further, they will surely interfere with our attempts to detect life remotely from
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.600]   afar.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:23.840]   LB: So taking a tangent upon a tangent, you've written about binary planets, and that they're
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:30.040]   surprisingly common, or they might be surprisingly common.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.760]   What's the difference between a large Moon and binary planets?
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.200]   What are binary planets?
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:39.560]   What's interesting to say here about giant rocks flying through space and orbiting each
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.560]   other?
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.520]   CB: The thing that's interesting about binary objects is that they're very common in the
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.840]   universe.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.080]   Binary stars are everywhere.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:51.520]   In fact, the majority of stars seem to live in binary systems.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:56.120]   When we look at the outer edges of the solar system, we see binary Kuiper Belt objects
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.920]   all the time, asteroids basically bound to one another.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.400]   Pluto-Charon is kind of an example of that.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.600]   It's a 10% mass ratio system.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:08.240]   It almost is by many definitions a binary planet, but now it's a dwarf planet.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.160]   So I don't know what you'd call that now.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:15.200]   But we know that the universe likes to make things in pairs.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:21.160]   LB: So you're saying our Sun is an incel.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:25.000]   So most things are dating, they're in relationships, and ours is alone.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:32.040]   CB: It's not a complete freak of the universe to be alone, but it's more common for something
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.040]   like stars.
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.560]   If you count up all the Sun-like stars in the universe, about half of the Sun-like star
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:39.880]   systems are in binary or trinary systems, and the other half are single.
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:44.920]   But because those binaries are two or three stars, then cumulatively maybe a third of
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.520]   all Sun-like stars are single.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:52.000]   LB: I'm trying hard to not anthropomorphize the relationship that stars have with each
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   other.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   CB: The triplets game.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.080]   LB: Yeah, I've met those folks also.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:02.400]   So is there something interesting to learn about the habitability, how that affects the
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:07.920]   probability of habitable worlds when they kind of couple up like that in those different
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:08.920]   ways?
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.840]   CB: It depends which way the stars of the planet.
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:16.280]   Certainly if stars couple up, that has a big influence on the habitability.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:20.480]   Of course this is very famous from Star Wars, Tatooine in Star Wars is a binary star system,
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:24.720]   and you have Luke Skywalker looking at the Sunset and seeing two stars come down.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:30.160]   And for years we thought that was purely a product of George Lucas's incredibly creative
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:35.880]   mind, and we didn't think that planets would exist around binary star systems.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:42.240]   It seems like too tumultuous an environment for a quiescent planetary disc, a circumstellar
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.680]   disc to form planets from.
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:50.520]   And yet one of the astounding discoveries from Kepler was that these appear to be quite
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:51.520]   common.
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:56.000]   In fact, as far as we can tell, they're just as common around binary stars as single stars.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.680]   The only caveat to that is that you don't get planets close into binary stars.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:06.120]   They have a clearance region on the inside where planets maybe they form there, but they
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.120]   don't last.
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:10.800]   They are dynamically unstable in that zone.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:14.080]   But once you get out to about the distance that the Earth orbits the Sun, or even a little
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:18.280]   bit closer in, you start to find planets emerging.
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:21.760]   And so that's the right distance for liquid water, the right distance for potentially
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.100]   life on those planets.
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:27.260]   And so there may very well be plenty of habitable planets around the binary stars.
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:28.940]   Binary planets is a little bit different.
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:37.060]   Binary planets, I don't think we have any serious connection of planet banality to habitability.
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:41.540]   Certainly when we investigated it, that wasn't our drive that this is somehow the solution
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:43.700]   to life in the universe or anything.
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:47.540]   It was really just a, like all good science questions, a curiosity-driven question.
[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:48.540]   LB: What's the dynamic?
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:53.220]   Are they legit orbiting each other as they orbit the star?
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:59.860]   CB: So the formation mechanism proposed here, because it is very difficult to form two proto-planets
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:00.860]   close to each other like this.
[00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:04.380]   They would generally merge within the disk, and so that's why you normally get single
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:05.380]   planets.
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:09.100]   But you could have something like Jupiter and Saturn form at separate distances.
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:14.320]   They could dynamically be scattered in towards one another, and basically not quite collide,
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.820]   but have a very close-on encounter.
[00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:23.180]   Now because tidal forces increase dramatically as the distance decreases between two objects,
[00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:28.660]   the tides can actually dissipate the kinetic energy and bring them bound into one another.
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:34.420]   So that seems, when you first hear that, you think that seems fairly contrived, that you'd
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:38.220]   have the conditions just right to get these tides to cause a capture.
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:43.020]   But numerical simulations have shown that about 10% of planet-planet encounters are
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:48.900]   shown to produce something like binary planets, which is a startling prediction.
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:53.840]   And so that seems at odds with, naively, the exoplanet catalogue for which we know of,
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:56.060]   so far, no binary planets.
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:59.100]   And we propose one of the resolutions to this might be that the binary planets are just
[00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:03.660]   incredibly difficult to detect, which is also counterintuitive.
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:07.800]   Because remember how they form is through this tidal mechanism, and so they form extremely
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:08.800]   close to each other.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.980]   So the distance that Io is away from Jupiter, just a few planetary radii, they're almost
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:18.180]   touching one another, and they're just tidally locked, facing each other for eternity.
[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:23.020]   And so in that configuration, as it transits across the star, it kind of looks like you
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:24.700]   can't really resolve those two planets.
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:27.740]   It just looks like one planet to you that's going across the star.
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:31.540]   The temporal resolution of the data is rarely good enough to distinguish that.
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:36.300]   And so you'd see one transit, but in fact it's two planets very close together, which
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:37.900]   are transiting at once.
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:42.580]   And so, yeah, we wrote a paper just recently where we developed some techniques to try
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:47.340]   and get around this problem, and hopefully provide a tool where we could finally look
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:48.340]   for these planets.
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:50.620]   The problem of detection of these planets when they're so close together.
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:55.460]   That was our focus, was how do you get around this merging problem.
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:47:00.060]   So whether they're out there or not, we don't know.
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:04.580]   We're planning to do a search for them, but it remains an open question.
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:09.660]   And I think just one of those fun astrophysics curiosities questions, whether binary planets
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:10.660]   exist in the universe.
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:15.060]   Because then you have binary Earths, you could have binary Neptune, all sorts of wild stuff
[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.940]   that would float the sci-fi imagination.
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:22.140]   - I wonder what the physics on a binary planet feels like.
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:23.340]   It might be trivial.
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:25.180]   I have to think about that.
[00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:26.980]   I wonder if there's some interesting dynamics.
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:31.940]   Like, if you have multiple, or would gravity feel different on different parts of the surface
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:34.380]   of the sphere when there's another large sphere?
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:39.980]   - Yeah, I would think that the force would be fairly similar, because the shape of the
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:45.500]   object would deform to a flat geopotential, essentially a uniform geopotential.
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.940]   But it would lead to a distorted shape for the two objects.
[00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:52.420]   I think they'd become ellipsoids facing one another.
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:57.620]   So it would be pretty wild when people like flat Earth or spherical Earth, you fly from
[00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:59.620]   space and you see a football-shaped Earth.
[00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:02.420]   - Finally, there's proof.
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:06.100]   And I wonder how difficult it would be to travel from one to the other, because you
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.300]   have to overcome the one.
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:11.700]   No, it might be kind of easy.
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:15.180]   - Yeah, I mean, they're so close to each other, that helps.
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:17.980]   And I think the most critical factor would be how massive is the planet.
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:21.860]   That's always, I mean, one of the challenges with escaping planets, there was a fun paper
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:26.860]   one of my colleagues wrote that suggested that super-Earth planets may be inescapable.
[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:31.620]   If you're a civilization that were born on a super-Earth, the surface gravity is so high
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:39.700]   that the chemical potential energy of hydrogen or methane, whatever fuel you're using, simply
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:43.060]   is at odds with the gravity of the planet itself.
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:47.140]   And so you would, you know, our current rockets, I'm not sure of the fraction, but maybe like
[00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:49.760]   90% of the rocket is fuel or something by mass.
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:55.660]   These things would have to be like the size of the Giza pyramids of fuel with just a tiny
[00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:59.380]   tip on the top in order just to escape that planetary atmosphere.
[00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:04.580]   And so it has been argued that if you live on a super-Earth, you may be forced to live
[00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:05.580]   there forever.
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:09.100]   There may be no escape unless you invent a space elevator or something, but then how
[00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:13.820]   do you even build the infrastructure and space to do something like that in the absence of
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:16.260]   a successful rocket program?
[00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:21.820]   And so the more and more we look at our Earth and think about the sorts of problems we're
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:27.300]   facing, the more you see things about the Earth which make it ideally suited in so many
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:28.300]   regards.
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:32.420]   It's so spooky, right, that we not only live on a planet which has the right conditions
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:37.140]   for life, for intelligent life, for sustained fossil fuel industry, just happens to be in
[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:38.140]   the ground.
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:41.820]   We have plenty of fossil fuels to get our industrial revolution going.
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:47.260]   But also the chemical energy contained within those fossil fuels and hydrogen and other
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:52.020]   fuels is sufficient that we have the ability to escape our planetary atmosphere and planetary
[00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:54.540]   gravity to have a space program.
[00:49:54.540 --> 00:50:00.060]   And we also happen to have a celestial body which is just within reach, the Moon, which
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:02.100]   doesn't also necessarily have to be true.
[00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:07.440]   Were the Moon not there, what effect would that have had on our aspirations of a space
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.380]   program in the 1960s?
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:12.700]   Would there have ever been a space race to Mars or to Venus?
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:13.700]   It's a much harder...
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:17.260]   Certainly for a human program, that seems almost impossible with 1960s technology to
[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:18.620]   imagine ever come to fruition.
[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:25.020]   It's almost as if somebody constructed a set of challenging obstacles before us, challenging
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:26.780]   problems to solve.
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:29.260]   They're challenging, but they're doable.
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:30.900]   And there's a sequence of them.
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:35.780]   Gravity is very difficult to overcome, but we have, given the size of Earth, it's not
[00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:40.100]   so bad that we could still actually construct propulsion systems that can escape it.
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:41.100]   Yeah.
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:42.100]   And the same with climate change, perhaps.
[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:46.580]   I mean, climate change is the next major problem facing our civilization.
[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:50.020]   But we know it is technically surmountable.
[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:57.800]   It does seem sometimes like there has been a series of challenges laid out to progress
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:02.460]   us towards a mature civilization that can one day perhaps expand to the stars.
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:09.580]   I'm a little more concerned about nuclear weapons, AI, and natural or artificial pandemics.
[00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:10.580]   But yes, climate change is...
[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:11.580]   Well, there you go.
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:14.860]   I mean, plenty of milestones that we need to cross.
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:18.940]   And we can argue about the severity of each of them, but there is no doubt that we live
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:25.180]   in a world that has serious challenges that are pushing our intellects and our will to
[00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:31.420]   the limit of whether we're really ready to progress to the next stage of our development.
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:34.540]   So thank you for taking the tangent, and there'll be a million more.
[00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:38.500]   But can we step back to Kepler-1625b?
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:39.500]   What is it?
[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:48.140]   And you've talked about this kind of journey, this effort to discover exomoons, so moons
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:52.900]   out there, or small, cool objects out there.
[00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:55.180]   Where does that effort stand, and what is Kepler-1625b?
[00:51:55.180 --> 00:52:00.380]   Yeah, I mean, I've been searching for exomoons for most of my professional career.
[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:08.820]   And I think a lot of my colleagues think I'm kind of crazy to still be doing it.
[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:12.180]   After five years of not finding anything, I think most people would probably try doing
[00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:13.180]   something else.
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:14.180]   I even had people say that to me.
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:15.180]   They said, you know, professors.
[00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:21.340]   I remember at a cocktail party, took me to the side, an MIT professor, and he said, "You
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:23.260]   know, you should just look for hot Jupiters.
[00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:24.260]   They're everywhere.
[00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:25.260]   You can write papers.
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:26.260]   They're so easy to find."
[00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:32.140]   And I was like, "Yeah, but hot Jupiters, they're not interesting to me.
[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:38.700]   I want to do something that I feel intellectually pushes me to the edge, and is maybe a contribution
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:44.420]   that not no one else could do, but maybe is not certainly the thing that anybody could
[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:45.420]   do.
[00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:47.660]   I don't want to just be the first to something for the sake of being first.
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:53.300]   I want to do something that feels like a meaningful intellectual contribution to our society."
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:58.420]   And so, this exomoon problem has been haunting me for years to try and solve this.
[00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:03.020]   Now as I said, we looked for years and years using Kepler, and the closest we ever got
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:05.620]   was just a hint for this one star.
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:11.220]   Kepler-1625 has a Jupiter-like planet in orbit of it, and that Jupiter-like planet is on
[00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:16.700]   a 287-day period, so it's almost the same distance as the Earth around the Sun, but
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:19.140]   for a Jupiter.
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:20.700]   So that was already unusual.
[00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:25.260]   I don't think people realize that Jupiter-like planets are quite rare in the universe.
[00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:30.780]   Certainly mini-Neptunes and Neptunes are extremely common, but Jupiters, only about 10% of Sun-like
[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:33.380]   stars have Jupiters around them, as far as we can tell.
[00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:36.140]   - When you say Jupiter, which aspect of Jupiter?
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:39.380]   - In terms of its mass and its semi-major axis.
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:44.500]   So anything beyond about half an AU, so half the distance of the Earth and the Sun, and
[00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:49.460]   something of order of a tenth of a Jupiter mass, that's the mass of Saturn, up to say
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:53.580]   ten Jupiter masses, which is basically where you start to get to brown dwarfs.
[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:56.620]   Those types of objects appear to be somewhat unusual.
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:54:02.620]   Most solar systems do not have Jupiters, which is really interesting, because Jupiter, again,
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:07.420]   like the Moon, seems to have been a pivotal character in the story of the development
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:12.580]   of our solar system, perhaps especially having a large influence on the development of the
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:16.580]   late heavy bombardment and the rate of asteroid impacts that we receive and things like this.
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:23.700]   Anyway, to come back to 1625, this Jupiter-like planet had a hint of something in the data.
[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:28.580]   What I mean by that is when we looked at the transit, we got the familiar decrease in light
[00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:31.060]   that we always see when a planet tries to come in front of the star.
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:37.140]   But we saw something extra; just on the edges we saw some extra dips around the outside.
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:39.760]   It was right at the hairy edge of detectability.
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:45.620]   We didn't believe it, because I think one of the challenges of looking for something
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:49.460]   for ten years is that you become your own greatest skeptic.
[00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:54.600]   And no matter what you're shown, you're always thinking, "I've been falling in love so many
[00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:58.220]   times and it's not working out."
[00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:01.580]   You convince yourself it's never going to happen.
[00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:02.580]   Not for me.
[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:03.940]   This just isn't going to happen.
[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:10.020]   I saw that and I didn't really believe it, because I didn't dare let myself believe it.
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:15.420]   But being a good scientist, we knew we had an obligation to publish it, to talk about
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:19.660]   the result, and to follow it up and to try and resolve what was going on.
[00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:24.540]   So we asked for Hubble Space Telescope time, which was awarded in that case.
[00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:27.860]   We were one of those lucky 20 that got telescope time.
[00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:32.220]   We stared at it for about 40 hours continuously.
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:37.260]   And to provide some context, the dip that we saw in the Kepa data corresponded to a
[00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:41.940]   Neptune-sized Moon around a Jupiter-sized planet, which was another reason why I was
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:42.940]   skeptical.
[00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:46.980]   We don't have that in the solar system; that seems so strange.
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:51.420]   And then when we got the Hubble data, it seemed to confirm exactly that.
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:57.740]   There were two really striking pieces of evidence in the data that suggested this Moon was there.
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:56:02.340]   Another was a fairly clear second dip in light, pretty clearly resolved by Hubble.
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:04.980]   It was about a five sigma detection.
[00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:09.580]   And on top of that, we could see the planet didn't transit when it should have done.
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:13.900]   It actually transited earlier than we expected it to, by about 20 minutes or so.
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:17.560]   And so that's a hallmark of a gravitational interaction between the planet and the Moon.
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:18.980]   We actually expected that.
[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:23.620]   You can also expect that if the Moon transits after the planet, then the planet should come
[00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:28.660]   in earlier than expected, because the barycenter, the center of mass, lives between the two
[00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:32.500]   of them, kind of like on a balancing arm between them.
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:33.580]   And so we saw that as well.
[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:35.620]   So the phase signature matched up.
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:40.540]   The mass of the Moon was measured to be Neptune mass, and the size of the Moon was measured
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:41.900]   to be Neptune radius.
[00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:46.220]   And so everything just really lined up.
[00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:50.100]   And we spent months and months trying to kill it.
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:53.180]   This is my strategy for anything interesting.
[00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:57.380]   We just try to throw the kitchen sink at it and say, "We must be tricked by something."
[00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:02.980]   And so we tried looking at the centroid motion of the telescope, the different wavelength
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:06.420]   channels that have been observed, the pixel level information.
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:08.980]   And no matter what we did, we just couldn't get rid of it.
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:11.740]   And so we submitted it to Science.
[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:15.500]   And I think at the time, Science, which is one of the top journals, said to us, "Would
[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:19.140]   you mind calling your paper 'Discovery of an Exomoon'?"
[00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:23.040]   And I had to push back, and we said, "No, we're not calling it that.
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:26.620]   I don't- even despite everything we've done, we're not calling it a discovery.
[00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:29.700]   We're calling it evidence for an exomoon."
[00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:34.540]   Because for me, I'd want to see this repeat two times, three times, four times before
[00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:38.380]   I really would bet my house that this is the real deal.
[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:44.660]   And I do worry, as I said, that perhaps that's my own self-skepticism going too far.
[00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:47.460]   But I think it was the right decision.
[00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:52.860]   And since that paper came out, there has been continuous interest in this subject.
[00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:57.500]   The team independently analysed that star and recovered actually pretty much exactly
[00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:02.500]   the same results as us, the same dip, the same wobble of the planet.
[00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:05.060]   And a third team looked at it, and they actually got something different.
[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:07.820]   They saw the dip was diminished compared to what we saw.
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:11.520]   They saw a little hint of a dip, but not as pronounced as what we saw.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:13.760]   And they saw the wobble as well.
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:21.960]   So there's been a little bit of tension about analysing the reduction of the Hubble data.
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:26.160]   And so the only way in my mind to resolve this is just to look again.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:29.140]   We actually did propose to Hubble straight after that.
[00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:35.060]   And we said, "Look, if our model is right, if the Moon is there, it came in late last
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:36.060]   time.
[00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:37.960]   It transited after the planet.
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:43.140]   Because of the orbit, we can calculate that it should transit before the planet next time.
[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:46.680]   If it's not there, if it doesn't transit before, and even if we see a dip afterwards, we know
[00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:48.140]   that's not our Moon.
[00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:50.700]   It's obviously some instrumental effect with the data."
[00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:53.840]   We had a causal prediction as to where the Moon should be.
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:58.180]   And so I was really excited about that, but we didn't get the telescope time.
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:02.100]   And unfortunately, if you go further into the future, we no longer have the predictive
[00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:03.160]   capability.
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:04.340]   Because it's like predicting the weather.
[00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:08.020]   You might be able to predict the weather next week to some level of accuracy, but predicting
[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:10.620]   the weather next year becomes incredibly hard.
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:15.020]   The uncertainties just grow and compound as you go forward into the future more and more.
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:18.460]   LB: How were you able to know where the Moon would be positioned?
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:25.460]   So you're able to tell the orbiting geometry and frequency?
[00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:32.580]   CB: Yeah, so basically from the wobbles of the planet itself, that tells us the orbital
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:34.260]   motion of the Moon.
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:35.980]   It's the reflex motion of the Moon on the planet.
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:39.940]   LB: But isn't it just an estimate where...
[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:42.620]   Like I'm concerned about you making a strong prediction here.
[00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:48.660]   Because if you don't get the Moon where the Moon leads on the next time around, if you
[00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:53.060]   did get Hubble time, couldn't that mean something else if you didn't see that?
[00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:55.580]   Because you said it would be an instrumental...
[00:59:55.580 --> 01:00:03.340]   I feel the strong urge to disprove your own, which is a really good imperative.
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:05.420]   It's a good way to do science.
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:09.100]   But this is such a noisy signal, right?
[01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.380]   Or blurry signal, maybe.
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:12.860]   Or resolution signal, maybe.
[01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:17.420]   CB: Yeah, I mean it's a five sigma signal, so that's at the slightly uncomfortable edge.
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:21.900]   I mean, it's often said that for any detection of a first new phenomena, you really want
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:24.220]   like a 20, 25 sigma detection.
[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:27.900]   Then there's just no doubt that what you're seeing is real.
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:28.900]   This was at that edge.
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:31.900]   I mean, I guess it's comparable to the Higgs boson, but the Higgs boson was slightly different
[01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:38.220]   because there was so much theoretical impetus as to expect a signal at that precise location.
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:40.580]   A Neptune-sized Moon was not predicted by anyone.
[01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:45.100]   There was no papers you can find that expect Neptune-sized Moons around Jupiter-sized planets.
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:50.300]   So I think we were inherently sceptical about its reality for that reason.
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:51.540]   But this is science in action.
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:57.980]   And when we fit the wobbles, we fit the dips, and we have this 3G geometric model for the
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:04.140]   motion of the orbit, and projecting that forward, we found that about 80% of our projections
[01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:05.780]   led to the Moon to be before.
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:06.780]   So it's not 100%.
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:10.460]   There was maybe 20% of the cases it was over here.
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:17.980]   But to me, that was a hard enough projection that we felt confident that we could refute
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:19.420]   the exit, which was what I really wanted.
[01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:23.900]   I wanted a refutable, that's the basis of science, a falsifiable hypothesis.
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:27.580]   How can you make progress in science if you don't have a falsifiable testable hypothesis?
[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:31.020]   And so that was the beauty of this particular case.
[01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:35.540]   So there's a numerical simulation with the Moon that fits the data that we observed,
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:40.100]   and then you can now make predictions based on that simulation.
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:41.100]   That's so cool.
[01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:42.100]   Okay.
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:43.100]   It's fun.
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:47.860]   These are like little solar systems that we can simulate on the computer and imagine their
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.260]   motions.
[01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:54.140]   But we are pushing things to the very limits of what's possible, and that's double-edged
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:55.140]   sword.
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:02:01.820]   It's both incredibly exciting intellectually, but you're always risking, to some degree,
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:03.580]   the pushing too far.
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:09.780]   So I'd like to ask you about the recent paper you co-authored, an exomoon survey of 70 cool
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:15.300]   giant exoplanets and the new candidate Kepler 1708 Bi.
[01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:19.300]   I would say there's like three or four candidates at this point, of which we have published
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:20.300]   two of them.
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:27.660]   And to me, two are quite compelling and deserve follow-up observations.
[01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:32.580]   And so to get a confirmed detection, at least in our case, we would need to see it repeat,
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:33.580]   for sure.
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:36.420]   One of the problems with some of the other methods that have been proposed is that you
[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:38.380]   don't get that repeatability.
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:41.860]   So for instance, an example of a technique that would lack that would be gravitational
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:43.180]   microlensing.
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:48.260]   So it's possible with a new telescope coming up in the future called the Roman Space Telescope,
[01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:53.300]   which is basically a repurposed spy satellite that's the size of the Hubble mirror going
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:55.100]   up into space.
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:03:00.220]   It will stare at millions of stars simultaneously, and it will look to see - instead of whether
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:05.460]   any of those stars get dimmer for a short amount of time, which would be a transit,
[01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:06.460]   it'll look for the opposite.
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:08.620]   It'll look to see if anything can get brighter.
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:13.140]   And that brightness increase is caused by another planetary system passing in front
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:17.780]   and then gravitationally lensing light around it to cause a brightening.
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:25.220]   So this is a method of discovering an entire solar system, but only for a glimpse.
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:29.460]   You just get a short glimpse of it passing like a ship sailing through the night, just
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.340]   that one photo of it.
[01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:35.540]   Now the problem with that is that it's very difficult.
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:40.220]   The physics of gravitational lensing are not surprisingly quite complicated.
[01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:42.260]   And so there's many, many possible solutions.
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:48.620]   So you might have a solution which is this could be a red dwarf star with a Jupiter-like
[01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:49.620]   planet around it.
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:50.700]   That's one solution.
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:55.540]   But another solution is that it's a free-floating planet, a rogue planet like Jupiter, with
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:57.240]   an Earth-like moon around it.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:00.160]   And those two solutions are almost indistinguishable.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:03.660]   Now ideally, we would be able to repeat the observation.
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:06.660]   We'd be able to go back and see, well, if the moon really is there, then we could predict
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:11.240]   its mass, its predicted motion, and expect it to be maybe over here next time or something.
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:14.700]   With microlensing, it's a one snapshot event.
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:20.580]   And so for me, it's intriguing as a way of revealing something about the exomoon population.
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:24.900]   But I always come back to transits because it's the only method we really have that's
[01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:30.700]   absolutely repeatable, that we'll be able to come back and prove to everyone that, look,
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:34.620]   on the 17th of October, the moon will be over here, and the moon will look like this, and
[01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:36.180]   we can actually capture that image.
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.840]   And that's what we see with, of course, many exoplanets.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:42.340]   So we want to get to that same point of full confidence, full confirmation, the slam-dunk
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:44.540]   detection of these exomoons.
[01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:53.140]   But yeah, it's been a hell of a journey to try and push the field into that direction.
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:56.820]   Is there some resistance to the transit method?
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:58.660]   Not to the transit method, I just say to exomoons.
[01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:03.700]   So the transit method is by far the most popular method for looking for exoplanets.
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:10.060]   But yeah, as I've alluded to, exomoons is kind of a niche topic within the discipline
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:11.380]   of exoplanets.
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:17.260]   And that's largely because there are people, I think, are waiting for those slam-dunks.
[01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:22.420]   And it was like, if you go back to the first exoplanet discovery that was made in 1995
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:27.860]   by Misha Mayor and Didier Queloz, I think it's true at the time that they were seen
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:29.340]   as mavericks.
[01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:33.780]   The idea of looking for planets around stars was considered fringe science.
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:38.040]   And I'm sure many colleagues told them, "Why don't you do something more safe, like study
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.420]   eclipsing stars?"
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:43.380]   Two binary star systems, we know those exist, so why are you wasting your time looking for
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:44.380]   planets?
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:48.700]   You're going to get this alien moniker or something, and you'll be seen as a fringe
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:50.180]   maverick scientist.
[01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:55.140]   And so I think it was quite difficult for those early planet hunters to get legitimacy
[01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:56.140]   and be taken seriously.
[01:05:56.140 --> 01:06:00.340]   And so very few people risked their careers to do it, except for those that were either
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:06.780]   emboldened to try or had maybe the career, maybe like a tenure or something, so they
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:10.060]   didn't have to necessarily worry about the implications of failure.
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:16.440]   And so once that happened, once they made the first discoveries, overnight everyone
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.500]   and their dog was getting into exoplanets.
[01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:23.820]   And all of a sudden the whole astronomy community shifted, and huge numbers of people that were
[01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:28.860]   once upon a time studying eclipsing binaries changed to becoming exoplanet scientists.
[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:31.380]   And so that was the first wave of exoplanet scientists.
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:36.560]   We're now in a kind of a second wave, or even a third wave, where people like me to some
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:40.060]   degree kind of grew up with the idea of exoplanets as being normal.
[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:43.620]   I was 11 years old, I guess, when the first exoplanet was discovered.
[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:48.760]   And so to me it was a fairly normal idea to grow up with.
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:53.780]   And so we've been trained in exoplanets from the very beginning.
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:59.460]   And so that brings a different perspective to those who have maybe transitioned from
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:01.960]   a different career path.
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:09.340]   And so I suspect with exomoons and probably technosignatures, astrobiology, many of the
[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:16.060]   topics which are seen at the fringes of what's possible, they will all open up into becoming
[01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:17.680]   mainstream one day.
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:23.940]   But there's a lot of people who are just waiting, waiting for that assuredness that there is
[01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:28.380]   a secure career net ahead of them before they commit.
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:35.220]   - Yeah, it does seem to me that exomoons open wider or open for the first time the door
[01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:37.060]   to aliens.
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:42.620]   Just more seriously, academically studying, all right, let's look at alien worlds.
[01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:48.020]   So I think it's still pretty fringe to talk about alien life, even on Mars and the moons
[01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:49.020]   and so on.
[01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:53.780]   You're kind of like, it would be nice, but imagine the first time to discover a living
[01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:54.780]   organism.
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:08:00.380]   That's gonna change, then everybody will look like an idiot for not focusing everything
[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:01.380]   on this.
[01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:06.220]   'Cause the possibility of the things, it's possible it might be super boring.
[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:11.940]   It might be very boring bacteria, but even the existence of life elsewhere, I mean, that
[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:12.940]   changes everything.
[01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:14.660]   That means life is everywhere.
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:19.800]   - If you knew now that in five years, 10 years, the first life would be discovered elsewhere,
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:25.460]   you knew that in advance, it would surely affect the way you approach your entire career.
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:28.580]   Especially someone junior in astronomy, you would surely be like, well, this is clearly
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:32.980]   gonna be the direction I have to dedicate my classes and my training and my education
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:33.980]   towards that direction.
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:35.900]   - All the new textbooks, all the--
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:36.900]   - Right.
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:38.660]   - You have to be written.
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:45.780]   And I think there's a lot of value to hedging, like allocating some of the time to that possibility.
[01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:52.700]   Because the kind of discoveries we might get in the next few decades, it feels like we're
[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:59.420]   on the verge of getting a lot of really good data and having better and better tools that
[01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:00.420]   can process that data.
[01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:05.380]   So there's just going to be a continuous increase of the kind of discoveries that will open.
[01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:08.540]   But a slam dunk, that's hard to come by.
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:12.860]   - Yeah, I think a lot of us are anticipating, I mean, we're already seeing it to some degree
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:15.620]   with Venus and the phosphine incident.
[01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:19.460]   But we've seen it before with Bill Clinton's in the White House lawn announcing life from
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:26.500]   Mars and there are inevitably gonna be spurious claims, or at least claims which are ambiguous
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:27.940]   to some degree.
[01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:34.080]   There will be for sure a high profile journal like Nature or Science that will one day publish
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:39.100]   a paper saying, "Biosignature discovered" or something like that on TRAPPIST-1 or some
[01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:40.300]   other planet.
[01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:44.660]   And then there will be years of back and forth in the literature.
[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:47.740]   And that might seem frustrating, but that's how science works.
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:52.980]   That's the mechanism of science at play, of people scrutinizing the results to intense
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:54.420]   skepticism.
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:59.740]   And it's like a crucible, you know, you burn away all irrelevances until whatever is left
[01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:00.900]   is the truth.
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:05.700]   And so you're left with this product which is that, okay, we either believe or don't
[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:07.180]   believe that biosignatures are there.
[01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:11.540]   So there's inevitably going to be a lot of controversy and debate and argument about
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.540]   it.
[01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:13.540]   We just have to anticipate that.
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:18.320]   And so I think you have to basically have a thick skin to some degree, academically,
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:20.200]   to dive into that world.
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:25.880]   And you're seeing that with phosphine.
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:31.400]   It's been uncomfortable to watch from the outside, the kind of dialogue that some of
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.200]   the scientists have been having with each other about that.
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.200]   Because...
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:37.200]   >>They get a little aggressive.
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:41.200]   >>Yeah, and you can understand why, because...
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.200]   >>Jealousy?
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.200]   I don't know.
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:44.960]   That's me saying, not you.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.800]   That's me talking.
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:55.080]   I'm sure there's some envy and jealousy involved on the behalf of those who are not part of
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.760]   the original discovery.
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:01.640]   But there's also, in any case, just leave the particular people involved in Venus alone,
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:09.120]   in any case of making a claim of that magnitude, especially life, because life is pretty much
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:14.100]   one of the biggest discoveries of all time, you can imagine, scientifically.
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:18.940]   You can see, and I'm so conscious of this in myself when I get close to, as I said,
[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:24.040]   even the much smaller goal of setting an exomoon, the ego creeping.
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:28.080]   And so as a scientist, we have to be so guarded against our own egos.
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:36.160]   You see the lights in your eyes of a Nobel Prize, or the fame and fortune and being remembered
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:37.160]   in the history books.
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:41.840]   And we all grew up in our training learning about Newton and Einstein, these giants of
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:44.320]   the field, Feynman and Maxwell.
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:51.280]   And you get the idea of these individual contributions which get immortalized for all time, and that's
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.280]   seductive.
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:57.360]   It's why many of us with the skill set to go into maybe banking instead decided, actually,
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:01.480]   there's something about the idea of being immortalized and contributing towards society
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:06.880]   in a permanent way that is more attractive than the financial reward of applying my skills
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:07.880]   elsewhere.
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:12.520]   And to some degree, that ego can be a benefit because it brings in skillful people into
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:16.200]   our field who might otherwise be tempted by money elsewhere.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:23.420]   But on the other hand, the closer you get towards when you start flirting with that
[01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:27.880]   Nobel Prize in your eyes, or you think you're on the verge of seeing something, you can
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:29.640]   lose objectivity.
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:33.400]   A very famous example of this is Barnard's Star.
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:39.320]   There was a planet claimed there by Peter van der Kamp, I think it was in 1968, 69.
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:43.160]   And at the time, it would have been the first ever exoplanet ever claimed.
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:47.400]   And he felt assured that this planet was there.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:50.800]   He was actually using the wobbling star method, but using the positions of the stars to see
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.800]   them, to claim this exoplanet.
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:57.760]   It turned out that this planet was not there.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:01.680]   Subsequent analyses by both dynamicists and theorists and those looking at the instrumental
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:09.080]   data established fairly unanimously that there was no way this planet was really there.
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:14.080]   But Peter van der Kamp insisted it was there, despite overwhelming evidence that was accruing
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.320]   against him.
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:22.200]   And even to the day he died, which was I think in the early 90s, he was still insisting this
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:26.980]   planet was there, even when we were starting to make the first genuine exoplanet discoveries.
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:31.860]   And even at that point, I think Hubble had even looked at that star and had totally ruled
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:35.060]   out any possibility of what he was talking about.
[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:36.340]   And so that's a problem.
[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:41.520]   How do you get to a point as a scientist where you just can't accept anything that comes
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.520]   otherwise?
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:49.740]   Because it starts out with the dream of fame, and then it ends in a stubborn refusal to
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:50.740]   ever back down.
[01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:57.500]   Of course, the flip side of that is sometimes you need that to have the strength to carry
[01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:02.980]   a belief against the entire scientific community that resists your beliefs.
[01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:05.180]   And so it's a double-edged sword.
[01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:09.500]   - That can happen, but I guess the distinction here is evidence.
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:17.340]   So in this case, the evidence was so overwhelming, it wasn't really a matter of interpretation.
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:23.340]   You had observed this star with the same star, but with maybe 10, even 100 times greater
[01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:26.900]   precision for much longer periods of time.
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:31.540]   And there was just no doubt at this point this planet was a mirage.
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:32.540]   And so that's why you have to be very careful.
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:37.020]   I always say, don't ever name my wife and my daughter, like, "Name this planet after
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:38.020]   me that you discover."
[01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:44.660]   I can't ever name a planet after you, because I won't be objective anymore.
[01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:48.780]   How could I ever turn around to you and say that planet wasn't real that I named after
[01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:49.780]   you?
[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:53.380]   - So you're somebody that talks about, and it's clear in your eyes and in your way of
[01:14:53.380 --> 01:15:02.260]   being that you love the process of discovery, that joy, the magic of just seeing something,
[01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:05.700]   a new observation, a new idea.
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:13.540]   But I guess the point is when you have that great feeling is to then switch on the skepticism,
[01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:17.660]   to start testing what does this actually mean?
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:18.660]   Is this real?
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:23.380]   What are the possible different interpretations that could make this a lot less grand than
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:25.340]   I first imagined?
[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:28.900]   So both have the wonder and the skepticism all in one brain.
[01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:34.500]   - Yeah, I think generally the more I want something to be true, the more I inherently
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:35.500]   doubt it.
[01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:41.900]   And I think that just comes from, you know, I grew up with a religious family and was
[01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:45.660]   just sort of indoctrinated to some degree, like many children are, that, okay, this is
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:49.300]   normal, that there's a God and this is the way the world is.
[01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:50.300]   God created the Earth.
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:56.980]   And then as I became more well-read and illiterate of what was happening in the world scientifically,
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:58.500]   I started to doubt.
[01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:03.820]   And it really just struck me that the hardest thing to let go of when you do decide not
[01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:07.980]   to be religious anymore, and it's not really like a light bulb moment, but it just kind
[01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:12.380]   of happens over sort of 11 to 13, I think for me it was happening.
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:18.060]   But it's that sadness of letting go of this beautiful dream which you had in your mind
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:22.260]   of eternal life for behaving yourself on Earth.
[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:25.900]   You would have this beautiful heaven that you could go to and live forever.
[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:27.780]   And that's very attractive.
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:34.740]   And for me personally, that was one of the things that pulled me against it.
[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:41.820]   It's like it's too good to be true, and it's very convenient that this could be so.
[01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:47.260]   And I have no evidence directly in terms of a scientific sense to support this hypothesis.
[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:53.340]   And it just became really difficult to reconcile my growth as a scientist.
[01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:56.620]   And I know some people find that reconciliation.
[01:16:56.620 --> 01:16:58.380]   I have not.
[01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:00.980]   Maybe I will one day.
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:07.780]   But as a general guiding principle, which I think I obtained from that experience, was
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:12.580]   that I have to be extremely guarded about what I want to be true, because it's going
[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:18.320]   to sway me to say things which are not true if I'm not careful.
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:21.420]   And that's not what we're trying to do as scientists.
[01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:26.700]   So you felt from a religious perspective that there was a little bit of a gravitational
[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:31.860]   field in terms of your opinions, like it was affecting how you could be as a scientist.
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:35.300]   Like as a scientific thinker, obviously, you were young.
[01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:39.500]   Yeah, I think that's true.
[01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:48.060]   Whenever there's something you want to be true, it's the ultimate seduction, intellectually.
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:53.500]   And I worry about this a lot with UFOs.
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:58.540]   It's true already with things like Venus, phosphine, and searching for astrobiological
[01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:00.120]   signals.
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:04.380]   We have to guard against this all the way through, from however we're looking for life,
[01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:06.780]   however we're looking for whatever this big question is.
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:11.800]   There is a part of us, I think I would love there to be life in the universe.
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:19.220]   I hope there is life in the universe, but I've been on record several times as being
[01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:25.060]   fairly firm about trying to remain consciously agnostic about that question.
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:30.500]   I don't want to make up my mind about what the answer is before I've collected evidence
[01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:31.860]   to inform that decision.
[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:33.300]   That's how science should work.
[01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:37.540]   If I already know what the answer is, then what am I doing?
[01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:39.260]   That's not a scientific experiment anymore.
[01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:41.740]   You've already decided, so what are you trying to learn?
[01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:44.380]   What's the point of doing the experiment if you already know what the answer is?
[01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:45.380]   There's no point.
[01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:52.300]   It's so complicated, so if I'm being honest with myself, when I imagine the universe,
[01:18:52.300 --> 01:19:00.140]   so first thing I imagine about our world is that we humans, and me certainly as one particular
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:10.140]   human, know very, my first assumption is I know almost nothing about how anything works.
[01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:17.060]   So first of all, that actually applies for things that humans do know, like quantum mechanics,
[01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:21.340]   all the things that there's different expertises that I just have not dedicated to, so even
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:22.340]   that's starting point.
[01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:26.460]   But if we take all of knowledge as human civilization, we know almost nothing.
[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:31.220]   That's kind of an assumption I have, because it seems like we keep discovering mysteries,
[01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:36.820]   and it seems like history, human history, is defined by moments when we said, okay,
[01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:41.900]   we pretty much figured it all out, and then you realize a century later, when you said
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:43.460]   that you didn't figure out anything.
[01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:45.860]   Okay, so that's like a starting point.
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:52.820]   The second thing I have is I feel like the entirety of the universe is just filled with
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:57.140]   alien civilizations.
[01:19:57.140 --> 01:20:05.140]   Statistically, the important thing that enables that belief for me is that they don't have
[01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:08.500]   to be human-like, they can be anything.
[01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:13.700]   And it's just the fact that life exists, and just seeing the way life is on Earth, that
[01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:15.580]   it just finds a way.
[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:19.180]   It finds a way in so many different complicated environments.
[01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:20.500]   It finds a way.
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:26.260]   Whatever that force is, that same force has to find a way elsewhere also.
[01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:32.540]   But then if I'm also being honest, I don't know how many hours in a day I spend seriously
[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:35.940]   considering the possibility that we're alone.
[01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:42.900]   I don't know when my heart is in mind or filled with wonder, I think about all the different
[01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:44.920]   life that's out there.
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:49.980]   But to really imagine that we're alone, like really imagine all the vastness that's out
[01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:53.820]   there, we're alone, not even bacteria.
[01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:59.820]   I would say you don't have to believe that we are alone, but you have to admit it's a
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:05.260]   possibility of our ignorance of the universe so far.
[01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:10.700]   You can have a belief about something in the absence of evidence, and Carl Sagan famously
[01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:12.620]   described that as the definition of faith.
[01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:17.740]   If you believe something when there's no evidence, you have faith that there's life in the universe.
[01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:22.560]   But you can't demonstrate, you can't prove it mathematically, you can't show me evidence
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:23.560]   of that.
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:28.640]   - But is there some, so mathematically math is a funny thing, is there, I mean the way
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:35.560]   physicists think, like intuition, so basic reasoning, is there some value to that?
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:40.080]   - Well, I'd say we're always, there's certainly, you can certainly make a very good argument,
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:45.120]   I think you've kind of already made one, just the vastness of the universe is the default
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:49.560]   argument people often turn to, that surely there should be others out there, it's hard
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:50.560]   to imagine.
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:57.080]   There are of order of 10 to the 22 stars in our observable universe, and so really the
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:02.040]   question comes down to what is the probability of one of those 10 to the 22 planets, let's
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:07.760]   say, Earth-like planets, if they all have Earth-like planets, going on to form life,
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:08.760]   spontaneously.
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:14.200]   That's the process of abiogenesis, the spontaneous emergence of life.
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:16.080]   - Also the word spontaneous is a funny one.
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:24.960]   - Yeah, okay, maybe we won't use spontaneous, but not being, let's say, seeded by some other
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:27.440]   civilization or something like that, it naturally emerges.
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:33.680]   - 'Cause even the word spontaneous makes it seem less likely, like there's just this chemistry
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:34.840]   and an extremely random process.
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:38.440]   - Right, it could be a very gradual process, over millions of years of growing complexity
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:40.240]   in chemical networks.
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:44.520]   - Maybe there's a force in the universe that pushes it towards interesting complexity,
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:49.480]   pockets of complexity, that ultimately creates something like life which we can't possibly
[01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:50.680]   define yet.
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:54.800]   And sometimes it manifests itself into something that looks like humans, but it could be a
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:59.440]   totally different kind of computational information processing system that we're too dumb to even
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:00.440]   visualize.
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:04.560]   - Yeah, I mean, certainly, it's kind of weird that complexity develops at all, right?
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:09.960]   Because it seems like the opposite to our physical intuition, if you're training in
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:13.640]   physics, of entropy, that things should, you know, complexity's hard to spontaneously,
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:18.240]   or I shouldn't say spontaneously, but hard to emerge in general.
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:20.040]   And so that's an interesting problem.
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:25.200]   I think there's been, certainly from an evolutionary perspective, you do see growing complexity.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:29.960]   And there's a nice argument, I think it's by Gould, who shows that if you have a certain
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:35.080]   amount of complexity, it can either become less complex or more complex through random
[01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:36.440]   mutation.
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:40.360]   And the less complex things are stripping away something, something that was necessary
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:42.360]   potentially to their survival.
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:46.680]   And so in general, that's going to be not particularly useful in its survival, and so
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:51.240]   it's going to be detrimental to strip away a significant amount of its useful traits.
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:56.440]   Whereas if you add something, the most typical thing that you add is probably not useful
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:57.440]   at all.
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:01.880]   It probably just doesn't really affect its survival negatively, but neither does it provide
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:04.380]   any significant benefit.
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:07.340]   But sometimes, on rare occasions, of course, it will be of benefit.
[01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:12.100]   And so if you have a certain level of complexity, it's hard to go back in complexity, but it's
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:16.120]   fairly easy to go forward with enough bites at the cherry.
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:17.920]   You will eventually build up in complexity.
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:24.000]   And that tends to be why we see complexity grow, certainly in an evolutionary sense,
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.400]   but also perhaps it's operating in chemical networks that led to the emergence of life.
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:34.560]   I guess the real problem I have with the numbers game, just to come back to that, is that we
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:38.000]   are talking about a certain probability of that occurring.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:43.000]   It may be to go from the primordial soup, however you want to call it, the ingredients
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.860]   that the Earth started with, the organic molecules, the probability of going from that initial
[01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:53.020]   condition to something that was capable of Darwinian natural selection that maybe we
[01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:55.260]   could define as life.
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:59.340]   The probability of that is maybe 1%, 1% of the time that happens, in which case you're
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:02.200]   right, the universe will be absolutely teeming with life.
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:07.060]   But it could also be 10 to the power of minus 10, in which case it's 1 per galaxy, or 10
[01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:12.340]   to the power of minus 100, in which case the vast majority of universes even do not have
[01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:13.340]   life within it.
[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:14.340]   - Or 90%.
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:15.340]   - Or 90%.
[01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:21.620]   - You said 1%, but it could be 90% if the conditions, the chemical conditions of a planet
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:23.460]   are correct, or a moon are correct.
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:24.460]   - I admit that.
[01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:26.140]   It could be any of those numbers.
[01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:34.020]   And the challenge is we just have no rigorous reason to expect why 90% is any...
[01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:38.060]   Because we're talking about a probability for probability.
[01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:43.300]   Is 90% more a priori likely than 10 to the power of minus 20?
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:48.940]   - Well, the thing is we do have an observation, N of one, of Earth.
[01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:54.020]   And it's difficult to know what to do with that, what kind of intuition you build on
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:59.620]   top of that, because on Earth, it seems like life finds a way.
[01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:03.940]   In all kinds of conditions, in all kinds of crazy conditions.
[01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:07.340]   And it's able to build up from the basic chemistry.
[01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:13.340]   You could say, okay, maybe it takes a little bit of time to develop some complicated technology
[01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:15.700]   like mitochondria, I don't know, like photosynthesis.
[01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:21.500]   Fine, but it seems to figure it out and do it extremely well.
[01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:25.660]   - Yeah, but I would say you're describing a different process.
[01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:30.740]   Maybe I'm at fault for separating these two processes, but to me, you're describing basically
[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:33.340]   natural selection evolution at that point.
[01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:37.900]   Whereas I'm really describing abiogenesis, which is to me a separate distinct process.
[01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:43.420]   - To you limited to human scientists, yes, but why would it be a separate process?
[01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:48.220]   Why is the birth of life a separate process from the process of life?
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:49.220]   Why is the...
[01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:54.180]   I mean, we're uncomfortable with the Big Bang.
[01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:56.260]   We're uncomfortable with the first thing, I think.
[01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:57.620]   Like, where did this come from?
[01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:01.180]   - Right, so I think I would say, I just twist that question around and say, you're saying
[01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:04.700]   why is it a different process?
[01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:06.700]   And I would say, why shouldn't it be a different process?
[01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:13.100]   Which isn't really a good defense, except to say that we have knowledge of how natural
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:14.220]   selection evolution works.
[01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:16.620]   We think we understand that process.
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:21.980]   We have almost no information about the earliest stages of how life emerged on our planet.
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:25.740]   It may be that you're right, and it is a part of a continuum.
[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:32.440]   It may be that it is also a distinct, improbable set of circumstances that led to the emergence
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:33.440]   of life.
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:38.600]   As a scientist, I'm just trying to be open-minded to both possibilities.
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:44.380]   If I assert that life must be everywhere, to me, you run the risk of experimenter's
[01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:45.820]   bias.
[01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:50.020]   If you think you know what the answer is, if you look at an Earth-like planet and you
[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:55.020]   are preconditioned to think there's a 90% chance of life on this planet, it's going
[01:27:55.020 --> 01:28:00.140]   to, at some level, affect your interpretation of that data.
[01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:07.740]   Whereas if I, however critical you might be of the agnosticism that I impose upon myself,
[01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:13.140]   remain open to both possibilities, then I trust in myself to make a fair assessment
[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:16.620]   as to the reality of that evidence for life.
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:23.660]   - Yeah, but I wonder, sort of scientifically, and that's really beautiful to hear, and inspiring
[01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:33.500]   to hear, I wonder scientifically how many firsts we truly know of, and that we don't
[01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:42.540]   eventually explain as actually a step number one million in a long process.
[01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:48.460]   So I think that's a really interesting thing if there's truly firsts in this universe.
[01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:53.660]   For us, whatever happened at the Big Bang is a kind of first, the origin of stuff.
[01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:59.660]   But it just, again, it seems like history shows that we'll figure out that it's actually
[01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:00.860]   a continuation of something.
[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:06.260]   But then physicists say that time is emergent, and that our causality in time is a very human
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:09.940]   kind of construct, that it's very possible that all of this, so there could be really
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:14.740]   firsts of a thing to which we attach a name.
[01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:18.580]   So whatever we call life, maybe there is an origin of it.
[01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:23.260]   - Yeah, and I would also say I'm open to the idea of it being part of a continuation, but
[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:27.220]   the continuation maybe is more broader, and it's a continuation of chemical systems and
[01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:28.540]   chemical networks.
[01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:33.620]   And what we call this one particular type of chemistry in this behavior of chemistry
[01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:40.460]   is life, but it is just one manifestation of all the trillions of possible permutations
[01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:42.940]   in which chemical reactions can occur.
[01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:47.820]   And we assert specialness to it because that's what we are.
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:51.500]   And so it's also true of intelligence, you could extend the same thing and say, you know,
[01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:56.420]   we're looking for intelligent life in the universe, and then you sort of, where do you
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:57.940]   define intelligence?
[01:29:57.940 --> 01:30:00.900]   Where's that continuum of something that's really like us?
[01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:01.900]   Are we alone?
[01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:09.300]   There may be a continuum of chemical systems, a continuum of intelligences out there, and
[01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:14.900]   we have to be careful of our own arrogance, of assuming specialness about what we are,
[01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:19.940]   that we are some distinct category of phenomena.
[01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:24.140]   Whereas the universe doesn't really care about what category we are, it's just doing what
[01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:29.780]   it's doing, and doing everything in infinite diversity and infinite combinations, essentially
[01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:30.780]   what it's doing.
[01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:37.020]   And so we are taking this one slice and saying, no, this has to be treated separately.
[01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:42.700]   And I'm open to the idea that it could be a truly separate phenomenon, but it may just
[01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:46.860]   be like a snowflake, every snowflake's different.
[01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:53.300]   It may just be that this one particular iteration is another variant of the vast continuum.
[01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:58.540]   - And maybe the algorithm of natural selection itself is an invention of Earth.
[01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:04.660]   I kind of also tend to suspect that this, whatever the algorithm is, it kind of operates
[01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:07.620]   at all levels throughout the universe.
[01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:15.880]   But maybe this is a very kind of peculiar thing, that where there's a bunch of chemical
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:22.420]   systems that compete against each other somehow for survival under limited resources, and
[01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:24.500]   that's a very Earth-like thing.
[01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:29.980]   You have a nice balance of, there's a large number of resources, enough to have a bunch
[01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:36.980]   of different kinds of systems competing, but not so many that they get lazy.
[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:41.140]   And maybe that's why bacteria were very lazy for a long time, maybe they didn't have much
[01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:42.140]   competition.
[01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:43.140]   - Quite possibly.
[01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:51.260]   I mean, I try to, as fun as it is to get into the speculation about the definitions of life
[01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:58.380]   and what life does, and this gross network of possibilities, honestly for me, the strongest
[01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:05.620]   argument for remaining agnostic is to avoid that bias in assessing data.
[01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:06.620]   I mean, we've seen it.
[01:32:06.620 --> 01:32:12.180]   I mean, Percival Lowell I talked about on my channel, maybe last year or two years ago,
[01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:16.340]   you know, he's a very famous astronomer who in the 19th century was claiming the evidence
[01:32:16.340 --> 01:32:19.260]   of canals on Mars.
[01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:24.500]   And from him, from his perspective, and even at the time, culturally, it was widely accepted
[01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:26.300]   that Mars would of course have life.
[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:29.820]   I mean, I think it seems silly to us, but it was kind of similar arguments to what we're
[01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:30.820]   using now about exoplanets.
[01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:35.020]   That, well, of course there must be life in the universe, how could it just be here?
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:38.820]   And so it seemed obvious to people that when you looked at Mars with its polar caps, even
[01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:45.100]   its atmosphere, had seasons, it seemed obvious to them that that too would be a place where
[01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:49.300]   life not only was present, but had emerged to a civilization which actually was fairly
[01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:53.060]   comparable in technology to our own, because it was building canal systems.
[01:32:53.060 --> 01:32:58.140]   Of course, the canal system seems a bizarre technosignature to us, but it was a product
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:32:59.180]   of their time.
[01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:02.180]   To them, that was the cutting edge in technology.
[01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:06.300]   It should be a warning shot, actually, a little bit for us that if we think, you know, solar
[01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:12.500]   panels or building star links or whatever, space mining is like an inevitable technosignature,
[01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:17.940]   that may be laughably antiquated compared to what other civilizations far more advanced
[01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:18.940]   than us may be doing.
[01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:23.500]   And so anyway, Percival Lowell, I think, was a product of his time that he thought life
[01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:24.500]   was there.
[01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:26.460]   Inevitably, he even wrote about it extensively.
[01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:31.540]   And so when he saw these lines, these lineae on the surface of Mars, to him it was just
[01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:33.400]   obvious they were canals.
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:36.260]   And that was experimenters' bias playing out.
[01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:40.740]   He was told, for one, that he had basically the greatest eyesight out of any of his peers.
[01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:45.220]   An ophthalmologist had told him that in Boston, that his eyesight was absolutely spectacular.
[01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:49.420]   So he was convinced everything he saw was real.
[01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:51.860]   And secondly, he was convinced there was life there.
[01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:53.980]   And so to him, it just added up.
[01:33:53.980 --> 01:34:01.100]   And then that kind of wasted decades of research, of treating the idea of Mars being inhabited
[01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:03.980]   by this canal civilization.
[01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:07.860]   But on the other hand, it's maybe not a waste because it is a lesson in history of how we
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:13.580]   should be always on guard against our own preconceptions and biases about whether life
[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:14.580]   is out there.
[01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:18.300]   And furthermore, what types of things life might do if it is there.
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:22.120]   - If I were running this simulation, which we'll also talk about because you make the
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:26.060]   case against it, but if I were running a simulation, I would definitely put you in a room with an
[01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:30.660]   alien just to see you mentally freak out for hours at a time.
[01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:36.060]   You for sure would have thought, you will be convinced that you've lost your mind.
[01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:41.540]   - I mean, no, not that, but I mean, if we discover life, we discover interesting new
[01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:45.620]   physical phenomena, I think the right approach is definitely to be extremely skeptical and
[01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:49.100]   be very, very careful about things you want to be true.
[01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:51.620]   That's really- - Yeah, I would say, I'm not like some extreme
[01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:53.900]   denialist of evidence.
[01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:58.340]   If there was compelling evidence for life on another planet, I would be the first one
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:02.340]   to be celebrating that and be shaking hands with the alien on the White House lawn or
[01:35:02.340 --> 01:35:03.340]   whatever.
[01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:08.940]   I grew up with Star Trek and that was my fantasy was to be Captain Kirk and fly across the
[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:10.420]   stars meeting other civilizations.
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:17.060]   So there's nothing more I'd want to be true, as I've said, but we just have to guard against
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:20.140]   it when we're assessing data.
[01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:27.100]   But I have to say, I'm very skeptical that we will ever have that Star Trek moment.
[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:32.900]   Even if there are other civilizations out there, they're never going to be at a point
[01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:37.260]   which is in technological lockstep with us, similar level of development.
[01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:43.660]   Even intellectually, the idea that they could have a conversation with us, even through
[01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:44.660]   a translator.
[01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:48.540]   I mean, we can't communicate with humpback whales, we can't communicate with dolphins
[01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:54.340]   in a meaningful way, we can sort of bark orders at them, but we can't have abstract conversations
[01:35:54.340 --> 01:35:56.460]   with them about things.
[01:35:56.460 --> 01:36:02.820]   And so the idea that we will ever have that fulfilling conversation, I'm deeply skeptical
[01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:03.820]   of.
[01:36:03.820 --> 01:36:04.980]   And I think a lot of us are drawn to that.
[01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:09.700]   It is maybe a replacement for God to some degree, that Father-Figure civilization that
[01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:15.700]   might step in, teach us the air of our ways, and bestow wisdom upon our civilization.
[01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:22.220]   But they could equally be a giant fungus that doesn't even understand the idea of socialization,
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:24.180]   because it's the only entity on its planet.
[01:36:24.180 --> 01:36:28.060]   It just swells over the entire surface.
[01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:32.500]   And it's incredibly intelligent, because maybe each node communicates with each other to
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:35.060]   create essentially a giant neural net.
[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:38.500]   But it has no sense of what communication even is.
[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:42.540]   And so alien life is out there, surely can be extremely diverse.
[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:48.700]   I'm pretty skeptical that we'll ever get that fantasy moment I always had as a kid, of having
[01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:50.980]   a dialogue within the civilization.
[01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:52.900]   - So dialogue, yes.
[01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:54.020]   What about noticing them?
[01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:55.900]   What about noticing signals?
[01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:57.280]   Do you hope...
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:01.300]   So one thing we've been talking about is getting signatures, biosignatures, technosignatures
[01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:03.100]   about other planets.
[01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:10.260]   Maybe if we're extremely lucky in our lifetime to be able to meet life forms, get evidence
[01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:14.820]   of living or dead life forms on Mars, or the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.
[01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:18.540]   What about getting signals from outer space, interstellar signals?
[01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:22.660]   What would those signals potentially look like?
[01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:26.580]   - That's a hard question to answer, because we are essentially engaging in xenopsychology
[01:37:26.580 --> 01:37:27.580]   to some degree.
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:31.220]   We're looking at the activities of another civilization.
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:32.220]   A lot of that is inevitable.
[01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:35.860]   - What does the word xenopsychology, I apologize to interrupt, mean?
[01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:37.580]   - Maybe I'm just fabricating that word, really.
[01:37:37.580 --> 01:37:45.420]   But trying to guess at the machinations and motivations of another intelligent being that
[01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:48.460]   was completely evolutionary divorced from us.
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:53.300]   - So it's like you said, exo-moons, it's exopsychology, extrasolar psychology.
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.500]   - Yeah.
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:38:00.140]   - Xenopsychology is another way of maybe making it more grounded.
[01:38:00.140 --> 01:38:04.180]   We can't really guess at their motivations too well, but we can look at the sorts of
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:08.260]   behaviors we engage in, and at least look for them.
[01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:11.980]   We're always guilty that when we look for biosignatures, we're really looking for, and
[01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:14.860]   even when we look for planets, we're looking for templates of Earth.
[01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:18.220]   When we look for biosignatures, we're looking for templates of Earth-based life.
[01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:22.060]   When we look for technosignatures, we tend to be looking for templates of our own behaviors
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:25.060]   or extrapolations of our behaviors.
[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:30.940]   So there's a very long list of technosignatures that people have suggested we could look for.
[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:34.460]   The earliest ones were, of course, radio beacons.
[01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:40.060]   That was sort of Project Osma that Frank Drake was involved in, trying to look for radiosignatures,
[01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:46.180]   which could either be just like blurting out high-power radiosignals saying, "Hey, we're
[01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:51.020]   here," or could even have encoded within them galactic encyclopedias for us to unlock, which
[01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:55.140]   has always been the allure of the radio technique.
[01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:58.780]   But there could also be unintentional signatures.
[01:38:58.780 --> 01:39:02.100]   For example, you could have something like the satellite system that we've produced around
[01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:06.360]   the Earth, the artificial satellite system, Starlink-type systems we mentioned.
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:10.940]   You could detect the glint of light across those satellites as they orbit around the
[01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:12.540]   planet.
[01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:16.460]   You could detect a geostationary satellite belt which would block out some light as the
[01:39:16.460 --> 01:39:18.840]   planet transited across the star.
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:23.360]   You could detect solar panels, potentially spectrally, on the surface of the planet.
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:24.360]   Heat island effects.
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:27.940]   New York is hotter than New York State by a couple of degrees because of the heat island
[01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:28.940]   effect of the city.
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:32.400]   And so you could thermally map different planets and detect these.
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:39.880]   So there's a large array of things that we do that we can go out and hypothesize we could
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:41.000]   look for.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.880]   And then on the furthest end of the scale, you have things which go far beyond our capabilities,
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:49.440]   such as warp drive signatures which have been proposed.
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:55.260]   These bright flashes of light or even gravitational wave detections from LIGO could be detected.
[01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:57.160]   You could have Dyson spheres.
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:02.200]   The idea of covering a star is completely covered by some kind of structure which collects
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:05.860]   all the light from the star to power the civilization.
[01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:10.940]   And that would be pretty easily detectable to some degree because you're transferring
[01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:13.880]   all of the visible light thermodynamically.
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:17.200]   It has to be re-emitted to come out as infrared light.
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:23.120]   So you'd have an incredibly bright infrared star, yet one that was visibly not present
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:24.120]   at all.
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:27.320]   And so that would be a pretty intriguing signature to look for.
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:32.200]   CB: Is there efforts to look for something like that for Dyson spheres out there, for
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:33.360]   the strong infrared signal?
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:34.360]   CB: There has been.
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:35.360]   Yeah, there has been.
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:38.920]   And I think in the literature there was one with the IRAS satellite, which is an infrared
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:40.000]   satellite.
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:46.600]   They targeted I think of order of 100,000 stars, nearby stars, and found no convincing
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:49.320]   examples of what looked like a Dyson sphere star.
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:54.120]   And then Jason Wright and his team extended this I think using WISE, which is another
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:57.200]   infrared satellite, to look around galaxies.
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:02.800]   So could an entire galaxy have been converted into Dyson spheres or a significant fraction
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:03.800]   of the galaxy?
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:06.720]   Which is basically the Kardashev type 3, right?
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:12.000]   This is when you've basically mastered the entire galactic pool of resources.
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:17.620]   And again, out of 100,000 nearby galaxies, there appears to be no compelling examples
[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:21.320]   of what looks like a Dyson galaxy, if you want to call it that.
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:28.340]   So that by no means proves that they don't exist or don't happen, but it seems like it's
[01:41:28.340 --> 01:41:33.480]   an unusual behavior for a civilization to get to that stage of development and start
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:36.600]   harvesting the entire stellar output.
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:37.600]   - Unusually, yes.
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:43.440]   And I mean, LIGO is super interesting with gravitational waves, if that kind of experiment
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:51.720]   could start seeing some weirdness, some weird signals, that compare to the power of cosmic
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:52.720]   phenomena.
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:53.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:57.920]   I mean, it's a whole new window to the universe, not just in terms of astrophysics, but potentially
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:59.400]   for technosciences as well.
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:05.840]   I have to say with the warp drives, I am skeptical that warp drives are possible, because you
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:07.400]   have kind of fundamental problem relativity.
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:11.880]   You can either really have relativity, faster than light travel, or causality.
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:13.920]   You can only choose two of those three things.
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:17.120]   You really can't have all three in a coherent universe.
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:20.520]   If you have all three, you basically end up with the possibility of these kind of temporal
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:23.000]   paradoxes and time loops and grandfather paradoxes.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.520]   - Well, can't there be pockets of causality?
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:26.520]   Something like that?
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:30.000]   Like where there's pockets of consistent causality?
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.400]   - You could design it in that way.
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:37.040]   You could be, if you had a warp drive or a time machine, essentially, you could be very
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:42.640]   conscious and careful of the way you use it, so as to not cause paradoxes or just do it
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:44.760]   in a local area or something.
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:49.720]   But the real fundamental problem is, you always have the ability to do it.
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:56.080]   And so in a vast cosmic universe, if time machines were all over the place, there's
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:58.200]   too much risk of someone doing it, right?
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:02.880]   Of somebody having the option of essentially breaking the universe with it.
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:05.080]   So this is a fundamental problem.
[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:11.240]   Hawking has this chronology protection conjecture where he said that essentially, this just
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:16.040]   can't be allowed, because it breaks all our laws of physics if time travel is possible.
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:17.880]   - Current laws of physics, yes.
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:18.880]   - Correct, yeah.
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:20.760]   And so we'd need to rip up relativity.
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:22.520]   I mean, that's the point, is the current laws of physics.
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:27.000]   So you'd have to rip up our current law of relativity to make sense of how FTL could
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.720]   live in that universe, because you can't have relativity, FTL, and causality sit nicely
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:34.600]   and play nicely together.
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:39.080]   - But we currently don't have quantum mechanics and relativity playing nice together anyway,
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:41.440]   so it's not like everything is all a nice little fabric.
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:42.720]   - It's certainly not the full picture.
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:44.760]   There must be more to go.
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:50.760]   - So it's already ripped up, so might as well rip it up a little more.
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:53.160]   In the process, actually try to connect the two things.
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:59.720]   Because maybe in the unification of the standard model and general relativity, maybe there
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:05.160]   lies some kind of new wisdom about warp drives.
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:10.840]   So by the way, warp drives is somehow messing with the fabric of the universe to be able
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:12.600]   to travel faster than the speed of light?
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:15.320]   - Yeah, you're basically bending space-time.
[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:20.800]   You could also do it with a wormhole, or some other hypothetical FTL.
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:24.240]   So this doesn't have to necessarily be the Alcubierre drive, the warp drive.
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:26.080]   It could be any faster-than-light system.
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:30.560]   As long as it travels superluminally, it will violate causality and relativity.
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:33.360]   - And presumably that will be observable with LIGO?
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:35.360]   - Potentially, yeah, potentially.
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:40.520]   It depends on, I think, the properties of whatever the spacecraft is.
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:44.360]   One problem with warp drives is - there's all sorts of problems with warp drives - but
[01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:45.360]   when it -
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:48.600]   - Like the start of that sentence, "One problem, the warp drive."
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:52.000]   - There's just this one minor problem that we have to get around.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:58.720]   But when it arrives at its destination, it basically collects this vast - it has an event
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:02.440]   horizon almost at the front of it - and so it collects all this radiation at the front
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:03.680]   as it goes.
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:07.680]   And when it arrives, all that radiation gets dumped on its destination, and would basically
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:12.040]   completely exterminate the planet it arrives at.
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:14.920]   That radiation is also incident within the shell itself.
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:19.720]   There's Hawking radiation occurring within the shell, which is pretty dangerous.
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:24.720]   And then it also raises all sorts of exacerbations of the Fermi Paradox, of course, as well.
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:31.720]   So you might be able to explain why we don't see a galactic empire - even here it's hard.
[01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:34.600]   You might be able to explain why we don't see a galactic empire if everybody's limited
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:39.760]   to Voyager 2 rocket speeds of like 20 kilometers per second or something.
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:47.320]   But it's a lot harder to explain why we don't see the stars populated by galactic empires
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:49.680]   when warp drive is eminently possible.
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:56.360]   Because it makes expansion so much more trivial, it makes our life harder.
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:46:00.160]   There's some wonderful simulation work being done out of Rochester where they actually
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:06.400]   simulate all the stars in the galaxy - or a fraction of them - and they spawn a civilization
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:10.520]   in one of them, and they let it spread out at sub-light speeds.
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:14.560]   And actually the very mixing of the stars themselves - because the stars are not static,
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:19.080]   they're in orbit of the galactic center and they have crossing paths with each other - if
[01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:23.960]   you just have a range of even like five light years, and your speed is of order of a few
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:28.080]   percent the speed of light is the maximum you can muster, you can populate the entire
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:32.900]   galaxy within something like a hundred thousand to about a million years or so.
[01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:36.880]   So in other words, a fraction of the lifetime of the galaxy itself.
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:43.880]   And so this raises some fairly serious problems, because if any civilization in the entire
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:49.840]   history of the galaxy decided to do that, then either we shouldn't be here or we happen
[01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:54.680]   to live in this kind of rare pocket where they chose not to populate to.
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:47:01.920]   And so this is sometimes called 'Fact A' - Hart's Fact A. The Fact A is that a civilization
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:07.640]   is not here now, an alien civilization is not in present occupation of the Earth.
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:15.160]   And that's difficult to resolve with the apparent ease at which even a small extrapolation of
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:22.160]   our own technology could potentially populate a galaxy in far faster than galactic history.
[01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:28.800]   So, to me, by the way, yeah, the Fermi Paradox is truly a paradox for me.
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:38.240]   But I suspect that if aliens visit Earth, I suspect if they do, if they are everywhere,
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:42.040]   I think they're already here, and we're too dumb to see it.
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:50.040]   But leaving that aside, I think we should be able to, in that case, have very strong
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:56.080]   obvious signals when we look up at the stars, at the emanation of energy required.
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:03.160]   We would see some weirdness, where these are these kinds of stars, and these are these
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:08.000]   kinds of stars that are being messed with, like leveraging the nuclear fusion of stars
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.800]   to do something useful.
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:14.580]   The fact that we don't really see that, maybe you can correct me, wouldn't we be able to,
[01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:20.140]   if there is alien civilizations running galaxies, wouldn't we see weirdnesses from an astronomy
[01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:23.020]   perspective with the way the stars are behaving?
[01:48:23.020 --> 01:48:25.340]   CB: Yeah, I mean, it depends exactly what they're doing.
[01:48:25.340 --> 01:48:30.100]   But the Dyson Sphere example is one that we already discussed, where a survey of 100,000
[01:48:30.100 --> 01:48:36.460]   nearby galaxies find that they have all been transformed into Dyson Sphere collectors.
[01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:39.940]   You could also imagine them doing things like, we wrote a paper about this recently, of star
[01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:43.860]   lifting, where you can extend the life of your star by scooping mass off the star.
[01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:48.580]   So you'd be doing stellar engineering, essentially.
[01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:53.020]   If you're doing a huge amount of asteroid mining, you would have a spectral signature,
[01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:55.780]   because you're basically filling the solar system with dust.
[01:48:55.780 --> 01:48:58.580]   By doing that, there'd be debris from that activity.
[01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:03.820]   And so there are some limits on this.
[01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:09.780]   Certainly we don't see bright flashes, which would be one of the consequences of warp drives,
[01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:13.680]   as I said, is as they decelerate, they produce these bright flashes of light.
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:17.700]   We don't seem to see evidence of those kinds of things.
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:21.860]   We don't see anything obvious around the nearby stars or the stars that we've surveyed in
[01:49:21.860 --> 01:49:27.620]   detail beyond that, that indicate any kind of artificial civilization.
[01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:31.300]   The closest maybe we had was Boyajian's star, that there was a lot of interest in.
[01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:37.780]   There was a star that was just very peculiarly dipping in and out its brightness.
[01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:45.020]   And it was hypothesized for a time that that may indeed be some kind of Dyson-like structure,
[01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:48.060]   so maybe a Dyson sphere that's half-built.
[01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:51.780]   And so as it comes in and out, it's blocking out huge swaths of the star.
[01:49:51.780 --> 01:49:58.500]   It was very difficult to explain, really, with any kind of planet model at the time.
[01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:02.780]   But an easier hypothesis that was proposed was it could just be a large number of comets
[01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:08.020]   or dust or something, or maybe a planet that had broken apart, and as its fragments orbit
[01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:10.660]   around it blocks out starlight.
[01:50:10.660 --> 01:50:15.660]   And it turned out, with subsequent observations of that star, which especially the amateur
[01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:22.140]   astronomy community made a big contribution to as well, that the dips were chromatic,
[01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:27.100]   which was a real important clue that that probably wasn't a solid structure then that
[01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:28.260]   was going around it.
[01:50:28.260 --> 01:50:29.860]   It was more likely to be dust.
[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:30.860]   Dust is chromatic.
[01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:35.300]   By chromatic I mean it looks different in different colours, so it blocks out more red
[01:50:35.300 --> 01:50:36.300]   light than blue light.
[01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:41.100]   If it was a solid structure, it shouldn't do that.
[01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:44.180]   It should be opaque, a solid metal structure or something.
[01:50:44.180 --> 01:50:45.740]   So that was one of the clear indications.
[01:50:45.740 --> 01:50:51.140]   And the behaviour of and the way the light changed, or the dips changed across wavelength,
[01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:56.620]   was fully consistent with the expectations of what small particulates would do.
[01:50:56.620 --> 01:50:58.060]   And so that's very hard.
[01:50:58.060 --> 01:51:02.700]   The real problem with alien hunting...
[01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:04.900]   The technical term.
[01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:05.900]   This is the real problem.
[01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:06.900]   The one problem.
[01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:09.420]   The one problem with the warp drive and the one problem with alien hunting.
[01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:10.420]   Yes.
[01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:14.420]   Actually, I'd say there's three big problems for me with any search for life, which includes
[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:23.020]   UFOs, all the way to fossils on Mars, is that aliens have three unique properties as a hypothesis.
[01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:26.820]   One is they have essentially unbounded explanatory capability.
[01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:31.420]   So there's almost no phenomena I can show you that you couldn't explain with aliens,
[01:51:31.420 --> 01:51:32.420]   to some degree.
[01:51:32.420 --> 01:51:36.100]   You could say, well, the aliens just have some super high-tech way of creating that
[01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:38.020]   illusion.
[01:51:38.020 --> 01:51:42.260]   The second one would be unbounded avoidance capacity.
[01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:46.700]   So I might see a UFO tomorrow, and then the next day, and then the next day, and then
[01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:50.180]   predict I should see it on Thursday at the end of the week.
[01:51:50.180 --> 01:51:54.140]   But then I don't see it, but I could always get out of that and say, well, that's just
[01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:55.700]   because they chose not to come here.
[01:51:55.700 --> 01:52:02.460]   You know, they can always avoid future observations fairly easily.
[01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:07.420]   If you survey an exoplanet for biosignatures and you don't see oxygen, you don't see methane,
[01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:09.340]   that doesn't mean there's no one living there.
[01:52:09.340 --> 01:52:13.420]   They could always be either tricking their atmosphere, engineering it - we actually wrote
[01:52:13.420 --> 01:52:20.860]   a paper about that, how you can use lasers to hide your biosignatures as advanced civilization.
[01:52:20.860 --> 01:52:24.860]   Or you could just be living underground or underwater or something where there's no biosignatures.
[01:52:24.860 --> 01:52:30.460]   So you can never really disprove there's life on another planet or on another star.
[01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:32.580]   It has infinite avoidance.
[01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:36.620]   And then finally, the third one is that we have incomplete physical understanding of
[01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:37.940]   the universe.
[01:52:37.940 --> 01:52:41.900]   So if I see a new phenomena - Voyager and Star were a good example of that - we saw
[01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:46.900]   this new phenomena of these strange dips we'd never seen before, it was hypothesized immediately
[01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:51.100]   this could be aliens, like a god of the gaps, but it turned out to be incomplete physical
[01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:52.100]   understanding.
[01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:54.060]   And so that happens all the time.
[01:52:54.060 --> 01:52:58.180]   In the first pulsar that was discovered, same story.
[01:52:58.180 --> 01:53:03.860]   Jocelyn Bell, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, called it 'Little Green Man 1' because it looked
[01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:08.940]   a lot like the radio signature that was expected from an alien civilization.
[01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:12.900]   But of course it turned out to be a completely new type of star that we had never seen before,
[01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:16.980]   which was a neutron star with these two jets coming out the top of it.
[01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:20.180]   And so that's a challenge.
[01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:26.700]   Those three things are really, really difficult in terms of experimental design for a scientist
[01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:27.740]   to work around.
[01:53:27.740 --> 01:53:33.060]   Something that can explain anything, can avoid anything, so it's almost unfalsifiable.
[01:53:33.060 --> 01:53:37.380]   And could always just be, to some degree as you said, we have this very limited knowledge
[01:53:37.380 --> 01:53:41.780]   of the infinite possibilities of physical law, and we're probably only scratching the
[01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:43.220]   surface.
[01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:49.500]   Each time, and we've seen it so often in history, we may just be detecting some new phenomena.
[01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:55.100]   Well that last one, I think I'm a little more okay with making mistakes on.
[01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:57.540]   Yeah, because it's exciting still.
[01:53:57.540 --> 01:54:01.540]   Because no matter what, so you might exaggerate the importance of the discovery, but the whole
[01:54:01.540 --> 01:54:07.380]   point is to try to find stuff in this world that's weird, and try to characterize that
[01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:08.380]   weirdness.
[01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:15.140]   Sure you can throw a little green man as a label on it, but eventually it's as mysterious
[01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:18.500]   and as beautiful, as interesting as little green man.
[01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:22.980]   We tend to think that there's some kind of threshold, but there's all kinds of weird
[01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:27.940]   organisms on this earth that operate very differently than humans that are super interesting.
[01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:31.220]   The human mind is super interesting.
[01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:39.140]   Weirdness and complexity is as interesting in any of its forms as what we might think
[01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:41.460]   from Hollywood what aliens are.
[01:54:41.460 --> 01:54:45.820]   So that's okay, looking for weirdnesses on Mars.
[01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:49.860]   That's one of the best sales pitches to do technosignature work, is that we always have
[01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:50.860]   that as our fallback.
[01:54:50.860 --> 01:54:56.460]   That we're going to look for alien signatures, if we fail we're going to discover some awesome
[01:54:56.460 --> 01:54:57.860]   new physics along the way.
[01:54:57.860 --> 01:55:04.900]   And so any kind of signature that we detect is always going to be interesting.
[01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:11.460]   And so that compels us to have not only the question of looking for life in the universe,
[01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:16.460]   but it gives us a strong scientific grounding as to why this sort of research should be
[01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:19.860]   funded and should be executed, because it always pushes the frontiers of knowledge.
[01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:26.100]   - I wonder if we'll be able to discover and be open enough to a broad definition of aliens,
[01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:31.060]   where we see some kind of technosignature, basically like a Turing test, like this thing
[01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:33.420]   is intelligent.
[01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:36.100]   It's processing information in a very interesting way.
[01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:40.740]   But you could say that about chemistry, you could say that about physics.
[01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:41.740]   Maybe not physics, chemistry.
[01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:47.380]   Like interesting, complex chemistry, you could say that this is processing, this is storing
[01:55:47.380 --> 01:55:51.260]   information, this is propagating information over time.
[01:55:51.260 --> 01:55:58.580]   So I mean, it's a gray area between a living organism that we would call an alien, and
[01:55:58.580 --> 01:56:01.940]   I think that's super interesting, it's able to carry some kind of intelligence.
[01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:08.740]   - Yeah, information is a really useful way to frame what we're looking for though, because
[01:56:08.740 --> 01:56:14.460]   then you're divorced from making assumptions about even a civilization necessarily, or
[01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:15.460]   anything like that.
[01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:20.340]   So any kind of information-rich signature, indeed, you can take things like the light
[01:56:20.340 --> 01:56:24.860]   curve from Boyajian's star and ask, "What is the minimum number of free parameters,
[01:56:24.860 --> 01:56:29.380]   or the minimum information content that must be encoded within this light curve?"
[01:56:29.380 --> 01:56:34.020]   And the hope is that maybe from, a good example would be from a radio signature, you detect
[01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:41.700]   something that has a thousand megabytes of parameters essentially contained within it.
[01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:45.620]   That's pretty clearly at that point not the product of a natural process, or at least
[01:56:45.620 --> 01:56:48.900]   any natural process that we could possibly imagine with our current understanding of
[01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:49.980]   the universe.
[01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:54.620]   And so, thinking that even if we can't decode, which actually I'm skeptical we'd be able
[01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:59.080]   to ever decode in our lifetimes, it would probably take decades to fully ever figure
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:00.820]   out what they're trying to tell us.
[01:57:00.820 --> 01:57:05.020]   But if there was a message there, we could at least know that there is high information
[01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:11.660]   content and there is complexity, and that this is an attempt at communication and information
[01:57:11.660 --> 01:57:17.100]   transfer, and leave it to our subsequent generations to figure out what exactly it is they're trying
[01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:18.100]   to say.
[01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:21.780]   - What, again, a wild question, and thank you for...
[01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:22.780]   - Entertaining them.
[01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:27.460]   - Entertaining them, I really, really appreciate that.
[01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:32.820]   But what kind of signal in our lifetime, what kind of thing do you think might happen, could
[01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:40.140]   possibly happen, where the scientific community would be convinced that there's alien civilizations
[01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:41.140]   out there?
[01:57:41.140 --> 01:57:46.060]   Like what, so you already said maybe a strong infrared signature for something like a Dyson
[01:57:46.060 --> 01:57:47.060]   sphere.
[01:57:47.060 --> 01:57:51.820]   - Yeah, that's possibly, that's also to some degree a little bit ambiguous, because...
[01:57:51.820 --> 01:57:57.980]   That's the challenge, sorry to interrupt, is where your brain would be, like you as
[01:57:57.980 --> 01:58:03.620]   a scientist would be like, I know it's ambiguous, but this is really weird.
[01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:08.580]   - I think if you had something, I can imagine something like a prime number sequence, or
[01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:12.180]   a mathematical sequence, like the Fibonacci series, something being broadcasted.
[01:58:12.180 --> 01:58:15.300]   - Mathematically provable that this is not a physical phenomenon.
[01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:18.940]   - Right, I mean, yeah, prime numbers is a pretty good case, because there's no natural
[01:58:18.940 --> 01:58:22.860]   phenomena that produces prime number sequences, it seems to be a purely abstract mathematical
[01:58:22.860 --> 01:58:24.700]   concept as far as I'm aware.
[01:58:24.700 --> 01:58:30.900]   And so if we detected a series of radio blips that were following that sequence, it would
[01:58:30.900 --> 01:58:36.380]   be pretty clear to me, or it could even be Carl Sagan suggested that pi could be encoded
[01:58:36.380 --> 01:58:41.340]   in that, or you might use the hydrogen line, but multiply it by pi, like some very specific
[01:58:41.340 --> 01:58:46.680]   frequency of the universe, like a hydrogen line, but multiply it by an abstract mathematical
[01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:52.180]   constant that would imply strongly that there was someone behind the scenes operating that.
[01:58:52.180 --> 01:58:55.180]   - Sorry, stored in which phenomena though?
[01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:57.380]   - In that case, a radio wave.
[01:58:57.380 --> 01:59:03.060]   But the information, I mean, we kind of toyed with this idea in a video I did about hypothetical
[01:59:03.060 --> 01:59:09.300]   civilization on my channel, but one kind of fun way, I do want to bring this conversation
[01:59:09.300 --> 01:59:15.260]   towards time a little bit, and thinking about not just looking for life and intelligence
[01:59:15.260 --> 01:59:19.740]   around us right now, but looking into the past and even into the future to some degree,
[01:59:19.740 --> 01:59:21.700]   or communicating with the future.
[01:59:21.700 --> 01:59:26.060]   And so we had this fun experiment of imagining a civilization that was born at the beginning
[01:59:26.060 --> 01:59:29.940]   of the history of the galaxy, and being the first, and what it would be like for them.
[01:59:29.940 --> 01:59:33.940]   And they were desperately searching for evidence of life, but couldn't find it.
[01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:38.980]   And so they decided to try and leave something behind for future civilizations to discover,
[01:59:38.980 --> 01:59:39.980]   to tell them about themselves.
[01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:44.420]   But of course, a radio signature's not going to work there, because it has to have a power
[01:59:44.420 --> 01:59:47.460]   source, and that's a piece of machinery, it's going to eventually break down, it's going
[01:59:47.460 --> 01:59:51.500]   to be hard to maintain that for billions of years' timescale.
[01:59:51.500 --> 01:59:55.060]   And so you wanted something that was kind of passive, that doesn't require an energy
[01:59:55.060 --> 01:59:58.580]   source but can somehow transmit information.
[01:59:58.580 --> 02:00:02.380]   Which is hard to think about something that satisfies those criteria.
[02:00:02.380 --> 02:00:07.700]   But there was a proposal by one of my colleagues, Luke Arnold, which inspired a lot of us in
[02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:12.540]   technosignatures, and he suggested that you could build artificial transitors.
[02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:17.020]   So you could build sheets of material that transit in front of the star.
[02:00:17.020 --> 02:00:22.500]   Maybe one thin sheet passes across first, then two, then three, then five, then seven,
[02:00:22.500 --> 02:00:24.860]   so you could follow the prime number sequence of these.
[02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:28.700]   And so there'd be a clear indication that someone had manufactured those.
[02:00:28.700 --> 02:00:32.700]   But they don't require any energy source, because they're just sheets of material in
[02:00:32.700 --> 02:00:33.700]   orbit of the star.
[02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:37.540]   They would eventually degrade from micrometeorites, and maybe they'd always become destabilized.
[02:00:37.540 --> 02:00:43.460]   But they should have lifetimes far exceeding the lifetime of any battery or mechanical
[02:00:43.460 --> 02:00:47.540]   electronic system that we could, at least with our technology, conceive of building.
[02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:49.180]   And so you could imagine extending that.
[02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:53.020]   And how could you encode not just a prime number sequence, but maybe in the spatial
[02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:57.020]   pattern of this very complex light curve we see?
[02:00:57.020 --> 02:01:02.700]   You could encode more and more information through 2D shapes and the way those occultations
[02:01:02.700 --> 02:01:03.700]   happen.
[02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:10.300]   Maybe you could even encode messages and in-depth information.
[02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:14.700]   You could even imagine it being like a lower layer of information, which is just the prime
[02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:15.700]   number sequence.
[02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:20.200]   But then you look closely and you see the smaller divots embedded within those that
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:24.520]   have a deeper layer of information to extract.
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:28.740]   And so to me, something like that would be pretty compelling, that there was somebody
[02:01:28.740 --> 02:01:29.740]   who had manufactured it.
[02:01:29.740 --> 02:01:33.180]   It's just a very impressive hoax.
[02:01:33.180 --> 02:01:35.460]   That would be pretty compelling evidence in this civilization.
[02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:43.620]   LB: And actually, the methods of astronomy right now are kind of marching towards being
[02:01:43.620 --> 02:01:46.100]   able to better and better detect a signal like that.
[02:01:46.100 --> 02:01:47.100]   CB: Yeah.
[02:01:47.100 --> 02:01:50.380]   I mean, to some degree it's just building bigger aperture in space.
[02:01:50.380 --> 02:01:55.020]   The bigger the telescope, the finer ability to detect those minute signals.
[02:01:55.020 --> 02:01:59.660]   LB: Do you think the current scientific community - another weird question - but just the observations
[02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:07.100]   that are happening now, do you think they're ready for a prime number sequence?
[02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:14.340]   If we're using the current method, the transit timing variation method, do you think you're
[02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:15.340]   ready?
[02:02:15.340 --> 02:02:18.260]   Do you have the tools to detect the prime number sequence?
[02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:19.980]   CB: Yeah, for sure.
[02:02:19.980 --> 02:02:25.020]   I mean, there's 200,000 stars that Kepler monitored, and it monitored them all the time.
[02:02:25.020 --> 02:02:29.780]   It took a photo of each one of them every 30 minutes, measured their brightness, and
[02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:32.340]   it did that for four and a half years.
[02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:36.020]   And so you have already - and Tess is doing it right now, another mission - and so you
[02:02:36.020 --> 02:02:38.300]   have already an existing catalogue.
[02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:43.580]   And people are genuinely scouring through each of those light curves with automated
[02:02:43.580 --> 02:02:44.580]   machine learning techniques.
[02:02:44.580 --> 02:02:48.760]   We even developed some in our own team that can look for weird behavior.
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:52.660]   We wrote a code called the weird detector, for instance.
[02:02:52.660 --> 02:02:55.860]   It was just the most generic thing possible.
[02:02:55.860 --> 02:02:59.500]   Don't assume anything about the signal shape, just look for anything that repeats.
[02:02:59.500 --> 02:03:03.540]   The signal shape can be anything, and we kind of learn the template of the signal from the
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:04.660]   data itself.
[02:03:04.660 --> 02:03:08.460]   And then it's like a template matching filter to see if that repeats many, many times in
[02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:09.460]   the data.
[02:03:09.460 --> 02:03:13.260]   And so we actually applied that and found a bunch of interesting stuff, but we didn't
[02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:17.980]   see anything that was the prime number sequence, at least on the Kepler data.
[02:03:17.980 --> 02:03:23.340]   That's 200,000 stars, which sounds like a lot, but compared to 200 billion stars in
[02:03:23.340 --> 02:03:26.700]   the Milky Way, it's really just scratching the surface.
[02:03:26.700 --> 02:03:29.940]   - So one, because there could be something much more generalizable than the prime number
[02:03:29.940 --> 02:03:35.540]   sequence, it's ultimately the question of a signal that's very difficult to compress
[02:03:35.540 --> 02:03:38.180]   in the general sense of what compress means.
[02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:42.460]   So maybe as we get better and better machine learning methods that automatically figure
[02:03:42.460 --> 02:03:47.960]   out, analyze the data to understand how to compress it, you'll be able to discover data
[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:50.840]   that's for some reason not compressible.
[02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:56.060]   But then, you know, compression really is a bottomless pit, because that's really what
[02:03:56.060 --> 02:03:58.700]   intelligence is, is being able to compress information.
[02:03:58.700 --> 02:04:01.220]   - Yeah, and to some degree, the more you...
[02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:04.180]   I would imagine, I don't work in compression algorithms, but I would imagine the more you
[02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:11.700]   compress your signal, the more assumptions that kind of go on behalf of the decoder,
[02:04:11.700 --> 02:04:14.180]   the more skilled they really have to be.
[02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:20.380]   You know, a prime number sequence is completely unencoded information, essentially.
[02:04:20.380 --> 02:04:26.000]   But if you look at the Arecibo message, they were fairly careful with their pixelation
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:33.960]   of this simple image they sent, to try and make it as interpretable as possible, to be
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:38.920]   that even a dumb alien would be able to figure out what we're trying to show them here.
[02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:44.560]   Because there's all sorts of conventions and rules that are built in that we tend to presume
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:46.620]   when we design our messages.
[02:04:46.620 --> 02:04:53.980]   And so if your message is assuming they know how to do an MP3 decoder, a particular compression
[02:04:53.980 --> 02:04:58.380]   algorithm, I'm sure they could eventually reverse engineer it and figure it out.
[02:04:58.380 --> 02:05:03.260]   But you're making it harder for them to get to that point.
[02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:06.020]   So maybe, I always think, you know, you probably would have a two-tier system, right?
[02:05:06.020 --> 02:05:10.840]   You'd probably have some lower-tier key system, and then maybe beneath that you'd have a deeper
[02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:14.120]   compressed layer of more in-depth information.
[02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:19.040]   - What about maybe observing actual physical objects?
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:22.600]   So first let me go to your tweet as a source of inspiration.
[02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:29.080]   You tweeted that it's interesting to ponder that if Oort clouds are ever mined by the
[02:05:29.080 --> 02:05:33.640]   systems of alien civilizations, mining equipment from billions of years ago could be in our
[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:41.880]   Oort cloud, since the Oort clouds extend really, really, really, really far outside the actual
[02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:42.880]   star.
[02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:47.880]   So, you know, mining equipment, just basic boring mining equipment out there.
[02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:51.280]   I don't know if there's something interesting to say about Oort clouds themselves that are
[02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:58.800]   interesting to you, and about possible non-shiny light-emitting mining equipment from alien
[02:05:58.800 --> 02:05:59.800]   civilizations.
[02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:04.680]   - I mean, that's kind of the beauty of the field of technosignatures and looking for
[02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:12.200]   life, is you can find inspiration and intellectual joy in just the smallest little thing that
[02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:17.800]   starts a whole thread of building upon it and wondering about the implications.
[02:06:17.800 --> 02:06:23.120]   And so in this case, I was just really struck by, we kind of mentioned this a little bit
[02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:25.900]   earlier, the idea that stars are not static.
[02:06:25.900 --> 02:06:30.880]   We tend to think of the galaxy as having stars in a certain location from the center of the
[02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:32.760]   galaxy, and they kind of live there.
[02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:38.660]   But in truth, the stars are not only orbiting around the center of the galaxy, but those
[02:06:38.660 --> 02:06:41.200]   orbits are themselves changing over time.
[02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:42.480]   They're processing.
[02:06:42.480 --> 02:06:45.040]   And so in fact, the orbits look more like a spirograph.
[02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:49.480]   If you've ever done those as a kid, they kind of whirl around and trace out all sorts of
[02:06:49.480 --> 02:06:50.940]   strange patterns.
[02:06:50.940 --> 02:06:54.100]   And so the stars intersect with one another.
[02:06:54.100 --> 02:07:00.200]   And so the current closest star to us is Proxima Centauri, which is about 4.2 light years away.
[02:07:00.200 --> 02:07:02.080]   But it will not always be the closest star.
[02:07:02.080 --> 02:07:06.160]   Over millions of years, it will be supplanted by other stars.
[02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:09.560]   In fact, stars that will come even closer than Proxima within just a couple of light
[02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:10.560]   years.
[02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:14.000]   And that's been happening, not just we can project that will happen over the next few
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:18.820]   million years, but that's been happening presumably throughout the entire history of the galaxy
[02:07:18.820 --> 02:07:20.500]   for billions of years.
[02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:24.400]   And so if you went back in time, there would have been all sorts of different nearest stars
[02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:26.960]   throughout different stages of the Earth's history.
[02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:32.640]   And those stars are so close that their Oort clouds do intermix with one another.
[02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:36.120]   So the Oort cloud can extend out to even a light year or two around the Earth.
[02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:39.120]   There's some debate about exactly where it ends.
[02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:42.280]   It probably doesn't really have a definitive end, but it kind of more just kind of peters
[02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:44.880]   out more and more and more as you go further away.
[02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:48.200]   LBW - For people who don't know, an Oort cloud, I don't know what the technical definition
[02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:55.040]   is, but a bunch of rocks that kind of, no, objects that orbit the star.
[02:07:55.040 --> 02:07:56.840]   And they can extend really, really far because of gravity.
[02:07:56.840 --> 02:07:57.840]   CB - Correct.
[02:07:57.840 --> 02:08:00.720]   These are objects that probably are mostly icy rich.
[02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:06.180]   They were probably formed fairly similar distances to Jupiter and Saturn, but were scattered
[02:08:06.180 --> 02:08:10.520]   out through the interactions of those giant planets.
[02:08:10.520 --> 02:08:14.920]   We see a circular disk of objects around us, which kind of looks like the asteroid belt,
[02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:16.800]   but just further away called the Kuiper belt.
[02:08:16.800 --> 02:08:19.400]   And then further beyond that, you get the Oort cloud.
[02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:21.960]   And the Oort cloud is not on a disk, it's just a sphere.
[02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:24.480]   It kind of surrounds us in all directions.
[02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:30.520]   So these are objects that were scattered out three-dimensionally in all different directions.
[02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:36.760]   And so those objects are potentially resources for us, especially if you were planning to
[02:08:36.760 --> 02:08:41.600]   do an interstellar mission one day, you might want to mine the water that's embedded within
[02:08:41.600 --> 02:08:45.420]   those and use that as either oxygen or fuel for your rocket.
[02:08:45.420 --> 02:08:46.920]   And so it's quite possible.
[02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:49.760]   There's also some rare earth metals and things like that as well.
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:53.040]   But it's quite possible that a civilization might use Oort cloud objects as a jumping
[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:56.280]   off point.
[02:08:56.280 --> 02:08:58.560]   Or in the Kuiper belt you have things like Planet Nine even.
[02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:02.600]   There might even be objects beyond in the Oort cloud which are actually planet-like
[02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:03.600]   that we just cannot detect.
[02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:06.960]   These objects are very, very faint, so that's why they're so hard to see.
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:12.160]   Even Planet Nine is hypothesized to exist, but we've not been able to confirm its existence
[02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:16.460]   because it's at something like a thousand AU away from us, a thousand times the distance
[02:09:16.460 --> 02:09:17.800]   of the Earth from the Sun.
[02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:21.620]   And so even though it's probably larger than the Earth, the amount of light it reflects
[02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:25.980]   from the Sun - the Sun just looks like a star at that point, so far away from it - that
[02:09:25.980 --> 02:09:27.660]   it barely reflects anything back.
[02:09:27.660 --> 02:09:29.780]   It's extremely difficult to detect.
[02:09:29.780 --> 02:09:34.340]   So there's all sorts of wonders that may be lurking out in the outer solar system.
[02:09:34.340 --> 02:09:40.920]   And so this leads you to wonder, you know, in the Oort cloud, that Oort cloud must have
[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:43.900]   intermixed with other Oort clouds in the past.
[02:09:43.900 --> 02:09:51.060]   And so what fraction of the Oort cloud truly belongs to us, belongs to what was scattered
[02:09:51.060 --> 02:09:52.940]   from Jupiter and Saturn?
[02:09:52.940 --> 02:09:56.780]   What fraction of it could in fact be interstellar visitors?
[02:09:56.780 --> 02:10:02.740]   And of course we got excited about this recently because of 'Oumuamua, this interstellar asteroid,
[02:10:02.740 --> 02:10:07.220]   which seemed to be at the time the first evidence of an interstellar object.
[02:10:07.220 --> 02:10:12.620]   But when you think about the Oort cloud intermixing, it may be that a large fraction of comets
[02:10:12.620 --> 02:10:16.860]   are seeded from the Oort cloud that eventually come in.
[02:10:16.860 --> 02:10:20.700]   Some of those comets may indeed have been interstellar in the first place, that we just
[02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:24.220]   didn't know about through this process.
[02:10:24.220 --> 02:10:26.820]   There even is an example - I can't remember the name - there's an example of a comet that
[02:10:26.820 --> 02:10:31.540]   has a very peculiar spectral signature that has been hypothesized to have actually been
[02:10:31.540 --> 02:10:36.300]   an interstellar visitor, but one that was essentially sourced through this Oort cloud
[02:10:36.300 --> 02:10:37.660]   mixing.
[02:10:37.660 --> 02:10:41.100]   And so this is kind of intriguing.
[02:10:41.100 --> 02:10:44.780]   It also, you know, the outer solar system is just such a, it's like the bottom of the
[02:10:44.780 --> 02:10:45.780]   ocean.
[02:10:45.780 --> 02:10:50.300]   We know so little about what's on the bottom of our own planet's ocean, and we know next
[02:10:50.300 --> 02:10:53.260]   to nothing about what's on the outskirts of our own solar system.
[02:10:53.260 --> 02:10:54.260]   - It's all darkness.
[02:10:54.260 --> 02:10:55.260]   - Yeah.
[02:10:55.260 --> 02:11:01.740]   - And so like, that's one of the things is, to understand the phenomena, we need light.
[02:11:01.740 --> 02:11:07.300]   And we need to see how light interacts with it, or what light emanates from it.
[02:11:07.300 --> 02:11:08.960]   But most of our universe is darkness.
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:11.420]   So it's, there could be a lot of interesting stuff.
[02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:16.020]   I mean, this is where your interest is with the cool worlds, and the interesting stuff
[02:11:16.020 --> 02:11:17.820]   lurks in the darkness, right?
[02:11:17.820 --> 02:11:22.060]   - Basically all of us, you know, 400 years of astronomy, our only window into the universe
[02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:23.540]   has been light.
[02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:27.900]   And that has only changed quite recently with the discovery of gravitational waves.
[02:11:27.900 --> 02:11:30.380]   That's now a new window.
[02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:34.340]   And hopefully, well to some degree, I guess, solar neutrinos we've been detecting for a
[02:11:34.340 --> 02:11:36.300]   while, but they come from the sun, not interstellar space.
[02:11:36.300 --> 02:11:40.180]   But we may be able to soon detect neutrino messages, as has even been hypothesized as
[02:11:40.180 --> 02:11:44.420]   a way of communicating between civilizations as well, or just do neutrino telescopes to
[02:11:44.420 --> 02:11:46.620]   study the universe.
[02:11:46.620 --> 02:11:50.980]   And so there's a growing interest in what we'd call multi-messenger astronomy now.
[02:11:50.980 --> 02:11:58.540]   So not just messages from light, but messages from these other physical packets of information
[02:11:58.540 --> 02:12:00.500]   that are coming our way.
[02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:04.660]   But when it comes to the outer solar system, light really is our only window.
[02:12:04.660 --> 02:12:06.700]   There's two ways of doing that.
[02:12:06.700 --> 02:12:10.100]   One is you detect the light from the Oort cloud object itself, which as I just said,
[02:12:10.100 --> 02:12:11.700]   is very, very difficult.
[02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:16.340]   There's another trick, which we do in the Kuiper belt especially, and that's called
[02:12:16.340 --> 02:12:18.020]   inoculation.
[02:12:18.020 --> 02:12:24.060]   And so sometimes those objects will just pass in front of a distant star just coincidentally.
[02:12:24.060 --> 02:12:25.740]   These are very, very brief moments.
[02:12:25.740 --> 02:12:26.740]   They last for less than a second.
[02:12:26.740 --> 02:12:31.820]   And so you have to have a very fast camera to detect them, which conventionally astronomers
[02:12:31.820 --> 02:12:33.660]   don't usually build fast cameras.
[02:12:33.660 --> 02:12:37.460]   Most of the phenomena we observe occurs on hours, minutes, days even.
[02:12:37.460 --> 02:12:42.420]   But now we're developing cameras which can take thousands of images per second, and yet
[02:12:42.420 --> 02:12:47.460]   do it at the kind of astronomical fidelity that we need for this kind of precise measurement.
[02:12:47.460 --> 02:12:50.660]   And so you can see these very fast dips.
[02:12:50.660 --> 02:12:54.500]   You even get these kind of diffraction patterns that come around, which are really cool to
[02:12:54.500 --> 02:12:55.620]   look at.
[02:12:55.620 --> 02:12:59.780]   And I kind of love it because it's almost like passive radar.
[02:12:59.780 --> 02:13:01.540]   You have these pinpricks of light.
[02:13:01.540 --> 02:13:06.740]   Imagine that you live in a giant black sphere, but there's these little pinholes that have
[02:13:06.740 --> 02:13:11.620]   been poked, and through those pinholes almost laser light is shining through.
[02:13:11.620 --> 02:13:17.260]   And inside this black sphere, there are unknown things wandering around, drifting around that
[02:13:17.260 --> 02:13:18.740]   we are trying to discover.
[02:13:18.740 --> 02:13:23.500]   And sometimes they will pass in front of those little pencil-thin laser beams, block something
[02:13:23.500 --> 02:13:25.660]   out, and so we can tell that it's there.
[02:13:25.660 --> 02:13:29.740]   And it's not an active radar, because we didn't actually beam anything out and get a reflection
[02:13:29.740 --> 02:13:31.340]   off, which is what the Sun does.
[02:13:31.340 --> 02:13:32.980]   The Sun's light comes off and then comes back.
[02:13:32.980 --> 02:13:34.740]   That's more like an active radar system.
[02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:39.260]   It's more like a passive radar system where we are just listening very intently.
[02:13:39.260 --> 02:13:47.940]   And so I'm kind of so fascinated by that, the idea that we could map out the rich architecture
[02:13:47.940 --> 02:13:52.340]   of the outer solar system just by doing something that we could have done potentially for a
[02:13:52.340 --> 02:13:57.540]   long time, which is just listening in the right way, just tuning our instrumentation
[02:13:57.540 --> 02:14:03.620]   to the correct way of not listening, but viewing the universe to catch those objects.
[02:14:03.620 --> 02:14:05.940]   LB: Yeah, I mean, it's really fascinating.
[02:14:05.940 --> 02:14:12.540]   It seems almost obvious that your efforts, when projected out over like 100, 200 years,
[02:14:12.540 --> 02:14:17.500]   will have a really good map through even methods like basically transit timing, high-resolution
[02:14:17.500 --> 02:14:24.860]   transit timing, but basically the planetary and the planet satellite movements of all
[02:14:24.860 --> 02:14:27.300]   the different star systems out there.
[02:14:27.300 --> 02:14:30.020]   CB: Yeah, and it could revolutionize the way we think about the solar system.
[02:14:30.020 --> 02:14:33.740]   I mean, that revolution has happened several times in the past.
[02:14:33.740 --> 02:14:40.180]   When we discovered Vesta in the 19th century, that was I think the seventh planet for a
[02:14:40.180 --> 02:14:42.340]   while, or the eighth planet when it was first discovered.
[02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:46.860]   And then we discovered Ceres, and there was a bunch of asteroid objects, Janus.
[02:14:46.860 --> 02:14:52.580]   And so for a while, the textbooks had something like 13 planets in the solar system.
[02:14:52.580 --> 02:14:56.180]   And then that was just a new capability that was emerging to detect those small objects.
[02:14:56.180 --> 02:14:59.260]   And then we ripped that up and said, "No, no, we're going to change the definition of
[02:14:59.260 --> 02:15:00.260]   a planet."
[02:15:00.260 --> 02:15:03.820]   And then the same thing happened when we started looking at the outer skirts of the solar system.
[02:15:03.820 --> 02:15:09.380]   Again, we found Eris, we found Sedna, these objects which resembled Pluto.
[02:15:09.380 --> 02:15:11.980]   And more and more of them we found, make, make.
[02:15:11.980 --> 02:15:18.820]   And eventually, we again had to rethink the way we even contextualize what a planet is,
[02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:22.100]   and what the nature of the outer solar system is.
[02:15:22.100 --> 02:15:25.740]   So regardless as to what you think about the debate about whether Pluto should be devoted
[02:15:25.740 --> 02:15:31.220]   or not, which I know often evokes a lot of strong feelings, it is an incredible achievement
[02:15:31.220 --> 02:15:38.380]   that we were able to transform our view of the solar system in a matter of years just
[02:15:38.380 --> 02:15:44.620]   by basically charge-coupled devices, the things that's in cameras.
[02:15:44.620 --> 02:15:48.900]   The invention of that device allowed us to detect objects which were much further away,
[02:15:48.900 --> 02:15:52.840]   much fainter, and revealed all of this stuff that was there all along.
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:59.260]   And so that's the beauty of astronomy, there's just so much to discover, and even in our
[02:15:59.260 --> 02:16:00.260]   own backyard.
[02:16:00.260 --> 02:16:01.820]   - Do you ever think about this?
[02:16:01.820 --> 02:16:05.900]   Do you imagine, what are the things that will completely change astronomy over the next
[02:16:05.900 --> 02:16:06.900]   hundred years?
[02:16:06.900 --> 02:16:11.540]   Like if you transport yourself forward a hundred years, what are the things that will blow
[02:16:11.540 --> 02:16:14.540]   your mind when you look at, "Wait, what?"
[02:16:14.540 --> 02:16:18.140]   Would it be just a very high-resolution mapping of things?
[02:16:18.140 --> 02:16:27.840]   Like holy crap, one surprising thing might be, holy crap, there's Earth-like moons everywhere.
[02:16:27.840 --> 02:16:30.920]   Another one could be just totally different devices for sensing.
[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:36.960]   - Yeah, I think usually astronomy moves forward dramatically, and science in general, when
[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:41.360]   you have a new technological capability come online for the first time.
[02:16:41.360 --> 02:16:44.940]   And we kind of just gave examples of that there with the solar system.
[02:16:44.940 --> 02:16:49.220]   So what kind of new capabilities might emerge in the next 100 years?
[02:16:49.220 --> 02:16:54.280]   The capability I would love to see is not just, I mean, in the next 10, 20 years we're
[02:16:54.280 --> 02:16:57.160]   hoping to take these pale blue dot images we spoke about.
[02:16:57.160 --> 02:17:02.360]   So that requires building something like JWST, but on an even larger scale, and optimized
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:03.360]   for direct imaging.
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:06.600]   You'd have to have either a coronagraph or a star shade or something to block out the
[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:09.600]   starlight and reveal those pale blue dots.
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:14.860]   So in the next sort of decades, I think that's the achievement that we can look forward to
[02:17:14.860 --> 02:17:19.020]   in our lifetimes, is to see photos of other Earths.
[02:17:19.020 --> 02:17:22.720]   Going beyond that, maybe in our lifetimes, towards the end of our lifetimes perhaps,
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:27.200]   I'd love it if we, I think it's technically possible as Breakthrough Starshot are giving
[02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:32.440]   us a lot of encouragement with, to maybe send a small probe to the nearest stars and start
[02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:35.520]   actually taking high resolution images of these objects.
[02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:40.280]   There's only so much you can do from far away if you want to have, and we can see it in
[02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:41.280]   the solar system.
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:44.320]   I mean, there's only so much you can learn about Europa by pointing a Hubble Space Telescope
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:45.320]   at it.
[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:48.180]   But if you really want to understand that Moon, you're going to have to send something
[02:17:48.180 --> 02:17:52.360]   to orbit it to hopefully land on it and drill down to the surface.
[02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:58.280]   And so the idea of even taking a flyby and doing a snapshot photo that gets beamed back
[02:17:58.280 --> 02:18:03.160]   that could be, doesn't even have to be more than 100 pixels by 100 pixels, even that would
[02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:09.040]   be a completely game-changing capability to be able to truly image these objects.
[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:16.280]   And maybe at home in our own solar system, we can certainly get to a point where we produce
[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:19.520]   crude maps of exoplanets.
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:24.280]   One of the, kind of the ultimate limit of what a telescope could do is governed by its
[02:18:24.280 --> 02:18:25.340]   size.
[02:18:25.340 --> 02:18:28.400]   And so the largest telescope you could probably ever build would be one that was the size
[02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:29.400]   of the Sun.
[02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:33.360]   There's a clever trick for doing this without physically building a telescope that's the
[02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:37.320]   size of the Sun, and that's to use the Sun as a gravitational lens.
[02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:43.040]   This was proposed, I think, by Van Eschleman in like 1979, but it builds upon Einstein's
[02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:47.920]   theory of general relativity, of course, that there is a warping of light, a bending of
[02:18:47.920 --> 02:18:50.360]   light from the Sun's gravitational field.
[02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:55.720]   And so a distant starlight, it's like a magnifying glass, anything that bends light is basically
[02:18:55.720 --> 02:18:57.440]   can be used as a telescope.
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:18:59.400]   It's going to bend light to a point.
[02:18:59.400 --> 02:19:04.080]   Now it turns out the Sun's gravity is not strong enough to create a particularly great
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:08.360]   telescope here, because the focus point is really out in the Kuiper Belt.
[02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:14.320]   It's at 550 astronomical units away from the Earth, so 550 times further away from the
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:15.320]   Sun than we are.
[02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:17.920]   And that's beyond any of our spacecraft have ever gone.
[02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:24.760]   So you have to send a spacecraft to that distance, which would take 30, 40 years, even optimistically
[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:27.840]   improving our chemical propulsion system significantly.
[02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:32.560]   You'd have to bound it into that orbit, but then you could use the entire Sun as your
[02:19:32.560 --> 02:19:38.880]   telescope, and with that kind of capability, you could image planets to kilometer-scale
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:41.120]   resolution from afar.
[02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:43.720]   And that really makes you wonder.
[02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:49.880]   If we can conceive, maybe we can't engineer it, but if we can conceive of such a device,
[02:19:49.880 --> 02:19:56.080]   what might other civilizations be currently observing about our own planet?
[02:19:56.080 --> 02:20:03.200]   And perhaps that is why nobody is visiting us, because there is so much you can do from
[02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:06.800]   afar that to them, that's enough.
[02:20:06.800 --> 02:20:10.200]   Maybe they can get to the point where they can detect our radio leakage, they can detect
[02:20:10.200 --> 02:20:17.160]   our terrestrial television signals, they can map out our surfaces, they can tell we have
[02:20:17.160 --> 02:20:20.560]   cities, they can even do infrared mapping of the heat island effect, all this kind of
[02:20:20.560 --> 02:20:21.560]   stuff.
[02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:23.920]   They can tell the chemical composition of our planet.
[02:20:23.920 --> 02:20:25.040]   And so that might be enough.
[02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:30.120]   Maybe they don't need to come down to the surface and do anthropology and see what our
[02:20:30.120 --> 02:20:32.360]   civilization is like.
[02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:36.600]   But there's certainly a huge amount you can do, which is significantly cheaper to some
[02:20:36.600 --> 02:20:42.040]   degree than flying there, just by exploiting cleverly the physics of the universe itself.
[02:20:42.040 --> 02:20:48.680]   - So your intuition is, and this very well might be true, that observation might be way
[02:20:48.680 --> 02:20:51.520]   easier than travel.
[02:20:51.520 --> 02:20:57.960]   From our perspective, from an alien perspective, we could get very high resolution imaging
[02:20:57.960 --> 02:20:59.560]   before we could ever get there.
[02:20:59.560 --> 02:21:01.920]   - It depends on what information you want.
[02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:07.720]   If you want to know the chemical composition, and you want to know kilometer-scale maps
[02:21:07.720 --> 02:21:13.440]   of the planet, then you could do that from afar with some version of these kind of gravitational
[02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:14.440]   lenses.
[02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:19.040]   If you want to do better than that, if you want to image a newspaper set on the porch
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:21.640]   of somebody's house, you're going to have to fly there.
[02:21:21.640 --> 02:21:26.440]   There's no way, unless you had a telescope the size of Sagittarius A* or something, you
[02:21:26.440 --> 02:21:32.160]   just simply cannot collect enough light to do that from many light-years away.
[02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:39.720]   So there is certainly reasons why visiting will always have its place, depending on what
[02:21:39.720 --> 02:21:42.360]   kind of information you want.
[02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:49.280]   We propose in my team actually that the Sun is the ultimate pinnacle of telescope design,
[02:21:49.280 --> 02:21:53.200]   but flying to a thousand AU is a real pain in the butt because it's just going to take
[02:21:53.200 --> 02:21:54.200]   so long.
[02:21:54.200 --> 02:21:59.280]   And so a more practical way of achieving this might be to use the Earth.
[02:21:59.280 --> 02:22:04.160]   Now the Earth doesn't have anywhere near enough gravity to create a substantial gravitational
[02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:06.840]   lens, but it has an atmosphere.
[02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:10.920]   And that atmosphere refracts light, it bends light.
[02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:16.360]   So whenever you see a sunset, just as the Sun is setting below the horizon, it's actually
[02:22:16.360 --> 02:22:18.600]   already beneath the horizon.
[02:22:18.600 --> 02:22:21.880]   It's just the light is bending through the atmosphere.
[02:22:21.880 --> 02:22:26.880]   It's actually already about half a degree down beneath, and what you're seeing is that
[02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:28.760]   curvature of the light path.
[02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:32.080]   And your brain interprets it, of course, to be following a straight line because your
[02:22:32.080 --> 02:22:34.520]   brain always thinks that.
[02:22:34.520 --> 02:22:36.160]   And so you can use that bending.
[02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:38.040]   Whenever you have bending, you have a telescope.
[02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:42.960]   And so we've proposed to my team that you could use this refraction to similarly create
[02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:43.960]   an Earth-sized telescope.
[02:22:43.960 --> 02:22:44.960]   - Called the Terrascope.
[02:22:44.960 --> 02:22:45.960]   - The Terrascope, yeah.
[02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:46.960]   - We have a great video on this.
[02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:47.960]   - Yeah.
[02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:50.960]   - Do you have a paper on the Terrascope?
[02:22:50.960 --> 02:22:51.960]   - I do, yeah.
[02:22:51.960 --> 02:22:52.960]   - Great.
[02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:55.400]   - Sometimes I get confused with this because I've heard of an Earth-sized telescope because
[02:22:55.400 --> 02:23:00.200]   of the, maybe you've heard of the Event Horizon Telescope, which took an image of, well it's
[02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:03.040]   taking an image right now of the center of our black hole.
[02:23:03.040 --> 02:23:07.780]   And it's very impressive, and it previously did Messier 87, a nearby supermassive black
[02:23:07.780 --> 02:23:08.780]   hole.
[02:23:08.780 --> 02:23:10.860]   And so those images were interferometric.
[02:23:10.860 --> 02:23:16.060]   So they were small telescopes scattered across the Earth, and they combined the light paths
[02:23:16.060 --> 02:23:23.400]   together interferometrically to create effectively an Earth-sized angular resolution.
[02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:24.920]   Telescopes always have two properties.
[02:23:24.920 --> 02:23:29.200]   There's the angular resolution, which is how small of a thing you can see on the surface,
[02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:31.120]   and then there's the magnification.
[02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:35.880]   How much brighter does that object get versus just your eye or some small object?
[02:23:35.880 --> 02:23:45.000]   Now what the Event Horizon Telescope did, it traded off amplification or magnification
[02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:46.240]   for the angular resolution.
[02:23:46.240 --> 02:23:47.240]   That's what it wanted.
[02:23:47.240 --> 02:23:50.400]   It wanted that high angular resolution, but it doesn't really have much photon collecting
[02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:53.600]   power because each telescope individually is very small.
[02:23:53.600 --> 02:23:59.520]   The Telescope is different because it is literally collecting light with a light bucket, which
[02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:01.560]   is essentially the size of the Earth.
[02:24:01.560 --> 02:24:04.560]   And so that gives you both benefits, potentially.
[02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:09.320]   Not only the high angular resolution that a large aperture promises you, but also actually
[02:24:09.320 --> 02:24:10.840]   physically collects all those photons.
[02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:16.480]   So you can detect light from very, very far away, the very outer edges of the universe.
[02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:25.440]   And so we propose this as a possible future technological way of achieving these extreme
[02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:29.680]   goals, ambitious goals we have in astronomy.
[02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:34.720]   But it's a very difficult system to test because you essentially have to fly out to these focus
[02:24:34.720 --> 02:24:37.440]   points, and these focus points lie beyond the Moon.
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:44.120]   So you have to have someone who is willing to fly beyond the Moon and hitchhike an experimental
[02:24:44.120 --> 02:24:46.880]   telescope onto it and do that cheaply.
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:49.200]   If it was something doing low Earth orbit, it'd be easy.
[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:53.640]   You could just attach a CubeSat to the next Falcon 9 rocket or something and test it out.
[02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:57.040]   It'd probably only cost you a few tens of thousands of dollars, maybe a hundred thousand
[02:24:57.040 --> 02:24:58.040]   dollars.
[02:24:58.040 --> 02:25:03.840]   But there's basically no one who flies out that far, except for bespoke missions such
[02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:09.960]   as a mission that's going to Mars or something that would pass through that kind of space.
[02:25:09.960 --> 02:25:14.840]   And they typically don't have a lot of leeway and excess payload that they're willing to
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:17.240]   strap on for radical experiments.
[02:25:17.240 --> 02:25:18.920]   So that's been the problem with it.
[02:25:18.920 --> 02:25:23.520]   In theory it should work beautifully, but it's a very difficult idea to experimentally
[02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:24.520]   test.
[02:25:24.520 --> 02:25:27.760]   Can you elaborate why the focal point is that far away?
[02:25:27.760 --> 02:25:32.760]   So you get about half a degree bend from the Earth's atmosphere when you're looking at
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:36.920]   the Sun at the horizon, and you get that two times over if you're outside of the planet's
[02:25:36.920 --> 02:25:37.920]   atmosphere.
[02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:42.800]   Because the star is half a bend to you, still on the horizon, and half a degree back out
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:43.800]   either way.
[02:25:43.800 --> 02:25:44.800]   So you get about a one degree bend.
[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:49.440]   You take the radius of the Earth, which is about 7,000 kilometers, and do your arctan
[02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:52.080]   function, you'll end up with a distance that's about...
[02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:55.800]   It's actually the inner focal point is about two thirds the distance of the Earth-Moon
[02:25:55.800 --> 02:25:56.800]   system.
[02:25:56.800 --> 02:26:01.400]   The problem with that inner focal point is not useful, because that light ray path had
[02:26:01.400 --> 02:26:03.840]   to basically scrape the surface of the Earth.
[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:06.960]   So it passes through the clouds, it passes through all the thick atmosphere, it gets
[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:09.160]   a lot of extinction along the way.
[02:26:09.160 --> 02:26:12.320]   If you go higher up in altitude, you get less extinction.
[02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:15.520]   In fact, you can even go above the clouds, and so that's even better, because the clouds
[02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:18.940]   obviously are going to be a pain in the neck for doing anything optical.
[02:26:18.940 --> 02:26:22.660]   But the problem with that is that the atmosphere, because it gets thinner at higher altitude,
[02:26:22.660 --> 02:26:24.500]   it bends light less.
[02:26:24.500 --> 02:26:26.900]   And so that pushes the focal point out.
[02:26:26.900 --> 02:26:31.140]   So the most useful focal point is actually about three or four times the distance of
[02:26:31.140 --> 02:26:32.780]   the Earth-Moon separation.
[02:26:32.780 --> 02:26:36.060]   And so that's what we call one of the Lagrange points, essentially.
[02:26:36.060 --> 02:26:39.300]   And so there there's a stable orbit, it's kind of the outermost stable orbit you could
[02:26:39.300 --> 02:26:41.140]   have around the Earth.
[02:26:41.140 --> 02:26:46.620]   So the atmosphere does bad things to the signal.
[02:26:46.620 --> 02:26:49.220]   Yeah, it's absorbing light.
[02:26:49.220 --> 02:26:54.260]   Is that possible to reconstruct, to remove the noise, whatever?
[02:26:54.260 --> 02:26:57.180]   So it's just strength, it's nothing else?
[02:26:57.180 --> 02:26:58.180]   It's possible to reconstruct.
[02:26:58.180 --> 02:27:03.020]   I mean, to some degree we do this as a technology called adaptive optics that can correct for
[02:27:03.020 --> 02:27:06.140]   what's called wavefront errors that happen through the Earth's atmosphere.
[02:27:06.140 --> 02:27:12.580]   The Earth's atmosphere is turbulent, it is not a single plane of air of the same density,
[02:27:12.580 --> 02:27:15.540]   there's all kind of wiggles and currents in the air.
[02:27:15.540 --> 02:27:20.820]   And so that each little layer is bending light in slightly different ways.
[02:27:20.820 --> 02:27:24.500]   And so the light actually kind of follows a wiggly path on its way down.
[02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:29.140]   What that means is that two light rays which are traveling at slightly different spatial
[02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:33.820]   separations from each other will arrive at the detector at different times, because one
[02:27:33.820 --> 02:27:37.140]   maybe goes on more or less a straight path and the one wiggles down a bit more before
[02:27:37.140 --> 02:27:38.140]   it arrives.
[02:27:38.140 --> 02:27:41.980]   And so you have an incoherent light source.
[02:27:41.980 --> 02:27:45.040]   And when you're trying to do imagery construction, you always want a coherent light source.
[02:27:45.040 --> 02:27:50.140]   So the way they correct for this is that if this path had to travel a little bit faster,
[02:27:50.140 --> 02:27:53.980]   the straight one goes faster and the wiggly one takes longer, the mirror is deformable.
[02:27:53.980 --> 02:27:58.940]   And so you actually bend the mirror on the straight one down a little bit to make it
[02:27:58.940 --> 02:28:01.140]   an equivalent light path distance.
[02:28:01.140 --> 02:28:05.980]   So the mirror itself has all these little actuators, it's actually made up of like thousands
[02:28:05.980 --> 02:28:10.060]   of little elements, almost looks like a liquid mirror, because they can manipulate it in
[02:28:10.060 --> 02:28:11.480]   kind of real time.
[02:28:11.480 --> 02:28:15.100]   And so they scan the atmosphere with a laser beam to tell what the deformations are in
[02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:19.060]   the atmosphere, and then make the corrections to the mirror to account for it.
[02:28:19.060 --> 02:28:20.060]   That's amazing.
[02:28:20.060 --> 02:28:24.980]   So you could, you could do something like this for the terrascope, but it would be...
[02:28:24.980 --> 02:28:28.580]   It's cheaper and easier to go above the atmosphere and just fly out.
[02:28:28.580 --> 02:28:29.580]   I think so.
[02:28:29.580 --> 02:28:32.220]   It would be very, it's a very, that's a very challenging thing to do.
[02:28:32.220 --> 02:28:35.780]   And normally when you do adaptive optics, as it's called, you're looking straight up.
[02:28:35.780 --> 02:28:38.420]   So you're, you know, or very close to straight up.
[02:28:38.420 --> 02:28:42.280]   If you look at the horizon, we basically never do astronomical observations on the horizon,
[02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:44.560]   because you're looking through more atmosphere.
[02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:47.040]   If you go straight up, you're looking at the thinnest portion of atmosphere possible.
[02:28:47.040 --> 02:28:50.480]   But as you go closer and closer towards the horizon, you're increasing what we call the
[02:28:50.480 --> 02:28:53.680]   air mass, the amount of air you have to travel through.
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:58.040]   So here it's kind of the worst case because you're going through the entire atmosphere
[02:28:58.040 --> 02:29:00.640]   in and out again with a terrascope.
[02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:04.640]   So you'd need a very impressive adaptive optics system to correct for that.
[02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:09.560]   So yeah, I would say it's probably simpler, at least for proof of principle, just to test
[02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:15.600]   it with having some satellite that was at a much wider orbit.
[02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:19.640]   - Now speaking of traveling out into deep space, you already mentioned this a little
[02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:22.120]   bit.
[02:29:22.120 --> 02:29:26.240]   You made a beautiful video called "The Journey to the End of the Universe".
[02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:30.880]   And sort of at the start of that, you're talking about Alpha Centauri.
[02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:37.960]   So what would it take for humans or for human-like creatures to travel out to Alpha Centauri?
[02:29:37.960 --> 02:29:42.700]   - There's a few different ways of doing it, I suppose.
[02:29:42.700 --> 02:29:44.400]   One is, it depends on how fast your ship is.
[02:29:44.400 --> 02:29:46.580]   That's always going to be the determining factor.
[02:29:46.580 --> 02:29:51.400]   If we devised some interstellar propulsion system that could travel a fraction of the
[02:29:51.400 --> 02:29:57.340]   speed of light, then we could do it in our lifetimes, which is I think what people normally
[02:29:57.340 --> 02:30:01.360]   dream of when they think about interstellar propulsion and travel.
[02:30:01.360 --> 02:30:05.660]   You could literally step onto the spacecraft, maybe a few years later you step off on Alpha
[02:30:05.660 --> 02:30:10.120]   Centauri B, you walk around the surface and come back and visit your family.
[02:30:10.120 --> 02:30:14.740]   There would be of course a lot of relativistic time dilation as a result of that trip.
[02:30:14.740 --> 02:30:18.640]   You would have aged a lot less than people back on Earth by traveling close to the speed
[02:30:18.640 --> 02:30:22.400]   of light for some fraction of time.
[02:30:22.400 --> 02:30:26.280]   The challenge of this of course is that we have no such propulsion system that can achieve
[02:30:26.280 --> 02:30:27.280]   this.
[02:30:27.280 --> 02:30:28.280]   - But do you think it's possible?
[02:30:28.280 --> 02:30:37.400]   You have a paper called the Halo Drive, fuel-free relativistic propulsion of large masses via
[02:30:37.400 --> 02:30:40.400]   recycled boomerang photons.
[02:30:40.400 --> 02:30:43.640]   So do you think, first of all, what is that?
[02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:49.000]   And second of all, how difficult are alternate propulsion systems?
[02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:55.640]   - Yeah, so before I took on the Halo Drive, there was an idea, because I think the Halo
[02:30:55.640 --> 02:30:58.760]   Drive is not gonna solve this problem.
[02:30:58.760 --> 02:31:02.480]   I'll talk about the Halo Drive in a moment, but the Halo Drive is useful for a civilization
[02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:05.640]   which is a bit more advanced than us, that has spread across the stars, and is looking
[02:31:05.640 --> 02:31:09.760]   for a cheap highway system to get across the galaxy.
[02:31:09.760 --> 02:31:16.580]   For that first step, just to context that, the Halo Drive requires a black hole.
[02:31:16.580 --> 02:31:20.040]   So that's why you're not gonna be able to do this on the Earth right now.
[02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:22.160]   But there are lots of black holes in the Milky Way, so that's the good news.
[02:31:22.160 --> 02:31:23.240]   So we'll come to that in a moment.
[02:31:23.240 --> 02:31:29.840]   But if you're trying to travel to Alpha Centauri without a black hole, then there are some
[02:31:29.840 --> 02:31:30.840]   ideas out there.
[02:31:30.840 --> 02:31:36.560]   There was a Project Daedalus and Project Icarus that were two projects that the British Interplanetary
[02:31:36.560 --> 02:31:40.680]   Society conjured up on a 20, 30-year timescale.
[02:31:40.680 --> 02:31:47.320]   And they asked themselves, if we took existing and speculatively but realistic attempts at
[02:31:47.320 --> 02:31:51.560]   future technology that are emerging over the next few decades, how far could we push into
[02:31:51.560 --> 02:31:54.760]   the stellar travel system?
[02:31:54.760 --> 02:31:58.200]   And they settled on fusion drives in that.
[02:31:58.200 --> 02:32:03.200]   So if we had the ability to essentially either detonate - you can always imagine nuclear
[02:32:03.200 --> 02:32:07.680]   fission or nuclear fusion bombs going off behind the spacecraft and propelling it that
[02:32:07.680 --> 02:32:14.320]   way, or having some kind of successful nuclear fusion reaction, which obviously we haven't
[02:32:14.320 --> 02:32:18.760]   really demonstrated yet as a propulsion system - then you could achieve something like 10%
[02:32:18.760 --> 02:32:20.520]   the speed of light in those systems.
[02:32:20.520 --> 02:32:22.680]   But these are huge spacecrafts.
[02:32:22.680 --> 02:32:26.360]   I think you need a huge spacecraft if you're going to take people along.
[02:32:26.360 --> 02:32:31.600]   The conversation recently has actually switched, and that idea seems a little bit antiquated
[02:32:31.600 --> 02:32:32.600]   now.
[02:32:32.600 --> 02:32:38.120]   And most of us have kind of given up on the idea of people physically, biologically, stepping
[02:32:38.120 --> 02:32:40.240]   on board the spacecraft.
[02:32:40.240 --> 02:32:43.760]   And maybe we'll be sending something that's more like a microprobe that maybe just weighs
[02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:47.360]   a gram or two, and that's much easier to accelerate.
[02:32:47.360 --> 02:32:51.520]   You could push that with a laser system to very high speed, get it to maybe 20% the speed
[02:32:51.520 --> 02:32:52.520]   of light.
[02:32:52.520 --> 02:32:53.520]   It has to survive the journey.
[02:32:53.520 --> 02:32:56.560]   Probably a large fraction of them won't survive the journey, but they're cheap enough that
[02:32:56.560 --> 02:32:59.080]   you could maybe manufacture millions of them.
[02:32:59.080 --> 02:33:03.480]   And some of them do arrive and are able to send back an image.
[02:33:03.480 --> 02:33:09.280]   Maybe even if you wanted to have a person there, we might have some way of doing a telepresence,
[02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:14.920]   or some kind of delayed telepresence, or some kind of reconstruction of the planet which
[02:33:14.920 --> 02:33:20.680]   is sent back, so you can digitally interact with that environment in a way which is not
[02:33:20.680 --> 02:33:25.280]   real-time, but representative of what that planet would be like to be on the surface.
[02:33:25.280 --> 02:33:28.720]   So we might be more like digital visitors to these planets.
[02:33:28.720 --> 02:33:34.880]   Certainly far easier, practically, to do that than physically forcing this wet chunk of
[02:33:34.880 --> 02:33:39.640]   meat to fly across space to do that.
[02:33:39.640 --> 02:33:44.560]   And so that's maybe something we can imagine down the road.
[02:33:44.560 --> 02:33:48.320]   The Halo Drive, as I said, is thinking even further ahead.
[02:33:48.320 --> 02:33:54.440]   And if you did want to launch large masses - large masses could even be planet-sized
[02:33:54.440 --> 02:33:58.640]   things, in the case of the Halo Drive - you can use black holes.
[02:33:58.640 --> 02:34:02.080]   So this is kind of a trick of physics.
[02:34:02.080 --> 02:34:07.720]   I often think of the universe as like a big computer game, and you're trying to find cheat
[02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:12.680]   codes, hacks, exploits that the universe didn't intend for you to use.
[02:34:12.680 --> 02:34:17.000]   But once you find them, you can address all sorts of interesting capabilities that you
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.320]   didn't previously have.
[02:34:19.320 --> 02:34:21.720]   And the Halo Drive does that with black holes.
[02:34:21.720 --> 02:34:25.160]   So if you have two black holes, which is a very common situation - a binary black hole
[02:34:25.160 --> 02:34:28.440]   - and they're in spiraling towards each other.
[02:34:28.440 --> 02:34:31.560]   LIGO has detected, I think, dozens of these things, maybe even over a hundred at this
[02:34:31.560 --> 02:34:32.560]   point.
[02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:38.120]   And these things, as they merge together, the pre-merger phase, they're orbiting each
[02:34:38.120 --> 02:34:41.180]   other very, very fast, even close to the speed of light.
[02:34:41.180 --> 02:34:46.260]   And so Freeman Dyson, before he passed away, I think in the 70s, had this provocative paper
[02:34:46.260 --> 02:34:51.080]   called Gravitational Machines, and he suggested that you could use neutron stars as an interstellar
[02:34:51.080 --> 02:34:53.560]   propulsion system.
[02:34:53.560 --> 02:35:00.640]   And neutron stars are sort of the lower mass version of a binary black hole system, essentially.
[02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:04.280]   In this case, he suggested just doing a gravitational slingshot.
[02:35:04.280 --> 02:35:13.100]   Just fly your spacecraft into this very compact and relativistic binary system.
[02:35:13.100 --> 02:35:16.740]   And you do need neutron stars because if there were two stars, they'd be physically touching
[02:35:16.740 --> 02:35:17.840]   each other.
[02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:21.380]   So the neutron stars are so small, like 10 kilometers across, they can get really close
[02:35:21.380 --> 02:35:25.940]   to each other and have these very, very fast orbits with respect to each other.
[02:35:25.940 --> 02:35:30.060]   You shoot your spacecraft through, right through the middle, like through the eye of a needle,
[02:35:30.060 --> 02:35:32.220]   and you do a slingshot around one of them.
[02:35:32.220 --> 02:35:35.340]   And you do it around the one that's coming sort of towards you.
[02:35:35.340 --> 02:35:38.380]   So one of them will be coming away, one will be coming towards you at any one point.
[02:35:38.380 --> 02:35:42.060]   And then you could basically steal some of the kinetic energy in the slingshot.
[02:35:42.060 --> 02:35:45.380]   In principle, you can set up to twice the speed.
[02:35:45.380 --> 02:35:50.820]   You can take your speed, and it becomes your speed plus twice the speed of the neutron
[02:35:50.820 --> 02:35:51.820]   star in this case.
[02:35:51.820 --> 02:35:54.700]   And that would be your new speed after the slingshot.
[02:35:54.700 --> 02:35:57.780]   This seems great because it's just free energy, basically.
[02:35:57.780 --> 02:36:01.180]   You're not doing any, you know, you're not generating to have a nuclear power reactor
[02:36:01.180 --> 02:36:03.140]   or anything to generate this, you're just stealing it.
[02:36:03.140 --> 02:36:06.020]   And indeed, you could get to relativistic speeds this way.
[02:36:06.020 --> 02:36:09.380]   So I loved that paper, but I had a criticism.
[02:36:09.380 --> 02:36:13.820]   And the criticism was that this is like trying to fly your ship into a blender, right?
[02:36:13.820 --> 02:36:20.380]   This is two neutron stars, which have huge tidal forces, and they're whipping around
[02:36:20.380 --> 02:36:23.860]   each other once every second or even less than a second.
[02:36:23.860 --> 02:36:28.340]   And you're trying to fly your spaceship and do this maneuver that is pretty precarious.
[02:36:28.340 --> 02:36:30.860]   And so it just didn't seem practical to me to do this.
[02:36:30.860 --> 02:36:32.220]   But I loved it.
[02:36:32.220 --> 02:36:35.340]   And so I took that idea, and this is how science is.
[02:36:35.340 --> 02:36:36.340]   It's iterative.
[02:36:36.340 --> 02:36:40.700]   It's, you take a previous great man's idea, and you just sort of maybe slightly tweak
[02:36:40.700 --> 02:36:41.700]   it and improve it.
[02:36:41.700 --> 02:36:44.060]   That's how I see the halo drive.
[02:36:44.060 --> 02:36:48.180]   And I just suggested, why not replace those out for black holes, which are certainly very
[02:36:48.180 --> 02:36:49.260]   common.
[02:36:49.260 --> 02:36:55.300]   And rather than flying your ship into that hellhole of a blender system, you just stand
[02:36:55.300 --> 02:36:57.540]   back and you fire a laser beam.
[02:36:57.540 --> 02:37:01.660]   Now because black holes have such intense gravitational fields, they can bend light
[02:37:01.660 --> 02:37:02.660]   into complete 180s.
[02:37:02.660 --> 02:37:04.900]   They can actually become mirrors.
[02:37:04.900 --> 02:37:10.620]   So the sun bends light by maybe a fraction of a degree through gravitational lensing.
[02:37:10.620 --> 02:37:13.900]   But a compact object like a black hole can do a full 180.
[02:37:13.900 --> 02:37:18.100]   In fact, obviously, if you went too close, if you put the laser beam too close, the black
[02:37:18.100 --> 02:37:20.380]   hole would just fall into it and never come back out.
[02:37:20.380 --> 02:37:23.500]   So you just kind of push it out, push it out, push it out until you get to a point where
[02:37:23.500 --> 02:37:26.140]   it's just skirting the event horizon.
[02:37:26.140 --> 02:37:29.100]   And then that laser beam skirts around and it comes back.
[02:37:29.100 --> 02:37:33.380]   Now the laser beam wants to do a gravitational, I mean it is doing a gravitational slingshot,
[02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:38.860]   but laser, I mean light photons, can't speed up, unlike the spaceship case.
[02:37:38.860 --> 02:37:43.940]   So instead of speeding up, the way they steal energy is they increase their frequency.
[02:37:43.940 --> 02:37:46.860]   So they become higher energy photon packets, essentially.
[02:37:46.860 --> 02:37:48.260]   They get blue shifted.
[02:37:48.260 --> 02:37:52.820]   So that you send maybe a red laser beam that comes back blue, it's got more energy in it.
[02:37:52.820 --> 02:37:58.180]   And because photons carry momentum, which is somewhat unintuitive in everyday experience,
[02:37:58.180 --> 02:38:02.340]   but they do, that's how solar sails work, they carry momentum, they push things.
[02:38:02.340 --> 02:38:07.020]   You can even use them as laser tweezers and things to pick things up.
[02:38:07.020 --> 02:38:11.540]   Because they push, it comes back with more momentum than it left.
[02:38:11.540 --> 02:38:15.080]   So you get an acceleration force from this.
[02:38:15.080 --> 02:38:17.940]   And again, you're just stealing energy from the black hole to do this.
[02:38:17.940 --> 02:38:19.780]   So you can get up to the same speed.
[02:38:19.780 --> 02:38:24.240]   It's basically the same idea as Freeman Dyson, but doing it from a safer distance.
[02:38:24.240 --> 02:38:28.420]   And there should be of order of a million or so, or 10 million black holes in the Milky
[02:38:28.420 --> 02:38:30.420]   Way galaxy.
[02:38:30.420 --> 02:38:35.720]   Some of them would be even as close as 10 to 20 light years when you do the occurrence
[02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:39.100]   rate statistics of how close you might expect, feasibly want to be.
[02:38:39.100 --> 02:38:42.380]   They're of course difficult to detect because they're black, and so they're inherently hard
[02:38:42.380 --> 02:38:43.480]   to see.
[02:38:43.480 --> 02:38:45.980]   But statistically there should be plenty out there in the Milky Way.
[02:38:45.980 --> 02:38:49.720]   And so these objects would be natural waypoint stations.
[02:38:49.720 --> 02:38:55.700]   You could use them to both accelerate away and to break and slow down.
[02:38:55.700 --> 02:39:00.420]   - And on top of all this, we've been talking about astronomy and cosmology.
[02:39:00.420 --> 02:39:08.460]   There's been a lot of exciting breakthroughs in detection and exploration of black holes.
[02:39:08.460 --> 02:39:15.260]   So the boomerang photons that you're talking about, there's been a lot of work on photon
[02:39:15.260 --> 02:39:20.800]   rings and just all the fun stuff going on outside the black holes.
[02:39:20.800 --> 02:39:27.260]   So all the garbage outside is actually might be the thing that holds a key to understanding
[02:39:27.260 --> 02:39:28.520]   what's going on inside.
[02:39:28.520 --> 02:39:31.620]   And there's the Hawking radiation, there's all kinds of fascinating stuff.
[02:39:31.620 --> 02:39:36.620]   I mean, there's trippy stuff about black holes that I can't even, well, most people don't
[02:39:36.620 --> 02:39:37.620]   understand.
[02:39:37.620 --> 02:39:43.080]   I mean, the holographic principle with the plate and the information being stored potentially
[02:39:43.080 --> 02:39:50.080]   outside of the black hole, I can't even comprehend how you can project a three-dimensional object
[02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:53.840]   onto 2D and somehow store information where it doesn't destroy it.
[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:56.840]   And if it does destroy it, challenging all of physics.
[02:39:56.840 --> 02:40:03.360]   All of this is very interesting, especially for kind of more practical applications of
[02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:05.840]   how the black hole can be used for propulsion.
[02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:10.840]   - Yeah, I mean, it may be that black holes are used in all sorts of ways by advanced
[02:40:10.840 --> 02:40:12.400]   civilizations.
[02:40:12.400 --> 02:40:16.960]   I think, again, it's been a popular idea in science fiction or science fiction trope that
[02:40:16.960 --> 02:40:21.140]   Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole in the central galaxy, could be the best place
[02:40:21.140 --> 02:40:27.760]   to look for intelligent life in the universe because it is a giant engine in a way.
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:32.680]   You know, a unique capability of a black hole is you can basically throw matter into it
[02:40:32.680 --> 02:40:36.280]   and you can get these jets that come out, the accretion disks and the jets that fly
[02:40:36.280 --> 02:40:37.280]   out.
[02:40:37.280 --> 02:40:42.480]   And you can more or less use them to convert matter into energy via E=mc2.
[02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:48.080]   And there's pretty much nothing else except for annihilation with its own antiparticle
[02:40:48.080 --> 02:40:49.960]   as a way of doing that.
[02:40:49.960 --> 02:40:51.140]   So they have some unique properties.
[02:40:51.140 --> 02:40:56.040]   You could perhaps power a civilization by just throwing garbage into a black hole, right?
[02:40:56.040 --> 02:40:59.640]   Just throwing asteroids in and power your civilization with as much energy as you really
[02:40:59.640 --> 02:41:01.780]   would ever plausibly need.
[02:41:01.780 --> 02:41:05.420]   And you could also use them to accelerate away across the universe.
[02:41:05.420 --> 02:41:09.760]   And you can even imagine using small artificial black holes as thermal generators, right?
[02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:14.440]   So the Hawking radiation from them kind of exponentially increases as they get smaller
[02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:16.160]   and smaller in size.
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:21.200]   And so a very small black hole, one that you can almost imagine like holding in your hand,
[02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:24.520]   would be a fairly significant heat source.
[02:41:24.520 --> 02:41:29.660]   And so that raises all sorts of prospects about how you might use that in an engineering
[02:41:29.660 --> 02:41:34.040]   context to power your civilization as well.
[02:41:34.040 --> 02:41:37.480]   You have a video on becoming a Kardashev Type I civilization.
[02:41:37.480 --> 02:41:39.200]   What's our hope for doing that?
[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:41.520]   We're a few orders of magnitude away from that.
[02:41:41.520 --> 02:41:43.240]   Yeah, it is surprising.
[02:41:43.240 --> 02:41:47.400]   I think people tend to think that we're close to this scale.
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:53.680]   The Kardashev Type I is defined as a civilization which is using as much energy as is essentially
[02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:56.120]   incident upon the planet from the star.
[02:41:56.120 --> 02:42:01.520]   So as of order, I think, for the Earth of something like 10^5 terawatts or 10^7 terawatts
[02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:04.120]   is a gigantic amount of energy.
[02:42:04.120 --> 02:42:07.640]   And we're using a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of that right now.
[02:42:07.640 --> 02:42:14.280]   So if you became a Kardashev Type I civilization, which is seen not necessarily as a goal into
[02:42:14.280 --> 02:42:20.560]   itself, I think people think, "Well, why are we aspiring to become this energy-hungry civilization?
[02:42:20.560 --> 02:42:27.400]   Surely our energy needs might improve our efficiency or something as time goes on."
[02:42:27.400 --> 02:42:32.320]   But ultimately, the more energy you have access to, the greater your capabilities will be.
[02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:38.280]   If you want to lift Mount Everest into space, there is just a calculable amount of potential
[02:42:38.280 --> 02:42:41.720]   energy change that that's going to take in order to accomplish that.
[02:42:41.720 --> 02:42:46.200]   And the more energy you have access to as a civilization, then clearly the easier that
[02:42:46.200 --> 02:42:48.200]   energy achievement is going to be.
[02:42:48.200 --> 02:42:50.240]   So it depends on what your aspirations are as a civilization.
[02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:53.560]   It might not be something you want to ever do, but...
[02:42:53.560 --> 02:42:57.560]   - We should make clear that lifting heavy things isn't the only thing.
[02:42:57.560 --> 02:42:58.880]   It's just doing work.
[02:42:58.880 --> 02:43:01.520]   So it could be computation.
[02:43:01.520 --> 02:43:05.160]   It could be more and more and more and more sophisticated and larger and larger and larger
[02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:13.920]   computation, which is, it does seem where we're headed with the very fast increase in
[02:43:13.920 --> 02:43:19.680]   the scale and the quality of our computation outside the human brain, artificial computation.
[02:43:19.680 --> 02:43:20.680]   - Yeah.
[02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:25.960]   - Computation is a great example of, I mean, already I think some 10% of US power electricity
[02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:28.440]   use is going towards the supercomputing centers.
[02:43:28.440 --> 02:43:33.080]   So there's a vast amount of current energy needs which are already going towards computing,
[02:43:33.080 --> 02:43:36.520]   but surely only increase over time.
[02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:42.800]   If we start ever doing anything like mind uploading or creating simulated realities,
[02:43:42.800 --> 02:43:46.600]   that cost will surely become almost a dominant source of our energy requirements at that
[02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:52.360]   point if civilization completely moves over to this kind of post-humanism stage.
[02:43:52.360 --> 02:43:56.680]   And so it's not unreasonable that our energy needs would continue to grow.
[02:43:56.680 --> 02:44:00.520]   Certainly historically, they always have at about 2% per year.
[02:44:00.520 --> 02:44:05.800]   And so if that continues, there is going to be a certain point where you're running up
[02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:10.000]   against the amount of energy which you can harvest, because you're using every, even
[02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:15.240]   if you cover the entire planet in solar panels, there's no more energy to be had.
[02:44:15.240 --> 02:44:17.720]   And so there's a few ways of achieving this.
[02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:21.600]   I sort of talked about in the video how there were several renewable energy sources that
[02:44:21.600 --> 02:44:27.400]   we're excited about, like geothermal, wind power, waves, but pretty much all of those
[02:44:27.400 --> 02:44:30.880]   don't really scratch the surface or don't really scratch the itch of getting to a Kardashev
[02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:32.240]   type one civilization.
[02:44:32.240 --> 02:44:37.640]   That meaningful now, I would never tell anybody don't do wind power now because it's clearly
[02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:42.800]   useful at our current stage of civilization, but it's going to be a pretty negligible fraction
[02:44:42.800 --> 02:44:45.960]   of our energy requirements if we got to that stage of development.
[02:44:45.960 --> 02:44:50.960]   And so there has to be a breakthrough in either our ability to harvest solar energy, which
[02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:55.040]   would require maybe something like a space array of solar panels of beaming the energy
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:45:02.720]   back down, or some developments and innovations in nuclear fusion that would allow us to essentially
[02:45:02.720 --> 02:45:08.640]   reproduce the same process of what's producing the solar photons, but here on Earth.
[02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:10.420]   But even that comes with some consequences.
[02:45:10.420 --> 02:45:14.220]   If you're generating the energy here on Earth and you're doing work on it on Earth, then
[02:45:14.220 --> 02:45:17.360]   that work is going to produce waste heat, and that waste heat is going to increase the
[02:45:17.360 --> 02:45:19.280]   ambient temperature of the planet.
[02:45:19.280 --> 02:45:24.960]   And so even if this isn't really a greenhouse effect that you're increasing the temperature
[02:45:24.960 --> 02:45:27.760]   of the planet, this is just the amount of computers that are churning.
[02:45:27.760 --> 02:45:30.920]   You put your hand to a computer, you can feel the warmth coming off them.
[02:45:30.920 --> 02:45:36.040]   If you do that much work of literally the entire instant energy of the planet is doing
[02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:41.320]   that work, the planet's going to warm up significantly as a result of that.
[02:45:41.320 --> 02:45:47.800]   And so that clearly indicates that this is not a sustainable path.
[02:45:47.800 --> 02:45:52.040]   That civilizations as they approach Kailash-Eve type 1 are going to have to leave planet Earth,
[02:45:52.040 --> 02:45:58.640]   which is really the point of that video, to show that a Kailash-Eve type 1 civilization,
[02:45:58.640 --> 02:46:03.440]   even though it's defined as instant energy upon a planet, that is not a species that
[02:46:03.440 --> 02:46:07.800]   is going to still be living on their planet, at least in isolation.
[02:46:07.800 --> 02:46:12.960]   They will have to be harvesting energy from afar, they will have to be doing work on that
[02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:18.120]   energy outside of their planet, because otherwise you're going to dramatically change the environment
[02:46:18.120 --> 02:46:19.120]   in which you live.
[02:46:19.120 --> 02:46:26.240]   - Well, yeah, so the more energy you create, the more energy you use, the higher the imperative
[02:46:26.240 --> 02:46:27.800]   to expand out into the universe.
[02:46:27.800 --> 02:46:31.240]   But also not just the imperative, but the capabilities.
[02:46:31.240 --> 02:46:36.920]   I mean, you've kind of, as a side on your lab page, mentioned that you're sometimes
[02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:39.720]   interested in astroengineering.
[02:46:39.720 --> 02:46:46.280]   So what kind of space architectures do you think we can build to house humans or interesting
[02:46:46.280 --> 02:46:47.880]   things outside of Earth?
[02:46:47.880 --> 02:46:51.840]   - Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of fun ideas here.
[02:46:51.840 --> 02:46:55.280]   One of the classic ideas is an O'Neill cylinder, or a Stanford torus.
[02:46:55.280 --> 02:46:59.680]   These are like two rotating structures that were devised in space.
[02:46:59.680 --> 02:47:04.800]   They're basically using the centrifugal force as artificial gravity.
[02:47:04.800 --> 02:47:08.520]   And so these are structures which tend to be many kilometers across that you're building
[02:47:08.520 --> 02:47:16.680]   in space, but could potentially habitat millions of people in orbit of the Earth.
[02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:21.240]   Of course, you could imagine putting them, the Expanse does a pretty good job, I think,
[02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:27.160]   of exploring the idea of human exploration of the solar system and having many objects,
[02:47:27.160 --> 02:47:33.280]   many of the small near-Earth objects and asteroids inhabited by mining colonies.
[02:47:33.280 --> 02:47:38.160]   One of the ideas we've played around with our group is this technology called a quasite.
[02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:44.840]   A quasite is an extension, again, we always tend to extend previous ideas, ideas build
[02:47:44.840 --> 02:47:48.440]   upon ideas, but an extension idea called a statite.
[02:47:48.440 --> 02:47:52.920]   A statite was an idea proposed, I think, by Ron Forward in the 1970s.
[02:47:52.920 --> 02:47:55.720]   1970s seem to have all sorts of wacky ideas.
[02:47:55.720 --> 02:47:58.000]   I don't know what was going on then.
[02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:04.520]   I think the Stanford torus, the O'Neill cylinder, statites, the gravitational lens.
[02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:09.160]   People were really having fun with dreaming about space in the 70s.
[02:48:09.160 --> 02:48:16.120]   The statite is basically a solar sail, but it's such an efficient solar sail that the
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:20.640]   outward force of radiation pressure equals the inward force of gravity from the Sun.
[02:48:20.640 --> 02:48:22.840]   And so it doesn't need to orbit.
[02:48:22.840 --> 02:48:29.280]   The Sun is pulling us right now through force of gravity, but we are not getting closer
[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:33.240]   towards the Sun, even though we are falling towards the Sun because we're in orbit, which
[02:48:33.240 --> 02:48:38.080]   means our translational speed is just enough to keep us at the same altitude, essentially,
[02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:39.080]   from the Sun.
[02:48:39.080 --> 02:48:41.840]   And so you're in orbit, and that's how you maintain distance.
[02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:43.280]   A statite doesn't need to do that.
[02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:49.280]   It could be basically completely static in inertial space, but it's just balancing the
[02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:53.440]   two forces of radiation pressure and inward gravitational pressure.
[02:48:53.440 --> 02:48:56.880]   A quasite is the in-between of those two states.
[02:48:56.880 --> 02:49:03.280]   So it has some significant outward pressure, but not enough to resist fully falling into
[02:49:03.280 --> 02:49:04.280]   the star.
[02:49:04.280 --> 02:49:07.640]   And so it compensates for that by having some translational motion.
[02:49:07.640 --> 02:49:10.960]   So it's in between an orbit and a statite.
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:14.880]   And so what that allows you to do is maintain artificial orbits.
[02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:19.200]   So normally, if you want to calculate your orbital speed of something at, say, half an
[02:49:19.200 --> 02:49:22.080]   AU, you would use Kepler's third law and go through that.
[02:49:22.080 --> 02:49:26.120]   And you'd say, "Okay, if it's at half an AU, I can calculate the period by p squared as
[02:49:26.120 --> 02:49:28.680]   proportional to a cubed and go through that."
[02:49:28.680 --> 02:49:32.840]   But for a quasite, you can basically have any speed you want.
[02:49:32.840 --> 02:49:38.240]   It's just a matter of how much of the gravitational force are you balancing out.
[02:49:38.240 --> 02:49:42.340]   You effectively enter an orbit where you're making the mass of the star be less massive
[02:49:42.340 --> 02:49:43.820]   than it really is.
[02:49:43.820 --> 02:49:47.800]   So it's as if you're orbiting a 0.1 solar mass star or a 0.2 solar mass star, whatever
[02:49:47.800 --> 02:49:48.800]   you want.
[02:49:48.800 --> 02:49:56.600]   And so that means that Mercury orbits with a pretty fast orbital speed around the Sun
[02:49:56.600 --> 02:49:59.040]   because it's closer to the Sun than we are.
[02:49:59.040 --> 02:50:03.520]   But we could put something in Mercury's orbit that would have a slower speed, and so it
[02:50:03.520 --> 02:50:05.840]   would co-track with the Earth.
[02:50:05.840 --> 02:50:09.460]   And so we would always be aligned with them at all times.
[02:50:09.460 --> 02:50:16.800]   And so this could be useful if you wanted to have either a chain of colonies or something
[02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:23.520]   that were able to easily communicate and move between one another, between these different
[02:50:23.520 --> 02:50:24.520]   bases.
[02:50:24.520 --> 02:50:30.380]   You'd probably use something like this to maintain that easy transferability.
[02:50:30.380 --> 02:50:35.100]   Or you could even use it as a space weather monitoring system, which was actually proposed
[02:50:35.100 --> 02:50:36.740]   in the paper.
[02:50:36.740 --> 02:50:41.340]   We know that major events like the Carrington event that happened, it can knock out all
[02:50:41.340 --> 02:50:43.060]   of our electromagnetic systems quite easily.
[02:50:43.060 --> 02:50:46.980]   A major solar flare could do that, a geomagnetic storm.
[02:50:46.980 --> 02:50:55.780]   But if we had the ability to detect those higher elevated activity cycles in advance,
[02:50:55.780 --> 02:50:59.460]   the problem is they travel obviously pretty fast, and so it's hard to get ahead of them.
[02:50:59.460 --> 02:51:03.220]   But you could have a station which is basically sampling solar flares very close to the surface
[02:51:03.220 --> 02:51:08.380]   of the Earth, and as soon as it detects anything suspicious, magnetically, it could then send
[02:51:08.380 --> 02:51:11.860]   that information straight back at the speed of light to your Earth and give you maybe
[02:51:11.860 --> 02:51:16.060]   a half an hour warning or something, that something bad was coming.
[02:51:16.060 --> 02:51:21.980]   You should shut off all your systems or get in your Faraday cage now and protect yourself.
[02:51:21.980 --> 02:51:27.620]   And so these quasites are kind of a cool trick of again, kind of hacking the laws of physics.
[02:51:27.620 --> 02:51:32.940]   It's like another one of these exploits that the universe seems to allow us to do, to potentially
[02:51:32.940 --> 02:51:38.220]   manifest these artificial systems that would otherwise be difficult to produce.
[02:51:38.220 --> 02:51:40.980]   LBW So leveraging natural phenomena.
[02:51:40.980 --> 02:51:42.940]   CB Yeah.
[02:51:42.940 --> 02:51:47.060]   That's always the key, is to work, in my mind, is to work with nature.
[02:51:47.060 --> 02:51:49.540]   That's how I see astroengineering, rather than against it.
[02:51:49.540 --> 02:51:53.380]   You're not trying to force it to do something.
[02:51:53.380 --> 02:51:57.140]   That's why I always think solar energy is so powerful, because in the battle against
[02:51:57.140 --> 02:52:00.980]   nuclear fusion, nuclear fusion you're really fighting a battle where you're trying to confine
[02:52:00.980 --> 02:52:05.900]   plasma into this extremely tight space.
[02:52:05.900 --> 02:52:08.660]   The Sun does this for free; it has gravitation.
[02:52:08.660 --> 02:52:12.780]   And so that's in essence what a solar panel does.
[02:52:12.780 --> 02:52:19.540]   It is a nuclear fusion reactor-fuelled energy system, but it's just using gravitation for
[02:52:19.540 --> 02:52:24.800]   the confinement and having a huge standoff distance for its energy collection.
[02:52:24.800 --> 02:52:30.520]   And so there are tricks like that, it's a very naive, simple trick in that case, where
[02:52:30.520 --> 02:52:35.520]   we can, rather than having to reinvent the wheel, we can use the space infrastructure,
[02:52:35.520 --> 02:52:38.760]   if you like, the astrophysical infrastructure that's already there to our benefit.
[02:52:38.760 --> 02:52:44.080]   LBW Yeah, I think in the long arc of human history, probably natural phenomena is the
[02:52:44.080 --> 02:52:45.080]   right solution.
[02:52:45.080 --> 02:52:48.640]   That's the simple, that's the elegant solution, because all the power's already there.
[02:52:48.640 --> 02:52:52.240]   That's why a Dyson sphere in the long, sort of...
[02:52:52.240 --> 02:52:57.640]   Well, you don't know what a Dyson sphere would look like, but some kind of thing that leverages
[02:52:57.640 --> 02:53:03.920]   the power, the energy that's already in the Sun is better than creating artificial nuclear
[02:53:03.920 --> 02:53:05.120]   fusion reaction.
[02:53:05.120 --> 02:53:10.000]   But then again, that brings us to the topic of AI.
[02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:19.240]   How much of this, if we're traveling out there, interstellar travel, or doing some of the
[02:53:19.240 --> 02:53:24.360]   interesting things we've been talking about, how much of those ships would be occupied
[02:53:24.360 --> 02:53:31.880]   by AI systems, do you think?
[02:53:31.880 --> 02:53:35.800]   What would be the living organisms occupying those ships?
[02:53:35.800 --> 02:53:43.160]   CB: Yeah, it's depressing to think about AI in the search for life, because it has...
[02:53:43.160 --> 02:53:46.280]   I mean, I've been thinking about this a lot over the last few weeks with playing around
[02:53:46.280 --> 02:53:50.760]   with Chat GPT-3, like many of us, and being astonished with its capabilities.
[02:53:50.760 --> 02:53:59.400]   And you see that our society is undergoing a change that seems significant in terms of
[02:53:59.400 --> 02:54:00.960]   the development of artificial intelligence.
[02:54:00.960 --> 02:54:06.240]   We've been promised this revolution, this singularity, for a long time, but it really
[02:54:06.240 --> 02:54:12.200]   seems to be stepping up its pace of development at this point.
[02:54:12.200 --> 02:54:18.080]   And so that's interesting, because as someone who looks for alien life out there in the
[02:54:18.080 --> 02:54:25.880]   universe, it sort of implies that our current stage of development is highly transitional.
[02:54:25.880 --> 02:54:31.840]   And that you go back for the last four and a half billion years, the planet was dumb,
[02:54:31.840 --> 02:54:32.840]   essentially.
[02:54:32.840 --> 02:54:36.320]   If you go back the last few thousand years, there was a civilization, but it wasn't really
[02:54:36.320 --> 02:54:38.360]   producing any technosignatures.
[02:54:38.360 --> 02:54:41.680]   And then over the last maybe hundred years, there's been something that might be detectable
[02:54:41.680 --> 02:54:43.560]   from afar.
[02:54:43.560 --> 02:54:47.360]   But we're approaching this cusp where we might imagine it.
[02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:52.000]   I mean, we're thinking of maybe years and decades with AI development, typically when
[02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:53.440]   we talk about this.
[02:54:53.440 --> 02:54:58.440]   But as an astronomer, I have to think about much longer timescales of centuries, millennia,
[02:54:58.440 --> 02:54:59.980]   millions of years.
[02:54:59.980 --> 02:55:06.720]   And so if this wave continues over that timescale, which is still the blink of an eye on a cosmic
[02:55:06.720 --> 02:55:12.880]   timescale, that implies that everything will be AI, essentially, out there if this is a
[02:55:12.880 --> 02:55:14.080]   common behavior.
[02:55:14.080 --> 02:55:20.160]   And so that's intriguing, because it sort of implies that we are special in terms of
[02:55:20.160 --> 02:55:23.320]   our moment in time as a civilization.
[02:55:23.320 --> 02:55:28.280]   Which normally is something we're averse to as astronomers.
[02:55:28.280 --> 02:55:30.480]   We normally like this mediocrity principle.
[02:55:30.480 --> 02:55:33.880]   We're not special, we're a typical part of the universe, similar to the cosmological
[02:55:33.880 --> 02:55:34.880]   principle.
[02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:40.360]   But in a temporal sense, we may be in a unique location.
[02:55:40.360 --> 02:55:44.280]   And perhaps that is part of the solution to the Fermi paradox, in fact.
[02:55:44.280 --> 02:55:50.060]   That if it is true that planets tend to go through basically three phases, dumb life
[02:55:50.060 --> 02:55:55.920]   for the vast majority, a brief period of biological intelligence, and then an extended period
[02:55:55.920 --> 02:56:02.400]   of artificial intelligence that they transition to, then we would be in a unique and special
[02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:07.320]   moment in galactic history that would be of particular interest for any anthropologist
[02:56:07.320 --> 02:56:09.160]   out there in the galaxy.
[02:56:09.160 --> 02:56:14.280]   This would be the time that you would want to study a civilization very carefully.
[02:56:14.280 --> 02:56:18.760]   You wouldn't want to interfere with it, you would just want to see how it plays out.
[02:56:18.760 --> 02:56:22.320]   Kind of similar to the ancestor simulations, though sometimes talked over the simulation
[02:56:22.320 --> 02:56:28.880]   argument, that you are able to observe perhaps your own origins and study how the transformation
[02:56:28.880 --> 02:56:29.880]   happens.
[02:56:29.880 --> 02:56:33.880]   So yeah, that has for me recently been throwing the Fermi paradox a bit on its head.
[02:56:33.880 --> 02:56:38.120]   And this idea of the Zoo hypothesis that we may be monitored, which has for a long time
[02:56:38.120 --> 02:56:43.320]   been sort of seen as a fringe idea, even amongst the SETI community.
[02:56:43.320 --> 02:56:50.160]   But if we live in this truly transitional period, it adds a lot of impetus to that idea,
[02:56:50.160 --> 02:56:51.160]   I think.
[02:56:51.160 --> 02:56:59.080]   - I think even AI itself, by its very nature, would be observing us.
[02:56:59.080 --> 02:57:05.080]   It's like, there used to be this concept of human computation, which is actually exactly
[02:57:05.080 --> 02:57:10.760]   what's feeding the current language models, which is leveraging all the busy stuff we're
[02:57:10.760 --> 02:57:14.240]   doing to do the hard work of learning.
[02:57:14.240 --> 02:57:21.120]   So the language models are trained on human interaction and human language on the internet.
[02:57:21.120 --> 02:57:30.000]   And so AI feeds on the output of brain power from humans.
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:35.200]   And so it would be observing and observing, and it gets stronger as it observes.
[02:57:35.200 --> 02:57:38.440]   So it actually gets extremely good at observing humans.
[02:57:38.440 --> 02:57:45.320]   And one of the interesting philosophical questions that starts percolating is, what is the interesting
[02:57:45.320 --> 02:57:48.360]   thing that makes us human?
[02:57:48.360 --> 02:57:52.240]   We tend to think of it, and you said there's three phases.
[02:57:52.240 --> 02:57:56.280]   What's the thing that's hard to come by in phase three?
[02:57:56.280 --> 02:57:59.760]   Is it something like scarcity, which is limited resources?
[02:57:59.760 --> 02:58:01.600]   Is it something like consciousness?
[02:58:01.600 --> 02:58:10.040]   Is that the thing that's very, that emerged the evolutionary process in biological systems
[02:58:10.040 --> 02:58:15.060]   that are operating under constrained resources?
[02:58:15.060 --> 02:58:19.000]   This thing that feels, that it feels like something to experience the world, which we
[02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:24.600]   think of as consciousness, is that really difficult to replicate in artificial systems?
[02:58:24.600 --> 02:58:27.620]   Is that the thing that makes us fundamentally human?
[02:58:27.620 --> 02:58:32.960]   Or is it just a side effect that we attribute way too much importance to?
[02:58:32.960 --> 02:58:37.940]   Do you have a sense?
[02:58:37.940 --> 02:58:42.760]   If we look out into the future and AI systems are the ones that are traveling out there
[02:58:42.760 --> 02:58:49.080]   to Alpha Centauri and beyond, do you think they have to carry the flame of consciousness
[02:58:49.080 --> 02:58:50.080]   with them?
[02:58:50.080 --> 02:58:53.520]   >>JG: No, not necessarily.
[02:58:53.520 --> 02:58:56.840]   They may do, but it may not be necessarily...
[02:58:56.840 --> 02:59:03.000]   I mean, I guess we're talking about the difference here between sort of an AGI, artificial general
[02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:08.680]   intelligence, or consciousness, which are distinct ideas, and you can certainly have
[02:59:08.680 --> 02:59:09.720]   one without the other.
[02:59:09.720 --> 02:59:10.720]   So I could imagine...
[02:59:10.720 --> 02:59:14.120]   I would disagree with it certainly in that statement.
[02:59:14.120 --> 02:59:18.320]   I think it's very possible in order to have intelligence you have to have consciousness.
[02:59:18.320 --> 02:59:19.320]   >>Corey: Okay.
[02:59:19.320 --> 02:59:24.480]   Well, I mean, to a certain degree, GPT-3 has a level of intelligence already.
[02:59:24.480 --> 02:59:30.520]   It's not general intelligence, but it displays properties of intelligence with no consciousness.
[02:59:30.520 --> 02:59:33.320]   >>JG: Again, I would disagree.
[02:59:33.320 --> 02:59:35.320]   >>Corey: Okay, okay.
[02:59:35.320 --> 02:59:37.520]   Well, I don't know.
[02:59:37.520 --> 02:59:43.360]   >>JG: Because you said, it's very nice that you said, "It displays properties of intelligence."
[02:59:43.360 --> 02:59:47.160]   In the same way it displays properties of intelligence, I would say it's starting to
[02:59:47.160 --> 02:59:49.360]   display properties of consciousness.
[02:59:49.360 --> 02:59:51.360]   It certainly could fool you that it's conscious.
[02:59:51.360 --> 02:59:52.360]   >>Corey: Correct, yeah.
[02:59:52.360 --> 02:59:59.240]   So I guess there's like a Turing test problem, like if it's displaying all those properties,
[02:59:59.240 --> 03:00:04.040]   if it quacks like a parrot, looks like a parrot, or quacks like a duck, isn't it basically
[03:00:04.040 --> 03:00:05.240]   a duck at that point?
[03:00:05.240 --> 03:00:08.280]   So yeah, I can see that argument.
[03:00:08.280 --> 03:00:15.200]   It probably, I mean, certainly I try to think about it from the observer's point of view
[03:00:15.200 --> 03:00:16.200]   as an astronomer.
[03:00:16.200 --> 03:00:18.280]   What am I looking for?
[03:00:18.280 --> 03:00:25.640]   Whether that intelligence is conscious or not has little bearing, I think, as to what
[03:00:25.640 --> 03:00:30.680]   I should be looking for when I'm trying to detect evidence of them.
[03:00:30.680 --> 03:00:38.240]   It would maybe affect their behavior in ways that I can't predict.
[03:00:38.240 --> 03:00:42.040]   But that's again getting into the game of what I would call xenopsychology, of trying
[03:00:42.040 --> 03:00:47.800]   to make projections about the motivations of an alien species is incredibly difficult.
[03:00:47.800 --> 03:00:52.580]   And similarly for any kind of artificial intelligence, it's unfathomable what its intentions may
[03:00:52.580 --> 03:00:53.580]   be.
[03:00:53.580 --> 03:00:58.640]   I mean, I would sort of question whether it would even be interested in traveling between
[03:00:58.640 --> 03:01:06.080]   the stars at all if its primary goal is computation, computation for the sake of computation.
[03:01:06.080 --> 03:01:11.520]   Then it's probably going to have a different way of, you know, it's going to be engineering
[03:01:11.520 --> 03:01:16.560]   its solar system and the nearby material around it for a different goal if it's just simply
[03:01:16.560 --> 03:01:21.080]   trying to increase computer substrate across the universe.
[03:01:21.080 --> 03:01:25.240]   And that of course, if that is its principal intention, to just essentially convert dumb
[03:01:25.240 --> 03:01:31.040]   matter into smart matter as it goes, then I think that would come into conflict with
[03:01:31.040 --> 03:01:32.880]   our observations of the universe, right?
[03:01:32.880 --> 03:01:36.920]   Because the Earth shouldn't be here if that were true.
[03:01:36.920 --> 03:01:40.240]   The Earth should have been transformed into computer substrate by this point.
[03:01:40.240 --> 03:01:45.920]   There has been plenty of time in the history of the galaxy for that to have happened.
[03:01:45.920 --> 03:01:54.720]   So I'm skeptical that we can...I'm skeptical in the part that that's a behavior that AI
[03:01:54.720 --> 03:01:59.200]   or any civilization really engages in, but I also find it difficult to find a way out
[03:01:59.200 --> 03:02:01.200]   of it.
[03:02:01.200 --> 03:02:05.680]   To explain why that would never happen in the entire history of the galaxy amongst potentially
[03:02:05.680 --> 03:02:11.360]   if life is common, millions, maybe even billions of instant instantiations of AI could have
[03:02:11.360 --> 03:02:14.160]   occurred across the galaxy.
[03:02:14.160 --> 03:02:20.480]   And so that seems to be a knock against the idea that there is life else or intelligent
[03:02:20.480 --> 03:02:22.880]   life elsewhere in the galaxy.
[03:02:22.880 --> 03:02:28.520]   The fact that that hasn't occurred in our history is maybe the only solid data point
[03:02:28.520 --> 03:02:32.480]   we really have about the activities of other civilizations.
[03:02:32.480 --> 03:02:40.040]   LB: Of course, the scary one could be that we just at this stage, intelligent alien civilizations
[03:02:40.040 --> 03:02:43.040]   just start destroying themselves.
[03:02:43.040 --> 03:02:44.640]   It becomes too powerful.
[03:02:44.640 --> 03:02:48.840]   Everything's just too many weapons, too many nuclear weapons, too many nuclear weapon style
[03:02:48.840 --> 03:02:56.200]   systems that just from mistake to aggression to like the probability of self-destruction
[03:02:56.200 --> 03:03:03.120]   is too high relative to the challenge of avoiding the technological challenges of avoiding self-destruction.
[03:03:03.120 --> 03:03:11.080]   LB: You mean the AI destroys itself or we destroy ourselves prior to the advent of AI?
[03:03:11.080 --> 03:03:17.240]   As we get smarter and smarter, AI, either AI destroys us or other, there could be just
[03:03:17.240 --> 03:03:18.240]   a million.
[03:03:18.240 --> 03:03:22.240]   Like AI is correlated, the development of AI is correlated with all this other technological
[03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:23.240]   innovation.
[03:03:23.240 --> 03:03:32.560]   Genetic engineering, all kinds of engineering at the nano scale, mass manufacture of things
[03:03:32.560 --> 03:03:38.560]   that could destroy us or cracking physics enough to have very powerful weapons, nuclear
[03:03:38.560 --> 03:03:40.320]   weapons, all of it.
[03:03:40.320 --> 03:03:49.000]   Just too much physics enables way too many things that can destroy us before it enables
[03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:56.320]   the propulsion systems that allow us to fly far enough away before we destroy ourselves.
[03:03:56.320 --> 03:03:58.640]   So maybe that's what happens to the other alien civilizations.
[03:03:58.640 --> 03:03:59.640]   Is that your resolution?
[03:03:59.640 --> 03:04:04.680]   Because I mean, I think us in the technosignature community and astronomy community aren't thinking
[03:04:04.680 --> 03:04:07.560]   about this problem seriously enough, in my opinion.
[03:04:07.560 --> 03:04:13.640]   We should be thinking about what AI is doing to our society and the implications of what
[03:04:13.640 --> 03:04:14.920]   we're looking for.
[03:04:14.920 --> 03:04:20.560]   And so the only, I think, part of this thinking has to involve people like yourself who are
[03:04:20.560 --> 03:04:24.880]   more intimate with the machine learning and artificial intelligence world.
[03:04:24.880 --> 03:04:30.000]   How do you reconcile in your mind, you said earlier that you think you can't imagine a
[03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:35.000]   galaxy where life and intelligence is not all over the place.
[03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:39.760]   And if artificial intelligence is a natural progression for civilizations, how do you
[03:04:39.760 --> 03:04:44.560]   reconcile that with the absence of any information around us?
[03:04:44.560 --> 03:04:51.520]   So any clues or hints of artificial behavior, artificially engineered stars, or colonization,
[03:04:51.520 --> 03:04:54.560]   computer substrate transform planets, anything like that?
[03:04:54.560 --> 03:04:58.200]   It's extremely difficult for me.
[03:04:58.200 --> 03:05:02.040]   The Fermi paradox broadly defined is extremely difficult for me.
[03:05:02.040 --> 03:05:07.640]   And the terrifying thing is one thing I suspect is that we keep destroying ourselves.
[03:05:07.640 --> 03:05:12.760]   The probability of self-destruction with advanced technology is just extremely high.
[03:05:12.760 --> 03:05:15.620]   That's why we're not seeing it.
[03:05:15.620 --> 03:05:22.360]   But then again, my intuition about why we haven't blown ourselves up with nuclear weapons,
[03:05:22.360 --> 03:05:26.560]   it's very surprising to me from a scientific perspective.
[03:05:26.560 --> 03:05:34.000]   Given all the cruelty I've seen in the world, given the power that nuclear weapons place
[03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:39.200]   in the hands of a very small number of individuals, it's very surprising to me we destroy ourselves.
[03:05:39.200 --> 03:05:45.960]   And it seems to be a very low probability situation we have happening here.
[03:05:45.960 --> 03:05:52.200]   And then the other explanation is the zoo, is the observation that we're just being observed.
[03:05:52.200 --> 03:05:53.360]   That's the only other thing.
[03:05:53.360 --> 03:05:57.280]   It's just so difficult for me.
[03:05:57.280 --> 03:06:00.000]   Of course, all of science, everything is very humbling.
[03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:06.080]   It would be very humbling for me to learn that we're alone in the universe.
[03:06:06.080 --> 03:06:08.760]   It would change.
[03:06:08.760 --> 03:06:10.320]   You know what?
[03:06:10.320 --> 03:06:13.280]   Maybe I do want that to be true 'cause you want us to be special.
[03:06:13.280 --> 03:06:15.720]   That's why I'm resisting that thought maybe.
[03:06:15.720 --> 03:06:17.840]   There's no way we're that special.
[03:06:17.840 --> 03:06:19.800]   There's no way we're that special.
[03:06:19.800 --> 03:06:21.400]   That's where my resistance comes from.
[03:06:21.400 --> 03:06:26.240]   I would just say the specialness is something...
[03:06:26.240 --> 03:06:31.880]   Implicitly in that statement, there's kind of an assumption that we are something positive.
[03:06:31.880 --> 03:06:34.640]   We're a gift to this planet or something, and that makes us special.
[03:06:34.640 --> 03:06:39.000]   But it may be that intelligence is more of a...
[03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:40.600]   We're like rats or cockroaches.
[03:06:40.600 --> 03:06:43.080]   We're an infestation of this planet.
[03:06:43.080 --> 03:06:49.520]   We're not some benevolent property that a planet would ideally like to have, if you
[03:06:49.520 --> 03:06:50.840]   can even say such a thing.
[03:06:50.840 --> 03:06:57.280]   But we may be not only generally a negative force for a planet's biosphere and its own
[03:06:57.280 --> 03:07:01.880]   survivability, which I think you can make a strong argument about, but we may also be
[03:07:01.880 --> 03:07:05.400]   a very persistent infestation that may...
[03:07:05.400 --> 03:07:06.400]   Even in...
[03:07:06.400 --> 03:07:07.400]   Interesting thoughts.
[03:07:07.400 --> 03:07:13.320]   In the wake of a nuclear war, would that be an absolute eradication of every human being,
[03:07:13.320 --> 03:07:16.280]   which would be a fairly extreme event?
[03:07:16.280 --> 03:07:20.440]   Or would the Candela consciousness, as you might call it, the flame of consciousness,
[03:07:20.440 --> 03:07:27.080]   only with some small pockets, that would maybe in 10,000 years, 100,000 years, we'd see civilization
[03:07:27.080 --> 03:07:30.120]   re-emerge and play out the same thing over again?
[03:07:30.120 --> 03:07:31.120]   Yeah, certainly.
[03:07:31.120 --> 03:07:33.920]   But nuclear weapons aren't powerful enough yet.
[03:07:33.920 --> 03:07:38.840]   But yes, to sort of push back on the infestation, sure.
[03:07:38.840 --> 03:07:42.560]   But the word 'special' doesn't have to be positive.
[03:07:42.560 --> 03:07:43.560]   I just mean...
[03:07:43.560 --> 03:07:45.160]   I think it tends to imply...
[03:07:45.160 --> 03:07:46.440]   I take your point, yeah.
[03:07:46.440 --> 03:07:50.760]   That maybe... just maybe extremely rare might be.
[03:07:50.760 --> 03:08:00.760]   Yeah, and that to me, it's very strange for me to be cosmically unique.
[03:08:00.760 --> 03:08:03.680]   It's just very strange.
[03:08:03.680 --> 03:08:11.600]   I mean, that we're the only thing of this level of complexity in the galaxy just seems
[03:08:11.600 --> 03:08:13.640]   very strange to me.
[03:08:13.640 --> 03:08:18.080]   I would just... yeah, I do think it depends on this classification.
[03:08:18.080 --> 03:08:22.160]   I think there is sort of, again, it's kind of buried within there as a subtext, but there
[03:08:22.160 --> 03:08:29.160]   is a classification that we're doing here that what we are is a distinct category of
[03:08:29.160 --> 03:08:30.680]   life, let's say in this case.
[03:08:30.680 --> 03:08:35.040]   When we're talking about intelligence, we are something that can be separated.
[03:08:35.040 --> 03:08:41.400]   But of course, we see intelligence across the animal kingdom in dolphins, humpback whales,
[03:08:41.400 --> 03:08:43.760]   octopuses, crows, ravens.
[03:08:43.760 --> 03:08:51.320]   And so it's quite possible that these are all manifestations of the same thing.
[03:08:51.320 --> 03:08:57.680]   And we are not a particularly distinct class, except for the fact we make technology.
[03:08:57.680 --> 03:08:59.800]   That's really the only difference to our intelligence.
[03:08:59.800 --> 03:09:05.040]   And we classify that separately, but from a biological perspective, to some degree,
[03:09:05.040 --> 03:09:07.020]   it's really just all part of a continuum.
[03:09:07.020 --> 03:09:13.140]   And so that's why when we talk about unique, you are putting yourself in a box which is
[03:09:13.140 --> 03:09:17.300]   distinct and saying, "This is the only example of things that fall into this box."
[03:09:17.300 --> 03:09:23.820]   But the walls of that box may themselves be a construct of our own arrogance that we are
[03:09:23.820 --> 03:09:27.100]   something distinct.
[03:09:27.100 --> 03:09:33.740]   - But I was also speaking broadly for us, meaning all life on Earth.
[03:09:33.740 --> 03:09:41.020]   But then it's possible that there's all kinds of living ecosystems on other planets and
[03:09:41.020 --> 03:09:47.460]   other moons that just don't have interest in technological development.
[03:09:47.460 --> 03:09:53.660]   Maybe technological development is the parasitic thing that destroys the organism broadly.
[03:09:53.660 --> 03:09:59.280]   And then maybe that's actually one of the fundamental realities.
[03:09:59.280 --> 03:10:04.000]   Whatever broad way to categorize technological development, that's just the parasitic thing
[03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:05.000]   that just destroys itself.
[03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:06.000]   It's a cancer.
[03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:09.600]   - We're floating around, sorry to interrupt, but we're floating around this idea of the
[03:10:09.600 --> 03:10:11.400]   great filter a little bit here.
[03:10:11.400 --> 03:10:15.120]   So we're asking, "Does it lie ahead of us?"
[03:10:15.120 --> 03:10:18.280]   Nuclear war may be imminent, that would be a filter that's ahead of us.
[03:10:18.280 --> 03:10:23.720]   Or could it be behind us, and it's the advent of technology that is genuinely a rare occurrence
[03:10:23.720 --> 03:10:28.120]   in the universe, and that explains the Fermi paradox.
[03:10:28.120 --> 03:10:33.960]   And so that's something that obviously people have debated and argued about in SETI for
[03:10:33.960 --> 03:10:40.520]   decades and decades, but it remains a persistent--people argue whether it should be really called a
[03:10:40.520 --> 03:10:46.080]   paradox or not--but it remains a consistent apparent contradiction that you can make a
[03:10:46.080 --> 03:10:50.000]   very cogent argument as to why you expect life and intelligence to be common in the
[03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:56.480]   universe, and yet everything, everything we know about the universe is fully compatible
[03:10:56.480 --> 03:10:58.920]   with just us being here.
[03:10:58.920 --> 03:11:07.400]   And that's a haunting thought, but I have no preference or desire for that to be true.
[03:11:07.400 --> 03:11:14.120]   I'm not trying to impose that view on anyone, but I do ask that we remain open-minded until
[03:11:14.120 --> 03:11:16.440]   evidence has been collected either way.
[03:11:16.440 --> 03:11:23.520]   - The thing is, it's one of, if not the, probably I would argue it's the most important question
[03:11:23.520 --> 03:11:29.920]   facing human civilization, or the most interesting, I think, scientifically speaking.
[03:11:29.920 --> 03:11:39.120]   What question is more important than--somehow, there could be other ways to sneak up to it,
[03:11:39.120 --> 03:11:45.920]   but it gets to the essence of what we are, what these living organisms are.
[03:11:45.920 --> 03:11:50.160]   It's somehow seeing another kind helps us understand--
[03:11:50.160 --> 03:11:54.560]   - It speaks to the human condition, helps us understand what it is to be human to some
[03:11:54.560 --> 03:11:57.200]   degree.
[03:11:57.200 --> 03:12:03.640]   I think, you know, I have tried to remain very agnostic about the idea of life and intelligence.
[03:12:03.640 --> 03:12:09.080]   One thing I try to be more optimistic about, and I've been thinking a lot with our searches
[03:12:09.080 --> 03:12:13.400]   for life in the universe, is life in the past.
[03:12:13.400 --> 03:12:17.240]   I think it's actually not that hard to imagine we are the only civilization in the galaxy
[03:12:17.240 --> 03:12:18.240]   right now.
[03:12:18.240 --> 03:12:19.240]   - Living.
[03:12:19.240 --> 03:12:21.080]   - Living to this current extent.
[03:12:21.080 --> 03:12:24.080]   But there may be very many extinct civilizations.
[03:12:24.080 --> 03:12:28.160]   If each civilization has a typical lifetime comparable to, let's say, AI is the demise
[03:12:28.160 --> 03:12:32.360]   of our own, that's only a few hundred years of technological development, or maybe 10,000
[03:12:32.360 --> 03:12:37.640]   years if you go back to the Neolithic Revolution, the dawn of agriculture.
[03:12:37.640 --> 03:12:40.760]   Hardly anything in cosmic time span.
[03:12:40.760 --> 03:12:42.800]   That's nothing, that's the blink of an eye.
[03:12:42.800 --> 03:12:47.840]   And so it's not surprising at all that we would happen not to coexist with anyone else.
[03:12:47.840 --> 03:12:51.400]   But that doesn't mean nobody else was ever here.
[03:12:51.400 --> 03:12:57.120]   And if other civilizations come to that same conclusion and realization, maybe they scour
[03:12:57.120 --> 03:13:02.080]   the galaxy around them, don't find any evidence for intelligence, then they have two options.
[03:13:02.080 --> 03:13:06.560]   They can either give up on communication and just say, "Well, it's never going to happen.
[03:13:06.560 --> 03:13:11.160]   We just may as well just worry about what's happening here on our own planet."
[03:13:11.160 --> 03:13:15.160]   Or they could attempt communication, but communication through time.
[03:13:15.160 --> 03:13:22.320]   And that's almost the most selfless act of communication, because there's no hope of
[03:13:22.320 --> 03:13:24.040]   getting anything back.
[03:13:24.040 --> 03:13:30.360]   It's a philanthropic gift almost to that other civilization that maybe might just be nothing
[03:13:30.360 --> 03:13:34.560]   more than a monument, which the pyramids essentially are, a monument of their existence.
[03:13:34.560 --> 03:13:41.160]   That these are the things they achieved, the things they believed in, their language, their
[03:13:41.160 --> 03:13:42.160]   culture.
[03:13:42.160 --> 03:13:45.000]   It could be maybe something more than that.
[03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:47.920]   It could be lessons from what they learned in their own history.
[03:13:47.920 --> 03:13:57.360]   And so I've been thinking a lot recently about how would we send a message to other civilizations
[03:13:57.360 --> 03:13:59.240]   in the future?
[03:13:59.240 --> 03:14:04.080]   Because that act of thinking seriously about the engineering of how you would design it
[03:14:04.080 --> 03:14:11.000]   would inform us about what we should be looking for, and also perhaps be our best chance,
[03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:13.560]   quite frankly, of ever making contact.
[03:14:13.560 --> 03:14:17.400]   It may not be the contact we dream of, but it's still contact.
[03:14:17.400 --> 03:14:23.320]   There would still be a record of our existence, as pitiful as it might be compared to a two-way
[03:14:23.320 --> 03:14:24.320]   communication.
[03:14:24.320 --> 03:14:30.640]   - And I love the humility behind that project, the Universal Project.
[03:14:30.640 --> 03:14:42.720]   It's humble, and it humbles you to the vast temporal landscape of the universe.
[03:14:42.720 --> 03:14:47.380]   Just realizing our day-to-day lives, all of us will be forgotten.
[03:14:47.380 --> 03:14:52.800]   It's nice to think about something that sends a signal out to other, yeah.
[03:14:52.800 --> 03:14:59.120]   - It was almost like a humility of acceptance as well, of knowing that you have a terminal
[03:14:59.120 --> 03:15:04.480]   disease, but your impact on the Earth doesn't have to end with your death.
[03:15:04.480 --> 03:15:09.720]   It could go on beyond with what you leave behind for others to discover, with maybe
[03:15:09.720 --> 03:15:12.600]   the books you write or what you leave in the literature.
[03:15:12.600 --> 03:15:18.160]   - Do you think launching the Roadster vehicle out in space would have done panic?
[03:15:18.160 --> 03:15:19.160]   - Yeah, the Roadster.
[03:15:19.160 --> 03:15:23.160]   I'm not sure what someone would make of that if they found it.
[03:15:23.160 --> 03:15:24.160]   - Yeah, that's true.
[03:15:24.160 --> 03:15:28.000]   - I mean, there have been quasi-attempts at it beyond the Roadster.
[03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:35.120]   I mean, there's the Pioneer plaques, there's the Voyager 2 Golden Record.
[03:15:35.120 --> 03:15:40.240]   It's pretty unlikely anybody's going to discover those, because they're just adrift in space
[03:15:40.240 --> 03:15:45.320]   and they will eventually mechanically die and not produce any signal for anyone to spot.
[03:15:45.320 --> 03:15:48.040]   So you'd have to be extremely lucky to come across them.
[03:15:48.040 --> 03:15:51.800]   I've often said to my colleagues that I think the best place is the Moon.
[03:15:51.800 --> 03:15:57.120]   The Moon, unlike the Earth, has no significant weathering.
[03:15:57.120 --> 03:16:02.200]   How long will the Apollo descent stages, which are still still on the lunar surface, last
[03:16:02.200 --> 03:16:03.200]   for?
[03:16:03.200 --> 03:16:09.400]   The only real effect is micrometeorites, which are slowly like dust smashing against them
[03:16:09.400 --> 03:16:10.400]   pretty much.
[03:16:10.400 --> 03:16:16.080]   But that's going to take millions, potentially billions of years to erode that down.
[03:16:16.080 --> 03:16:18.600]   And so we have an opportunity, and that's on the surface.
[03:16:18.600 --> 03:16:23.240]   If you put something just a few meters beneath the surface, it would have even greater protection.
[03:16:23.240 --> 03:16:28.760]   And so it raises the prospect of that if we wanted to send something, a significant amount
[03:16:28.760 --> 03:16:33.560]   of information, to a future galactic-spanning civilization that maybe cracks the interstellar
[03:16:33.560 --> 03:16:38.520]   propulsion problem, the Moon's going to be there for five billion years.
[03:16:38.520 --> 03:16:44.560]   That's a long time for somebody to come by and detect maybe a strange pattern that we
[03:16:44.560 --> 03:16:50.240]   draw on the sand for them to, you know, big arrow, big cross, like, look under here.
[03:16:50.240 --> 03:16:54.440]   And we could have a tomb of knowledge of some record of our civilization.
[03:16:54.440 --> 03:17:00.840]   And so I think when you think like that, what that implies to us, well, OK, the galaxy's
[03:17:00.840 --> 03:17:04.320]   13 billion years old, the Moon is already four billion years old.
[03:17:04.320 --> 03:17:10.920]   There may be places familiar to us, nearby to us, that we should be seriously considering
[03:17:10.920 --> 03:17:15.960]   as places we should look for life, and intelligent life, or evidence of relics that they might
[03:17:15.960 --> 03:17:17.340]   leave behind for us.
[03:17:17.340 --> 03:17:25.040]   - So thinking like that will help us find such relics, and it's like a beneficial cycle
[03:17:25.040 --> 03:17:26.040]   that happens.
[03:17:26.040 --> 03:17:27.040]   - Yes, yeah, exactly.
[03:17:27.040 --> 03:17:32.120]   - That enables the science of society better, like, of searching for bios and tech signatures
[03:17:32.120 --> 03:17:33.120]   and so on.
[03:17:33.120 --> 03:17:34.120]   - Yeah.
[03:17:34.120 --> 03:17:35.120]   - And it's inspiring.
[03:17:35.720 --> 03:17:44.520]   It's also inspiring in that we want to leave a legacy behind as an entire civilization,
[03:17:44.520 --> 03:17:47.560]   not just in the symbols, but broadly speaking.
[03:17:47.560 --> 03:17:48.800]   That's the last thing somehow.
[03:17:48.800 --> 03:17:56.320]   - Yeah, and I'm part of a team that's trying to repeat the Golden Record experiment.
[03:17:56.320 --> 03:18:00.000]   We're trying to create like an open source version of the Golden Record that future spacecraft
[03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:04.120]   are able to download, and basically put on a little hard drive that they can carry around
[03:18:04.120 --> 03:18:08.520]   with them, and get these distributed, hopefully, across the solar system eventually.
[03:18:08.520 --> 03:18:12.080]   - So it's gonna be called the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, or?
[03:18:12.080 --> 03:18:14.920]   - It could be, that's a good name for it.
[03:18:14.920 --> 03:18:17.040]   We've been toying a little bit with the name, but I think it'll probably just be Golden
[03:18:17.040 --> 03:18:19.560]   Record at this point, or Golden Record version two or something.
[03:18:19.560 --> 03:18:29.760]   But I think another benefit that I see of this activity is that it forces us as a species
[03:18:29.760 --> 03:18:34.720]   to ask those questions about what it is that we want another civilization to know about
[03:18:34.720 --> 03:18:35.720]   us.
[03:18:35.720 --> 03:18:40.160]   The Golden Record was kind of funny because it had photos on it, and it had photos of
[03:18:40.160 --> 03:18:45.720]   people eating, for instance, but it had no photos of people defecating.
[03:18:45.720 --> 03:18:51.080]   And so I always thought that was kind of funny, because if I was an alien, or if I was studying
[03:18:51.080 --> 03:18:56.040]   an alien, if I saw images of an alien, I would, I'm not trying to be like a perv or anything,
[03:18:56.040 --> 03:18:59.640]   but I would want to see the full, I want to understand the biology of that alien.
[03:18:59.640 --> 03:19:05.240]   And so we always censor what we show, and--
[03:19:05.240 --> 03:19:10.480]   - We should show the whole actual natural process, and then also say, we humans tend
[03:19:10.480 --> 03:19:12.160]   to censor these things.
[03:19:12.160 --> 03:19:18.040]   We tend to not like to walk around naked, we tend to not to talk about some of the natural
[03:19:18.040 --> 03:19:24.040]   biological phenomena, and talk a lot about others, and actually just be very, like the
[03:19:24.040 --> 03:19:27.280]   way you would be to a therapist or something, very transparent about the way we actually
[03:19:27.280 --> 03:19:28.280]   operate in this world.
[03:19:28.280 --> 03:19:30.840]   - I mean, and Sagan had that with the Golden Record.
[03:19:30.840 --> 03:19:37.120]   I think he originally, there's a male and a female figure to pitch on the Golden Record,
[03:19:37.120 --> 03:19:43.840]   and the woman had a genitalia originally drawn, and there was a lot of pushback from, I think,
[03:19:43.840 --> 03:19:48.900]   a lot of Christian groups who were not happy about the idea of throwing this into space.
[03:19:48.900 --> 03:19:51.760]   And so eventually they had to remove that.
[03:19:51.760 --> 03:19:57.640]   And so it would be confusing biologically, if you're trying to study xenobiology of this
[03:19:57.640 --> 03:20:03.000]   alien that apparently has no genitalia, or the man does, but for some reason the woman
[03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:04.000]   doesn't.
[03:20:04.000 --> 03:20:11.560]   And that's our own societal and cultural imprint happening into that information.
[03:20:11.560 --> 03:20:19.000]   - To be fair, just even having two sexes, and predators and prey, just the whole, that
[03:20:19.000 --> 03:20:22.800]   could be just a very unique Earth-like thing, so they might be confused about why there's
[03:20:22.800 --> 03:20:24.080]   like pairs of things.
[03:20:24.080 --> 03:20:29.440]   Like why is there a man and a woman in general?
[03:20:29.440 --> 03:20:33.640]   Like they could be confused about a lot of things in general.
[03:20:33.640 --> 03:20:38.280]   - They don't even know which way to hold the picture.
[03:20:38.280 --> 03:20:43.280]   - Or there's the picture, they might have very different sensory devices to even interpret
[03:20:43.280 --> 03:20:44.280]   this.
[03:20:44.280 --> 03:20:48.000]   - Correct, yeah, if they only have sound as their only way of navigating the world, it's
[03:20:48.000 --> 03:20:49.000]   kind of lost.
[03:20:49.000 --> 03:20:56.840]   There's been a lot of conversation about sending video and pictures, and that's one of the
[03:20:56.840 --> 03:21:02.280]   things I've been a little bit resistant about in the team, that I've been thinking, well,
[03:21:02.280 --> 03:21:03.280]   they might not have eyes.
[03:21:03.280 --> 03:21:09.840]   And so if you lived on the Europa surface, having eyes wouldn't be very useful.
[03:21:09.840 --> 03:21:14.520]   If you lived on a very dark planet on the tidally locked night side of an exoplanet,
[03:21:14.520 --> 03:21:16.440]   having eyes wouldn't be particularly useful.
[03:21:16.440 --> 03:21:22.200]   So it's kind of a presumption of us to think that video is a useful form of communication.
[03:21:22.200 --> 03:21:24.800]   - Do you hope we become a multi-planetary species?
[03:21:24.800 --> 03:21:30.880]   So we're almost sneaking up to that, but the efforts of SpaceX, of Elon, maybe in general
[03:21:30.880 --> 03:21:32.920]   what your thoughts are about those efforts?
[03:21:32.920 --> 03:21:37.080]   So you already mentioned Starship will be very interesting for astronomy, for science
[03:21:37.080 --> 03:21:40.960]   in general, just getting stuff out into space.
[03:21:40.960 --> 03:21:46.080]   But what about the longer term goal of actually colonizing, of building civilizations on other
[03:21:46.080 --> 03:21:49.120]   surfaces, on moons, on planets?
[03:21:49.120 --> 03:21:52.880]   - It seems like a fairly obvious thing to do for our survival, right?
[03:21:52.880 --> 03:22:01.680]   There's a high risk if we are committed to trying to keep this human experiment going,
[03:22:01.680 --> 03:22:06.640]   putting all of our eggs in one basket is always going to be a risky strategy to pursue.
[03:22:06.640 --> 03:22:08.040]   - It's a nice basket though.
[03:22:08.040 --> 03:22:09.600]   - It is a beautiful basket.
[03:22:09.600 --> 03:22:13.560]   I wouldn't want to, I personally have no interest in living on Mars or the Moon.
[03:22:13.560 --> 03:22:17.920]   I would like to visit, but I would definitely not want to spend the rest of my life and
[03:22:17.920 --> 03:22:18.920]   die on Mars.
[03:22:18.920 --> 03:22:21.640]   I mean, it's a hellhole.
[03:22:21.640 --> 03:22:26.160]   Mars is a very, very difficult- I think the idea that this is going to happen in the next
[03:22:26.160 --> 03:22:31.160]   10, 20 years seems to me very optimistic.
[03:22:31.160 --> 03:22:38.160]   Not that it's insurmountable, but the challenges are extreme to survive on a planet like Mars,
[03:22:38.160 --> 03:22:45.080]   which is like a dry, frozen desert with a high radiation environment.
[03:22:45.080 --> 03:22:48.480]   It's a challenge of a type we've never faced before.
[03:22:48.480 --> 03:22:53.640]   I'm sure human ingenuity can tackle it, but I'm skeptical that we'll have thousands of
[03:22:53.640 --> 03:22:56.320]   people living on Mars in my lifetime.
[03:22:56.320 --> 03:23:06.400]   But I would relish that opportunity to maybe one day visit such a settlement and do scientific
[03:23:06.400 --> 03:23:10.880]   experiments on Mars, or experience Mars, do astronomy from Mars, all sorts of cool stuff
[03:23:10.880 --> 03:23:13.200]   you could do.
[03:23:13.200 --> 03:23:17.840]   Sometimes you see these dreams of outer solar system exploration, and you can fly through
[03:23:17.840 --> 03:23:23.880]   the clouds of Venus, or you could just do these enormous jumps on these small moons
[03:23:23.880 --> 03:23:27.760]   where you can essentially jump as high as a skyscraper and traverse the Moon.
[03:23:27.760 --> 03:23:31.600]   So there's all sorts of wonderful ice skating on Europa might be fun.
[03:23:31.600 --> 03:23:34.840]   So don't get me wrong, I love the idea of us becoming interplanetary.
[03:23:34.840 --> 03:23:40.760]   I think it's just a question of time.
[03:23:40.760 --> 03:23:49.400]   Our own destructive tendencies, as you said earlier, are at odds with our emerging capability
[03:23:49.400 --> 03:23:51.280]   to become interplanetary.
[03:23:51.280 --> 03:23:55.480]   And the question is, will we get out of the nest before we burn it down?
[03:23:55.480 --> 03:23:56.480]   And I don't know.
[03:23:56.480 --> 03:24:02.880]   Obviously, I hope that we do, but I don't have any special insight.
[03:24:02.880 --> 03:24:10.160]   There is somewhat of an annoying intellectual itch I have with the so-called doomsday argument,
[03:24:10.160 --> 03:24:16.680]   which I try not to treat too seriously, but there is some element of it that bothers me.
[03:24:16.680 --> 03:24:22.800]   The doomsday argument basically suggests that you're typically the mediocrity principle
[03:24:22.800 --> 03:24:25.880]   - you're not special - that you're probably going to be born somewhere in the middle of
[03:24:25.880 --> 03:24:28.160]   all human beings who will ever be born.
[03:24:28.160 --> 03:24:32.160]   You're unlikely to be one of the first 1% of human beings that ever lived, and one of
[03:24:32.160 --> 03:24:35.640]   the last 1% - and similarly the last 1% of human beings that will ever live.
[03:24:35.640 --> 03:24:39.120]   Because you'd be very unique and special if that were true.
[03:24:39.120 --> 03:24:44.280]   And so by this logic, you can sort of calculate how many generations of humans you might expect.
[03:24:44.280 --> 03:24:48.000]   So if there's been, let's say, 100 billion human beings that have ever lived on this
[03:24:48.000 --> 03:24:55.560]   planet, then you could say to 95% confidence - so you divide by 5% - so 100 billion divided
[03:24:55.560 --> 03:25:00.520]   by 0.05 would give you 2 trillion human beings that would ever live, you'd expect by this
[03:25:00.520 --> 03:25:01.520]   argument.
[03:25:01.520 --> 03:25:10.000]   And so if each planet - in general the planet has a 10 billion population - so that would
[03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:15.220]   be 200 generations of humans we would expect ahead of us.
[03:25:15.220 --> 03:25:19.400]   And if each one has an average lifetime of say 100 years, then that would be about 20,000
[03:25:19.400 --> 03:25:20.400]   years.
[03:25:20.400 --> 03:25:21.880]   So there's 20,000 years left on the clock.
[03:25:21.880 --> 03:25:28.520]   That's like a typical doomsday argument type - that's how they typically lay it out.
[03:25:28.520 --> 03:25:33.880]   Now a lot of the criticisms of the doomsday argument come down to, well what are you really
[03:25:33.880 --> 03:25:34.880]   counting?
[03:25:34.880 --> 03:25:37.720]   You're counting humans there, but maybe you should be counting years.
[03:25:37.720 --> 03:25:41.080]   Or maybe you should be counting human hours.
[03:25:41.080 --> 03:25:43.800]   Because what you count makes a big difference to what you get out on the other end.
[03:25:43.800 --> 03:25:46.120]   So this is called the reference class.
[03:25:46.120 --> 03:25:48.880]   And so that's one of the big criticisms of the doomsday argument.
[03:25:48.880 --> 03:25:54.480]   But I do think it has a compelling point that it would be surprising if our future is to
[03:25:54.480 --> 03:25:59.760]   one day blossom and become a galactic spanning empire.
[03:25:59.760 --> 03:26:03.640]   Trillions upon trillions upon trillions of human beings will one day live across the
[03:26:03.640 --> 03:26:09.440]   stars for essentially as long as the galaxy exists and the stars burn.
[03:26:09.440 --> 03:26:13.240]   We would live at an incredibly special point in that story.
[03:26:13.240 --> 03:26:17.120]   We would be right at the very, very, very beginning.
[03:26:17.120 --> 03:26:21.100]   And that's not impossible, but it's just somewhat improbable.
[03:26:21.100 --> 03:26:26.840]   And so part of that sort of irks against me, but it also almost feels like a philosophical
[03:26:26.840 --> 03:26:33.900]   argument because you're sort of talking about souls being drawn from this cosmic pool.
[03:26:33.900 --> 03:26:38.940]   So it's not an argument that I lose sleep about for our fate of the doomsday, but it
[03:26:38.940 --> 03:26:47.620]   is somewhat intellectually annoying that there is a slight contradiction now it feels like
[03:26:47.620 --> 03:26:52.020]   with the idea of a galactic spanning empire.
[03:26:52.020 --> 03:26:55.700]   - But of course there's so many unknowns.
[03:26:55.700 --> 03:27:01.700]   I for one would love to visit even space, but Mars, just imagine standing on Mars and
[03:27:01.700 --> 03:27:04.100]   looking back at Earth.
[03:27:04.100 --> 03:27:05.540]   - Yeah.
[03:27:05.540 --> 03:27:06.540]   - I mean.
[03:27:06.540 --> 03:27:09.100]   - It'd be incredible sight.
[03:27:09.100 --> 03:27:14.180]   It would give you such a fresh perspective as to your entire existence and why you're
[03:27:14.180 --> 03:27:15.500]   meant to be human.
[03:27:15.500 --> 03:27:20.660]   And then come back to Earth, it would give you a heck of a perspective.
[03:27:20.660 --> 03:27:23.180]   Plus the sunset on Mars is supposed to be nice.
[03:27:23.180 --> 03:27:27.100]   - I loved what William Shatner said after his flight.
[03:27:27.100 --> 03:27:29.520]   His words really moved me when he came down.
[03:27:29.520 --> 03:27:36.420]   And I think it really captured the idea that we shouldn't really be sending engineers,
[03:27:36.420 --> 03:27:37.860]   our scientists into space.
[03:27:37.860 --> 03:27:43.620]   We should be sending our poets because those are the people when they come down who can
[03:27:43.620 --> 03:27:47.460]   truly make a difference when they describe their experiences in space.
[03:27:47.460 --> 03:27:50.700]   And I found it very moving reading what he said.
[03:27:50.700 --> 03:27:58.260]   - Yeah, when you talk to astronauts, when they describe what they see, it's like this,
[03:27:58.260 --> 03:28:02.100]   like they discovered a whole new thing that they can't possibly convert back into words.
[03:28:02.100 --> 03:28:03.100]   - Yeah.
[03:28:03.100 --> 03:28:04.940]   - Yeah, it's beautiful to see.
[03:28:04.940 --> 03:28:10.300]   Just as a quick, before I forget, I have to ask you, can you summarize your argument against
[03:28:10.300 --> 03:28:13.720]   the hypothesis that we live in a simulation?
[03:28:13.720 --> 03:28:17.700]   Is it similar to our discussion about the Doomsday Clock?
[03:28:17.700 --> 03:28:24.260]   - No, it's actually pretty more similar to my agnosticism about life in the universe.
[03:28:24.260 --> 03:28:28.740]   And it's just sort of remaining agnostic about all possibilities.
[03:28:28.740 --> 03:28:34.020]   The simulation argument, sometimes it gets mixed.
[03:28:34.020 --> 03:28:37.780]   There's kind of two distinct things that we need to consider.
[03:28:37.780 --> 03:28:42.740]   One is the probability that we live in so-called base reality, that we're not living in a simulated
[03:28:42.740 --> 03:28:43.740]   reality itself.
[03:28:43.740 --> 03:28:48.420]   And another probability we need to consider is the probability that that technology is
[03:28:48.420 --> 03:28:53.020]   viable, possible, and something we will ultimately choose to one day do.
[03:28:53.020 --> 03:28:54.380]   Those are two distinct things.
[03:28:54.380 --> 03:28:59.100]   They're probably quite similar numbers to each other, but they are distinct probabilities.
[03:28:59.100 --> 03:29:04.460]   So in my paper I wrote about this, I just tried to work through the problem.
[03:29:04.460 --> 03:29:06.900]   I teach astrostatistics, actually teach me this morning.
[03:29:06.900 --> 03:29:11.620]   And so it just seemed like a fun case study of working through a Bayesian calculation
[03:29:11.620 --> 03:29:12.620]   for it.
[03:29:12.620 --> 03:29:15.420]   Bayesian calculations work on conditionals.
[03:29:15.420 --> 03:29:19.700]   And so when you hear, what kind of inspired this project was when I heard Musk said, "There's
[03:29:19.700 --> 03:29:25.300]   like a billion to one chance that we don't live in a simulation."
[03:29:25.300 --> 03:29:30.920]   He's right if you add the Bayesian conditional, and the Bayesian conditional is conditioned
[03:29:30.920 --> 03:29:34.780]   upon the fact that we eventually develop that technology and choose to use it.
[03:29:34.780 --> 03:29:39.660]   Or it's chosen to be used by such species, by such civilizations.
[03:29:39.660 --> 03:29:40.940]   That's the conditional.
[03:29:40.940 --> 03:29:44.780]   And you have to add that in because that conditional isn't guaranteed.
[03:29:44.780 --> 03:29:49.140]   And so in a Bayesian framework you can kind of make that explicit.
[03:29:49.140 --> 03:29:53.380]   You see mathematically, explicitly that's a conditional in your equation.
[03:29:53.380 --> 03:29:58.060]   And the opposite side of the coin is basically in the trilemma that Bostrom originally put
[03:29:58.060 --> 03:30:00.340]   forward is options one and two.
[03:30:00.340 --> 03:30:04.140]   Option one is that you basically never develop the ability to do that.
[03:30:04.140 --> 03:30:07.260]   Option two is you never choose to execute that.
[03:30:07.260 --> 03:30:14.060]   So we kind of group those together as sort of the non-simulation scenario, let's call
[03:30:14.060 --> 03:30:15.060]   it.
[03:30:15.060 --> 03:30:17.860]   So you've got non-simulation scenario and simulation scenario.
[03:30:17.860 --> 03:30:23.660]   And agnostically we really have to give the, you know, how do you assess the model, the
[03:30:23.660 --> 03:30:27.940]   a priori model probability of those two scenarios?
[03:30:27.940 --> 03:30:32.100]   It's very difficult and we can, I think people would probably argue about how you assign
[03:30:32.100 --> 03:30:33.260]   those priors.
[03:30:33.260 --> 03:30:34.740]   In the paper we just assigned 50/50.
[03:30:34.740 --> 03:30:37.900]   We just said this hasn't been demonstrated yet.
[03:30:37.900 --> 03:30:43.260]   There's no evidence that this is actually technically possible, but nor is it that it's
[03:30:43.260 --> 03:30:44.500]   not technically possible.
[03:30:44.500 --> 03:30:47.940]   So we're just going to assign 50/50 probability to these two hypotheses.
[03:30:47.940 --> 03:30:51.540]   And then in the hypothesis where you have a simulated reality, you have a base reality
[03:30:51.540 --> 03:30:52.820]   sat at the top.
[03:30:52.820 --> 03:30:56.380]   So there is, even in the simulated hypothesis, there's a probability you still live in base
[03:30:56.380 --> 03:31:02.220]   reality and then there's a whole myriad of universes beneath that which are all simulated.
[03:31:02.220 --> 03:31:07.260]   And so you have a very slim probability of being in base reality if this is true.
[03:31:07.260 --> 03:31:11.380]   And you have a hundred percent probability of living in base reality on the other hand
[03:31:11.380 --> 03:31:16.720]   if it's not true and we never develop that ability or choose never to use it.
[03:31:16.720 --> 03:31:20.200]   And so then you apply this technique called Bayesian model averaging, which is where you
[03:31:20.200 --> 03:31:23.980]   propagate the uncertainty of your two models to get a final estimate.
[03:31:23.980 --> 03:31:29.340]   And because of that one base reality that lives in the simulated scenario, you end up
[03:31:29.340 --> 03:31:32.980]   counting this up and getting that it always has to be less than 50%.
[03:31:32.980 --> 03:31:36.980]   So the probability you live in a simulated reality versus a base reality has to be slightly
[03:31:36.980 --> 03:31:39.340]   less than 50%.
[03:31:39.340 --> 03:31:44.980]   Now that really comes down to that statement of giving it 50/50 odds to begin with.
[03:31:44.980 --> 03:31:49.260]   And on the one hand you might say, "Look David, I work in artificial intelligence, I'm very
[03:31:49.260 --> 03:31:53.900]   confident that this is going to happen, just of extrapolating of current trends."
[03:31:53.900 --> 03:31:59.900]   On the other hand, a statistician would say, "You're giving way too much weight to the
[03:31:59.900 --> 03:32:03.960]   simulation hypothesis because it's an intrinsically highly complicated model.
[03:32:03.960 --> 03:32:08.580]   You have a whole hierarchy of realities within realities within realities.
[03:32:08.580 --> 03:32:11.080]   It's like the Inception-style thing, right?"
[03:32:11.080 --> 03:32:16.520]   And so this requires hundreds, thousands, millions of parameterizations to describe.
[03:32:16.520 --> 03:32:20.560]   And by Occam's razor, we would always normally penalize inherently complicated models as
[03:32:20.560 --> 03:32:22.160]   being disfavoured.
[03:32:22.160 --> 03:32:27.440]   So I think you could argue I'm being too generous or too kind with that, but I sort of want
[03:32:27.440 --> 03:32:31.680]   to develop the rigorous mathematical tools to explore it.
[03:32:31.680 --> 03:32:35.800]   And ultimately it's up to you to decide what you think that 50/50 odds should be.
[03:32:35.800 --> 03:32:40.020]   But you can use my formula to plug in whatever you want and get the answer.
[03:32:40.020 --> 03:32:41.020]   And I use 50/50.
[03:32:41.020 --> 03:32:48.040]   - So, and, but when in that first pile, with the first two parts of the, the, the, the
[03:32:48.040 --> 03:32:53.240]   Boston talks about, it seems like connected to that is the question we've been talking
[03:32:53.240 --> 03:32:57.960]   about, which is the number of times at bat you get, which is the number of intelligent
[03:32:57.960 --> 03:33:02.800]   civilizations that are out there that can build such simulations.
[03:33:02.800 --> 03:33:05.680]   That's it seems like very closely connected.
[03:33:05.680 --> 03:33:10.480]   Because if we're the only ones that are here and it could build such things that changes
[03:33:10.480 --> 03:33:11.480]   things.
[03:33:11.480 --> 03:33:12.480]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:33:12.480 --> 03:33:17.960]   I mean, yeah, the simulation hypothesis has all sorts of implications like that.
[03:33:17.960 --> 03:33:21.760]   I've always loved, Sean Carroll points out a really interesting contradiction apparently
[03:33:21.760 --> 03:33:26.000]   with the simulation hypothesis that I speak about a little bit in the paper.
[03:33:26.000 --> 03:33:32.120]   But he showed that, or pointed out that in this hierarchy of realities, which then develop
[03:33:32.120 --> 03:33:37.200]   their own AIs within the realities, and then they, or really ancestor simulations, I should
[03:33:37.200 --> 03:33:40.680]   say rather than AI, they develop their own capability to simulate realities.
[03:33:40.680 --> 03:33:41.680]   You get this hierarchy.
[03:33:41.680 --> 03:33:46.760]   And so eventually there'll be a bottom layer, which I often call the sewer of reality.
[03:33:46.760 --> 03:33:51.400]   It's like the worst layer where it's the most pixelated it could possibly be, right?
[03:33:51.400 --> 03:33:54.640]   Because each layer is necessarily going to have less computational power than the layer
[03:33:54.640 --> 03:33:55.640]   above it.
[03:33:55.640 --> 03:33:59.000]   Because not only are you simulating that entire planet, but also some of that's being used
[03:33:59.000 --> 03:34:02.140]   for the computers themselves, that those are simulated.
[03:34:02.140 --> 03:34:08.480]   And so that base reality, or sorry, the sewer of reality is a reality where they are simply
[03:34:08.480 --> 03:34:15.000]   unable to produce ancestor simulations because the fidelity of the simulation is not sufficient.
[03:34:15.000 --> 03:34:17.680]   And so from their point of view, it might not be obvious that the universe is pixelated,
[03:34:17.680 --> 03:34:20.380]   but they would just never be able to manifest that capability.
[03:34:20.380 --> 03:34:28.440]   - What if they're constantly simulating, 'cause in order to appreciate the limits of the fidelity,
[03:34:28.440 --> 03:34:29.960]   you have to have an observer.
[03:34:29.960 --> 03:34:34.100]   What if they're always simulating a dumber and dumber observer?
[03:34:34.100 --> 03:34:39.700]   What if the sewer has very dumb observers that can't, like scientists that are the dumbest
[03:34:39.700 --> 03:34:41.200]   possible scientists.
[03:34:41.200 --> 03:34:47.760]   So like it's very pixelated, but the scientists are too dumb to even see the pixelations.
[03:34:47.760 --> 03:34:53.280]   That's like built into the universe always has to be a limitation on the cognitive capabilities
[03:34:53.280 --> 03:34:55.440]   of the complex systems that are within it.
[03:34:55.440 --> 03:35:02.000]   - Yeah, so that sewer of reality, they would still presumably be able to have a very impressive
[03:35:02.000 --> 03:35:03.000]   computational capabilities.
[03:35:03.000 --> 03:35:07.040]   They'd probably be able to simulate galactic formation or this kind of impressive stuff,
[03:35:07.040 --> 03:35:12.080]   but they would be just short of the ability to, however you define it, create a truly
[03:35:12.080 --> 03:35:15.080]   sentient conscious experience in a computer.
[03:35:15.080 --> 03:35:18.580]   That would just be just beyond their capabilities.
[03:35:18.580 --> 03:35:22.860]   And so Carol pointed out that if you add up all the, you know, you count up how many realities
[03:35:22.860 --> 03:35:29.560]   there should be, probabilistically, if this is true, over here, the simulation hypothesis
[03:35:29.560 --> 03:35:34.000]   or scenario, then you're most likely to find yourself in the sewer, because there's just
[03:35:34.000 --> 03:35:38.960]   far more of them than there are of any of the higher levels.
[03:35:38.960 --> 03:35:44.640]   And so that sort of sets up a contradiction, because then you live in a reality which is
[03:35:44.640 --> 03:35:50.000]   inherently incapable of ever producing ancestor simulations.
[03:35:50.000 --> 03:35:55.440]   But the premise of the entire argument is that ancestor simulations are possible.
[03:35:55.440 --> 03:35:58.200]   So there's a contradiction that's been introduced.
[03:35:58.200 --> 03:36:01.960]   - There's that old quote, "We're all living in the sewer, but some of us are looking up
[03:36:01.960 --> 03:36:02.960]   at the stars."
[03:36:02.960 --> 03:36:04.640]   (laughing)
[03:36:04.640 --> 03:36:08.040]   This is maybe more true than we think.
[03:36:08.040 --> 03:36:11.800]   - To me, so there's of course physics and computational fascinating questions here,
[03:36:11.800 --> 03:36:18.480]   but to me, there's a practical psychological question, which is, you know, how do you create
[03:36:18.480 --> 03:36:28.000]   a virtual reality world that is as compelling, and not necessarily even as realistic, but
[03:36:28.000 --> 03:36:33.960]   almost as realistic, but as compelling or more compelling than physical reality?
[03:36:33.960 --> 03:36:44.120]   Because something tells me it's not very difficult, in the full history of human civilization.
[03:36:44.120 --> 03:36:49.920]   That is an interesting kind of simulation to me, because that feels like it's doable
[03:36:49.920 --> 03:36:55.480]   in the next hundred years, creating a world where we all prefer to live in the digital
[03:36:55.480 --> 03:37:03.440]   world, and not like a visit, but like it's like, your scene is insane.
[03:37:03.440 --> 03:37:10.600]   No, like you're required, it's unsafe to live outside of the virtual world.
[03:37:10.600 --> 03:37:15.160]   And it's interesting to me from an engineering perspective, how to build that, because I'm
[03:37:15.160 --> 03:37:20.520]   somebody that sort of loves video games, and it seems like you can create incredible worlds
[03:37:20.520 --> 03:37:22.480]   there and stay there.
[03:37:22.480 --> 03:37:31.320]   And it's a different question than creating an ultra high resolution, high fidelity simulation
[03:37:31.320 --> 03:37:32.800]   of physics.
[03:37:32.800 --> 03:37:39.960]   But if that world inside a video game is as consistent as the physics of our reality,
[03:37:39.960 --> 03:37:44.240]   you can have your own scientists in that world, trying to understand that physics world.
[03:37:44.240 --> 03:37:45.240]   It might look different.
[03:37:45.240 --> 03:37:49.760]   - I'm presuming that eventually, forget, you know, give it long enough, they might forget
[03:37:49.760 --> 03:37:54.880]   about their origins of being once biological, and assume this was their only reality.
[03:37:54.880 --> 03:38:00.680]   - Especially if you're now born, you know, well certainly if you're born, but even if
[03:38:00.680 --> 03:38:04.920]   you were eight years old or something when you first started wearing the headset.
[03:38:04.920 --> 03:38:07.520]   - Yeah, or you have a memory wipe when you go in.
[03:38:07.520 --> 03:38:12.320]   I mean, it also kind of maybe speaks to this issue of like Neuralink, and how do we keep
[03:38:12.320 --> 03:38:15.240]   up with AI in our world?
[03:38:15.240 --> 03:38:20.480]   If you want to augment your intelligence, perhaps one way of competing, and one of your
[03:38:20.480 --> 03:38:26.240]   impetuses for going into this digital reality would be to be competitive intellectually
[03:38:26.240 --> 03:38:31.560]   with artificial intelligences, that you could trivially augment your reality if your brain
[03:38:31.560 --> 03:38:33.000]   was itself artificial.
[03:38:33.000 --> 03:38:38.600]   But I mean, one skepticism I've always had about that is whether, it's more of a philosophical
[03:38:38.600 --> 03:38:42.100]   question, but how much is that really you if you do a mind upload?
[03:38:42.100 --> 03:38:49.280]   Is this just a duplicate of your memories that thinks it's you versus truly a transference
[03:38:49.280 --> 03:38:52.600]   of your conscious stream into that reality?
[03:38:52.600 --> 03:39:00.760]   And I think when you, it's almost like the teleportation device in Star Trek, but with
[03:39:00.760 --> 03:39:07.140]   teleportation, quantum teleportation, you can kind of rigorously show that as long as
[03:39:07.140 --> 03:39:13.160]   all of the quantum numbers are exactly duplicated as you transfer over, it truly is, from the
[03:39:13.160 --> 03:39:18.460]   universe's perspective, in every way indistinguishable from what was there before.
[03:39:18.460 --> 03:39:25.100]   It really is, in principle, you, and all the sense of being you, versus creating a duplicate
[03:39:25.100 --> 03:39:34.500]   clone and uploading memories to that human body or a computer that would surely be a
[03:39:34.500 --> 03:39:39.040]   discontinuation of that conscious experience by virtue of the fact you've multiplied it.
[03:39:39.040 --> 03:39:43.580]   And so I would be hesitant about uploading for that reason.
[03:39:43.580 --> 03:39:53.300]   I would see it mostly as my own killing myself and having some AI duplicate of me that persists
[03:39:53.300 --> 03:39:56.780]   in this world, but is not truly my experience.
[03:39:56.780 --> 03:40:04.940]   Typical 20th century human, with an attachment to this particular singular instantiation
[03:40:04.940 --> 03:40:08.060]   of brain and body.
[03:40:08.060 --> 03:40:09.380]   How silly humans used to be.
[03:40:09.380 --> 03:40:19.380]   Used to have rotary phones and other silly things.
[03:40:19.380 --> 03:40:20.900]   You're an incredible human being.
[03:40:20.900 --> 03:40:22.060]   You're an educator.
[03:40:22.060 --> 03:40:24.780]   You're a researcher.
[03:40:24.780 --> 03:40:31.380]   You have an amazing YouTube channel.
[03:40:31.380 --> 03:40:37.900]   Looking to young people, if you were to give them advice, how can they have a career that
[03:40:37.900 --> 03:40:44.220]   maybe is inspired by yours, inspired by wandering curiosity, a career they can be proud of,
[03:40:44.220 --> 03:40:46.660]   or a life they can be proud of?
[03:40:46.660 --> 03:40:49.460]   What advice would you give?
[03:40:49.460 --> 03:40:55.220]   I certainly think in terms of a career in science, one thing that I maybe discovered
[03:40:55.220 --> 03:41:02.780]   late but has been incredibly influential on me in terms of my own happiness and my own
[03:41:02.780 --> 03:41:08.980]   productivity has been this synergy of doing two passions at once.
[03:41:08.980 --> 03:41:14.420]   One passion is science communication, another passion research, and not surrendering either
[03:41:14.420 --> 03:41:15.420]   one.
[03:41:15.420 --> 03:41:19.860]   And I think that tends to be seen as something that's an either/or.
[03:41:19.860 --> 03:41:24.620]   You have to completely dedicate yourself to one thing to gain mastery in it.
[03:41:24.620 --> 03:41:29.940]   That's a conventional way of thinking about both science and other disciplines.
[03:41:29.940 --> 03:41:35.260]   And I have found that both have been elevated by practicing in each.
[03:41:35.260 --> 03:41:38.420]   And I think that's true in all assets of life.
[03:41:38.420 --> 03:41:45.620]   If you want to become the best researcher you possibly can, you're pushing your intellect
[03:41:45.620 --> 03:41:49.380]   and in a sense your body to a high level.
[03:41:49.380 --> 03:41:54.860]   And so to me, I've always wanted to couple that with training of my body, training of
[03:41:54.860 --> 03:41:59.220]   my mind in other ways besides from just what I'm doing when I'm in the lecture room or
[03:41:59.220 --> 03:42:04.540]   when I'm in my office calculating something.
[03:42:04.540 --> 03:42:11.220]   Working on your own development through whatever it is, meditation, for me it's often running,
[03:42:11.220 --> 03:42:19.020]   working out and pursuing multiple passions, provides this almost synergistic bliss of
[03:42:19.020 --> 03:42:20.500]   all of them together.
[03:42:20.500 --> 03:42:25.860]   So often I've had some of the best research ideas from making a YouTube video and trying
[03:42:25.860 --> 03:42:30.620]   to communicate an idea or interacting with my audience who've had a question that sparked
[03:42:30.620 --> 03:42:35.500]   a whole trail of thought that led down this wonderful intellectual rabbit hole or maybe
[03:42:35.500 --> 03:42:36.980]   to a new intellectual discovery.
[03:42:36.980 --> 03:42:40.700]   It can go either way sometimes with those things.
[03:42:40.700 --> 03:42:49.460]   And so thinking broadly, diversely, and always looking after yourself in this highly competitive
[03:42:49.460 --> 03:42:57.820]   and often extremely stressful world that we live in is the best advice I can offer anybody.
[03:42:57.820 --> 03:43:02.780]   And just try, if you can, it's very cheesy, but if you can follow your passions, you'll
[03:43:02.780 --> 03:43:04.380]   always be happy.
[03:43:04.380 --> 03:43:11.100]   Trying to sell out for the quick cash out, for the quick book out, can be tempting in
[03:43:11.100 --> 03:43:12.100]   the short term.
[03:43:12.100 --> 03:43:18.740]   Looking for exo-moons was never easy, but I made a career not out of discovering exo-moons,
[03:43:18.740 --> 03:43:22.940]   but out of learning how to communicate the difficult problem and discovering all sorts
[03:43:22.940 --> 03:43:23.940]   of things along the way.
[03:43:23.940 --> 03:43:27.460]   You know, we shot for the sky and we discovered all this stuff along the way.
[03:43:27.460 --> 03:43:31.620]   We discovered dozens of new planets using all sorts of new techniques.
[03:43:31.620 --> 03:43:34.620]   We pushed this instrumentation to new places.
[03:43:34.620 --> 03:43:39.260]   And I've had an extremely productive research career in this world.
[03:43:39.260 --> 03:43:43.940]   I've had all sorts of ideas, working on techno-signatures.
[03:43:43.940 --> 03:43:49.740]   Thinking innovatively pushes you into all sorts of exciting directions.
[03:43:49.740 --> 03:43:56.140]   So just try to, yeah, it's hard to find that passion, but you can sometimes remember when
[03:43:56.140 --> 03:43:59.980]   you were a kid what your passions were and what fascinated you as a child.
[03:43:59.980 --> 03:44:04.300]   For me, as soon as I picked up a space book when I was five years old, that was it.
[03:44:04.300 --> 03:44:05.580]   I was hooked on space.
[03:44:05.580 --> 03:44:08.580]   And I almost betrayed my passion at college.
[03:44:08.580 --> 03:44:13.020]   I studied physics, which I've always been fascinated by physics as well.
[03:44:13.020 --> 03:44:18.420]   But I came back to astronomy because it was my first love, and I was much happier doing
[03:44:18.420 --> 03:44:24.580]   research in astronomy than I was in physics because it spoke to that wonder I had as a
[03:44:24.580 --> 03:44:29.460]   child that first was the spark of curiosity for me in science.
[03:44:29.460 --> 03:44:35.140]   - So society will try to get you to look at hot Jupiters, and the advice is to look for
[03:44:35.140 --> 03:44:36.140]   the cool worlds instead.
[03:44:36.140 --> 03:44:38.660]   What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?
[03:44:38.660 --> 03:44:41.780]   Have you ever asked yourself why?
[03:44:41.780 --> 03:44:44.100]   - It's just a ride.
[03:44:44.100 --> 03:44:45.100]   It's just a ride.
[03:44:45.100 --> 03:44:46.980]   We're on a roller coaster.
[03:44:46.980 --> 03:44:49.740]   And we have no purpose.
[03:44:49.740 --> 03:44:52.580]   It's an accident in my perspective.
[03:44:52.580 --> 03:44:54.220]   There's no meaning to my life.
[03:44:54.220 --> 03:45:01.940]   There's no objective deity who is overwatching what I'm doing, and I have some fate or destiny.
[03:45:01.940 --> 03:45:09.860]   It's all just riding on a roller coaster and trying to have a good time and contribute
[03:45:09.860 --> 03:45:12.660]   to other people's enjoyment of the ride.
[03:45:12.660 --> 03:45:15.540]   - Yeah, try to make it a happy accident.
[03:45:15.540 --> 03:45:16.540]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:45:16.540 --> 03:45:24.700]   I see no fundamental providence in my life or in the nature of the universe.
[03:45:24.700 --> 03:45:31.820]   And you just see this universe as this beautiful cosmic accident of galaxies smashing together,
[03:45:31.820 --> 03:45:37.060]   stars forging here and there, and planets occasionally spawning maybe life across the
[03:45:37.060 --> 03:45:38.740]   universe.
[03:45:38.740 --> 03:45:44.900]   And we are just one of those instantiations, and we should just enjoy this very brief episode
[03:45:44.900 --> 03:45:47.100]   that we have.
[03:45:47.100 --> 03:45:55.700]   I think trying to look at it much deeper than that is, to me, it's not very soul satisfying.
[03:45:55.700 --> 03:45:59.020]   I just think enjoy what you've got and appreciate it.
[03:45:59.020 --> 03:46:05.340]   - It does seem noticing that beauty helps make the ride pretty fun.
[03:46:05.340 --> 03:46:06.980]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[03:46:06.980 --> 03:46:08.660]   - David, you're an incredible person.
[03:46:08.660 --> 03:46:11.380]   I haven't covered most of the things I wanted to talk to you about.
[03:46:11.380 --> 03:46:13.620]   This was an incredible conversation.
[03:46:13.620 --> 03:46:14.620]   I'm glad you exist.
[03:46:14.620 --> 03:46:17.460]   I'm glad you're doing everything you're doing.
[03:46:17.460 --> 03:46:18.460]   I'm a huge fan.
[03:46:18.460 --> 03:46:19.460]   Thank you so much for talking today.
[03:46:19.460 --> 03:46:20.460]   This was amazing.
[03:46:20.460 --> 03:46:21.460]   - Thank you so much, Lex.
[03:46:21.460 --> 03:46:22.460]   It's a real honor.
[03:46:22.460 --> 03:46:23.460]   Thank you.
[03:46:23.460 --> 03:46:25.380]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with David Kipping.
[03:46:25.380 --> 03:46:29.380]   To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[03:46:29.380 --> 03:46:33.460]   And now, let me leave you with some words from Carl Sagan.
[03:46:33.460 --> 03:46:40.220]   Perhaps the aliens are here, but are hiding because of some Lex Galactica, some ethic
[03:46:40.220 --> 03:46:42.940]   of non-interference with emerging civilizations.
[03:46:42.940 --> 03:46:50.140]   We can imagine them, curious and dispassionate, observing us as we would watch a bacterial
[03:46:50.140 --> 03:46:57.900]   culture in a dish to determine whether this year, again, we manage to avoid self-destruction.
[03:46:57.900 --> 03:47:00.340]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[03:47:00.340 --> 03:47:01.340]   Bye.
[03:47:01.340 --> 03:47:01.340]   - Bye.
[03:47:01.420 --> 03:47:01.920]   - Bye.
[03:47:01.920 --> 03:47:02.420]   - Bye.
[03:47:02.420 --> 03:47:02.920]   - Bye.
[03:47:02.920 --> 03:47:03.420]   - Bye.
[03:47:03.420 --> 03:47:03.920]   - Bye.
[03:47:03.920 --> 03:47:04.420]   - Bye.
[03:47:04.420 --> 03:47:14.420]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
