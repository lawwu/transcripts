[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   "Will there be a war between US and China
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.240]   "in the 21st century?"
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.200]   - If there is, we're finished.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.800]   A war between the US and China
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.600]   would destroy the possibilities of organized life on Earth.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.440]   - The following is a conversation with Noam Chomsky,
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.600]   his second time on the podcast.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.560]   This episode is focused on the war in Ukraine,
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.120]   and it is a departure from the way I usually do this podcast
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.720]   in several ways.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.800]   Noam is a strong and healthy 93-year-old,
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.240]   but this conversation is remote, so be cautious.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.040]   It is brief, only one hour.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.480]   It is more of an interview than a conversation
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.480]   due to the limitations of our audio and video connection.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.240]   I decided it's best to get Noam's clear thoughts
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.920]   on this war and the complicated geopolitics of today
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.280]   and the rest of the 21st century
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.440]   that is unrolling before us,
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.520]   with our decisions and actions fully capable
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.720]   of either helping humanity flourish
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.960]   or unleashing global destruction and suffering.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.560]   As a brief aside, perhaps you know this,
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.720]   but let me mention that I traveled to Ukraine
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.600]   and saw, heard, felt things that are haunting
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.080]   and gave me a lot to think about.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.880]   Because of that, I've been really struggling
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.120]   to edit the videos I recorded.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.000]   I hope to finish it soon.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.760]   I'm sorry for these delays,
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.720]   and I'm especially sorry to the people there
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.160]   who gave me their time, their story, their heart.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.920]   Please be patient with me.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.080]   I hope you understand.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.960]   This is the Lex Riedman Podcast.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.040]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.480]   in the description.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.080]   And now, dear friends, here's Noam Chomsky.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.840]   You have studied and criticized
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.040]   powerful leaders and nations
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.960]   in times of global conflict and struggles for power.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.640]   So let me ask you,
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.640]   what do you think motivates Vladimir Putin?
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.280]   Is it power, legacy, fame, geopolitical influence,
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.840]   or the flourishing of a nation he loves and represents?
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.840]   I have no particular insight into Putin's mind.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.360]   I can only watch the actions over the last 20, 25 years
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.280]   and read the statements.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.600]   Took power about almost 25 years ago,
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.440]   has held it since as prime minister or president.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.040]   His first task was to try to overcome the chaos and disarray
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.040]   of the 1990s.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.960]   During the '90s, Gorbachev had a proposal.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:04.520]   He called for a cooperative enterprise with the West.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.920]   They would share an effort to rebuild
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.600]   what he called a common European home
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.000]   in which there would be no military alliances,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   just Russia, Western US accommodation
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.800]   with a move towards social democracy
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.920]   and former USSR
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.400]   and comparable moves in the United States.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.160]   Well, that was quickly smashed.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.920]   The United States had no interest in that.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.200]   Clinton came along pretty soon, early '90s.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.680]   Russia was induced to adopt what was called shock therapy,
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:01.080]   a harsh, quick market transformation
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.200]   which devastated the economy,
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.160]   created enormous social disarray,
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.800]   rise of what are called oligarchs, kleptocrats,
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.880]   high mortality.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.880]   And Clinton started the policy of expanding NATO to the East
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.760]   in violation of firm, unambiguous promises
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.160]   to Gorbachev not to do so.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.640]   Yeltsin, Putin's friend, opposed it.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.920]   Other Russian leaders opposed it, but they didn't react.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.240]   They accepted it.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.000]   When Putin came in, he continued that policy.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.960]   Meanwhile, did reconstruct the Russian economy.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.240]   Russian society became a viable,
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.080]   deeply authoritarian society.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.520]   Under his tight control,
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.520]   he himself organized a major kleptocracy
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.440]   with him in the middle, barely became very wealthy.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.960]   On the international front,
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.160]   he pretty much continued the former policies.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.160]   As US diplomats, practically every diplomat
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.400]   who had any contact with Russia
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.320]   had been dispatched there, knew about it,
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.840]   as they all warned from the '90s
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.840]   that what Clinton was doing, expanded by Bush,
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.480]   Bush too afterwards, was reckless and provocative,
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.560]   that Russia did have a clear red line before Putin,
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.440]   which he adhered to, namely no NATO membership
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.640]   for Ukraine and Georgia.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:58.200]   This is pretty much how things went on
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.200]   through the 2000s, 2014, 2008.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:09.600]   George Bush, President Bush did invite Ukraine
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.440]   to join NATO, that was vetoed by France and Germany,
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.880]   but under US pressure, it was kept on the agenda.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.040]   The Russians continued to object to Western diplomats,
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.880]   including the present current head of the CIA,
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.160]   his predecessors warned that this was reckless,
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.560]   provocative, shouldn't be done, continued.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.320]   Putin didn't do much, he stayed with it
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.400]   until pretty recently.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.400]   After 2014, the uprising that threw out
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:53.560]   the former president who was pro-Russian,
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.360]   instituted anti-Russian laws,
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.360]   the United States and NATO began to,
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.360]   a policy of moving to effectively integrate Ukraine
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:13.080]   into the NATO command, joint military exercises,
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.320]   training, sending weapons and so on.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.680]   Putin objected, other Russian leaders objected,
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.840]   they're unified on this, but didn't do much.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.840]   Continued with the proposals that NATO,
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.200]   that Ukraine be excluded from NATO,
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.640]   and that there be some form of autonomy
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.360]   for the Donbass region.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.360]   Meanwhile, in reaction to the uprising,
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:53.080]   the Maidan uprising, 2014, Russia moved in
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:58.080]   and took over Crimea, protecting its warm water base
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.440]   and major naval base.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.080]   US objected and recognized it,
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:10.080]   but things continued without notable conflict.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.960]   Won't go through all the details.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.960]   When Joe Biden came in, he expanded the program
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.520]   of what US military journals call a de facto war,
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.680]   de facto integration of Ukraine within NATO.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:32.520]   Developed, proposed September 2021,
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.760]   proposed enhanced program of preparation
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:41.760]   for NATO admission, extended with a formal statement
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:48.680]   in November, we're now practically up to the invasion.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.440]   Putin's position hardened.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.920]   France, mainly France, to an extent Germany,
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.920]   did make some moves towards possible negotiations.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:07.000]   Putin dismissed them, moved on to the direct invasion.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.560]   That's, what are his, to get back to your question,
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.840]   what motivates him?
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.120]   I presume what he's been saying all along,
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:26.360]   namely establishing his legacy as a leader
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:31.360]   who overcame the extensive destruction of Russia
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.880]   and massive weakening over it,
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.000]   restored his position as a world power,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.880]   prevented Ukraine from entering NATO.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.560]   May have further ambitions as to dominating
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.800]   and controlling Ukraine, very likely.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.600]   There is a theory in the West
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.280]   that he suddenly became a total madman
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.600]   who wants to restore the great Russian empire.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:07.760]   This is combined with gloating over the fact
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.480]   that the Russian military is a paper tiger
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.760]   that can't even conquer cities
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.600]   a couple of kilometers from the border,
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.000]   but defended not even by a regular army.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.200]   But somehow along with this,
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   he's planning to attack NATO powers, conquer Europe,
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.960]   who knows what.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.800]   It's impossible to put all these concepts together.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.920]   They're totally internally contradictory.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.360]   So what's my judgment?
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.520]   I think what motivates him
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.240]   is what he's been demonstrating in his actions.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.120]   Restore Russia as a great power,
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.120]   restore its economy, control it as a total dictatorship,
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:04.040]   enrich himself and his cronies,
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:09.040]   establish a legacy as a major figure in Russian history,
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:15.040]   make sure that Ukraine does not join NATO,
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:20.040]   and probably by now he's hardened the position,
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:25.040]   maintain Crimea and the southeastern corridor to Russia,
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:31.240]   and some ambiguous agreements about the Donbass region.
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.960]   That looks like his motivation.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.160]   There's much speculation that goes beyond this,
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.120]   but it's very hard to reconcile
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:47.120]   with the assessment of the real world
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.200]   by the same people who are making the grandiose speculations.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:57.800]   - Putin has been in power for 22 years.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.680]   Do you think power has corrupted him?
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.360]   - I don't think anything's changed.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.320]   It seems to me his policies
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.280]   are about the same as what they were.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.280]   They've changed in response to changed circumstances.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.640]   So very recently, right before the invasion,
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.480]   a few weeks before, for the first time,
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.480]   Putin announced recognition of the independence
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.400]   of the Donbass region.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.040]   That's a stronger position than before,
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.480]   much stronger.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.640]   Up till then, he had pretty much kept
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.640]   to the longstanding position of some kind of accommodation
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:47.360]   within a federal structure in which the Donbass region
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.920]   would have considerable autonomy.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.880]   So that's a harshening of the position.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.760]   - So even the human mind of Vladimir Putin, the man?
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.120]   - I can't read his mind.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.400]   I can only see the policies that he's pursued
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.720]   and the statements that he's made.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.600]   There are many people speculating about his mind.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:13.000]   And as I say, these speculations are, first of all,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.680]   not based on anything, never said anything
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.480]   about trying to conquer NATO.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.920]   But more importantly, they are totally inconsistent
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.480]   with the analyses of Russian power
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.240]   by the same people who are making the speculations.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:36.040]   So we see the same individual speculating
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:41.040]   about Putin's grandiose plans to become Peter the Great
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:48.680]   and conquer, start attacking NATO powers,
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.680]   on the one hand, saying that, on the other hand,
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.960]   gloating over the fact that his military power
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.920]   is so minuscule he can't even conquer
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.160]   towns a couple of miles from the border.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.960]   Well, it's impossible to make sense of that position.
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:11.760]   - Why did Russia invade Ukraine on February 24th?
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.120]   Who do you think is to blame?
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.720]   Who do you place the blame on?
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.920]   - Well, who's to blame?
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:24.040]   Any power that commits aggression is to blame.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:29.040]   So I continue to say, as I have been for many months,
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.120]   that the invasion, Putin's invasion of Ukraine
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.640]   is on a par with such acts of aggression
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:43.640]   as the US invasion of Iraq, the Stalin-Hitler invasion
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:50.920]   of Poland, other acts of supreme international crime
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:56.280]   under international law, aggression.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.080]   Of course, he's to blame.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.600]   - The US committed 6.9 billion in military assistance
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.760]   to Ukraine since the Russian invasion.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.360]   Should US keep up with this support?
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.120]   - There are two questions.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.560]   One has to do with providing support
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.000]   for defense against the invasion,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.160]   which is certainly legitimate.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.840]   The other is seeking ways to end the crime
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:27.920]   before even worse disasters arise,
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:31.600]   now that second part is not discussed in the West,
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.520]   barely discussed.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.880]   Anyone who dares to discuss it is immediately subjected
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:42.880]   to a flood of invective and a hysterical condemnation.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.040]   But if you're serious about Ukraine,
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.040]   there are two things you ask.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:52.160]   One, what can we do to support Ukraine
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.560]   in defense against aggression?
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.760]   Second, how can we move to end the war
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:03.760]   before it leads to even worse destruction of Ukraine,
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:08.840]   more starvation worldwide, reversing the efforts,
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.240]   the limited efforts to deal with global warming,
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.200]   possibly moving up an escalation ladder to war,
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.320]   the nuclear war.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:22.320]   That's the second half of the borrower phrase
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.840]   attributed to Winston Churchill.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:32.320]   There's a lot of war, war, but no joy, jaw, joy.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.960]   And there ought to be jaw, joy,
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.760]   if you care about Ukraine and the rest of the world.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.080]   Can it be done?
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.360]   We don't know.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:46.360]   Official US policy is to reject a diplomatic settlement,
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:51.880]   to move to weaken Russia severely
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.280]   so that it cannot carry out further aggression,
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.960]   but not do anything on the jaw, jaw side,
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.040]   not think of how to bring the crimes
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.720]   and atrocities to an end.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.360]   That's the second part of the question.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.240]   So yes, the US should continue
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.480]   with the kind of calibrated support
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.840]   that's been given the Pentagon wisely
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:27.840]   as vetoed initiatives to go well beyond support for defense
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:34.960]   up to attack on Russia.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.960]   So for the Pentagon, which seems to be the dovish component
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.400]   in the US administration has vetoed plans,
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.880]   which very likely would lead on to nuclear war,
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.040]   which would destroy everything.
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:55.040]   So calibrated provision of weapons to blunt the offensive,
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.280]   allow Ukraine to defend itself.
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:04.560]   If sensible combined with efforts to see
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:09.120]   if something can be done to bring the crimes
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.440]   and atrocities to an end and avert
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:16.640]   the much worse consequences that are in store,
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:21.440]   that would be all instead the US only dealing with the first
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.440]   and all of our discussions limit themselves to the first
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.320]   in the United States and in Britain, not in Europe.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:33.080]   - Do you worry about nuclear war in the 21st century?
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.040]   How do we avoid it?
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.680]   - Anyone who doesn't worry about nuclear war
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.160]   doesn't have a gray cell functioning.
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.680]   Of course, everyone is worried about nuclear war
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.120]   or should be.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:50.240]   It's very easy to see how steps could be taken.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.000]   Even been recommended that would lead to nuclear war.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.840]   So you can read articles even by liberal commentators
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.640]   who say we should drop all the pretenses,
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.200]   just go to war against Russia.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.600]   They have to be destroyed.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:12.480]   You can see proposals coming from Congress,
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.240]   the leading figures saying we should establish
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.320]   a no fly zone.
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:23.640]   Pentagon objects, they point out correctly
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.520]   that to establish a no fly zone,
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.880]   you have to have control of the air,
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:34.880]   which means destroying Russian air defense systems,
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.760]   which happen to be inside Russia.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.920]   We don't know that Russia won't react.
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.520]   Even the call now almost universal
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.280]   to ensure that Ukraine wins,
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.760]   drives out all the Russians,
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.920]   drives them out of the country,
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.040]   sounds nice on paper,
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.720]   but notice the assumption.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:02.320]   The assumption is that Vladimir Putin,
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:07.320]   this madman who just seeks power and is out of control,
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.880]   will sit there quietly,
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.120]   accept defeat, slink away,
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:18.120]   not use the military means that of course he has
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.200]   to destroy Ukraine.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.120]   One of the interesting comments that came out
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.760]   in today's long article,
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:31.760]   I think Washington Post reviewing a lot of leaks from,
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.280]   actually not leaks,
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:38.240]   actually presented by US intelligence and US leaders
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.200]   about the long buildup to the war.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.240]   One of the points it made was surprised
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.040]   on the part of British and US leaders
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:53.040]   about Putin's strategy and his failure to adopt,
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.920]   to fight the war the way the US and Britain would,
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.480]   with real shock and awe,
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.680]   destruction of communication facilities,
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.600]   energy facilities and so on.
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.800]   They can't understand why he hasn't done all that.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:12.440]   Well, could, if you wanna make it very likely
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.280]   that that'll happen,
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:19.280]   then insist on fighting until somehow Russia
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.880]   faces total defeat.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.280]   Then it's a gamble,
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:29.080]   but if he's as crazy and insane as you claim,
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.880]   presumably we'll use weapons that he hasn't used yet
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.040]   to destroy Ukraine.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:40.280]   So the West is taking an extraordinary gamble
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.880]   with the fate of Ukraine,
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.040]   gambling that the madman, lunatic,
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:52.040]   mad Vlad won't use the weapons he has to destroy Ukraine
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:56.800]   and set the stage for escalation of the latter,
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.160]   which might lead to nuclear war.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.640]   It's quite a gamble.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.200]   - How much propaganda is there in the world today,
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.640]   in Russia, in Ukraine, in the West?
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.760]   - It's extraordinary.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.720]   In Russia, of course it's total.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.320]   Ukraine is a different story.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.880]   They're at war, expect propaganda.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.880]   In the West, well, let me quote Graham Fuller,
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:28.400]   very highly placed in US intelligence,
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:32.440]   one of the top officials for decades,
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.320]   dealing mostly with Russia and Central Asia.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.200]   He recently said that in all the years of the Cold War,
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:45.200]   he's never seen any extreme Russophobia
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:49.960]   to the extent that he sees today.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.280]   That's pretty accurate.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:58.400]   I mean, the US has even canceled Russian outlets,
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:07.120]   which means if you wanna find out what Sergey Lavrov,
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.560]   other Russian officials are saying,
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.800]   you can't look it up on their own outlets.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:18.120]   You have to go through Al Jazeera,
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.480]   Indian state television or someplace
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:26.480]   where they still allow Russian positions to be expressed.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:31.000]   And of course the propaganda is just outlandish.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.640]   I think Fuller is quite correct on this.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.160]   In Russia, of course, you expect total propaganda.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:43.160]   There's nothing, any independent outlets,
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.720]   such as there were, have been crushed.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:51.760]   - If the media is a source of inaccuracies and even lies,
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.400]   then how do we find the truth?
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:59.400]   - I don't regard the media as a source of inaccuracies
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.280]   and lies.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.560]   They do exist, but by and large,
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:09.200]   media reporting is reasonably accurate.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.960]   Reporters, the journalists themselves,
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:17.960]   as in the past do courageous, honest work.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:23.520]   I've written about this for 50 years.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.320]   My opinion hasn't changed,
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:31.800]   but they do pick certain things and not other things.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:35.280]   There's selection, there's framing,
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.280]   there's ways of presenting things.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:43.560]   All of that forms a kind of propaganda system,
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.240]   which you have to work your way through,
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.280]   but it's rarely a matter of straight outright lying.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.560]   - So there's a difference between propaganda and lying.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:59.560]   - Of course, a propaganda system shapes and limits
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.960]   the material that's presented.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.520]   It may tell the truth within that framework.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.640]   So let me give you a concrete example,
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.400]   which I wrote about extensively.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:17.560]   I have a book called "Manufacturing Consent"
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.480]   jointly with Edward Herman.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.360]   It's about his term,
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.320]   which I accepted a propaganda model of the media.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:31.240]   A large part of the book is defense of the media,
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:36.240]   defense of the media against harsh attacks by Freedom House.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:40.920]   Several volumes they've published attacking the media,
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:45.920]   charging that the media were so adversarial and dishonest
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.600]   that they lost the war in Vietnam.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.880]   Well, I took the trouble of reading through the two volumes.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:57.880]   One volume is charges, the next volume is evidence.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:02.440]   Turns out that all of the evidence is lies.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.320]   They had no evidence.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.040]   They were just lying.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.760]   The media, in fact, were doing,
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:12.640]   the journalists were doing an honest, courageous work,
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.960]   but within a certain framework,
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:21.000]   a framework of assuming that the American cause
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.120]   was basically just, basically honorable,
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.960]   making mistakes, doing bad things,
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.960]   but all the idea of questioning
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:37.960]   that the United States was engaged in a major war crime.
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.920]   That's off the record.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:44.840]   So unfortunately, there was this crime and that crime,
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:49.840]   which harmed their effort to do good and so on.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.360]   Well, that's not lying, it's propaganda.
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:54.960]   - So how do we find the truth?
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.600]   - How do we find the truth?
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.240]   That's what you have a brain for.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.280]   It's not deep.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.760]   It's quite shallow.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.440]   It's not quantum physics.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.640]   Put a little effort into it.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:13.560]   Think about, look for other sources.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.600]   Think a little about history.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.600]   Look at the documentary record.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.880]   It all pretty well falls together
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.600]   and you can get a reasonable understanding
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.200]   of what's happening.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.400]   - If you could sit down with Vladimir Putin
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:32.720]   and ask him a question or talk to him about an idea,
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.640]   what would you say?
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.680]   - I would walk out of the room,
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.560]   just as with almost any other leader.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.920]   I know what he's gonna say.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.280]   I read the party line.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.160]   I read his pronouncements.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.280]   Doesn't wanna hear from me.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:51.000]   Am I gonna say, "Why did you carry out a crime
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.240]   "that's comparable to the US invasion of Iraq
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.840]   "and the Stalin-Hitler invasion of Poland?"
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.560]   Am I gonna ask that question?
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:06.600]   If I met with John F. Kennedy, say,
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.480]   would I ask, "Why did you radically escalate
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:14.600]   "the war in Vietnam, launch the US Air Force,
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:19.600]   "start, authorize an A-bomb, drive launch programs
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:23.200]   "to drive the villagers who you know
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.520]   "are supporting the National Liberation Front,
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.520]   "drive them into concentration camps
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.800]   "to separate them from the forces they're defending?"
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.200]   Would I have asked him that?
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.160]   Of course not.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.800]   - Do you think the people who led us
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:43.800]   into the war in Vietnam, the war in Afghanistan and Iraq,
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:49.800]   the war in Ukraine, are evil?
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:56.320]   - I mean, it's very hard to be in a position of leadership
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:00.960]   of a violent, aggressive power
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.240]   without carrying out evil acts.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.280]   Are the people evil?
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:12.320]   I mean, I'm not their moral advisors.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.640]   I don't know anything about them.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.640]   I look at their actions, their statements,
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:20.000]   their policies, evaluate those.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.360]   Other families can evaluate their personalities.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.520]   - Will there be a war between US and China
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.440]   in the 21st century?
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:34.400]   - If there is, we're finished, okay?
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.000]   A war between the US and China
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   would destroy the possibilities of organized life on Earth.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.840]   In fact, we can put it differently.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:50.840]   Unless the US and China reach an accommodation
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:55.840]   and work together and cooperatively,
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:00.840]   it's very unlikely that organized human society will survive.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.280]   We are facing enormous problems.
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:10.200]   Problems, destruction of the environment, pandemics,
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:15.200]   a threat of nuclear war.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:20.200]   None of these decline of democratic functioning
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:24.200]   of an arena for rational discourse,
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.800]   and none of these things have boundaries.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.600]   We either work together to overcome them,
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:34.440]   which we can do, or we'll all sink together.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.520]   That's the real question we should be asking.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:41.120]   What the United States is doing is not helping.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:46.840]   So current US policy, which is perfectly open,
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.880]   nothing secret about it,
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:53.360]   is to what's called encircle China,
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:57.400]   it's the official word, with sentinel states.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:03.240]   South Korea, Japan, Australia,
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:07.800]   which will be heavily armed,
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:13.760]   provided by Biden with precision weapons aimed at China,
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:19.080]   backed by major naval operations,
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:23.560]   huge naval operation just took place in the Pacific.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.480]   Many nations participating,
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:29.120]   RIMPAC didn't get reported here as far as I know,
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.920]   but an enormous operation threatening China.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.240]   All of this to encircle China,
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:41.080]   to continue with policies like that.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:47.240]   Somebody like Pelosi, just to probably to make her look more,
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:53.800]   I don't know what her motives are,
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.720]   taking a highly provocative, stupid act
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:02.360]   opposed by the military, opposed by the White House.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.000]   Yes, acts like that, which of course,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.080]   called forth the response of highly dangerous.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.360]   We don't have to do that.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.600]   We don't have to increase the threat.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:19.600]   I mean, right now, the last NATO summit, take a look at it.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:25.080]   For the first time, it invited to attend countries
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:30.800]   that are in the sentinel states surrounding China,
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.720]   encircling China from the east.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:38.840]   And it in fact extended the range of NATO
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:42.000]   to what's called the Indo-Pacific region.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.680]   So all of us, by now the North Atlantic
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.040]   includes the whole Indo-Pacific region
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:51.440]   to try to ensure that we can overcome
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:55.120]   the so-called China threat.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:59.680]   Suddenly we might ask exactly what the China threat is.
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:03.720]   It's done sometimes.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:08.720]   So former Prime Minister of Australia, Paul Keating,
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:12.440]   well-known international diplomat,
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.280]   had an article a while ago in the Australian press.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.200]   That's right in the claws of the dragon,
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.560]   asking, going through what the China threat is.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.920]   He ran through the various claims, finally concluded,
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.680]   the China threat is that China exists.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:34.560]   It exists, it does not follow US orders.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.560]   It's not like Europe.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:40.120]   Europe does what the United States tells it to do,
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.200]   even if it doesn't like it.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.360]   China just ignores what the US says.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:50.040]   There's a formal way of describing this.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:54.200]   There are two versions of the international order.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:59.960]   One version is the UN-based international order,
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.920]   which theoretically we subscribe to, but we don't accept.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.480]   The UN-based international order
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:11.040]   is unacceptable to the United States
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.080]   because it bans US foreign policy.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:19.920]   Literally, it explicitly bans the threat
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:24.360]   or use of force in international affairs,
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.960]   except under circumstances that almost never arise.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.480]   Well, that's US foreign policy.
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.480]   Try to find the president who isn't engaged
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:37.040]   in the threat or use of force in international affairs.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.520]   Okay, so obviously we can't accept
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:44.400]   the UN-based international system,
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.440]   even though under the Constitution,
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.120]   that's the supreme law of the land, but it doesn't matter.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.960]   So the United States has what's called
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.720]   a rule-based international order.
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:00.840]   That's acceptable because it's the United States
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.800]   that sets the rules.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:06.600]   So we want a rule-based international order
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.480]   where the US sets the rules.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:13.880]   In commentary in the United States, even in scholarship,
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:19.880]   almost 100% calling for a rule-based international order.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.880]   Is that false?
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.200]   No, it's true.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.880]   Is it propaganda?
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:29.840]   Of course it's propaganda because of what's not said
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.120]   and because of what's presupposed.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.800]   An answer to an earlier question.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.840]   Well, China does not accept
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.600]   the rule-based international order.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.800]   So when the US imposes demands,
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.520]   Europe may not like them, but they follow them.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.720]   China ignores them.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:55.320]   So take, for example, the US sanctions on Iran.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:36:01.560]   The US has to punish Iran because the United States
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:06.000]   pulled out of the, unilaterally pulled out of the Ukraine,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.120]   the Iran nuclear agreements.
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:14.120]   So in order to punish Iran for wrecking the agreements
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.840]   in violation of Security Council orders,
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:20.760]   we impose very harsh sanctions.
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:24.560]   Europe strongly opposes the sanctions,
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:28.960]   condemn them harshly, but it adheres to them
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:35.400]   because you don't disobey US orders.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.200]   That's too dangerous.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.640]   China ignores them.
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:44.400]   They're not keeping to the rule-based international order.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.720]   Well, that's unacceptable.
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:50.200]   In fact, it's said pretty openly.
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:54.120]   You can hear the Secretary of State and others saying
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:58.760]   China is challenging our global hegemony.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.160]   Yes, they are.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.400]   They don't accept US global hegemony,
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.640]   especially in the waters off China.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.720]   So that's a China threat.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.560]   They do a lot of rotten things, China.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.080]   I mean, internally, there's all kinds of repression,
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.120]   violence, and so on.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.640]   But first of all, it's not a threat to us.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.280]   And second, the US doesn't care about it
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.640]   because it easily accepts and supports
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:30.560]   comparable crimes and atrocities internal to allies.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:35.560]   So yes, we should protest it, but without hypocrisy.
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.640]   We have no standing to protest it.
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:42.320]   We support comparable things in all sorts of other places.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.400]   And just take a look at the US foreign aid.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:50.760]   The leading recipient is US foreign aid is Israel,
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:54.200]   which is engaged in constant terror, violence,
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.800]   and repression, constant, almost daily.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.600]   Second leading recipient is Egypt,
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:05.440]   under the worst dictatorship in Egypt's history.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:09.240]   That's 60,000 people in jail,
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.320]   political prisoners, tortured, and so on.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.320]   Do we care?
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.160]   No.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.040]   Second leading recipient.
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.560]   I mean, what are we talking about?
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.080]   That's why most of the world just laughs at us.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:26.520]   There's a lot of failure to understand here
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:30.400]   about why the global South doesn't join us
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:35.040]   in our proxy war against Russia,
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:38.320]   fighting Russia until it's severely weakened.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.080]   They don't join us.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.320]   Here, the question is what's wrong with them?
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:48.040]   Look into their minds to figure out what's wrong.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.960]   They have a different attitude.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:54.960]   They say, yes, we oppose the invasion of Ukraine,
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:58.600]   terrible crime, but what are you talking about?
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.440]   This is what you do to us all the time.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.080]   You don't care about crimes like this.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.720]   That's most of the global South.
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:11.040]   We can't comprehend that 'cause we're so insulated
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.440]   that we are just obviously right
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:16.080]   and everyone who doesn't go along must be wrong.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:20.840]   - Do you think the United States as a global leader,
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:24.280]   as an empire, may collapse in this century?
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:29.360]   Why and how will it happen and how can we avoid it?
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:34.360]   - The United States can certainly harm itself severely.
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:39.840]   That's what we're doing right now.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:43.720]   Right now, the greatest threat to the United States
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:48.720]   is internal countries tearing itself apart.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:56.720]   I mean, I really don't have to run through it with you.
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:02.560]   Take a look at something as elementary as mortality.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.960]   The United States is the only country.
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:10.480]   Outside of war, life expectancy is declining.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.480]   Mortality is increasing.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.000]   This doesn't happen anywhere.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.800]   You take a look at health outcomes generally.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:23.040]   They're among the worst among the developed societies
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:26.040]   and health spending is about twice as high
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.360]   as the developed societies.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.920]   You look at the charts, all of this starts
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:34.520]   around the late 1970s, early '80s.
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:38.040]   To go back to that point, the United States
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.800]   was pretty much a normal developed country
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:46.800]   in terms of mortality, incarceration,
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.400]   health expenses, other measures.
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:54.080]   Since then, the United States has fallen off the chart.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:57.040]   It's gone way off the chart.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:02.040]   Well, that's the neoliberal assault of the last 40 years.
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:05.600]   It's had a major effect on the United States.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:10.560]   It's left a lot of anger, resentment, violence.
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:12.200]   Meanwhile, the Republican Party
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.480]   has simply drifted off the spectrum.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:19.960]   It's not a normal political party in any usual sense,
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.680]   not what it used to be.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:26.160]   Its main policy is block anything
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.840]   in order to regain power.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.080]   That's its policy.
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:32.760]   It's stated almost openly by McConnell,
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:37.760]   followed religiously by the entire Congress.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:43.360]   That's not the acts of a political party.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:47.880]   So of course, democracy's declined,
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.800]   violence has increased.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:56.560]   The judgments, the decisions of the Supreme Court,
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:00.480]   the Court's the most reactionary court in memory.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.400]   To go back to the 19th century,
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:06.320]   decision after decision is an effort
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:11.320]   to create a country of white supremacist
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.360]   Christian nationalists.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:17.280]   I mean, it's scarcely hidden.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:22.000]   If you read the opinions of Alito, Thomas,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.560]   Gorsuch and others.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:31.800]   So yes, we can destroy ourselves within.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:36.280]   And in fact, the ways we're doing it are almost astonishing.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.280]   So it's well known, for example,
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:42.160]   everybody knows that US infrastructure,
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:46.920]   the bridges, subways and so on is in terrible shape.
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:49.640]   Needs a lot of repair.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.880]   The American Association of Engineers
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:55.600]   gives it a failing mark every year.
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.760]   All right, finally, Congress did pass
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.160]   a limited infrastructure bill.
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.840]   Say rebuild bridges and so on.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:07.120]   It has to be called a China Competition Act.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:10.600]   We can't rebuild their bridges
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.800]   'cause they're falling apart.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.000]   We have to rebuild their bridges to beat China.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.080]   It's pathological.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:23.160]   And that's what's happening inside the country.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:29.240]   Take Thomas's decision in the recent case
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:34.920]   in which he invalidated a New York law.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:38.760]   This is last October, a couple of weeks ago.
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:43.760]   Invalidated a New York law going back to 1913
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:48.320]   that required people to have some justification
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:51.640]   if they wanted to carry concealed weapons in public.
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:56.120]   He was through that with a very interesting decision.
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:59.800]   He said, the United States, he said,
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:04.800]   is such a decaying, collapsing, hateful society
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:09.280]   that people just have to have guns.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.880]   I mean, how can you expect somebody
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.440]   to go to the grocery store without a gun
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:19.040]   in a country as disgusting and hideous as this one?
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.560]   It's essentially what he said.
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:24.240]   Those weren't his words, but they were the import.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:29.400]   - What gives you hope about the United States,
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:33.200]   about the future of human civilization?
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:38.160]   - Human civilization will not survive
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:42.680]   unless the United States takes a lead,
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:47.680]   a leading position in dealing with and overcoming
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:51.320]   the very severe crises that we face.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.000]   United States is the most powerful country,
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.720]   not only in the world, but in human history.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.120]   There's nothing to compare with it.
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:04.120]   What the United States does has an overwhelming impact
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.040]   on what happens in the world.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:11.600]   When the United States pulls out alone,
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:15.040]   pulls out of the Paris agreements
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.720]   on dealing with climate change
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:22.720]   and insists on maximizing the use of fossil fuels
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:27.360]   and dismantling the regulatory apparatus
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.920]   that provides some mitigation,
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.200]   when the United States does that, as it did under Trump,
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:37.080]   it's a blow to the future of civilization.
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:42.920]   When Republican states today, right now,
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:47.480]   say they're gonna punish corporations
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:51.840]   that seek to take climate change into account
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:55.760]   in their investments, the US is telling the world,
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.920]   we wanna destroy all of us.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:02.600]   Again, not their words, but their import.
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.400]   That's what they mean.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:09.400]   So as long as we have a political organization
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:14.000]   dedicated to gaining power at any cost,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.240]   maximizing profit, no matter what the consequences,
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:21.440]   no future for human civilization.
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:26.040]   - Noam, thank you for talking today.
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.560]   Thank you for talking once again.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.560]   And thank you for fighting
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:33.040]   for the future of human civilization.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:33.960]   Again, thank you.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.760]   - Thank you.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.680]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.000]   with Noam Chomsky.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.280]   To support this podcast,
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.280]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:47.080]   And now let me leave you with some words from Voltaire.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.920]   "It is forbidden to kill.
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.600]   "Therefore all murderers are punished
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:55.720]   "unless they kill in large numbers
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.680]   "and to the sound of trumpets."
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:01.760]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:04.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:16.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
