[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Pastor John, a young man in Korea emails to ask, "Is intelligence required for becoming holy?
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Smart Christians can have better understandings about God, which gives them better discernment
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   on how to glorify God, and the opposite goes for dumber Christians. I think I'm wrong, but why?"
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Convince this young man that he's wrong, and explain the connection between intelligence and godliness.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   He's on to something, true, and yet you can't draw a straight line from intelligence to godliness.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   So here's what I would say. The mind, the human mind, is required for becoming holy.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   It's required for becoming human. The Bible says, "Think over what I say," 2 Timothy 2.7.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   "Think over what I say, and the Lord will give you understanding." So he's dealing with Timothy as a thinker,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   as a person with a mind, and so he's calling him, "Use your mind to think over what I say."
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   He says in 1 Corinthians 14, "Be babes in evil, but in your thinking be mature."
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   So he's calling us to mature through our thinking. Don't let your thinking lag behind.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Grow in grace as you think clearly about the things that I've spoken.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And he says in Ephesians, "You will know my mystery, my understanding of the mystery,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   as you read what I have written." Now, reading is a task of the mind.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   It requires that we teach our kids grammar and syntax, and that they be able to construe lines of thought
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   from one phrase to another, one sentence to another, and therefore Paul has clearly connected
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   acts of the mind with being able to grasp the mystery of God.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   So in that sense, this friend from Korea is on to something.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Here's the problem with drawing a line from there to, "Oh, well, then all smart people are godly people."
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   There are so many other factors besides IQ that go into deciding whether a person is holiness or not.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Those other factors about rebellion come into play and may make a person who is very intelligent
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   very rebellious, very angry, very bitter. And so I know of zero correlation between intelligence and godliness.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   In fact, Jesus said in Luke 10, 21 or 20, "God has hidden these things from the wise and understanding
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   and revealed them to babes," which I think leads us to this paradox.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Yes, use your mind, but use it to become a babe. Use it to become childlike.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   I just read this morning in my devotions, "Unless you receive the kingdom of God like a child,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   you will not enter it," which means that the mind, which is usually considered something that is going to
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   make us independent from the need for somebody else, should be used to show that we are more dependent
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   and childlike when it comes to God and bring us to a place of humility.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Then the mind can serve godliness. We use our intelligence, which is usually considered an instrument of independence,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   to lead us to be increasingly dependent on God.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Well said, Pastor John. I think you should tweet that, actually.
