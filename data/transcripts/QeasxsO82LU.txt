[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   - Do you think for teaching and in general,
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.680]   thinking about new concepts,
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.480]   do you think it's better to plug in the numbers
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.020]   or to think more abstractly?
[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.580]   So looking at theorems and proving the theorems
[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.180]   or actually building up a basic intuition of the theorem
[00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.860]   or the method, the approach,
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.880]   and then just plugging in numbers and seeing it work?
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.880]   - Yeah, well, certainly many of us like to see examples.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.020]   First, we understand,
[00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.920]   it might be a pretty abstract sounding example
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.760]   like a three-dimensional rotation.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.640]   How are you gonna understand a rotation in 3D?
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.600]   Or in 10D?
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.800]   And then some of us like to keep going with it
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.680]   to the point where you got numbers,
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.080]   where you got 10 angles, 10 axes, 10 angles.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.080]   But the best, the great mathematicians probably,
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.560]   I don't know if they do that 'cause they,
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.480]   for them, an example would be a highly abstract thing
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.800]   to the rest of us.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.720]   - Right, but nevertheless,
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.520]   working in the space of examples.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.360]   - Yeah, examples.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.200]   - It seems to--
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.800]   - Examples of structure.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.640]   - Our brains seem to connect with that.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.640]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:53.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
