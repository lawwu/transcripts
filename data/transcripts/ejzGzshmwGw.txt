[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Many words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in the book of the Acts of the Apostles in the fifth chapter, reading from verse 29 to verse 32, verses 29 to 32 in the fifth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We are to obey God rather than men. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a saviour, for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we are his witnesses of these things. And so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Now I want to consider with you particularly tonight this statement at the beginning of the 32nd verse, and we are his witnesses, or we are witnesses of these things.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   The apostles, you see, are on trial. They are before the great Jerusalem court, the Sanhedrin, and the charge brought against them is this, Did not we straightly commend you that you should not teach in this name?
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us. They are on trial because they are preaching Jesus Christ and him crucified and risen as the Son of God and the only way of salvation.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And they say that they cannot refrain from doing this. You see, they are like the writer of that hymn we have just been singing, This is my friend in whose sweet praise I all my days could gladly spend.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And they were spending themselves and ready even to face death rather than to stop preaching this great and glorious and wonderful name.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   But now the thing, you see, that confronts us is this. Everybody doesn't say that. There are many people to whom he means nothing, not interested in him at all. And his death means nothing.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   There are others who are bitterly opposed to this and ridicule it. And the people whom we are looking at here belong to that category. This is, I say once more, this astounding and amazing fact by which we are confronted, that the Sanhedrin could possibly behave in this way and manner.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Here are these apostles. They are harmless men. They haven't broken any laws. They have done nobody any harm. Indeed, they have given health and strength and vigor to a man who had been born lame.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   They have healed him. What nobody else could do, they have done. And here was a man born lame, over 40 years of age now, rejoicing, walking and leaping and praising God.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And it is for that that they are arrested more than once and are on trial once more before the Sanhedrin. And again they are prohibited to preach any more in the name of this Jesus.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   But this is their reply. We ought to obey God rather than men. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew and hanged on a tree.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a saviour, for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we are his witnesses of these things. And so is also the Holy Ghost whom God hath given to them that obey him.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Now, here, I say, is the thing that should engage our attention. Why did those members of the Sanhedrin react like that to these things?
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Let me remind you that they had reacted in exactly the same way not so long before this. To our blessed Lord himself. To all that he had said and to all that he had done.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   This is Palm Sunday. And think of the things that happened between that Palm Sunday and that death on the cross on Calvary's Hill.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Look at the things he had to endure, the things he had to pass through. Why was that? How do you account for the spite, the malignity of the Pharisees and scribes and the Sadducees and the doctors of the law, the Herodian party and everybody else?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   They all conspire against him. And they persuade the crowd, the mob, to shout out saying, "Away with him! Crucify him!"
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Now, my dear friends, surely we must face this question. Any intelligent person must at once want to face this question. Why is this? What is the matter with these people?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   That surely is the greatest tragedy in the whole story of the human race. That this kind of thing should never have happened and that it should be still happening.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   What accounts for it? Well, it seems to me that there is only one fundamental answer to this question and it is this. It was the refusal of these people to face the facts.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   That is the amazing thing. Let me use the modern jargon. That's the amazing thing about these people when you look at them at the merely psychological standpoint.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   It is a perfect instance of men being confronted by facts but yet not seeing them. In a sense, not allowing themselves to see them at all.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   And that is why the apostles replied to them as they do. They said, "Surely you can't prohibit us to report these facts, these things that we are witnesses to."
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   But that was the essence of the problem and here our attention is concentrated upon it by the way in which the apostles answer the charge.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   You see, the trouble with these members of the Sanhedrin was just this. That they were so governed by their prejudices that they didn't see things as they were.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   The trouble with our Lord as far as these Pharisees and scribes and Sadducees and doctors of the law were concerned was just this.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   That he didn't fit into their pattern. He broke all the rules. He cut across everything they'd ever stood for and everything that they'd always taught the people.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   And that is why they hated him. Now let's not forget our facts. These men, these were Jews and they were the teachers of the people and they were the experts in the Old Testament Scriptures.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   But you see, they'd misunderstood their Old Testament Scriptures. This is the whole tragedy of men in sin. That his mind becomes twisted and prejudiced and blinded.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   The very Scriptures which they taught were the Scriptures that were proving that they were wrong. Our Lord told them that. Search the Scriptures.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   For in them ye say that he hath eternal life and they are they, he says, that speak of me.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   But it was in the name of the Scriptures that they opposed him and finally procured his being crucified upon the cross.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   What was the matter? Well, I say the trouble was this. That the prejudices to which they were victims blinded to the truths and to the facts which were staring them in the face.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Now it's very simple for me to show you that in at this particular juncture in the story of these members of the Sanhedrin as they are dealing with these apostles.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   They did exactly the same with the apostles as they had done with their Lord. And our Lord had prophesied that they would do that.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   They said if they treat me in this way, he said, they'll treat you in the same way. Our Lord warned his disciples not to expect to be received with open arms by everybody.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   He said, you know, indeed, it's going to be the exact opposite. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more so shall they call his servants.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   And this, you see, is something that is verified here. They're giving the apostles, the servants, exactly the same treatment as they had given to the Lord and Master.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   And still the explanation is the same. Here they are, they're telling these people to stop. They're doing that in spite of certain facts.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   The fact of our Lord himself. The fact of what had happened on the day of Pentecost. The fact of what had happened to these apostles.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Now, we've been through this and we've seen it. They were frankly puzzled by these apostles. They couldn't understand them nor explain them.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   We read in chapter 4 verse 13, "Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled."
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   You see, they couldn't understand them. And yet, instead of looking at the facts, they were so blinded by their prejudices that they wouldn't even consider them.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Their argument was that these men must be wrong because they were not Pharisees and scribes and doctors of the law.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   They were unlearned and ignorant men. Therefore, anything they said was wrong. It was impossible. It was inconceivable that they could be right.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   They must be wrong. Therefore, they are. That's the kind of argument. That's prejudice, you see. It doesn't face the facts.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Not only were they not facing the facts of our Lord and Pentecost, may I remind you once more, we're not facing the fact of this man who'd been healed.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Let me use the legal jargon. There is an exhibit in court. And the exhibit is a man born lame, standing on his feet, and his ankle bones and feet have received strength.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   There's a fact facing them. They don't consider that at all. Now, if they had considered it, they'd have to change their whole opinion, their whole attitude, because they've got to explain that.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   And they can't. And then they're confronted by another fact, how these very men who were there now charging had been put in jail the previous night and were under lock and key and all the guards in position.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   But suddenly, during the night, these men had been set free by an angel. Well, whether you believe in angels or not, and some of these people didn't.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   The Sadducees didn't believe in angels. They at any rate ought to believe the evidence of their ires. They knew that they'd commanded the soldiers to put them into prison.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   They knew that that had been done. The soldiers had come back and had reported to them that the prisoners had escaped and were preaching in the temple.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   And they'd sent the soldiers to arrest them there and bring them back again on trial. And there they are standing before them.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Now, this is a sheer fact. But you see, they don't consider that. They don't explain that. They brush it aside. It can't be right. These men are wrong.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   And because we say they're wrong, they are wrong. Now, that's how unbelief always argues. It is a sheer refusal to face the facts.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   But you see, the apostles remind them of this, and they say, "You tell us not to preach. We can't listen to you. We must obey God rather than men.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   We are witnesses of these things. We can't keep quiet. We must. We've seen them. We are living witnesses. We are bearing testimony to something that we've seen and known and have proved."
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Now, I'm calling your attention to this, my dear friends, because mankind is still the same. There's no change.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   The world tonight, I say, is not interested in our Lord. That's why they stopped preaching today, by not listening to it.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   If they had power, they'd prohibit it. They're annoyed by it. The modern man is annoyed by this Christian faith. That's why he jeers at it and sneers at it and makes his clever jokes about it.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   They hate it. It's the same thing. Why do they hate it? Well, exactly for the same reason. It is still a refusal to face facts.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Now, let me show you how the modern man does it. I've shown you how the members of the Sanhedrin did it. The modern man does it in what he would claim is a scholarly manner.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   And this is how he does it. He comes to the New Testament, which is a record of these facts, particularly the four Gospels and this early history in the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   He comes to it with his learning, with his modern knowledge, especially with his scientific knowledge. And he starts off by saying that to start with, he doesn't believe all the facts.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   He rejects some of them. In other words, instead of facing the facts, they sit in judgment upon them and decide that some things are fact and some things are not fact.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   On what basis do they do that? Now, this is interesting. They call it historical criticism. It's historical and literary criticism, they call it.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Those are the terms they use to describe what is known as the higher criticism. It's meant to be historical. And this is, you see, how they do it.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   They say, "No, we don't accept certain facts." Why not? Well, the answer which they give is this. I'm quoting a well-known higher critic, one who adopts this attitude towards the New Testament and to our Lord at the present time.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   He says his standard of judgment is this. Anything he may read, even in the Bible, in the New Testament, even in the Gospels, which doesn't fit in with what he feels about Jesus and as to what he thinks Jesus would do, he rejects.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Now, this is a most interesting process. I'm trying to show you how the modern Sanhedrin conducts itself and its arguments, how it evades the facts.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   What does this man know about the Lord Jesus Christ? Well, he agrees that he knows no more than what he reads in the Bible.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   But he tells us that in reading the Bible, he gathers an impression about Jesus. He gets to know him. He's used an illustration. He says that when he reads Treasure Island, he feels he knows Long John Silver.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   From reading the book, he's got to know Long John Silver. He knows what sort of man he is. He knows the sort of thing he'd say and wouldn't say, the kind of thing he'd do and wouldn't do.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   And if he came across something in Treasure Island, which he feels is inconsistent with the Long John Silver that he knows, he doesn't believe it. He rejects it. He does exactly the same with Jesus, he tells us.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   And so, when he finds that our Lord speaks about judgment and punishment, he says, I don't believe it. He didn't say it.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   But Jesus, I know, wouldn't say a thing like that. He couldn't possibly say a thing like that. So he comes to the conclusion that he didn't say it.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   So half your facts are dismissed altogether and immediately.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   And then with the remainder, what they do, of course, is to explain them away according to their own theories and ideas and according to the dictates of modern knowledge.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Miracles, of course, are impossible, therefore they didn't happen. Well, then you say, but what about the accounts of miracles in the four Gospels?
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Oh, well, they say, we know now by the study of psychology that primitive people are always ready to believe in the magical. There are people like that now.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   They'll believe in astrology. They'll believe anything that they hear, which is marvelous and wonderful. And these were very simple primitive people, ignorant and unlearned.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   And of course, they were ready to believe in miracles. But we know miracles cannot happen. Science proves they can't happen. Not true, of course, and they can't prove that.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   They just say these things dogmatically. Therefore, out go your miracles. And so you manipulate and twist the facts. What do you end with?
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Well, what you end with is this, with what you think the Lord Jesus Christ was like, what you think he said, what you think he did, what you think was the cause of his death, what you think his teaching is.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   And it just comes to this, that he was a very good man, ahead of his times, was misunderstood by the world as most good men are, and died a shameful, cruel death.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   But still, he didn't become bitter and sour. He forgave the very people who were putting him to death. It is the supreme example of passive resistance, of pacifism, if you like.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   And his teaching is that we should go on loving people even though they hate us, that we should be kind and good, and just thus do our best to cultivate a beautiful and a loving and a good spirit.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   And that, they tell us, is Christianity. Well now, my friend, I'm simply here to put a question to you.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Does that explain this Christian story? Does that explain the origin of the Christian church? Does that explain the long history of the church?
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Is that adequate? Would it ever have come into being if that is the truth?
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   What is the origin of this whole business? What is the origin of the church? What is the message?
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Well, there's only one way to discover the answer, and that is to do the very thing we are doing, study these early chapters of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, and here is the answer.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Christianity is not a mere teaching, it isn't a philosophy, it isn't a point of view, it isn't a mere attitude to life. It is primarily, first and foremost, something which has happened in history, in the world.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   We are witnesses to these things and of these things. This is the thing that has brought it into being and has continued it throughout the centuries.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Look at these apostles, these are the men through whom the church was started and built up, nobody can deny that.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Well now then, what did they preach, what did they teach?
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Well, they tell us, here's the answer. You see, these were ignorant and unlearned men.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   These were not men who could weave philosophical and political theories and ideas.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   These were not men who wrote poetry and had wonderful mystical experiences. They were fishermen, ordinary men, as I'm going to remind you.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   And you see what they did was to report facts. We are witnesses of these very things, they say.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   They've got nothing to say in a sense, except certain events that have happened and the meaning of those events and the significance of those events.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Let me take up that word, that Peter, who probably was the spokesman on this occasion, when they were all on trial before the Sanhedrin,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Peter was generally the spokesman in these early days.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   Let me borrow that phrase that he used when, as an old man on the verge of the grave, he was writing that last letter of his to some Christian people,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   the second epistle of Peter, chapter 1, that we read just now. You remember how he keeps on saying, he says,
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   "And while I'm left in this world, I'm going to remind you of these things." "You know them," he says, "but you keep on forgetting them."
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   "And while I'm here," he says, "I'm going to remind you of these things. I know that very soon I've got to put off this tabernacle of mine,
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   but I'm going to remind you of them so that after my decease you'll never forget them again. You'll always hold them in remembrance."
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   "Why?" "Well," he says, "we have not followed cunningly devised fables.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   And we made known unto you the coming and the power of the Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty."
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Now there it is, you see, in a phrase, "not cunningly devised fables."
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   These apostles didn't preach theories, they didn't preach fairy tales.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   They were not novelists who had a vivid imagination and who took a simple peasant and turned him into a wonderful religious teacher.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   That's what the world does, but these men said, "We haven't done that," says Peter, "we're incapable of that. We haven't got cunningly devised fables."
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   "We're reporters of facts, we're eyewitnesses. We're simply telling you what our eyes have seen and our ears have heard."
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Now there it is, you see, in a nutshell, and he was there as an old man at the end of his life,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   just saying what he'd said right at the beginning of his career as an apostle, "We are his witnesses of these things."
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   And so is the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Very well, my friends, the Christian message first and foremost is a record of facts.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Get rid of this notion that Christianity is just a point of view with respect to life.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   That's the modern teaching. They say it doesn't matter if all the facts are proved to be wrong.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   There's a teacher in Germany who talks about demythologizing the scriptures, Bultmann.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   He says it doesn't matter if all the effects have gone, and he dismisses practically all of them,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   except the fact that a man called Jesus died on a cross.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   He says it doesn't matter, the teaching remains.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Now if there ever was a contradiction of the preaching of the apostles, it is that.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   If you take away the facts, there's no Christianity, there's no message.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   This is entirely a matter of facts.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   And that's what I'm trying to remind you of on this Palm Sunday evening.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Oh yes, he rode into Jerusalem that Palm Sunday, riding upon the fall of an ass.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   That's a fact of history, as definitely as the conquest of this country by Julius Caesar.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   And all these things are facts.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Now these apostles, they were very honest men.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Later, some of them wrote their Gospels.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Matthew and John, two of the apostles, wrote their Gospels.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   The other two Gospels, Mark and Luke, are undoubtedly dependent upon the apostles and what they reported to the writers.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   And these men are very honest, and they tell us quite frankly that there was a time when they themselves didn't understand the things they were seeing.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   You see, we're all like that by nature.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Men don't see things that are in front of them. Prejudice is so powerful, it can blind us to the things that are staring us in the face.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   And these men are honest enough to admit that.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   You read the four Gospels, you'll find these very apostles stumbling, grumbling, complaining, falling into all sorts of mistakes and errors.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   They were like that, and they didn't understand them until after the resurrection, and especially after what happened to them on the day of Pentecost.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   They thought that he was only a man like everybody else, and when he died upon the cross, they were absolutely shattered.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   They tell us that themselves.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   You see, they were Jews again, and they'd hoped that their Messiah was going to be a great military figure,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   who was going to deliver them from the tyranny and the bondage of Rome, and set up Israel again as the greatest military nation in the world.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   And he hadn't done that. He was crucified in weakness on a tree, and they were shattered completely.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   And they didn't know where they were. They all were scattered away.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   And there's a wonderful picture in John 21 of a group of them just sitting together, and Peter, at last in his impulsive way, said,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   "Well, I'm going to fish. I go a-fishing."
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   That's something he did understand. He couldn't understand this other thing.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   All the claims and the teaching, but to end in that, they couldn't follow it.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   But now, you see, as the result of our Lord's teaching to them after the resurrection and after the baptism with the Spirit,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   they know, they understand, and now they say, "We can tell you. We are witnesses of these things.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   We'll tell you facts. We'll tell you the meaning of the facts. We'll show you the relevance of the facts.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   We are witnesses of these things."
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   What are they? That's the question. What are they?
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   What is Christianity? What are these facts on which the Christian message, the Christian truth are based?
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Well, I want to hold them before you. I make no apology.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   I'm like the Apostle Peter. You've heard these things before. The question is, do you believe them?
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Would you be as you are if you really believed these things? That's the question.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Do you react, I say again, to him and all that is so true of him as that hymn we've just been singing just now,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   that beautiful hymn puts it so well. Is he this dear friend to you,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   for whose name's sake you are very ready to be spent, to spend and be spent?
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   That's the test. If you're not, you see, you've known the facts, but you haven't realized their meaning and significance.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   You're not captivated and captured by them as these men were. Here are men who'd sooner die than refrain from preaching
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   the glory of the Son of God as the only Savior of the world. What are the facts?
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   Well, let me take you hurriedly through them. The person of our blessed Lord himself,
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   the God of our fathers raised up Jesus. That's Christianity, it's Christ, it's this Jesus.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   Who is he? Well, you see, these men say we are witnesses of these things.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Of what are they witnesses? Oh, think of them, Peter, James, John and the others.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   You see, they'd been with him, they'd met him, and they'd felt from the very beginning
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   that there was something strange and unusual about him. They'd felt his authority,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   they'd felt some note of command about him. He was just a carpenter.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   He didn't come as a man with all the learning and the law and the knowledge of Greece.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   He hadn't come from the academies or one of the porches. He isn't a great Roman dignitary
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   versed in law and government. No, he's just an ordinary Galilean. He's just a carpenter,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   the one known as the son of Joseph and of Mary. And yet, you see, the thing that they never forgot
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   was this, that one day as Peter and his brothers were there mending the nets in the ship,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   the boat of their father, they were just fishermen, this strange Jesus came along and said,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   "Follow me!" And they got up and left their father and the boats and the nets and went after him.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   And there was another man called Matthew. He sat at the receipt of customs.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   He was a publican. He was a tax gatherer. And there he was one afternoon sitting there,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   and remember, a man became a tax gatherer and especially a Jew, if he was a very mercenary-minded
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   sort of person, a Jew shouldn't have done a thing like that. He was gathering the taxes
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   for the oppressor, for the conqueror. But some of them demeaned and debased themselves
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   to such an extent that he would do that in order to make a living, make money to get on.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   And Matthew was a publican, and he was sitting at the receipt of customs.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   And this Jesus went past and looked at him and said, "Follow me!"
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   And he got up and left the cash book and the box and everything else and went after him.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   What is this? Oh, this is the person to whom they bear their witness and their testimony.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   They felt some strange and unusual power and authority about him.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   But come, let me remind you of that other occasion. Peter, James, and John.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   One afternoon our Lord singled them out from the rest of the apostles
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   and asked them to come with him up to the top of a great mountain.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   And they went with him, Peter, James, and John.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   And when they reached the top of the mountain, suddenly he was transfigured before them.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   His face began to shine, his very clothing began to shine.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   There was a radiance that came out of him, from his very billiments, as it were,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   everything concerning him was shining in such a manner that no fuller on earth could ever produce such a shine.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   He was transfigured before them.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   They'd never seen anything like it in their lives.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   A cloud overshadowed them, and suddenly they heard a voice coming out of the cloud saying,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased. Hear him!"
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   "And that voice we heard," says Peter as an old man, and he's saying it in effect here.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   He may have used the very words.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   "That voice we heard from the excellent glory when we were with him on the mount saying,
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   'This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.'"
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   They'd heard it. They'd seen him. They'd heard him.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   This had never happened to anybody else in their presence in their lives.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   They'd seen the Jesus whom they'd known suddenly transformed and transfigured
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   and something of the radiance of eternal glory came out of him.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   They'd seen this, and they're witnesses of these things.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   You see, this is Christianity, my friend.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   Not what a clever modern man, whether he be bishop or anything else,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   thinks Christianity and chastisement really are.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   No, no. It's this, this person, this blessed person,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   this impact that he had upon these men through whom Christianity started.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   And there's a still more wonderful testimony to the power of his personality.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   We are told in John's Gospel, chapter 18, that when he was going to be arrested,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   he spoke certain words.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   He looked at Judas who was leading the enemy to arrest him and said,
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   "Whom are you seeking?"
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   And we read a most astounding thing.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   "As soon as he had said unto them, 'I am he,' they went backward and fell to the ground."
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   These were the soldiers that were sent to arrest him.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   He hasn't got a sword. He hasn't got a pistol.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   There were no such things as pistols in those days.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   He was completely defenseless.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   And yet when the armed soldiers with their swords and staves
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   come to arrest him as he speaks,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   they went backwards and fell to the ground.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   What is this? Who is this?
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   We are his witnesses of these things.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   And then, of course, his works.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Oh, read your four Gospels, my dear friends.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   How do you explain that a carpenter like this
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   could ever have had the effect he's had upon the whole world and its course of history?
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   How do you explain it? How does it happen?
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   It was said of him that he had no learning.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   How could he teach, therefore?
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   And he hadn't had any training in the customary manner.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   He was not trained as a Pharisee, nor as anything but a carpenter.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   And yet you see, what accounts for it? There's only one answer.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   These extraordinary demonstrations of divine power.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   John calls them signs.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   And miracles are, after all, primarily intended as signs
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   to authenticate his person, to let the world know who he is.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   He used the argument himself.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   One afternoon, he was dealing with these Jews who didn't believe in him.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   And he said, "Though ye believe not my words,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   believe me for the very work's sake.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   Face the facts. Look at them."
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   But that's the thing, you see, they wouldn't do.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   No, these apostles are witnesses of these things.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Well, might they say something like that.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   Peter, you see, was a witness to some of these things.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   There was an occasion once when he and some of his fellows had gone out fishing one night.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   And they came back in the morning having caught nothing.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   They'd been working very hard right through the night, but they hadn't caught a single fish.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   And our Lord addresses them and says, "What's happened to you?"
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   And they told him, "We've been out toiling all night and we haven't caught anything."
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   "All right," he said, "throw the net on the other side of the ship."
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   And they did.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   And so many fish were caught in it that the very nets broke.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   And they landed a great lot of fish into their ship.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   What was the effect of that upon Peter?
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Peter was an expert fisherman. Peter was a daredevil, a courageous fellow, afraid of nobody.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   When he saw that, he understood.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   And he went to our Lord and he said, "Depart from me, O Lord, for I am a sinful man."
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   He recognized power unearthly, beyond the human, something divine.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Read your four Gospels.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   These are the phrases that you'll find running through everywhere.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   "We have seen strange things today."
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   Or when he worked a miracle, "They glorified and magnified the name of God,"
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   "that such power should have been given to a man."
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Now they're witnesses of these things.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   They're being told not to preach anymore in the name of this Jesus.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   They say, "But this is monstrous."
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   "We've seen the demonstration of his divine power."
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   And then his teaching.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   Here again everybody was struck by the authority we read at the end of the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   When he'd finished preaching, the people turned to one another and they said,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   "This man speaketh with authority."
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And not as the Pharisees and scribes.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   The Pharisees and scribes quoted authorities.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   "This man speaks with authorities."
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   They were saying in their cleverness, "Hillel said this, Gamaliel said that."
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   And they were arguing, quoting authorities as they write us today.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Quote one another, and that's the sign of learning.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   "But here's a man who speaks with authority."
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Not as the Pharisees and scribes.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   They were all impressed by this.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   You remember that soldiers were sent one day to arrest him,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   and they went back without him.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   And the authorities said, "Where is the prisoner? Why haven't you brought him?"
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   And they could only give one reply, "Never men speak like this man."
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   There was something, there was an authority.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   And he made such astounding claims for himself.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   He said, "The Father and I are one. Before Abraham was, I am."
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   Read the records, my dear friends. Don't talk about Christianity.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   Read the record. Get the facts.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   It isn't your opinion. It's prejudice, as mine was prejudice.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   Get at the facts, and then begin to speak.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Take especially his teaching about his own death.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   That's the thing we need to think of this week in particular.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Go back again to that Mount of Transfiguration.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Moses and Elias appeared, and they began to speak to him.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   What did they speak to him about? Do you know?
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   Now come along, you've rejected Christianity. You say there's nothing in it.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Can you tell me what Moses and Elias spoke about on the Mount of Transfiguration to this Jesus?
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Isn't it shocking, shameful, mad, that people should argue about Christianity, who don't know the facts?
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   Get your facts first. Be honest.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Don't be like the Sanhedrin, just speaking blind prejudice.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   Do you know what they spoke to him about?
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   They spoke to him about the exodus that he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   They spoke to him about his death.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Moses and Elias talked to him about his death on the Mount of Transfiguration.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   And do you remember his teaching?
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   Do you remember what happened to Caesarea Philippi?
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Our Lord turned to these very apostles one afternoon and said, "Whom do men say that I am?"
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   "Well," they said, "some say that you're Elias. Some say that you're one of the prophets," and so on.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   But he said, "Whom do you say that I am?"
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Peter stepped forward and said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   And our Lord said to him, "Blessed art thou, Simon, bar Jonah, for flesh and blood doth not reveal this unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven."
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   And then he goes on to talk about founding the church and the faith of this apostle,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   and all others who have the same faith, all is based on that.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   But then he did the most amazing thing.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   Immediately after that, we are told in the 16th chapter of Matthew's Gospel,
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   immediately after this great confession of Peter and this great scene,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   from that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go unto Jerusalem
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Peter took him and began to rebuke him, saying, "Far be it from thee, Lord, this shall not be unto thee."
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   Then turned he and said unto Peter, "Get thee behind me, Satan, for thou art an offense unto me.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   For thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men."
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Now, you see, that's his teaching.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   He taught them about his death.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   And he did this many times.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   He said, "The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost."
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   He said, "The Son of Man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many."
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   Listen to this. Some Greeks came on one occasion.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   You see, the talk had spread about him.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   And some Greeks came one day and they said that they'd like to have an interview with Jesus.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   They approached Philip.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   But he wouldn't see them, and he gave this answer.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   He said, "The hour is come that the Son of Man should be glorified.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone;
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   Listen to him later on.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   "Now is the judgment of this world. Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   And I, if I be lifted up from the earth," that's a reference to crucifixion, "shall draw all men unto me."
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   Listen to him before that.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   "Here he is praying to his Father, 'Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say?'
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   Shall I say, 'Father, save me from this hour?'
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   But for this cause came I unto this hour.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   Father, glorify thy name.'"
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   These men had witnessed all that. They were there. They heard it.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   "Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, 'I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.'
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   The people, therefore, that stood by and heard it, said that it thundered.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   The Father said, 'An angel speak to him.'
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Jesus answered and said, 'This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.'"
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   That's his teaching.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   "He said, 'As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.'"
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   He says, "Don't resist. Put your swords away. Thus it be.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   Cometh us and behoveth us to fulfil all righteousness."
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   And in his final prayer to his Father, as recorded in the 17th chapter of John's Gospel,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   which they heard him offering, no doubt, he said,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   "Father, I have finished the work that thou gavest me to do."
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   And then he says, "I am ready to sanctify myself,"
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   by which he means he's ready to offer himself as a sacrifice to be offered to God's broken holy law.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   Oh, he said this so constantly.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   His friends warned him one day, they said, "Don't go up to Jerusalem.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   That King Herod is waiting to catch you and to kill you."
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   He said, "Go and tell that fox, Herod, that I work miracles today and tomorrow,
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   and the third day I am glorified."
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   Listen to him looking at the city of Jerusalem, just these last days of his life on earth,
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   and saying, "Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how oft, how oft
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   would I have taken thee and gathered thee as a hen gathers her chicks beneath her wing?"
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   And he would not.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   "Now your house is left unto you desolate."
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   That's his teaching. These men had heard all that.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   They hadn't understood it at the time, but they heard it, and it all came back to them afterwards.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   These are the things that their witnesses do.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   And then they witnessed his trial, the injustice of his trial.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   Peter had sneaked in, you remember, he wanted a year,
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   and yet he denied him because he was afraid he'd be killed with him.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   But he'd heard things like this, and he never forgot them.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   He'd heard this carpenter, Jesus, reasoning and arguing with Pontius Pilate
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   and talking to him about "my kingdom."
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   Here's a representative of the Roman Emperor and the great Roman Empire
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   and its great system of government, but here stands this common man, as it were, before him and says,
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   "My kingdom is not of this world."
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   He says, "You would have no authority over me were it not given you from above."
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   He knows what he's doing. He speaks with authority. He speaks as a king.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   They'd heard that.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   And you see, they'd heard another thing which is very germane to this argument here
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   with this great Sanhedrin, this great court.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   These people here, they say to them, "Look here, you must stop doing this."
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   They said, "Are you going to bring this man's blood upon us?
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   You fill Jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood upon us?"
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   But these disciples had heard them saying something like this.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   Pilate had reasoned with them and he'd tried to release Jesus.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   They said, "No, no."
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   "Well," says Pilate, "I'm at inner retreat." He washed his hands.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   "Your blood be on your own heads," he said to them.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   And they said, "It's all right. We are ready to take it."
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   "His blood be upon us and upon our children."
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   They'd taken it upon themselves and now they're objecting.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   Such is the ridiculous, contradictory character always of unbelief.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   Now these men had heard all these things and then finally
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   they'd witnessed his death upon the cross.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   They knew that this wasn't an accident.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   They knew that he had set his face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   They'd tried to stop him as I've reminded you.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   They'd warned him they'd done everything.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   "No, no," he said, "I must. I must."
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   "It's impossible that a prophet should die outside Jerusalem."
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   He did it deliberately. He went on.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   "Go and tell that fox, Herod."
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   He knows and on he goes.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   He rides to death.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   He goes deliberate.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   And there he is nailed to a tree.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   What do you hear? Listen to him.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   That's a quotation from the 22nd Psalm.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   Let me plead with you to do one thing this week.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   If you do nothing else, read the 22nd Psalm.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   And then read any one you like of the accounts of the death
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross on Calvary's Hill.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   And you'll find that on the cross he was giving a literal fulfillment
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   to the details described in that amazing way in the 22nd Psalm.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   He quotes the words, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   They'd heard all this.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   But then they'd noticed the rapidity with which he died.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   Crucifixion was a very slow process of death.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   But they found him already dead and the soldiers and everybody were amazed
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   that he died so soon.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   And one of the soldiers took a spear and thrust it into his side
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   and out came water and blood.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   He'd already been dead for some time.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   The blood had clotted.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   The serum and the clot.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   What's it mean?
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   To me there's only one adequate explanation.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   He died of a literal broken heart.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   Why? Because he was afraid of death? No, no.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   But because the sins of mankind were upon him.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   Because God had made him to be sinned.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   Because his soul was made an offering for sin.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   Because he's enduring the vials of God's wrath in our place.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   And it broke his heart literally.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   And out came clot and serum, blood and water.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   He didn't just swoon.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   He didn't just temporarily lose consciousness.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   The soldier has proved that once and forever by thrusting and piercing his side with this spear.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   And the blood and the water, their historical evidence, their exhibits in the court, we've seen.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   It was a real death.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   And he was buried and the grave was empty.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   And he rose again.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   They go on testifying to these things.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   And then they remember how he appeared in a room with them,
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   an upper room after his resurrection.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   And they were filled with astonishment.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   But he took them through the scriptures and he reprimanded them.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   There were two of them who were going on a journey to a place called Emmaus.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   And they were very downcast.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   They were very miserable.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   The one they'd looked for as the saviour had died in weakness upon a cross.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   A stranger joins them and he says, "What's the matter with you? Why are you so downcast?
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   What is this kind of conversation you're having with one another?"
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   And they looked at him in astonishment and said, "Haven't you heard?"
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   "Heard what?" he said.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   "Well," they said, "heard concerning Jesus of Nazareth,
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   which was a prophet, mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   and have crucified him.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   And beside this, today is the third day since these things were done.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   when they were early at the sepulchre and when they found not his body,
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   they came saying that they'd seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   and found it even so as the women had said, but him they saw not."
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   And the stranger looked at them and said,
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   "O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have written.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, died and suffered these things,
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   and enter into his glory?
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   And beginning at Moses and all the prophets,
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   And they say later that as he did this, their hearts began to warm within them.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   Did not our hearts warm, burn within us while he talked with us by the way
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   and while he opened to us the scriptures?"
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   He reprimanded them, he instructed them, he said, "You're blind, you fools,
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   you're downcast because I've been killed and crucified, but I'm risen.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   Don't you understand the meaning?"
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   And he took them through it all and expounded it all to them.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   And then one day they were with him on top of another mountain called Olivet.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   And suddenly while he was speaking to them, they saw him ascending in their sight.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   And he disappeared into the heavens.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   He told them, "Stay at Jerusalem, stay where you are, until I send the power on you."
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   Ten days later it came, and they were filled with power.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   All that you read of in the second chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   My friends, what these men are saying here is this.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   They say, "You're telling us not to preach.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   You're telling us not to do anything more in the name of this Jesus."
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   Yes, we can't. We ought to listen to God rather than men.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   "Why, well, the God of our fathers hath raised up Jesus, whom you flew and hanged on a tree.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   What for? Well, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins."
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   This is their message. This is what it means.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   They said to this council, "Can't you, don't you see and realize and understand
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   that these facts to which we are bearing witness, these prove who he is,
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   these are the fulfillment of the ancient prophecies.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   Go back," they said, "and read your Old Testament, the God of our fathers.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   Go back and read about all the ritual and the ceremonial of the temple and the tabernacle before that.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   Why did they take a lamb morning and evening and shed his blood and offer him?
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   Why did they take beasts and put their hands on the head of the beasts
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   and then kill them and take the blood and offer it?
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   Well, God instructed them to do that. All right, there's agreement about this.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   But yes," say the apostles, "the question for you is what is the meaning of all this?
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   You don't believe that the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   can cleanse the conscience from dead works, do you?
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   Of course you don't. These are prophecies. These are adumbrations.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   These are types, and they're pointing to a great anti-type.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   Listen, he's come, it's Jesus, the one whom you slew.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   He's the fulfillment of all the prophecies.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   We know, we've seen him, we felt but we didn't understand him, we were blinded as you are.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   But when he instructed us after his resurrection, when the Spirit came and gave us illumination,
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   we see it all, we've got it all.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   Listen, this is what it means, he is the Prince and the Savior.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   Don't you see, they said, what we've now come to see?
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   That this is, as John the Baptist said of him at the beginning of his preaching career,
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   this is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   Don't you see it?
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   Don't you see that he is the Lamb to which all the other lambs were pointing?
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   Don't you see that he's the High Priest and the offering at the same time?
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   Don't you see that God is in him, reconciling the world unto himself?
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   It is he alone who can save us.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   It is he alone who can give us repentance and remission of sin.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   There is no other way whereby a man can be saved.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   There is none other foundation that can be laid, save that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   That's why these men went on preaching, and the Apostle Paul wasn't with them at the time he came in letter.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   He tells the Corinthians the same thing.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   "I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   Why? Well, because that's the saving fact.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   That's the thing that makes me know that my sins are forgiven.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   My sins have been laid upon the spotless Lamb of God.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   He's been stricken, smitten, wounded for my transgressions.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   I look at him. I know I am forgiven.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   God is just because he's punished my sins.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   And he remains just and still, at the same time can justify me and reconcile me unto himself.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   God hath set him forth as a propitiation for our sins.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   My friends, these are the things about which these men are witnessing.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   We are witnesses of these things.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   It isn't a message only about the love of God.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   It is the proof of the love of God.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   It is the demonstration of the love of God.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   It is the love of God acting.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   And it's as great as this, that God spared not his only begotten dearly beloved Son,
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   but delivered him up for us all.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   That he has taken the Son of his love, who was innocent and pure,
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   never disobeyed him, never did anything wrong,
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   and hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   These things, say these men, we are witnesses of them.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   We've seen them, we've now seen their meaning.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   We now know that we are saved by them.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   Can't you see that we, in being what we are, are proofs of this?
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   You can't understand us.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   You say we are unlearned and ignorant men, and you're perfectly right.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   Well, how do you explain us?
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   He's the explanation, it's the only explanation.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   We are witnesses to the objective facts and events.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   We are living witnesses to the power and the truth of these things.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   And that is why we cannot accept your edict.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   That is why we propose to go on preaching,
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   and bearing witness to these things, whereby we are saved,
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   and apart from which no man can be saved.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   Very well, my friend.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   I have a simple question to put to you.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   What do these things mean to you?
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   These things I've been talking about.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   These facts, these historical events about which I've been reminding you,
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   what do these things mean to you?
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   You've got to come to some decision about them.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   You can't get rid of them.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   There would never have been a Christian church but for them.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   It's the sole explanation of the origin and the continuance of the Christian church.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   This is the Christian message.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   This alone explains the saints of the centuries,
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   and the dynamic power of this gospel.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   What do they mean to you?
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   Have you ever really faced them?
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   Can't you see the madness, the blindness, the prejudice
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   of these great members of this great Sanhedrin?
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   My dear friend, face the facts,
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   and ask God by His Spirit to remove your prejudice,
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   and to give you understanding.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   Once you see, or let me put it in the words of Isaac Watts,
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   you see he puts it like this,
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   he says, "When I survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of Glory died,"
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   he hadn't taken a casual glance at it and said, "Nonsense, rubbish.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   In this sophisticated scientific age we don't believe such things."
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   No, no, he'd stopped, he'd looked, he'd surveyed, he dwelt upon it, he gazed upon it.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   "When I survey this wondrous cross on which the Prince of Glory died,
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   my richest gain I count but lust and poor contempt.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   On all my pride were the whole realm of nature mine
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   that were an offering far too small.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   Love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all."
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   Of course it does.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   Have you felt that demand?
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   Look at the facts, I say.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   Dwell upon the cross, survey it, meditate upon it
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   until you feel the demand, and then give yourself to Him.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   And you'll find He'll give you not only an assurance of forgiveness,
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   He'll give you new life, new understanding, new power.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   He'll make of you a living witness to the truth of these things
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   and to the wonders of His grace.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   Amen.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
