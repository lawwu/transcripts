[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.680]   Well, I'm excited to be here today with three members of the Legacy Standard Bible
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.360]   Translation Team.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.560]   My name is Chris Scottie, I'm the VP and Publisher of 316 Publishing, and we're going to start
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.320]   today's segment by giving these men an opportunity to see a brand new Bible, the Inside Column
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.320]   Reference.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.320]   So, men, open up your boxes.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.000]   Wow, it's like Christmas morning, like a little kid.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Wow.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.040]   I'll beat you, guys, I'll beat you.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.960]   Were you that kid in Christmas?
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.960]   Yes.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.960]   Yes.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.960]   Yes.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.960]   Wow.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.520]   Can I rip this?
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.640]   You can slide it off, you can rip it.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.880]   This is the first full reference edition of the Legacy Standard Bible.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.880]   That is nice.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.880]   Yeah.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.880]   Always well-packaged, too.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.880]   Oh, my.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.360]   And for a guy my age, 39 years plus, it's a good-sized font.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.400]   Also, even the references are in a good size.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:28.040]   I have another reference Bible, remained unnamed as to what version it is, but I can't read
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.280]   the Scripture references in it.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.000]   And this, not only the text itself, but the references are readable.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.760]   I always tell young guys preparing for ministry, "Get a Bible with larger font so when you
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.000]   make your notes, you can use it when you get older."
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.040]   A lot of guys have these like little tiny Bibles with that eight-point font.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.240]   It's like, there'll be a day when you're going to need those.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.040]   My initial reaction also is that it's a good preaching Bible, you know, it can be on the
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.120]   pulpit with you, and I like that.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.720]   Preaching or teaching from it publicly, you can see it, yeah, I like it.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.560]   Yeah, and I appreciate an emphasis on the text, and I think that's one of the beauties
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.480]   of the inside column reference, which is that the references are toward the bend of the
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.240]   page, toward the inner side, so that the text stands out.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:33.800]   It's the main thing as it ought to be, and then if you want to refer, you go to the inner
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.400]   part of the column, but always what's on the flat of the page is the text of Scripture.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.520]   Sometimes they put references on the outside margin, and so now the text of Scripture has
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:53.600]   to bend into the gutter of the page, and so you're kind of straining to see the main thing,
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.160]   even though what is the secondary aspect, which is still important, but secondary to
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.100]   the text, of course, is actually featured.
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:08.240]   So this is handy in that regard, and it's also handy that the references are spliced
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.480]   between, I think it says cross-references at the top, and then on the bottom, any translators'
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.720]   footnotes, which is handy to kind of go back and forth between and quickly find the kind
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.260]   of information you want to refer people to, or you're looking for.
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.640]   So this edition, man, actually represents more of your work.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.640]   Oh, really?
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.100]   So it's not just the translation, but you gentlemen also worked on culling through the
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:42.520]   footnotes and such from the original NAS, the 95 and the 77, and so as part of your
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.480]   translation process, can you give us a few insights on how you handled that part of the
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.020]   process?
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.920]   Notes are very important.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.840]   I remember when we first started talking about dealing with the footnotes, and in my heart
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.980]   I thought, well, the text itself is the most important, which is true, and the text itself
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.640]   is what we're going to focus on, which is true, and we don't have to concentrate at
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.640]   all on the footnotes.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.400]   We'll just let them be because we're under strict deadlines.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.040]   Well, that thought, that last thought was false.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.700]   It really is important for several reasons, at least off the top of my head.
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.240]   One is because people really use the notes.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.240]   They really do, and I think that's wonderful.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.480]   I think it's wonderful that you have brothers and sisters in Christ who love the Word of
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.180]   God so much, and they want to know it so well that they care about those notes.
[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.960]   It's something, it's a tool for them, just like a translation is a tool.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.240]   This is an added layer on that.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.360]   Second, it's not just a tool for them, it's a tool for us.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.920]   That's what I think I soon realized, which was whenever we came to a quandary where we
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:05.640]   didn't know exactly how to solve, sometimes the note actually provided the solution to
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.140]   our question.
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.800]   If we thought, oh, how do you say this and refer to that?
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.240]   How do you mediate between the fact of you want consistency but there's this wordplay
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.400]   here and how do you make it all work together?
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.960]   Well, the footnote could be a really important solution to that.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.760]   And then on top of all that, as soon as you made those solutions you realize, and that's
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.640]   going to help the reader study in the end.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.120]   So you're building on what they wanted the footnotes to be, and you're taking it to a
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.780]   new level where it's not just about, okay, what does this literally say or an explanatory
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:49.280]   note or explaining measurements or the like, but it's on top of all that giving new ideas
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.880]   where they say, oh, okay, so this word is the same one as this other word in this other
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.880]   passage.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.600]   And if the translators are telling me that I should cross-reference there, maybe there's
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.880]   an important connection that they're hinting at that I need to find, and all of that's
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:13.320]   embedded in the notes on top of other kinds of footnotes that we introduced into the Legacy
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.840]   Standard Bible.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:21.920]   For example, whenever the New Testament deliberately is translating the Old, and you have Kyrios,
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.920]   Lord, translating Yahweh, since now we have in the Old Testament the Tetragrammaton translated
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:34.160]   as the name of God explicitly, we wanted to show the connections between the two, and
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.040]   the footnotes became part of that process.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:43.680]   So there's a lot of helpful resources in these footnotes, and they're a helpful tool for
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:51.040]   us to communicate what we're trying to get across and sometimes mediate solutions within
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.040]   the translation.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.960]   Yeah, it was an important thing.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:01.320]   - Yeah, I think just going off the same concept there, one of the most common questions I
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:09.560]   think I received and I noticed even in social media is how we were going to translate Lord
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.560]   in the New Testament.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.840]   What are we going to do, Yahweh?
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:18.560]   And I think that really does help when you have a footnote that says in the Old Testament
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:25.260]   Yahweh used, for instance, Matthew 22, "The Lord said to my Lord," and we have footnoted
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:30.320]   the first Lord and indicated that's Yahweh to help the reader understand that the Old
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.480]   Testament context makes that distinction.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.920]   And I think it helps people, and sometimes too it eases people like, "Okay, we're not
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.120]   going to just shove a word in there that's not really there, but we're going to help
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.880]   you make the connection back into another passage."
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:55.440]   - A tradition that we continued is something that new users of the LSB, and not in the
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:03.200]   NASB tradition, you know, they see in the New Testament the Old Testament quotes in
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:08.960]   capital letters and it's the first time that they've seen it and they like that.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.800]   You know, it's, boom, you know, call attention, there's a quotation from the Old Testament
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.800]   here.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:22.200]   And so that, putting it in all caps as we continued that tradition, that legacy, is
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:29.120]   a good one, and new users of the Bible have commented on that, how much they appreciate
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.120]   it.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:35.960]   - Yeah, I think of even in the Greek New Testaments that we use, whether it be in Nestle-Aland
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:42.960]   or UBS or whatnot, often Old Testament quotations, I think in UBS it's bolded, if my memory serves
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.240]   me right, and NA 27 I think is italicized or something like that.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:57.280]   So we're just mirroring in our translation what scholars and people who know Greek see
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:03.000]   in their Bibles, and that's kind of the whole idea of a window, which is what we see is
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.240]   what you see, and what you see is what we see.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.560]   And I can't, and I, you know, Jason and Dr. Varner are just across the hall from me at
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:19.240]   the Master's University, and we often comment as we look on social media, and people are
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.560]   saying, "Well, what about this, and how do you respond to that?"
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:28.240]   And it's often on Facebook, there's a Facebook group that's been very active and very encouraging.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.360]   I've been really thankful for those individuals in the Lord who have been interacting there.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.120]   And I often turn to both of them and say, "Man, the answer to that question, it's just
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.760]   in the footnote, and when they look at the footnote, it'll answer the question."
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.820]   And then I remember to myself, "Well, they don't have access to that wholly yet, at least
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.080]   at that time."
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:54.440]   And that's another beauty of these footnotes, is for people asking really good questions,
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.400]   questions that they ought to be asking, well, there's a reason why we put the footnote there,
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.160]   because that's a good question, and we anticipated it, and there is a good answer, and it's right
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.080]   there in the resource for them.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:11.100]   And I think this just helps connect back to one of the lines that we came up with for
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:16.200]   the LSB, that it's your translation for a lifetime of study.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:23.400]   And with 95,000 cross-references and 14,000 footnotes, there's a lot of studying that
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.480]   can be done in this edition.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:33.680]   So we're grateful that it's finally out now, and that people are really enjoying this specific
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.960]   edition of the LSB.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.800]   - And we should not neglect the physical beauty of this.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.800]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.800]   I was thinking that.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:48.720]   - Very well done, not only content, but something that's totally out of our hands, is the physical
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:54.960]   construction of the Bible, and it's a beautiful, visible piece of work.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.360]   - Yeah, the goatskin is just, it's fabulous.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.360]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.360]   I always like a good cover.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.440]   - And one of the things, too, when you, the reason the inside column is one of my favorite
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:12.560]   formats is that oftentimes your Bible won't lay flat unless, like, maybe you get a rebound
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.560]   or something like that.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:20.760]   But with this, like, it lays flat, and so you don't even have even the references kind of
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.320]   obscured because of that.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:29.280]   So it's almost like water, just the flow of it is a beautiful, beautiful Bible.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:36.040]   Not many versions of reference Bibles are inside column, from what I've observed.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.400]   A lot of them still have it on the outside, and that's fine.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:44.400]   It's not a sin, of course, but this is really useful, and I think, and I hope more Bibles
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.920]   imitate the style.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:57.440]   - Well, I just wanted to mention that there's been a timeline here of right now, it's January
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.360]   of 2023.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:06.000]   When the first complete edition of the LSB came out, it was October of 2021.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.480]   And so that doesn't seem like a lot of time has lapsed yet.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:14.440]   This is still a translation that people are discovering for the first time.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:20.800]   But if you can share some examples or stories of people that have began to read the LSB,
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:26.440]   whether it's in their personal study time or people that have incorporated it into their
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.440]   theories.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:37.280]   - Occasionally, we hear the general criticism, a literal translation does not read well.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.640]   It's too literal.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:46.360]   But I hear people saying, "You know, I've begun to use the Legacy Standard Bible, and
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.160]   it's readable.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.520]   And I enjoy reading it to the congregation."
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:58.400]   An essentially literal, or as we call it, formal equivalence theory of translation does
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:07.300]   not produce a woodenly literal, hard to read, hard for people in the pew to understand version.
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:15.000]   So I'm hearing far more positive responses in that regard than I even expected.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.880]   It is readable, they say.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:21.440]   - Yeah, I remember it was really touching.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.080]   We all teach at the university.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:31.480]   And some of us, I don't, but I know some of us require the Legacy Standard Bible for class.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.680]   But I remember even students under peer pressure, they say, "Oh, you just got to get one.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.880]   You just got to get one," to their fellow student.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:44.520]   And an individual wrote me a note one day, stuck it in my box, and it was just so remarkable.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:49.600]   The person said, "Oh, for my whole life, I know I needed to read my Bible.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.120]   I always struggled.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:57.600]   I felt like I could never understand, just never could, just really, really struggled."
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.880]   And so this individual said when she arrived on campus, and people were talking about the
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.440]   Legacy Standard Bible, she just thought it was hype.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.480]   And I understand that sentiment for sure.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.800]   But then she said, "I bought one, and I started reading."
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:19.520]   And she said, "Whatever you did, I don't know what you did, but whatever you did, thank
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:26.360]   you, because for the first time, I really feel like I have a grasp on the text.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.920]   I understand what's going on."
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:36.480]   And I think there is this notion that when you are "woodenly literal" or "literal," and
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:43.280]   you have this equivalence between the text, there is a kind of clarity that that produces.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.340]   Because you're sensitive to, "This phrase is this kind of part of speech.
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.200]   This phrase is the main phrase.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.880]   We've got to make sure everything connects correctly and correlates correctly."
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.240]   And people know how to talk.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.760]   They know how a participle works, even if they don't know the part of speech off the
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.760]   top of their head.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.360]   They understand these things.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:08.720]   And when you sometimes flatten that out, it's just a bunch of ideas that don't seem to cohere
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.940]   together.
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:15.640]   But when you have the structure that the author wanted you to have, with the grammar that
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:20.520]   the author wanted you to have, things start to piece together the right way in people's
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.520]   minds.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.520]   And there's a clarity to that.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:27.600]   And I think that's what this dear sister was conveying, and she was just so moved by it
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:34.320]   that she took the time to write a card, which I thought was just really touching and really
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.280]   encouraging.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:43.480]   So I see the effect not only in pastors who come up to me and talk with me about it, and
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:48.960]   not only in adults in the pew who also are talking about their own devotional life, but
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.120]   even in our students.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.120]   And it's really precious.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.040]   - Yeah, I would agree.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:16:02.120]   Just a couple weeks ago, my wife and I led a trip to Turkey and Greece through the university.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:08.880]   And so we would go to all of these biblical locations and, you know, for instance, Mars
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:15.000]   Hill in Athens, or at Corinth, or those kinds of places.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.720]   And each stop, we offered the opportunity for people to have had memorized and quote
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.480]   Scripture on site.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:30.800]   And so it was really fun to be in the Ephesian Theater and have a student quote the whole
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.480]   first chapter of Ephesians in the LSB.
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:39.880]   And so when I looked on, because we, you know, for a couple months ahead, we've prepared
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.680]   and had people sign up, not just students, but people who went on the trip.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:49.480]   And I would say a good portion of them did the LSB, not because they had to, but because
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.480]   they wanted to.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:59.560]   And it was really fun to see them on site, on location, quoting the LSB, and then talking
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:05.160]   with them afterwards as they've kind of memorized and things were really starting to piece together.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.160]   They would see the structure and things like that.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:13.180]   And it was just really fun to see that, and also encouraging that it's not just a good
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:20.240]   resource to read, but even the memorization, those things that the text points out were
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.440]   key things that they thought about even after.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.820]   - Fantastic.
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:34.120]   One other point that this discussion reminds me of is that you all are also preachers.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:40.080]   You're also preparing your own sermons to exposit publicly.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:46.040]   And so in your own personal study time as you're preparing those messages, can you tie
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:54.800]   the idea of the LSB being a window and how that actually helps you in your sermon preparation?
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:59.640]   - Well, Chris, it was not a sermon preparation, but I'm looking forward to preaching on this
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.760]   someday, but it was preparation for class.
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:09.200]   I've taught the book of Judges for many years and people are familiar with the sad theme
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:15.240]   text at the end, "And there was no king in Israel, everyone did that which was right
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.000]   in his own eyes."
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.540]   And many translations do it that way.
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:29.780]   But as I'm reading about Samson, I'm excited to point out to my students that when Samson
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:35.340]   was looking for a Philistine girl and he found one and his parents were not excited about
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:42.260]   this, he said, "Get her for me because she is right in my eyes."
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:50.140]   The exact same expression that is used of the general problem of the book of Judges,
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.460]   people were doing right in their own eyes.
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:19:00.280]   And it jumped out at me because most translate, most versions will say something like, "She
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.100]   looks good to me."
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:08.380]   And that's the idea, but if you miss it, that he's saying, "She's right in my eyes," you
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:16.860]   might miss the connection that he's sort of like exhibit A of the book of Judges.
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:22.460]   She's doing, I don't care what Yahweh says, she's right in my eyes and I'm the standard
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:26.780]   and he becomes sort of like a prime example in the book of Judges.
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:31.180]   And then of course when you see that, that it was a Philistine girl that was right in
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:36.120]   his own eyes, he's captured by the Philistines and guess what the Philistines do?
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.680]   They put out his eyes.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:44.140]   So there, this whole connection in the latter part of the book between doing what is right
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:51.660]   in my eyes, and who cares what Yahweh says, but also he loses his eyes.
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:59.860]   It's sort of like a sad irony that is brought out and strangely most versions don't translate
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.440]   it consistently.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.860]   Thank you for that example.
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:09.140]   This isn't necessarily again in sermon preparation, although I can talk about that as well, but
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:16.220]   even this past Sunday the preacher was preaching on Psalm 12, and this kind of ties in a discussion
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:21.940]   we had on footnotes with the window concept of the Legacy Standard Bible.
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:25.740]   And Psalm 12 begins with the phrase, "Save Yahweh."
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:32.460]   It's a very short prayer to the point because of the desperation of the psalmist.
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:40.300]   And then later on in the same psalm, Yahweh says, "Now I will set him on high, and I will
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:46.420]   give him, and I will put him in," the safety is often how it's translated.
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:53.380]   But there's a good footnote in the LSB that says, literally, "Salvation," cross-reference
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:21:00.220]   Psalm 12, 1, and the idea is, "Hey, this word is the word salvation.
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.860]   Go back to Psalm 12, 1.
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:02.860]   Read it.
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:03.860]   Save Yahweh."
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:08.100]   Oh, the psalmist prayed, "Save me."
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.460]   He didn't even pray, "Save me."
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:13.220]   He didn't even have the pronominal suffix there, he just said, "Save."
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:17.340]   So desperate, and Yahweh says, "And I'll give him that salvation.
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.340]   I'll give it to him."
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:26.300]   And so there is this very precise and deliberate answer to prayer in the nick of time.
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:30.220]   Now Yahweh will do this at God's perfect timing.
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:37.100]   He will answer, and according to His own promises, in the way that is best, in the way that we
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.460]   need.
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:46.140]   And there's an example of window back into the text, good footnote there to help make
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:50.380]   the connection established, and it's all right in your Bible.
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:57.060]   As we went through verse by verse through the Bible, these are all the connections and
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:00.420]   the issues that we were working through, and we left that behind.
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.900]   I think often we've all said, "Oh, I'm so glad we made that decision."
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:11.220]   We sometimes forget what we did, and we discovered and we thought, "Wow, that's nice.
[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.660]   I'm so glad we caught that.
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.020]   How did we catch that?"
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:20.540]   And it's a blessing working on commentary or in class.
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:27.180]   Sometimes you have to talk about a serious, very somber doctrine like hell, and it's in
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:31.500]   the Scriptures, and it's even lexically there by the Word.
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:37.860]   And a good example of that is in Isaiah 66, it talks about the worm will never be, fire
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:42.380]   will never be quenched, worm will never be satisfied, and they will endure everlasting
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:43.380]   reproach.
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:49.620]   Well, that word often translated "reproach" or "derision" or however you'd like to translate
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:55.900]   it, is a very unique Hebrew word, and it's only found elsewhere in Daniel 12 too, which
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.940]   also talks about there will be a resurrection for those unto eternal life and another resurrection
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:04.580]   for those under everlasting reproach, same word.
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:09.300]   And we wanted to make sure that those were translated the same way, and the students
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:16.660]   seeing, "Oh, it's consistently translated, oh, it's the same word," they start to realize
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:23.580]   as weighty as this doctrine is and as real as it is, it's not just something made up
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:27.940]   by scholars later or people who want to guilt people into salvation.
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:33.500]   This was consciously developed and expounded upon by the writers of Scripture from Old
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.260]   Testament to New Testament.
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:39.980]   And just consistency like that, that's very, very helpful.
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:50.740]   I think for me, I think of Philippians 2.11, after this amazing theological kind of unpacking
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:56.860]   of the personal work of Christ, you have verse 11, "And every tongue will confess that Jesus
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:03.300]   Christ is Lord," and we've capitalized some things to help the reader go back to the Old
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.500]   Testament.
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:10.340]   And I think as we do that, there's some like aha moments that happen.
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:16.340]   If you go back to that quote, it's Isaiah 45, and Isaiah 45, it's interesting, the whole
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:22.580]   context is about the exclusivity of Yahweh, that Yahweh is the only one.
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:27.460]   Verse 5, "I am Yahweh, there is no other besides me, there is no God."
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:33.420]   You have verse 6, "There is no one besides me, I am Yahweh, there is no other."
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:37.860]   You have in verse 18, "I am Yahweh, there is none."
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:45.320]   And it just keeps going on and on in chapter 45 until you get to this idea of, "Turn to
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:49.700]   me and be saved, all the ends of the earth," in verse 22, "For I am God and there is no
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:50.700]   other.
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:54.940]   I'm sworn by myself, the word has gone forth from my mouth in righteousness and will not
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:55.940]   turn back.
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:25:00.380]   That to me, every knee will bow and every tongue will swear allegiance that will say
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:03.740]   of me, 'Only in Yahweh are righteousness and strength.'"
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:08.860]   And when you come back to Philippians chapter 2, verse 11, "Every tongue will confess that
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:15.380]   Jesus Christ is Lord," L-O-R-D, with a footnote that says, "In the Old Testament, Yahweh."
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:21.780]   And it just shows the exclusivity of Christ, His deity, like He's already talked about
[00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:30.120]   it, and He does the exclamation point by referencing Isaiah 45, "There is no one but God."
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:37.220]   And yet, making that sweet connection of Jesus Christ is God.
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:45.020]   And I think that's a really sweet reminder that even when you see an Old Testament quote,
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.740]   it's not there just for you to go back to the one little verse that it quotes, but the
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:54.380]   whole context is in the mind of the writer, and it helps us to go back and kind of make
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:57.980]   those connections.
[00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.980]   - All of Scripture is such an amazing tapestry.
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:07.520]   And so just hearing these examples from you men just reminds me of that.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:15.460]   And the uniqueness of the format helps give that clue to the reader that there are those
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:16.620]   connections.
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:23.140]   When you read the New Testament, there's connections frequently drawing back to the Old Testament.
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:28.200]   And it's not always just in the footnotes or cross-references, but it's also in the
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:33.520]   layout, the way the Old Testament quotations are formatted.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.800]   So very helpful.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.760]   Thank you, men.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:45.100]   Well, gentlemen, the next question that I'd like to pose to all of you is, "Minor refinements
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.100]   to the text of the LSB."
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.120]   Can you expound upon that a bit?
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.880]   - Yeah, I'll tell a funny story first.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:27:00.720]   When we were translating, I used to have nightmares whenever I got a little bit of a nap that
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.240]   there were these horrendous errors in our translation.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:09.360]   And Dr. MacArthur was holding the violin saying, "What were you thinking?
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.480]   How does this happen?"
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:16.640]   And so we truly, and then I'd wake up and check and everything was fine.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:25.040]   But we truly labored as hard as we could to prevent errors, to prevent mistakes, to prevent
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.420]   typographical issues from creeping into the text.
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:32.800]   But of course, we are people, and what happens if those things happen?
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.680]   Well, you make corrections.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:41.160]   And I think just like everything we've tried to do is principally based, there were some
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:46.560]   principles about changing or making revisions, even minor revisions to the text.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:52.840]   One was we were committed to making those that could be substantiated.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:57.480]   In other words, you don't just change a text because of preference, and we've never done
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.480]   that.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.760]   And we won't do that, and we didn't do that even in the minor revisions.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:08.600]   The vast, vast majority of them, and there's only, yeah, I think just a few dozen compared
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:12.480]   to a lot of translations that do hundreds of revisions.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:19.880]   But the vast majority of those few dozen are typographical, add a comma, formatting issues
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:26.400]   where this should have been italicized but wasn't italicized, and that's because computer
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.960]   code was mistyped and such, and so we needed to go back and do that.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.720]   The vast majority are typographical.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:39.920]   There's a subset of minor refinements I can think of maybe out of the few dozen, maybe
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.760]   three to four, that are all actually related.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:48.160]   They deal with the issue of defilement and uncleanness in the book of Leviticus.
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.520]   And you say, "Why did that happen?"
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:56.480]   Well, the files that were syncing with the server, they're big files.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:01.200]   I wish Joe was here because I think he burned through several computers just trying to do
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:07.080]   this translation because they take forever to load, and then they take forever to save.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:12.600]   So I wouldn't turn on autosave, and you just hit Control-S, and then you leave your computer
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.840]   to take a nap and have a nightmare.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:19.000]   And then you come back, and by that time, hopefully, the file is saved.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.120]   But what can happen in that process is corruption, or a kind of corruption where certain kinds
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.200]   of changes weren't saved.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:34.560]   And those words were marked to be changed in our notes a certain way, and the file got
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.560]   corrupted.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.240]   And so someone lovingly pointed out, "Wait, this doesn't make any sense.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.560]   What happened here?"
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.520]   And Joe and I are looking at it and thinking, "What did happen?
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.360]   This was supposed to be changed."
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:49.800]   And when we went into the computer logs, we realized there was an error in the file save.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:54.800]   And so what should have been there wasn't there, and so we needed to make that correction.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:30:01.920]   And we've been noticing some things like that all along the way, but the changes we make
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:07.600]   are minor in the sense that the majority are these typographical errors.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:12.960]   And most people wouldn't even notice the change because they're so subtle.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.280]   But that leads to a second principle, which is transparency.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:21.240]   One of the things we really pressed for was to say to the reader, "Hey, these are the
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.760]   changes made so that everyone can be on the same page."
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:29.600]   Now, I know for a publisher, that can be a total nightmare.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.400]   And really, all it takes is a pencil, and you just kind of make the edit.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.760]   And it's kind of nice.
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:38.920]   You get this idiosyncratic edition, which has these issues.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.120]   And you can say, "I was one of those."
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.440]   And it's a real first edition.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.440]   How do you know it's a real first edition?
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.000]   Because it has these unique features, let's just put it that way.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:55.280]   And so it was our goal to have things principally based, to make sure things were as consistent
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.280]   as possible.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.360]   Any change always had a rationale.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.120]   Most of them were typographical.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:05.640]   A lot of them also were technologically related.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.480]   And then we wanted to be transparent with it.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.440]   And we've kept it to a minimum.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:15.280]   Sometimes, some people say, "Hey, I noticed this issue.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:19.040]   How do you-- can you just insert x here?"
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.600]   And the answer is, probably not.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.720]   We're not going to do that.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.880]   But what we can do-- and this is where our earlier conversation about footnotes comes
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:35.400]   into play-- that's an amazing tool, where we can accommodate observations readers and
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:41.980]   others have made into the coordination of the text by virtue of a footnote.
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:48.120]   And so there's a lot of tools at our disposal to resolve issues that come up, but still
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:53.580]   guarantee the stability of the text, so that people say, "My text isn't changing.
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:54.580]   It's not changing.
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:56.200]   It's going to endure the test of time.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.200]   And it's totally fine."
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:02.080]   Thank you for that.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:07.480]   As we move into this next portion of our segment today, we're actually going to cover some
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:14.760]   questions that came to us through users and such through our LSB website.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:21.200]   And so your explanation, I think, dovetails into the question that came through about
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:29.800]   the word "baby" in the original Greek and how, in some places, it's translated differently.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:35.360]   And so it appears to some that that is a break of the rule of consistency.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:41.920]   So if you could, gentlemen, just expand upon what you went through translating those places
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.680]   where the word "baby" is used.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.680]   Well, I can.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:51.520]   I'm happy to jump in there with brephos, I think, is the Greek term.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.400]   And there's several things involved.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:59.760]   I think, first, consistency does not mean-- let's put it this way-- consistency does not
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:07.180]   mean that you translate the same word always, no matter what.
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:13.920]   We recognize that every word in Greek or Hebrew or English, it has nuances.
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:16.520]   It has different usages.
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:23.080]   And so it would be inappropriate to translate a certain word the same way when it doesn't
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:28.920]   match what we might call the semantic tree or the different usages of a term.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:34.000]   For example, in English, if we use the word "dust," we say, yeah, what's dust?
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.640]   Oh, that's the dirt on the table.
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.640]   OK.
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.960]   So when you dust your home, what do you do?
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:43.000]   Well, that's when you remove the dust.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.040]   Oh, OK.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:47.120]   So when it's a verb, it's always removing dust.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.120]   So what's a crop duster?
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.280]   Is it an aerial vacuum?
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.320]   No.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:57.880]   It's something that actually spreads fertilizer or whatever, nutrients on plants and such.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:03.600]   And while in English, the word "dust" can carry all three of those nuances, no problems.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.800]   But if you were translating it into a different language, you might have to use different
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:14.480]   words because language transfers differently between the target language and the receptor
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.480]   language.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.720]   We understand those tensions.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:20.960]   And so when we wanted consistency, at bare minimum, if we could find one word that got
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.200]   it all, hey, praise the Lord for that.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:28.440]   But bare minimum, we needed consistency between and within nuances.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:33.240]   And with the term "brefos," there's a lot of different dynamics with that.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:36.480]   There's when it has the article and when it doesn't.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.840]   There's when it's used in idiom and when it's used not.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:47.720]   And we had to account for all of that so that when, say, you're talking about the baby that
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:56.120]   is brought to Simeon and Anna in Luke versus the infant, which is translating a Hebrew
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:02.160]   word in the New Testament quotation of the Old, versus an idiom where it's talking about
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:06.060]   from childhood, you knew the Scriptures.
[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:10.960]   We had to differentiate each of those ideas.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:17.540]   And that's because we're consistency relative to nuance, not just rote consistency of every
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:22.260]   single word, every single time, no difference whatsoever.
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:26.000]   And there's a lot of examples of this.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.920]   One of them is, "Work out your salvation with fear and trembling."
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:35.980]   Well, that's one translation of the word "kaergatzo," but there is another nuance where it's being
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:40.320]   "worked out within yourself" as opposed to working something out.
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:45.360]   And we had to translate it differently, otherwise the translation wouldn't make any sense and
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.620]   would give the wrong impression.
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:52.120]   And these are examples of every word has nuances.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:56.680]   They have kind of major categories, and we try to be consistent relative to the major
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:57.680]   categories.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:03.080]   Sometimes, and oftentimes, a dictionary like BDAG or whatnot, they'll delineate those categories
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:10.280]   for us so that we can keep things straight, but sometimes we had to kind of delineate
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.280]   it.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:17.280]   A good example in Hebrew would be "relent" versus "regret."
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:21.860]   You know, the Lord "relented" doing this, or the Lord "regretted" doing something.
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:23.340]   Why do we do these different things?
[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:30.300]   Because "relenting" is when you are restraining that which is in process.
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:35.300]   "Regretting" is what happens after the thing is done.
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:39.660]   You can't say, "Oh, the Lord regretted doing this, and so it stopped."
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:43.580]   Well, no, then that doesn't make any sense because you only regret things that have already
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:44.580]   happened.
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.740]   And we have limitations like that in English.
[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.380]   They didn't have it in Hebrew.
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.140]   Good for them, but we do.
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:52.140]   And so we just had to figure out solutions.
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:58.660]   And so even then, "relent," "regret," we try to make them sound pretty similar so that
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:02.300]   it kind of rolls off the tongue and such, and we kept it consistent.
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:07.220]   And by the way, just for people who are wondering, does that imply that God can have regrets
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.900]   or God can change His mind?
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:15.220]   No, because in 1 Samuel 15, it explicitly says, "The Lord does not regret," using that
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:16.580]   same word.
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:21.860]   And so by having consistency of translation, and even sometimes a footnote that points
[00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:26.740]   people back to 1 Samuel 15, people can see the theology that's happening there.
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:33.060]   - Chris, you know, to follow up, and in case people didn't quite get that on "brephos,"
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:38.940]   the Greek word "brephos" can refer to a little one in the womb, it can refer to a little
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:45.620]   one in a manger that's born, and it can refer to a very young child.
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:51.980]   So we have to be, you know, so from a child in the womb, you have known the Holy Scriptures?
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:52.980]   No.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:56.420]   From an infant, you know, no, no, they don't.
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:59.100]   But from a young child.
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:04.820]   So depending on the context, that it's a young child that would know the Holy Scriptures,
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.460]   not an infant in the womb.
[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:13.300]   So we're still paying attention to context, which oftentimes really helps us to define
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.420]   the word more accurately.
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:21.700]   - And the last thing you want, if you're trying to articulate the author's intent and what
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:30.860]   he was saying, is to misrepresent it by taking a word that he used out of context, because
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:32.300]   in the name of consistency.
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:39.360]   So consistency, I know, has been a big emphasis that we have, but that's not in exclusion
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.860]   of context and other linguistic factors.
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:47.540]   And they all have to play together to get us a conclusion.
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.680]   - Very good.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:55.620]   Another question that came through the LSB website is regarding the name Yahweh in the
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:58.500]   Old Testament that was chosen.
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:06.900]   But why were other names of God not translated, such as Elohim and Adonai?
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:14.700]   - Yeah, when you think about Elohim or Adonai, they're not just names, they're titles.
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:21.280]   And that's a big distinction of why you transliterate one and not the other.
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:28.380]   When we talk about King Nebuchadnezzar, we don't say Melech Nebuchadnezzar, because Melech
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:29.380]   means king.
[00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:30.900]   It's a title.
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:36.620]   And when we say, "Oh, Elijah's a prophet," we don't say Elijah Navi.
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:37.660]   We don't say that.
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:38.660]   It's not necessary.
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:46.060]   In any case, we don't need to do that because the title represents a role.
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:51.860]   Even though that title is ascribed to somebody in a very formal way, it's still a title that
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:57.180]   conveys an office, a role, a status.
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:05.060]   And so with Elohim and Adonai, they are titles, which accentuates this, that Yahweh is God's
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:06.860]   name.
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:09.700]   It's not His title.
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.700]   It's His personal name.
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:21.460]   You know, we might, Chris, call you Mr. Vice President, yes, but that's no substitute for
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.220]   your name.
[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.300]   And we understand the difference between the two.
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:30.660]   And when we want to address you as a person, as someone we care about, we would use your
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:32.340]   name.
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.780]   And that's the treasure that the Lord has given to us.
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:39.060]   He says, "My name is Yahweh.
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:41.660]   I don't just give you titles to worship Me.
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:49.140]   Amen to that, and we ought to, but I've also given you My name because I love you and because
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:51.180]   you're to love Me."
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:57.380]   And when it says, "They will call Him by name," they weren't just saying, "Call Him by title."
[00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:00.180]   They were saying, "Call Him by His name."
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:02.060]   What an amazing God to do that.
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:07.660]   Now, other gods can be called Elohim, and it's possible that other gods can be called
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:12.860]   Adon because it means "master," but other gods are not called Yahweh.
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:16.220]   And that is why we wanted to make that special and unique.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:20.060]   "This is My name," He says.
[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:26.740]   So where do you stop if you start translating every, or transliterating every single one
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:27.740]   of those?
[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:33.060]   We stopped at the point that, as you said, Abner, others are titles that could even be
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:37.860]   applied to pagan gods, Yahweh is unique.
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:45.980]   And that's what I think people, generally speaking, I've run into very little opposition.
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:47.180]   Maybe there are some out there.
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.420]   There will always be some out there.
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:55.280]   So okay, then maybe this Bible's not for you if you're that opposed to using Yahweh.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:42:02.780]   But generally speaking, I one time referred to it, to Dr. MacArthur, as a shock value.
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.420]   I'm reading it as Yahweh, and it shocks me.
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:09.380]   Well, maybe it's a good shock because it reminds me, oh.
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:17.180]   And also, does every English Bible reader always see capital L, capital O, capital R,
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:22.220]   capital D, and distinguish it from capital L, small o-r-d?
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.900]   Sometimes that flies past them.
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:33.000]   They may not recognize that, as Bibles do, English Bibles do, four capitals means Yahweh.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.220]   But not every Bible reader picks up on that.
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:38.860]   Let me tell you, you pick up on it when it says Yahweh is my shepherd.
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:39.860]   Absolutely.
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:46.040]   Even in Hebrew, we were trained, when we saw the Tetragrammaton, to read Adonai.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:53.300]   And so, Joe and I were even commenting, because of that training, and that's been decades
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:57.540]   of training, when we read, we just say Adonai.
[00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:04.940]   We don't even think to stop and meditate on, no, no, no, that's not Adonai, that is Yahweh.
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:10.740]   And so, where we're really confronted with that is when we read the English, ironically,
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:15.220]   because we kind of dulled ourselves to these realities inadvertently when we were reading
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:17.240]   the Hebrew.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:24.480]   And it not only accentuates the usage of Yahweh, it accentuates every time Adon or other terms
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.560]   are used, too, because now you don't confuse it.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:32.160]   I remember in Zechariah, as well as Daniel 1, we're writing some commentary, maybe more
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.360]   on that in a little bit, on it.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:38.360]   And I said, "Oh, yeah, the Lord handed them over."
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:42.720]   And I thought, "Oh, I better check if this is Yahweh or if this is Adonai."
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:49.000]   And then I laughed at myself, and I thought, "I know it can't be Yahweh, because it doesn't
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.480]   say Yahweh in the text, in the English text, it says Lord."
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:57.320]   And I realized at that moment, that actually tells you the theology.
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:02.780]   Daniel could have said Yahweh, amen, if he said Yahweh, but he said, "The Lord handed
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:04.040]   Israel over."
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.040]   Why?
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:10.680]   Because this is Adon, this is Adonai, this is the master, this is the true sovereign.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.960]   It was not the power of Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:16.040]   It was not the king of Jehoiakim.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.280]   It was not him.
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:21.880]   It was the Lord, the one who possesses all authority.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.480]   That's who was sovereign in that moment.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:28.520]   There are many kings in human nations, but there is one Lord.
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:35.400]   And that is brought forth when you are able to make sure you can distinguish between names
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.520]   and titles.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:44.180]   - Very good, well, another question that came to us is a question that we see come
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:48.900]   through fairly regularly, probably a few times every month.
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:56.740]   And the question goes something like this, "You gentlemen are all from the same school,
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:04.920]   so is there any Calvinism imported into this translation?"
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:16.480]   Only if the Greek words and the Hebrew words convey a high view of salvation.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:22.760]   I prefer that over Calvinism because I don't think Bible writers knew about Calvinism.
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:31.360]   But if the original languages communicated a sovereign view of election, did we communicate
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.760]   it?
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:39.040]   I guarantee you, I was not thinking, "Well, I hope I translate this as a Calvinist, or
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.920]   I hope my Calvinist friends will like this."
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:47.340]   I was just committed to translating what the Hebrew and Greek said.
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:51.600]   So I'm sure my colleagues were like that too.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.600]   - Were you like that?
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:53.600]   - Yes, of course.
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:46:03.520]   I think it goes back to being men of principle and having a principle that we want to reflect
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:09.360]   the text, be a window into the text and not a window into a theological system.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:16.040]   And if the text moves a certain way, then that's where we want to...and I think anybody
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:20.880]   that is a believer wants to go where the text goes.
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:27.560]   And so I think having a window into the text, into what the author's intent was and is,
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:34.920]   really helps dispel any myth of, "Oh, Calvinism, dispensationalism," or any of the other isms
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.840]   that could be there.
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:47.840]   I think we want to show what the Bible says and then let the text help build a theology.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:54.560]   - I think there's a fundamental theological commitment, which is you don't win theological
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:59.120]   arguments by translation.
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:00.660]   That's frankly cheating.
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:07.640]   That's what the cults do, is they translate something a certain way to prove their point.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:13.360]   But then you haven't won the theological argument because it's not the author who has said this,
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.480]   it's you, the translator, you've made that point.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:21.640]   Well, that's pretty convenient, but that's not the truth, because that's a layer you
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:28.160]   inserted on top of the Scriptures as opposed to letting the Scriptures speak.
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:35.920]   So my theological convictions, they don't require, I hope they don't require me to rig
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.080]   the results.
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.080]   That's not necessary.
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:44.320]   They stand or fall, and they ought to stand or fall based upon the standard of Scripture
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.400]   and what was originally articulated.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.080]   And that's our commitment.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:50.720]   And you can even see it.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.400]   People are saying, "First Corinthians, you're a cessationist.
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:57.160]   You guys are not charismatics, and so you shouldn't translate it as tongues."
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.160]   Well, we translate it as tongues.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.160]   Why?
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:00.160]   Because the word is tongues.
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.160]   - Glossa.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.160]   - Yeah.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.160]   - It's tongue.
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:09.920]   - It means your tongue, and in Hebrew, lashon, is tongue.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:14.300]   That's what you have to translate it, and in fact, there's even word plays made.
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:20.240]   Even in Acts, you saw a shape of a tongue in fire, and then they spoke in tongues.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.080]   Well, there's a correlation that needs to be made.
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:26.440]   If you translated one language and the other tongue, you break the consistency principle.
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:30.600]   And so we translated what is there.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:35.440]   That's always been the principle, and the linguistic decisions are based upon exactly
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.720]   that, linguistic decisions.
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:41.880]   When this plus this plus this, it's pretty mathematical.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:45.800]   It'll get you this, and that's how we did it.
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:52.600]   And so I understand people's concern, "Oh, are you going to infuse your theology into
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:53.600]   the text?"
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:49:03.040]   No, no, it's a commitment to the principle of what is said should be transferred over,
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:06.360]   and the theology derives from that.
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:13.000]   And if our theology has to rig the results, then it's a wrong theology.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:20.080]   - You brought up an important point about how you all had certain principles in the
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:21.800]   translation process.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:28.560]   Now, as part of this, and the men that were chosen, can you explain a little bit about
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:35.760]   the doctrine of inerrancy and why it was important for each man that was participating in the
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:40.040]   work being done held to that doctrine?
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:44.280]   - I'm thinking of all Scripture is breathed out by God.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:47.800]   That is a high view of Scripture.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:54.240]   It can be translated all Scripture is inspired by God, but the literal meaning of the word
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:58.640]   is all Scripture is God-breathed.
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:07.240]   That certainly supports our view of inerrancy, because if God breathed out those words upon
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:10.080]   the writers, obviously they were true.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:18.920]   So I think that there is an evidence, not that we forced the meaning on that, Theopneustos
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:23.660]   literally means that, God-breathed, and we brought that out.
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:25.520]   Does that support a high view of Scripture?
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:34.320]   Yes it does, but it still is a literal translation that supports the high view of Scripture.
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.980]   We didn't force the meaning onto that.
[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:43.760]   We simply tried to bring out the meaning that Scripture is God-breathed, 2 Timothy 3:16.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:52.000]   - And even part of inerrancy deals with the level of truthfulness of Scripture, that it
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:59.840]   is truthful to every word, not just what results in your life is true, or not just its ideas
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:09.180]   are true, but every word, every proposition, every claim, and every detail that it stipulates
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:17.360]   is true, and Joshua says at the end of the book, "Not one good word of all the good words
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:20.520]   that God spoke failed."
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:25.960]   Can we remember that truth and say that's why words matter?
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:34.760]   Yeah, if we didn't believe that the words mattered, only the ideas or the results mattered,
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:38.800]   then yes, translation would be dramatically different.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:44.320]   We could just kind of gloss over and give a summary of what was going on in the Bible.
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:51.360]   But the reason translation exists is because people believed, and the Scripture asserts,
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:59.320]   that every word of it are pure words refined seven times beyond gold and silver, and that's
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:04.080]   what we carried here, and so that is part of our translation philosophy.
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:10.360]   It's embedded in that, and without really having a strong conviction on inerrancy, yeah,
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:17.640]   the rigor of, shall we say, of the word-for-word formal equivalent window translation, it would
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:18.640]   change.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:19.640]   It would change.
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:28.420]   Yeah, all the words matter and are inspired, and every word, and even down to the singular
[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:34.840]   plural usage when it comes down to Galatians 3 and the fact that Paul talks about and his
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:45.200]   seed singular, and so when you come to the text and a window into the text, it's even
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:53.640]   something as precise as plural versus singular.
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:57.200]   Another question that came up is about a specific word.
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:04.200]   We know that one of the things that was used in the LSB is the word doulos.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.520]   The Greek word is translated as "slave."
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:16.400]   Somebody asked the question, "Well, the verb of that, doulo, I believe, why was that not
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:17.400]   translated?"
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:20.320]   Yeah, a great question.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:30.160]   When it comes to just the dual root, right, you have doulo and doulo.
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:36.680]   One is causative, right, to enslave, and that was across the board.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:43.580]   And then you have the doulo that oftentimes was translated to serve because the first
[00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:51.320]   term deals with the idea of enslavement, the causation of slavery.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:58.860]   The second term is the product of a slave, what does he do, the result of that serving.
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:03.740]   And even within the usage of that, because we want to be consistent and we want to make
[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:10.940]   sure that we're attentive to the linguistic details, there are sometimes within the doulo
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:16.740]   where it is translated as "enslave" for a couple of reasons.
[00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:25.260]   One is the perfect tense of doulo because it's talking about a state of type of idea.
[00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:33.540]   Another is the wordplay of "master/slave" and when "slave" is used to bring that out.
[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:40.980]   And so you have like several different kind of features of that, like a master type of
[00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:44.140]   idea with that wordplay.
[00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:50.540]   But then you also have concepts that are enslaving, like "sin" or things like that.
[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:59.460]   And so those were kind of the contextual factors that lean towards shaping how it was translated
[00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:03.620]   because they're linguistically driven, not necessarily, "Well, we like this and this
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:08.660]   and this sounds pretty in this way and oh, this, you know, you know, I prefer this kind
[00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:09.660]   of a thing."
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:18.460]   It's that term in particular is usually translated as "serve/serving."
[00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:24.020]   But when there were contextual factors, perfect tense or masters or a wordplay, we wanted
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:30.860]   to make sure that our choices were linguistically driven because the author is making that.
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:35.740]   So again, we want to be a window into the text, so the author is choosing a specific
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:37.820]   emphasis even using that term.
[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:42.020]   And that's why it wasn't across the board because then you'd miss what the author is
[00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:43.020]   intending.
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:47.660]   Also, the word "duluo," you wouldn't bring it over into English as "to slave."
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:49.900]   That doesn't make sense.
[00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:52.980]   You know, that's not good English, "to slave."
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:56.220]   It means "serve," "to serve as a slave."
[00:55:56.220 --> 00:56:00.180]   So I don't see where that's, you know, a problem.
[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:04.660]   Well, we had a conversation about this because I was just so zealous.
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:09.060]   I was like, "Let's just translate, I'm slaving away!"
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:13.060]   And everyone on the team's like, "Everett, that's not even English.
[00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:16.260]   Come on, you gotta relax.
[00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:17.900]   It's not that."
[00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:19.340]   And it's true.
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:22.700]   This is the limitation sometimes of English.
[00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:29.640]   But at the same time, there is an accuracy to it too because you don't want to press
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:38.860]   the verb of the dual root beyond its proper parameters because slaves, yes, they work.
[00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:44.500]   We understand that, but it might not have all the nuances of slaving.
[00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:46.420]   It's doing the activity of a slave.
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:48.740]   Well, what is the activity of a slave?
[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:50.620]   The activity is to serve.
[00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:52.900]   The activity is to work.
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:58.060]   And that's why it can be used in all kinds of arenas.
[00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:04.420]   But yes, when in certain contexts with certain linguistic factors, whether it be wordplay,
[00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:10.100]   whether it be in a certain tense, or even with certain words where abstractly it doesn't
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:17.660]   make sense because sin is not normally conceived of as a human master, that would be having
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:20.140]   to regard as personified.
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:27.020]   Then in those cases, yes, you have to change the normal translation of the word to show
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:33.020]   the abstract nature or to show a nuance brought out by the author himself.
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:37.740]   Well, there's another question that I'm going to ask you gentlemen today that came in through
[00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:45.660]   our LSB website, and it's regarding the base text that you used for your translation.
[00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:54.340]   The question reads, "Why does the LSB use the NA 27 UBS 4 as the base text for the New
[00:57:54.340 --> 00:58:01.860]   Testament rather than the majority text, Textus Receptus, Tyndale House Greek New Testament,
[00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:06.860]   or even the updated NA 28-UBS 5?"
[00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:13.580]   Well, oftentimes Abner said, "Dr. V, maybe this is for you on textual criticism.
[00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:17.660]   I'm sure we all could answer it, but I'll give a shot at it."
[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:25.540]   This is not a matter of a liberal or conservative fundamentalist or unbelieving issue.
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:33.700]   There's general agreement across evangelicals, Bible believers, that there needs to be improvement
[00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:36.980]   on the Textus Receptus.
[00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:45.260]   God honored and blessed that text for many years, but manuscript discoveries, manuscripts
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:52.100]   that predated the manuscripts that were used for the Textus Receptus, and evangelicals
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:59:01.800]   agree with this, too, and so we, with all due respect to those who advocate the Textus
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:04.820]   Receptus, we don't condemn them.
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:12.220]   They're not wicked people, but we want the earliest text of the New Testament, particularly
[00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:18.100]   I'm thinking of the New Testament here, and that is represented, we believe, in the
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:25.580]   Nestle-Alan 27th edition, and the Tyndale House is not much different, really.
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:28.300]   The Tyndale House is not much different.
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:34.580]   I worked with that quite often, so it's a very, very small difference.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:46.580]   So the NA 27, as it's called, or the UBS 4 is, we think, the best, earliest, most reliable
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:48.580]   edition of the New Testament.
[00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:58.420]   There is a movement that resulted in the NA 28 and the UBS 5 that we're concerned about.
[00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:01.500]   I don't want to go into details about it.
[01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:04.860]   It's called the coherence-based genealogical method.
[01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:14.620]   I like to say this, any method that tells me that 2 Peter 3.10 is a text that is represented
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:20.420]   by no Greek manuscript at all, I'm not going to put any value on that.
[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:30.620]   And sadly, the NA 28 and the UBS 5 are committed to a different approach to textual criticism
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:34.840]   that comes up with things that we're concerned about.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:41.700]   So we stuck with the NA 27 and the UBS 4, and again, I emphasize, this is not a matter
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:44.020]   of liberal or conservative.
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:50.020]   Across the board, those who have a high view of Scripture stand together on the idea that
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:01:00.100]   the earliest and the best manuscripts are represented in the NA 27 and the UBS 4.
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:08.540]   That being said, it's not as if we didn't consult all of those texts from SBL, Tyndale
[01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:17.020]   House, GNT, NA 28, UBS 5, and in fact, some of our readings and selection based on the
[01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:26.140]   evidence went against sometimes the NA 27-based text when you have issues in Jude with Jesus,
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:33.580]   for example, as opposed to Joshua and other, our Lord, excuse me, is it Kyrios or is it
[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:39.980]   Jesus, who led them out into the wilderness and into the Promised Land?
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:44.660]   And there were other issues in Mark that we had to kind of defer to, and it was based,
[01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:45.780]   though, upon the evidence.
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:53.620]   So it's not a slavish, automatic adherence to these texts.
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:59.180]   You have to start somewhere, but then from there, you have to go through the evidence.
[01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:03.900]   And one of the things that Dr. Varner really did is go through every problem, go through
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:09.820]   every issue, go through every variant, and map out, here's what it says in these different
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:16.320]   collections of texts, here's all the different textual evidence, here's what the strongest
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:21.300]   supporting evidence would suggest, and that's how we worked through it.
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:25.980]   So it wasn't blocking things out, and even for those of our friends who are Texas Receptus
[01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:35.620]   friendly, LSB, like its NASB predecessor, still includes the different texts from John
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:42.180]   8 and other passages, Mark 16, which are excluded in other translations just because we say,
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:47.860]   "Hey, these are issues that you have to deal with," and we're being transparent.
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:50.960]   This is what we would see in our Greek New Testament.
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:55.820]   It would be marked as a textual critical issue, so you should see the same thing.
[01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:58.340]   So you know that we're not hiding anything from you.
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:02.260]   So people can work with that.
[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:10.300]   Well, as I had mentioned at one point earlier in our discussion today, it's been just a
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:16.340]   little over a year since the full LSB was released, and I wanted to ask the question
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:24.940]   of you men, where are you seeing the LSB used in print or dissertations, et cetera?
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:33.560]   Right now, then, you'll see a graphic, and it's got the most freely translated here over
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:40.140]   here and the more strictly translated over here, and you'll see all these versions from
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:45.820]   the New Living Bible to the KJV, and it'll be on a gradient like that.
[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:49.100]   Well, we're starting to appear there.
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:53.580]   Just recently, I saw in some of those charts, there's LSB down at the bottom of the Legacy
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:58.900]   Standard Bible, and they're locating us pretty accurately on the more formal equivalent,
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:03:59.900]   literal.
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:03.460]   So evidently, somebody's taking note of us.
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:08.180]   They're putting us on their charts, so that's one way.
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:16.100]   And also, the growing number of people in this Legacy Standard Bible fan group, as they
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:24.660]   call it, it's getting bigger and bigger and bigger, and they're fans, and to see their
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:28.860]   excitement is really encouraging to me.
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:35.780]   - Yeah, a lot is by word of mouth, and you see those people who are, you know, sometimes
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:37.740]   they're the free promoters.
[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:42.240]   They're just, you know, they're talking about how much they love it, and especially like
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:49.740]   this edition has come up on social media quite a bit in that fan group as like the best edition
[01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:50.740]   or best format.
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:54.020]   They're like, they just love it, and looking at it, I can see why.
[01:04:54.020 --> 01:05:00.780]   I mean, it's a beautiful layout and really helpful, and on a personal note, when I started
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:08.020]   this project with joining my colleagues, I was in the middle of writing a dissertation,
[01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:16.780]   and so at the end, I was able to include some LSB shout-outs, if you will, or footnotes
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:22.900]   in my own dissertation, and so I don't know if that's a big deal, but I know that I used
[01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:23.900]   it.
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:24.900]   - It's a big deal to me.
[01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:25.900]   - Yeah.
[01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:26.900]   - I like it.
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:32.820]   - So it was good to be able to use what I had been working on for both in the LSB and
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:34.500]   in my dissertation at the end.
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:42.060]   - My last three books, one of which is soon to be published, use the LSB, and I've not
[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:44.180]   got any negative response to that.
[01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:51.140]   People appreciate using this newer version in these books that I've published.
[01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:53.940]   - And that's a great segue, Dr. Varner.
[01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:56.780]   So I have a couple books here that I wanted to show.
[01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:04.620]   So this one is Psalms of Grace, which is from the Master's Seminary Press, and this was
[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:11.340]   just put together, just released in the last few weeks, and it's a beautiful psalter that
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:15.500]   includes the entire book of Psalms from the Legacy Standard Bible.
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:20.860]   So that's one example, and then rather than talk about this book that just came out, I'd
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:22.860]   like you to talk about it a little bit.
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:26.540]   - Okay, Chris, can you just hold it there?
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:34.540]   Last May, I was praying Scripture as I always do, and the thought came to me, "Hey, hmm,
[01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:41.620]   we finished the Legacy Standard Bible, I'm praying somebody else's handbook of Scripture."
[01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:47.340]   You think, Varner, you could produce a handbook for praying Scripture from the Legacy Standard
[01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:48.340]   Bible?
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:57.860]   - I usually put in a few days of prayers, and I emphasize our adoration of God, our
[01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:07.520]   thanksgiving to Him, our affirmation of Him, our confession, and also personal petitions
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:13.380]   and intercessions, and put in the disciples' prayer and a benediction.
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:21.200]   So those are categories each day, and I've used about 300 verses and passages from the
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:28.020]   Legacy Standard Bible, so that we are actually praying to the Lord.
[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:34.220]   Occasionally, we adapt a verse, and I like the way that our editors, whenever I have
[01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:39.020]   slightly adapted a verse, in the reference, they put an asterisk there to let you know
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:45.260]   that I've adapted it, but I've never changed the intent of the verse at all.
[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:46.780]   So people are using it.
[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:53.880]   It's only been out, my, just less than a couple of weeks, and recently, the students at the
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:08:00.420]   Master's University got a copy, and it's just a delight to see them and hear that they're
[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:01.420]   praying.
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:07.500]   I think of the benediction that I use occasionally, "Yahweh bless you and keep you.
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:11.140]   May Yahweh lift up His face upon you and be gracious unto you.
[01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:15.060]   May Yahweh lift up His face to you and give you peace."
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:19.340]   People oftentimes forget that the word "face" is the same in the first part of the verse
[01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:21.100]   and the second part of the verse.
[01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:26.340]   But many translations will say "face" in countenance, because it's the same word.
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:28.760]   We use "face" both times.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:33.380]   And then as we pray that benediction, I'm reminded of the verse right after that that
[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:39.620]   says, "Thus you will place my name on the children of Israel."
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:40.620]   My name.
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:45.300]   Then it's important that we translate it as "Yahweh bless you and keep you.
[01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:49.420]   Yahweh make His face to shine upon you."
[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:57.180]   So it's been a delight, and I'm very thankful to the publishers of the Legacy Standard Bible.
[01:08:57.180 --> 01:09:01.580]   I remember sending you, you know, the idea, "Chris, what do you think about that?"
[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:03.420]   And you said, "Well, send me some samples."
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:07.380]   So I sent some samples, and you said, "Hmm, I like this, you know, okay, let's see who
[01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:08.620]   else likes it."
[01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:14.380]   And so it was field-tested to a bit, and enough people liked it that you committed to it.
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:17.780]   So I'm very thankful.
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:23.820]   It's very personal, and I hope people will read the preface, because this arose out of
[01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:25.640]   my life.
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:31.460]   And when you write a book out of your life, it's different than just writing about something.
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:40.140]   And so this has been a blessing in my own life to pray Scripture, and it's my most
[01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:47.100]   personal book, but I hope that it'll minister to others and enrich our prayer lives.
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:51.780]   I think when you ask just about any pastor what they'd like their congregation to do
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:56.100]   more of, it's read the Bible and pray.
[01:09:56.100 --> 01:10:00.500]   And so this is a great resource to help equip the church, so we're excited for it.
[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:05.420]   And we realize that, okay, well, do I just pray Scripture, or do I pray personal requests?
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:08.820]   At the end of each of those, I've got what I call a pause button.
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:14.220]   So at the end of the intercessory Scripture prayers, pause button, introduce your own
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:15.660]   intercessory prayers.
[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:22.380]   So it gives freedom as well as structure to one's prayer life, I hope.
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:25.360]   - Thank you very much for sharing about your book.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:30.820]   And Abner, I understand that you've been working diligently on a project regarding
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:33.100]   Pastor MacArthur's content.
[01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:39.340]   - Yes, so after we completed the Legacy Standard Bible, Joe and I had just such a wonderful
[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:44.500]   time working together, and we're part of the same fellowship group, and both emphasizing
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:48.620]   Old Testament as well, that we said, "Well, let's see if we can't figure out a project
[01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:49.620]   to do together."
[01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:56.860]   And we kind of said, "Oh, it'd be amazing if we had the honor to complete the MacArthur
[01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:58.780]   commentary on the Scriptures."
[01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:03.820]   Obviously Pastor John has done the New Testament and gone through every book preaching-wise
[01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:09.420]   as well as writing commentary on the entire New Testament, and we thought, "Well, why
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:11.060]   not try it with the Old Testament?"
[01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:12.740]   So we pitched the idea to him.
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:17.400]   He was thrilled, and we wanted to do it with the Legacy Standard Bible.
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:24.340]   And doing the Old Testament commentary, we've finished Zechariah, we've done work in Jonah,
[01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:31.280]   we've done work in Haggai, we've done work in Nahum, and we've done work in Daniel now
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:32.940]   as well.
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:38.100]   And Zechariah, I think, should be ready for Shepherds Conference 2023, so that's a huge
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:42.640]   praise and it's exciting to see this project really kick off.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:47.700]   But using the Legacy Standard Bible for all of it has been such a blessing because we've
[01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:50.500]   been able to maximize on the consistency.
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:58.780]   We've been able to see and bring out the distinction of God's name, Yahweh, as opposed to His other
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:00.220]   titles.
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:07.200]   And seeing all of the factors of the careful precision that was brought into the translation,
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:10.180]   it really does pay dividends when you're explaining the text.
[01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:14.780]   Dr. MacArthur always said, "Oh yeah, a really good translation is the expositor's dream."
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:17.580]   And I thought to myself, "Yeah, I could see that.
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:19.260]   Yeah, sure, that sounds good."
[01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:22.780]   And then now being in it, I really see the reality of it.
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:28.740]   And so we're really excited to complete an entire set so that people have both New Testament
[01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:36.020]   and Old Testament all produced in conjunction with Dr. MacArthur as a resource for the church
[01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:40.420]   expositing through the scriptures from Genesis to Revelation.
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:41.420]   - Big project.
[01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:42.420]   - Yes.
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:43.420]   - Wow.
[01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:44.420]   - Can't wait.
[01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:45.420]   - Yes.
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:50.220]   Many people can't wait because many people have been blessed for a long time using his
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:52.480]   New Testament commentaries.
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:56.260]   So I'm sure you're going to get a lot of emails saying, "When's it going to be ready?
[01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:57.700]   I'm preaching on this book."
[01:12:57.700 --> 01:12:58.700]   - Yeah.
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:12:59.700]   - That's true.
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:00.700]   That's true.
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:03.100]   And we're moving as fast as we can.
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:06.840]   - That's fantastic.
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:16.500]   Well, today we also wanted to showcase our Scripture Study Notebooks in the Legacy Standard
[01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:17.500]   Bible.
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:24.060]   The New Testament set came out in the last month, and today we're showing the Old Testament
[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:28.040]   set that's in production and releasing very soon.
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:34.400]   So these books are uniquely designed, and actually Jason and his wife have been using
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.400]   them.
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:40.480]   So I've asked Jason to give us an explanation of how useful this is as a tool.
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.360]   - Yeah, we love these.
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:49.380]   When my wife first saw that these were up for an option, I asked her, "What do you want
[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:50.380]   for Christmas?"
[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:52.920]   And this was on the top of the list, like, "I want this for Christmas."
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:54.600]   And so she got it for Christmas.
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:55.600]   It came in.
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.000]   We were excited.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.120]   It's a wonderful opportunity for inductive study.
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:08.560]   One of the things that I love about this, and my wife as well, is that there is so much
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:17.080]   room to make notations, highlight, draw, all kinds of things on the front side, when you
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:23.420]   have that, just that room to work through, and then the notes that you can then take
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:25.760]   on the right-hand side.
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:32.400]   And then you can have this and keep it and add to it as you continue to go back and study.
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:37.960]   I love just this concept, and the fact that it's an LSB, and the way that you formatted
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:42.000]   it, I just feel like is better than some of the other ones that I've seen, because of
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.160]   the space and the ability to do that.
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:51.120]   In fact, I teach a class in Romans every spring, and I was telling them that when it becomes
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:57.240]   available to do the Romans one, because I have them do specific projects in studying
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:02.300]   the text, looking for repetition, making notes, that kind of thing, that it would be perfect
[01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:04.800]   for that, too, and just a big fan.
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.240]   I think it's great.
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:11.960]   And the Scripture Study Notebooks are also available individually, so if somebody is
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:16.200]   studying a particular book and just wants to try one, they're welcome to do that as
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.200]   well.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:23.100]   - Well, thank you all today for taking time out of your busy schedules to address questions,
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:28.280]   give us more insights into the translation process for the Legacy Standard Bible, and
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:31.440]   it's been a joy to have you all together today.
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:31.720]   - Thank you.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:32.720]   - Thank you.
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:32.720]   - Thank you.
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:33.720]   - Thank you.
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:33.720]   - Thank you.
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:35.720]   - Thank you.
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:35.720]   - Thank you.
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:40.720]   - Thank you.
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:50.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
