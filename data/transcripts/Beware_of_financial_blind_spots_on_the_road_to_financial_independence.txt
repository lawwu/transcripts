[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk about financial
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.000]   blind spots on our road to financial independence.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.560]   So every month I treat myself to a chair massage.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.820]   The chair massage at the mall is about 80 cents to a dollar a minute and I'm hoping
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.240]   to get 30 minutes because that's I think the sweet spot, but I usually only get 10 minutes.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.240]   Why?
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.560]   Because every time I go to this chair massage place there's this guy that I'm trying to
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.040]   avoid and every time I get there he's like, "Hey, welcome, welcome to the chair massage
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.040]   place.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.960]   Come sit in my chair and do you want a 30 minute, 45 minute, 60 minute?"
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.400]   You know, the more the better for them because they make more money.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.960]   And every time I see him I say, "Well, no."
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.400]   I start pretending I actually don't have that much time.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.280]   I've got to go pick up my kid or something and I can only do 10 minutes.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.880]   And the reason why I say 10 minutes, which is the minimum chair massage time at the place,
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.480]   is because I don't know if I can take his torture.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.120]   I have told him time and time again, "Please go a little bit lighter because it's a little
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.200]   bit too sensitive after tennis and softball."
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.120]   And every time he says, "Sure, no problem."
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.640]   And then within three seconds he starts kneading away, kneading and he's like digging into
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.800]   something like trying to find gold in the ground or something and I'm just dying.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.840]   I'm making audible noises showing discomfort and he just keeps on going.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.280]   So there's a disconnect here.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.960]   He believes what he's doing is the right way even though the client, me, is suffering.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.360]   And I actually just don't want to suffer.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.240]   I know there's therapeutic massages where in order to get better you've got to feel
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.820]   that pain and crush those knots and stuff.
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.880]   But I just kind of want to relax and enjoy myself and just drift away and feel good.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.920]   But because of this financial blind spot, I would say he's missing out on 100% to 200%
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.040]   of income because he just doesn't listen to his clients.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.480]   I would happily pay him for 30 minutes if not 60 minutes if he was a great masseuse.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.400]   But he just wants to go to town and do his own thing.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.040]   So financial blind spots I think really impede us on the road to financial independence.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.240]   And in this episode I just want to talk about several financial blind spots and also a latest
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.440]   financial blind spot that I think is really, really interesting in modern day society.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.480]   So one, the first common financial blind spot I see is comparing someone's middle to your
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.640]   beginning.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.400]   Some of the most clueless people about their money are in their 20s because hey, you're
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.960]   just starting to make money, right?
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.480]   Nobody can blame you.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.320]   Yet ironically some of the most vociferous people who think they know it all also happen
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.880]   to mostly be in their 20s.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.840]   And I think this is a huge and fascinating disconnect.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.520]   They rage against the people who bought their own house by 28, accumulated a million dollars
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.520]   in after tax investments by 35, 40 and started making over $100,000 a year after going to
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.120]   graduate school.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.760]   Yet they haven't given their life enough time to compound.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.920]   It's as if they want to get ahead by refusing to work more than 40 hours a week.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.040]   It's as if they want to go straight to the corner office.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.040]   And that's a no-no.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.840]   You cannot compare your beginning and with no experience, relevant experience to someone
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.760]   who's been grinding away for 10, 15, 20 years.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.760]   So what's the repercussion?
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.520]   Well, I think you generate resentment, anger and bitterness towards a large swath of people.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.080]   And with so much resentment you end up going to your local hardware store and buying a
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.560]   pitchfork to stab anybody who has more than you.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.720]   Instead of taking action to improve your own financial situation, you use your negative
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.400]   energy to attack others and to try to bring them down to your level instead of working
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.520]   on yourself to bring yourself up.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.600]   Two, thinking parenting is easier and cheaper than it is.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.920]   For those suffering from this blind spot, they either don't have kids or are a parent
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.400]   working outside the home.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.080]   Being a stay-at-home parent to a baby or a toddler is harder than almost any job I can
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.320]   think of because it is 24/7 and the stakes are so high.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.680]   One look away could mean a bloody bonk on the head or a drowning, the number one cause
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.960]   of death of children under 4.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:23.400]   As a result, when looking after a child, you can never mentally or physically relax 100%
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.020]   of the time.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.840]   And over time, your nerves will begin to fray without relief.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.840]   I've met so many working dads who think raising a child is easy simply because they don't
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.480]   take care of their kids most of the day.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.880]   It's either their spouse or daycare that takes care of the child.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.000]   And that's fine, that's normal, that's just the way some arrangements are.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.840]   But what happens is that working spouse tends to take the stay-at-home spouse for granted
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.560]   and then the relationship begins to break down because nobody wants to feel this type
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.560]   of resentment.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.040]   I've also encountered childless couples who criticize stay-at-home parents for hiring
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.040]   help.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.480]   They think it's nuts for a stay-at-home parent to hire relief for several hours a week or
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.080]   a day so that the parent can take a shower, go to the bathroom in peace, exercise or spend
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.520]   quality time with friends and loved ones.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.120]   Folks, it's hard being a stay-at-home parent.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.120]   So if you don't have kids or you're not the stay-at-home parent, give some slack, otherwise
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.960]   there's going to be resentment, fighting, unhappiness, neglected kids, rebellious kids,
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.320]   divorce, financial ruin, and many more years of pain.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.200]   The third financial blind spot is thinking everybody can just move to a lower-cost area
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.840]   of the country and be happy.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.880]   Everybody knows the Midwest and South are lower-cost areas of the country than the coast.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.440]   That's just a no-brainer and I'm actively investing in these heartland states and cities.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.120]   The demographic trend is inward because the cost of living is so much cheaper and there's
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.920]   technology that allows us to work from home and do telecommuting and so forth.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:02.240]   However, not everybody can just go to the middle of America and feel happy.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.360]   Well, one, they might not have family there, two, no friends, three, they might feel like
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.320]   a fish out of water.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.080]   People naturally gravitate to people who look like them, talk like them, and have similar
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.080]   backgrounds.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.880]   You look at it in the boardrooms.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.500]   If one guy went to, let's say, Dartmouth, suddenly he or she has a lot of other friends
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.500]   who have gone to Dartmouth.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.240]   If one man is from Zimbabwe, suddenly there's other people from Zimbabwe surrounded by him
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.720]   in the boardroom.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.560]   And you look at your friends, probably they all tend to have similar backgrounds or they
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.000]   tend to look alike.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.920]   So just to ask someone to move from, let's say, one city like San Francisco where the
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:48.760]   minority are the majority to, let's say, Des Moines where they would be the absolute minority
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.660]   would be harder for some than others.
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.200]   So what's the repercussion for missing this blind spot?
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:00.000]   Well, I think the number one repercussion is homogeneity in your offline community or
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.360]   online community and what happens is that an echo chamber is created where nobody can
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.740]   think for themselves because they're just all finding belief and truth from other people
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.720]   to portress their own beliefs.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:18.000]   Okay, the fourth blind spot on the road to financial independence is underestimating
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.440]   healthcare costs in retirement.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.840]   Because employers subsidize most and sometimes all of their employees' healthcare costs,
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.400]   employees either don't know what their true healthcare costs are or they take these benefits
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.400]   for granted.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.180]   It's the same reason why so many freelancers get into trouble when it comes time to pay
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.820]   their taxes.
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.600]   When they were working full time as employees, their employer facilitated the payment of
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.340]   an estimated tax from each paycheck.
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:48.320]   If the government didn't require this practice, it would have a very difficult time collecting
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.120]   the majority of its tax revenue come year end because most people would have just spent
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.120]   it all.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:59.280]   So if you suffer from this blind spot, it can be very devastating to your finances because
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:05.840]   you will likely not save or accumulate enough capital to generate enough passive income.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.240]   To give you an example of how much healthcare costs, my family of three is going to pay
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:15.320]   $1,940 a month in premiums in the year 2020.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:22.280]   It's a platinum plan, it's a great plan, but $1,940 a month is a lot of money and if we
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.560]   were to add a second child, we asked, the plan is going to go up $440 a month.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:32.280]   So we're talking $30,000 a year in healthcare premiums.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:37.720]   And if you don't account for that in your financial plans, independent plans, that's
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.680]   going to be a tough nut to swallow.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.700]   Now of course there are other options, right?
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:47.240]   You can earn below 400% of the federal poverty limit to get subsidized healthcare.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.280]   I don't know how good it's going to be, but you can definitely save on costs that way.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:56.120]   You can go to health care ministries or you can just roll the dice and not have healthcare.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.160]   But I tell you, if you have kids, little ones are always getting sick, they're always getting
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.600]   in trouble, they're getting hurt, and you don't really know the health of your child
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.960]   fully until maybe they're five years old or maybe 10 years old.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:13.360]   So please, please account for healthcare costs before you leave your job.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.080]   Don't take your job's healthcare benefits and other benefits for granted.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.680]   Alright, the fifth blind spot on the road to financial independence is believing the
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.280]   only path to financial independence is through a high income.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.960]   Since 2009, I've heard this complaint over and over again, how someone made a higher
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:36.000]   income, therefore he or she obviously was able to achieve financial independence by
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.080]   the time they were 40 or whatever the age may be.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.880]   Everybody knows that the more you make, often the more you spend.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.760]   You've seen countless examples and countless data showing this to be the case.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:53.160]   It's often harder to stay financially disciplined if you have a higher cash flow.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.880]   Think about all the athletes who've made millions and millions of dollars who ended up broke
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:03.600]   because that allure to spend because you have so much money is so easy and nobody told them
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.080]   otherwise.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.660]   If you believe the only way to wealth is through a high income, then unfortunately you've already
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:14.000]   defeated yourself, you have weakened your money mindset.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.200]   You'll believe working on a side hustle like driving a car, assembling furniture or flipping
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.060]   burgers is beneath you.
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.740]   You won't be willing to put in your dues.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.300]   You probably won't be willing to put endless hours in an online entrepreneurial endeavor
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:33.760]   either because you think only "special people" with money can do something unique.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.680]   And sadly, that's just not true.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:40.340]   Think about when you were a kid, and I'm living this now as a high school tennis coach and
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.420]   as a father to a toddler.
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:46.540]   The ideas and the creativity and the hustle is endless.
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:52.020]   And somehow or another when we become, I don't know, 21, 25, we just get beaten down by the
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:56.820]   workplace and our creativity and hustle disappears.
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:02.100]   I am sure that all of you guys have something else to offer besides your day job that will
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.420]   allow you to make money.
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.220]   Please don't believe that other jobs are beneath you.
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.360]   Nothing is beneath you if you want to achieve financial independence.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.420]   You got to go out and do it.
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:18.020]   You got to save your money and you got to find other ways to make extra money.
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.660]   Curing blind spots is hard.
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:25.940]   And the reason why I introduced so many different financial archetypes is because it allows
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:30.860]   people to ponder and consider what their future might entail.
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.860]   One such financial archetype is a family of four with two kids under 18 living in a high
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.780]   cost of living area.
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.340]   There's nothing unusual about this financial archetype.
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:46.420]   According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, coastal counties of the US
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:52.460]   are home to over 126 million people or 40% of the nation's total population.
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:12:00.460]   Meanwhile, according to Statista, the average family has 1.9 aged under 18 children.
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.980]   In other words, a family of four living in an expensive city is quite common.
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:09.060]   And to understand and describe the pressures of raising two children in a high cost of
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:15.060]   living area where 40% of the American population lives, I wrote a guest post on CNBC entitled
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:20.780]   "It Now Costs $350,000 a Year to Live in a Big City with Family."
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.760]   And then it did well and then MarketWatch decided to pick it up and write their own
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:31.300]   spin that said "This budget shows a $350,000 salary barely qualifies as middle class."
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:39.140]   And then with one last final poke, MarketWatch tweeted out the budget and they said "$350,000
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:44.020]   and still struggling" and highlighted my $350,000 budget.
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:50.180]   Finally, this tweet caught the attention of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, AOC, who retweeted
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:53.140]   the budget and said "struggling?
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.820]   With what, math?"
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.860]   And I thought this was a great response because it was humorous and she retweeted it out to
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.300]   her 5.6 million followers.
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:07.180]   This is great because it got people talking about important things such as money and happiness,
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:12.260]   the purpose of grinding so hard at your day job to make money that I don't think will
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.660]   make you any happier, the importance of staying on top of your finances and living within
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:22.180]   your means, whether it's worth being a two-income household when you have kids and have to pay
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:28.500]   for daycare, the importance of contributing to your retirement plan, and so forth.
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:33.620]   It got America talking, which is all a personal finance educator can talk about.
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:38.640]   I'm not here to judge how you spend your money, but I'm here to show you how money can be
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:43.300]   spent quickly and look at these various blind spots.
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:50.260]   And what AOC doesn't realize is that as an unmarried 30-year-old woman, she might very
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:56.340]   well turn into the family of four one day who has to survive off $350,000 raising two
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.340]   kids in an expensive city like Washington DC.
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.540]   I fully expect her to be a rising star in the Democratic party for at least another
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:09.380]   decade if not two, and as a result she should prepare herself for financial life in DC or
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.660]   if she goes back to the New York City area.
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.780]   Same thing, it's equally as high cost to live there if not more.
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:23.060]   AOC makes $174,000 a year, which is pretty good, it puts her in the top 5% of all income
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.380]   earning Americans.
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:29.700]   However, the salary has been capped since 2009 given objections by the American people
[00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:34.300]   who give Congress a low approval rating, so I don't think that income is going up anytime
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:40.300]   soon and if AOC wants to buy a house, it's going to be tough in Washington DC where the
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:47.660]   median price detached home is around $820,000 as of the fourth quarter of 2019.
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:52.740]   And if she wants to send her kids to private school, which many Congress men and women
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:57.740]   do, well that's going to set her back even more.
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.620]   It's crazy how much private school is in the DC area, just look at Georgetown Prep, it's
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:07.180]   around $40,000 a year for high school, and if you look at Sidwell Friends where Obama's
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:12.420]   daughters went, it's $45,000 and up.
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:20.300]   And if you assume a 3% to 5% annual tuition inflation, there's just no way on a $174,000
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.900]   income she can provide all this for her children.
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:30.100]   And let's also forget about sending the two kids to AOC's alma mater, Boston University,
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:35.100]   according to their own website, it costs $72,000 a year to attend.
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:40.540]   And again if you assume inflation, I would say by the time her fictitious children, let's
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:45.740]   say who were miraculously born today, attend in 18 years, the cost is going to be about
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:49.180]   $170,000 a year.
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.620]   So what are the solutions?
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.900]   Well, one, be okay with public grade school and university.
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.540]   Don't think just because you went to a private university, your kids have to go there as
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.540]   well.
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.940]   We've talked about this ad nauseum, it's okay to go to public grade school like the majority
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.700]   of the American population.
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.820]   Two, do some side hustling.
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.960]   Members of Congress are supposedly able to earn an additional 15% of the annual rate
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:18.700]   of basic pay, so that's another $28,400 a year of outside earned income.
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.180]   Three, lose or quit.
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:25.580]   She is a very popular woman, there is an unlikely chance she will lose when she's up for re-election
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.940]   on November 3rd, 2020, but if she does or decides to quit, I'm sure she could get a
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:35.100]   multi-million book deal like every popular politician before her.
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.700]   Four, find a spouse or a wealthier spouse.
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:45.380]   It's a little funny that she highlighted my budget of $350,000 a year, where if she found
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:50.700]   a spouse that made an equal amount of money of $174,000 a year, their combined income
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.780]   would be $350,000 a year.
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.740]   It's funny how that goes full circle, doesn't it?
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:01.620]   When AOC is in the top 0.1% of power, she will naturally run in circles with other people
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:06.500]   of power and great wealth, so I see no reason why she can't find an equal partner who
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:11.060]   makes at least $174,000, if not more.
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:16.620]   And then the final solution, have fewer children or no children because children are expensive
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:20.940]   and it should be a reasonable ask to not have children before first being able to take care
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.500]   of yourself.
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:28.220]   Thinking about how many better adjusted children there would be if parents had a stable household
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:35.880]   with stable finances, maybe there would be less angry people, less murders, less crime.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.000]   Good things could happen if more parents are more present and more financially stable.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.120]   So in conclusion, I hope everybody is aware of their blind spots on the road to financial
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.260]   independence.
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:47.460]   We all have them.
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.460]   You have them.
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.300]   I have them, which is part of the reason why I write and podcast so much, is because I
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:56.460]   want the financial samurai community to tell me where I'm missing something.
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:02.300]   The best teacher is experience and why not get those who have experienced what you or
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:06.420]   I will eventually go through to share their thoughts and their wisdom.
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:11.780]   I know it's easy to make fun of people who are different from you, who live in a coastal
[00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:16.860]   city, who make $350,000 a year, who's a different race, speaks a different language,
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:17.860]   all that stuff.
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:23.500]   But I challenge you to keep an open mind, keep an open mind and realize that might be
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:30.420]   you one day or maybe someone is living a different life than you and going through different
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.340]   types of struggles.
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:36.540]   And one person's struggle is no different than another person's struggle.
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:40.840]   So hopefully through reading and listening, we can all be more empathetic and understanding
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:45.260]   to different situations because who knows, we might find ourselves there one day.
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.020]   Thanks everyone for listening.
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.300]   I always appreciate it.
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:53.380]   And if you enjoyed this podcast, I'd appreciate a positive review on iTunes or wherever you
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.940]   listen to this podcast.
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:19:01.340]   I plan to continue for a long, long time, at least one podcast a week, maybe more once
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:05.420]   I get more in the groove with my free time now that my boy's in school.
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:10.780]   And if you want to see AOC's budget, go ahead and check out the post on my website.
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.580]   I spent a little bit too much time trying to get all the details right.
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.820]   Have a great week everyone and I'll see you guys around.
