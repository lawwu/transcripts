[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Theologian Michael Reeves joins us again from the UK, filling in this week for John Piper.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   And today's question is rather simple. It's profoundly important, but the question itself is rather simple.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Michael, how do we pursue our happiness in Jesus?
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   First, I'd want to say this is important, pursuing our happiness in Jesus, that joy in Christ isn't an optional extra.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   We were made to share the Father's eternal pleasure in his Son.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   The Father is always delighted in his Son, eternally found pleasure in him.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   And we were created to share the Father's sweet pleasure in his Son.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   To love Jesus is to be made more like God himself, more like the Father.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   So this is important. Now, I confess personally that wasn't a message that I knew well when growing up as a young Christian.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   I think the message that I thought the gospel was, was I am a sinner.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Christ dies for my sins in order to buy me heaven, which meant I was grateful to Christ for redeeming me from hell and bringing me to heaven.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   But the real reward of the gospel, I believed, was heaven, not Christ, not God himself.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And that changed personally for me through reading Jonathan Edwards.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   And I was torn by his description of the hypocrite in the Religious Affections, where he says that's a good description of the hypocrite, that you are using God to get something else.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Your delight is not in God himself, the one we are made for.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   So I think this is very important as an issue, and I feel the personal significance of it.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   It's changed what the Christian life looks like to me.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   It means sanctification has a rationale to it that it didn't before to me.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   So we need to pursue our happiness in Jesus. And I want to use that word "pursue."
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   This is something we can't simply sit back on.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Paul in Philippians 3.14 uses strong, striving language.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I press on towards the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   It's an active thing. He wants to press in to know him.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I think the question is, so how then do we do this?
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   First thing I'd say is this. I'd say two things.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   First thing is know him. Grow in your knowledge of Christ.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   For it is knowing Christ that is why the Father so delights in him, because he is simply delightful.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Now, a past generation, the Puritans I think of, this seemed to be in the mainstream in a way that it's not today so much.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   So you see a number of Puritan works, for example, Thomas Goodwin's The Heart of Christ in Heaven.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   There's a great work to read and to consider the ascended, glorified Jesus, to fill your vision with him so that you know him.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And I want to say fill your vision, not simply so that you know about him, but so that he eclipses other concerns for you,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   so that his glory is of greater concern than your glory or your worries.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   So we need to fill our minds, our vision with him. Goodwin's Heart of Christ would be something I'd recommend.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Owen's The Glory of Christ I'd recommend as well. Charles Spurgeon, Christ's Glorious Achievements.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I would read some of these older, rich works. They help you see how a Christ-focused generation of the past read Scripture to know Christ better.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Fill out your knowledge of him. I try to think of something John Owen said on this.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   He talked about this a number of times in his works and said things like this. Do any of us find a lukewarmness, a spiritual stupidity and senselessness coming upon us?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Well, there is no better way for our healing than this, a fresh view of the glory of Christ and abiding therein.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   He wrote, after having buried 10 of his children, he would write, "A due contemplation of the glory of Christ will restore and compose the mind."
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   He's not an ivory tower theologian. Having suffered deeply, he knows that it's a view of Christ's glory, compassion, grace, holiness,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   will enable you to go through all that life throws at you and to go through it with a joy.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   So press into know Christ better. That's how we pursue our happiness.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   But I'd add one more thing to that. Compare Christ to whatever else it is that you treasure.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   So what is it that you really want? Is it love? Is it you want to be loved?
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   And that can come across in various ways, a sexual addiction, a desire for fame.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Those are really varieties of wanting to be loved. Is it acceptance? Is it money? Is it power? Is it comfort?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Now compare that thing you dream of and love with Christ. Which is better?
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Does pornography offer you the satisfaction, acceptance and love that Jesus does?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Does money offer you anything in comparison to the riches of Christ?
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Does passing temporal power offer you anything in comparison to what Christ is offering?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   And when you see how much better Christ is than those other things you go running after,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   you will choose Christ rather than those things, and you'll walk away from them with freedom.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Wonderful, Michael. And this is why we need you to keep writing books about the glory of Christ.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Thank you. I say that because he just finished work on an excellent book titled "Christ Our Life"
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   which is scheduled to release on September 1st in the UK.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   It will be titled "Rejoicing in Christ" and released in the US early next year.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And speaking of books on the importance of seeing and savoring Jesus Christ,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   see John Piper's book "Seeing and Savoring Jesus Christ."
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   You can download it right now for free from our website at DesiringGod.org.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Just click on the "Books" tab on the top of the page and you will find it,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   "Seeing and Savoring Jesus Christ" is the title. It's a wonderful little book.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Well, tomorrow we will hear from Michael Reeves one more time.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Christ is not just glorious and to be adored as he is often separate from us.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   The Bible teaches us that all Christians are united to him.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Michael has written and spoken a lot about union with Christ, and tomorrow I'll ask him,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   why is it important for Christians to understand and embrace the precious truth of our union with Christ?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   [Pastor John's Podcast - Ask Pastor John]
