[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Audrey, a podcast listener, writes in to ask this.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Pastor John, if our sins are already atoned for by the death of Christ,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   why is it necessary now for Jesus to currently make intercession for us in heaven
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   as our advocate before the Father?
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   I like that question.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   I like it because we know that both of those are presented in the New Testament,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   and there's an effort on her part to try to bring them into some deeper harmony.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   And so every time I try to do that, I see more of Christ, I love more of Christ.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   And so I think the answer to that question is that Jesus Christ receives more glory
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   because God does it this way, since that's the reason God does everything he does,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   so that Christ gets more glory.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   And in the long run, the glory of Christ will shine more fully, more brightly, more durably
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   for having made a complete atonement once for all at the cross and for interceding for us.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   But let's see if we can see in the New Testament how they're related.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   There are three key passages on the intercession of Christ.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   First one is 1 John 2.1.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   "I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin."
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   "If anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous."
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Now, right now, with the Father in heaven, we have an advocate, paraklaton,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Jesus Christ the righteous.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   The fact that he's called the righteous, our advocate is Jesus Christ the righteous,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   suggests that what Jesus achieved here on earth in his perfect obedience,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   his perfect fulfillment of the law, his perfect righteousness,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   is a necessity in an ongoing way in heaven.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   We always have a record like a criminal.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   We fail in this life.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   That's against us.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   We sinned.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   When Christ died to cover these sins, one of the ways he did it was to become for us our righteousness,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   so that in him we have a perfect record.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   But that means we need him to keep on being a perfect record for us, now and forever.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   We never have a standing before God that's acceptable apart from the righteousness of Christ.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   It doesn't matter the fact that we don't sin in heaven.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   We're not going to sin in heaven, but we sin on earth and we're the same person.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   We got a record, and God can't accept anything but perfection,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   therefore he provides the righteous one who stands always before him,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   and we, by faith, always in him, and therefore always acceptable because of Christ.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Think of it this way.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Just as in hell there is an eternal consequence of suffering for a lifetime of sinning,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   so also in heaven there's an eternal consequence of needing for our record to always be covered.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   That is what Christ, the righteous one, does for us.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   We were saved by being united to Christ so that his righteousness counts for ours,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   and it must count for ours forever, and therefore he is our living, eternal righteousness in heaven now and forever,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   and in that sense our advocate.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   He ever lives to be what he became for us on the earth, namely righteous.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   That's the first text. Here's the second one.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Romans 8, 34.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Who is to condemn? Christ is the one who died.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   More than that, who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   So notice the sequence.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   No one can condemn us because Christ died, second, was raised, third, is interceding.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   The implication is that what he achieved in his death for us,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   he now pleads or applies for us in his life for us in heaven.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   And I think one way to think about it is that Christ's life in heaven today
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   is the ever-present proof that his death was successful.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   If God had not raised Jesus from the dead, Paul says, we'd be still in our sins.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   So that he lives means that his death was effective in covering our sins,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   and so his living presence in heaven, by its very nature, is his intercession.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   His life is essential for his death to count.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And so his life is an essential part of our present and eternal forgiveness and acceptance.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Here's the last one. Hebrews 7, 23 to 27.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   This is the most explicit one of all, probably the most helpful one of all,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   if she studied it in context, I think it would make all kinds of lights go on.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   "The former priests were many in number because they were prevented by death from continuing in office.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   But he holds his priesthood permanently because he continues forever.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Consequently," that's a key word, verse 25 of Hebrews 7,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   "consequently he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   since he always lives to make intercession for them."
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Verse 27, "He has no need like those high priests to offer sacrifices daily,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   first for his own sins and then for the sins of the people,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   since he did this once for all when he offered up himself."
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   So isn't it interesting that the "once for allness" of the offering is underlined,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   and that's one thing she loves and is concerned about.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Once for all he offered himself up, and that's the reason why he,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   always living, can make intercession.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   So I think it's the same thing as we said for Romans 8,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   that Christ's life in heaven today, unlike the priests of old, never ends,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   and therefore he has taken into heaven one offering made once for all,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   and in himself, standing before God as the Lamb that was slain,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   is therefore worthy of all praise because that slaughter of that Lamb
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   is embodied in the presence of Christ in heaven forever.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   So I think we could, I suppose, ponder the possibility of God saving us another way
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   besides a once for all finished sacrifice, which then is embodied, as it were,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   in the slain Lamb in heaven, which becomes our advocate and our intercessor.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   But the fact that he did it this way, I think, will get more glory to him
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   for what he did in the past, what he's doing now, and what he'll do forever.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   That is profound truth. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   And thank you, Audrey, for your very perceptive question.
