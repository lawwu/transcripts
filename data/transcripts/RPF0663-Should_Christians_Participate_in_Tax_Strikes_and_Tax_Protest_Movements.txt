[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.100]   The challenge is that war tax protesting, or tax protesting in general,
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.940]   can be an extra challenge for Christians.
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.780]   And this show is primarily targeted towards the audience of Radical Personal Finance
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.960]   that identifies as Christian.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.340]   You're of course welcome to tune in if that's not you.
[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.760]   But tax resistance is very difficult for Christians.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.660]   Because on the one hand, there's an obvious moral horror
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.660]   There's an obvious moral horror
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.660]   There's an obvious moral horror
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.660]   There's an obvious moral horror at many of the things that are happening
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.660]   at many of the things that are happening
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.660]   at many of the things that are happening in the world.

[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.080]   that very clearly teach
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.140]   submission to government authority
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.400]   and the payment of taxes.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.860]   And if you look at the environments
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.280]   and the governments that these men were dealing with,
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.380]   it's hard to say that they had it tougher than we do.
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.700]   You can begin with Jesus Christ himself,
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.840]   who was executed without cause,
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.420]   without any kind of justice,
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.780]   was executed by the government of his day,
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.120]   and yet Jesus taught very clearly to
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.620]   pay taxes.
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:06:13.640]   to pay taxes.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:43.660]   to pay taxes.
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:43.660]   We don't know exactly, but at least thousands of people collectively,
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:43.660]   We don't know exactly, but at least thousands of people collectively,

[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.060]   and did nothing good.
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.640]   All of the accusations that were brought against them
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.620]   were trumped up charges.
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.320]   We have record of the trials of Christ and of Paul,
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.140]   and all of the accusations were false charges.
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.460]   They were lies that were brought against them in court.
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.300]   We don't know, we don't have the record of Paul's final trial,
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.340]   but we have the record of several of his trials
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.960]   before Festus and Felix, I think,

[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.960]   lead an insurrection against the regime.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.920]   This is because God has commanded the lesser magistrate
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.320]   to obey his civil law,
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:41.320]   and thus the lesser magistrate has a duty to perform in this regard.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:44.420]   If he is forced to declare his independence from the larger
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:44.420]   and lesser magistrates,
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:44.420]   from the larger and the lesser magistrates,
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:44.420]   the lesser magistrate has a duty to perform in this regard.
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:44.420]   If he is forced to declare his independence from the larger
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:45:14.440]   regime,
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:14.440]   He does not do so in the interest of maintaining his own rights,
[00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:16.920]   which do not adhere to the theology of the Reformation.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:20.680]   American individualism has given rise to the belief that there are,
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:22.020]   in the New Testament period,
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:26.020]   no longer legitimate office-bearers on earth to whom we are to give rear.
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:27.040]   Thus,
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:31.420]   a large number of Christians today are convinced that there are no real offices in the church
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:32.040]   or state,
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.840]   but only people carrying out various special functions.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.120]   This thinking is anti-covenantal,
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:41.200]   and naturally is found in Baptist circles far more readily than in Reformation churches,
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:44.460]   where the concept of covenant headship and submission for conscience
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:44.460]   and submission for conscience
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:44.460]   is not a concept that is found in the church.
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:44.460]   Where the concept of covenant headship and submission for conscience
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:44.460]   is not found in Baptist circles far more readily than in Reformation churches,
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:44.460]   where the concept of covenant headship and submission for conscience
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:44.460]   is not found in the church.
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:46:14.480]  ,
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:14.480]   and this has implications not only for the doctrine of baptism,
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:14.480]   but also for the doctrine of the right of revolution.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:14.480]   Point number four: Tax strikes ignore the New Testament principle of invisibility and cooperation. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus told his people to be pleasant and cooperative with oppressive authorities, so as to remain invisible and thus able to work in peace. Nothing is clearer than his commands.
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:44.500]   But I say to you,
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:44.500]   Do not resist him who is evil.
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:44.500]   Do not resist him who is evil.
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:44.500]   Do not resist him who is evil.
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:44.500]   Chapter 5, verses 40-41
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:44.500]   Chapter 5, verses 40-41
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:44.500]   Was it right for the Roman authorities to steal shirts from the local population?
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:44.500]   Was it right for the state to force men to leave their jobs and carry a soldier's uniform?
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:44.500]   Was it right for the state to force men to leave their jobs and carry a soldier's uniform?
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:44.500]   Was it right for the state to force men to leave their jobs and carry a soldier's uniform?
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:44.500]   Was it right for the state to force men to leave their jobs and carry a soldier's uniform?
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:44.500]   Was it right for the state to force men to leave their jobs and carry a soldier's uniform?
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:44.500]   Was it right for the state to force men to leave their jobs and carry a soldier's uniform?
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:47:14.500]   I'm going to ask you a question.
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:14.520]   I'm going to ask you a question.
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:14.520]   Is it right for the state to make a citizen to keep their children from their home?
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:14.520]   Is it right for the state to make a citizen to keep their children from their home?
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:14.520]   Is it right for the state to make a citizen to keep their children from their home?
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:14.520]   Is it right for the state to make a citizen to keep their children from their home?
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:44.540]   Is it right for the state to make a citizen to keep their children from their home?
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:44.540]   The state tends to leave people alone who cooperate with it,
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:44.540]   The state tends to leave people alone who cooperate with it,
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:44.540]   The state tends to leave people alone who cooperate with it,
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:44.540]   and peace is an indispensable prerequisite for social progress and economic advancement.
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:44.540]   The longer the kingdom is left alone, the better chance it has to grow.
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:44.540]   Second, invisibility is gained, since the anti-Christian state tends to ignore people who are not in flagrant rebellion.
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:44.540]   Invisibility allows the Christian counterculture to develop to great strength, unnoticed.
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:44.540]   Third, evangelism is enhanced, since the soldier will marvel when you carry his armor
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:44.540]   and the soldier will marvel when you carry his armor and the soldier will marvel when you carry his armor
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:44.540]   unnoticed.
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:48:14.560]  , and the soldier will marvel when you carry his armor and the soldier will marvel when you carry his armor
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:14.560]   and the soldier will marvel when you carry his armor and the soldier will marvel when you carry his armor
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:14.560]   and the soldier will marvel when you carry his armor and the soldier will marvel when you carry his armor and the soldier will be a good man.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:14.560]   and the soldier will marvel when you carry his armor and the soldier will be a good man.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:14.560]   and the soldier will marvel when you carry his armor and the soldier will be a good man.

[00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:40.220]   educai as the primary means of cultural transformation, though not the exclusive means. At present, Christian politicians can accomplish little to change the course of events. They can, however, use their offices and their campaigns as opportunities to witness and educate. Once the consensus of opinion in the United States has once again become Christian, the political order and its taxation will change in response. Tax strikers often argue that in the United States,
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:40.220]   ÐšÐ¾Ñ€,
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:51:10.240]  ,

In this case, the striker will make it plain that when push comes to shove, he will pay his taxes and submit, but that he is trying to get a test case before the courts. If, by its actions, the United States government shows that it is a pure tyranny, then we must submit to it and

In this case, the striker will make it plain that when push comes to shove, he will pay his taxes and submit, but that he is trying to get a test case before the courts. If, by its actions, the United States government shows that it is a pure tyranny, then we must submit to it and,
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:14.220]   as Israel had to submit to Rome. We are not to that point yet, however.
[00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:40.260]   Point number six. Tax strikes resist the judgment of God. As the United States has voted itself into sin, God has increased his judgments against us. One of his primary means of judgment is to put an oppressive state over a sinful people. If we recognize that we have sinned, the proper response is to be mute under the chastening hand of God and not rebel. If the United States is ruled by a sinful people, then we must submit to it and,
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:40.260]   If the United States is ruled by a sinful people, then we must submit to it and,
