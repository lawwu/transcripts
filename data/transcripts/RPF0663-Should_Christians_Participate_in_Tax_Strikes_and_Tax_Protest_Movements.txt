[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.160]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.400]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.520]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. Yesterday on the show,
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.160]   I talked to you about why is Joshua so anti-tax. But that show was largely philosophical. I talked
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.040]   about a little bit of theory, some moral theory, some governmental theory, political theory, etc.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.600]   And you're welcome to listen to that show, but it wasn't particularly practical.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.600]   I just talked about theory, but we talked about things that really you and I have no chance to
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.360]   affect. It's just a theoretical discussion that I think is worth thinking about, to ask ourselves
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.800]   if we're complicit in things that are immoral. But I didn't go into any detail about anything
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.320]   practical. I thought today, however, it would be interesting to talk about tax protesting and tax
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.880]   evasion, because I made the comment in yesterday's show that I don't personally support or practice
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.360]   any kind of tax evasion, the willful, intentional non-payment of taxes that are legally owed.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.960]   By way of reminder, there are two words that we use in tax planning. We use the word tax
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.560]   avoidance, which is simply choosing to arrange your affairs in a way that you avoid a tax that
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.160]   is due, and tax evasion, which is willfully and intentionally not paying a tax that is legally
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:43.120]   owed. So an example would be tax avoidance would be if taxes, if you live on the line of a place
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.120]   where there are no state income taxes and gas is five cents cheaper, then you can go over the state
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.280]   line and you fill up your car where the gas is five cents cheaper. You're avoiding the tax, the
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.600]   high tax in your state. Tax evasion would be doing something like going and using non-taxed off-road
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.640]   fuel and putting that in your on-road vehicle, which then drive on the vehicle, which is
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.560]   technically illegal. It's not illegal to cross the state line and buy your things there where the
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:16.080]   taxes are lower. It is illegal to use off-highway diesel fuel in your on-highway vehicle. So with
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.840]   regard to income taxes, tax avoidance simply means choosing to do something like put money into an
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.240]   IRA to avoid the tax on a certain amount of income. Tax evasion means not telling the IRS about
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.800]   $5,000 of income that you earned in cash from side work. Now this distinction is important because
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.920]   when we talk about tax protesting, we have a number of different techniques that you can choose from.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:50.160]   Tax protesting means not paying a tax out of protest for what it is. And this is not a new
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.560]   subject here on Radical Personal Finance. If we were to go all the way back to, I think, episode 17
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:05.280]   in July of 2014, July 10, 2014, I interviewed David Gross, who is the author of the book
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.600]   99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns. And the title of that episode was "Should I Stop
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.720]   Paying My Taxes on Moral Grounds?" David Gross is a tax protester, specifically a war tax protester,
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.760]   after the United States' invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan back in after the September 11,
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.920]   2001 terrorist attacks, he stopped paying his taxes to protest the war effort. And although,
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.080]   by my assessment, it seems that the current war tax resistance movement is pretty weak in the
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.480]   United States, I'm not aware of it being any significant political movement at the moment,
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.240]   there is a significant history in US American culture of war tax protesters. David writes
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.760]   extensively about his experiences. I like David. I've read his writing over the years. I think he
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.280]   does a good job of following these issues. If you're interested, you can read his work at
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:05.200]   sniggle.net, s-n-i-g-g-l-e.net. That's his website that he curates on these topics. The challenge is
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.520]   that war tax protesting or tax protesting in general can be an extra challenge for Christians.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.520]   And this show is primarily targeted towards the audience of Radical Personal Finance that
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.560]   identifies as Christian. You're, of course, welcome to tune in if that's not you. But
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:27.840]   tax resistance is very difficult for Christians because, on the one hand, there's an obvious
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.920]   moral horror at many of the things that are done with tax money. The most obvious example would be
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.920]   the war machine of the United States and many other governments. The behavior of the US military,
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.640]   the unjust and immoral wars that are constantly prosecuted by the US military, bringing death to
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.960]   millions of people all around the world, are obviously immoral, obviously completely antithetical
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.440]   to the teachings of Jesus. And so for Christians who try to look at this and say, "How do I
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   reconcile the fact that my tax dollars are going to support this military empire?" It can be very,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.600]   very difficult because you look at the behavior of the military empire and it turns your stomach.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.320]   And you don't want to be complicit. You don't want to have your money involved in it.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:26.480]   But the challenge is there are a number of very clear teachings in Christianity by the major
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:35.360]   prophets and founders of the faith that very clearly teach submission to government authority
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:42.000]   and the payment of taxes. And if you look at the environments and the governments that these men
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.360]   were dealing with, it's hard to say that they had it tougher than we do. You can begin with
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:54.000]   Jesus Christ himself, who was executed without cause, without any kind of justice, was executed
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.840]   by the government of his day. And yet Jesus taught very clearly to pay taxes. "Give to Caesar what is
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:07.520]   Caesar's and give to God what is God's." Paul also very clearly taught to pay taxes. Paul also
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:17.120]   executed completely without cause by the Roman Empire. Peter, "Honor the emperor, give to all,
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.160]   honor the emperor." In 1 Peter 2, "Honor everyone, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the emperor."
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:30.080]   And yet Peter also executed by the government of his day. Now, I don't know how you get much
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:36.320]   clearer than dealing with men who were executed by the government of their day when they did
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:42.000]   nothing wrong. They did nothing other than preach a gospel message, preaching the gospel of Jesus
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.840]   Christ. Christ, of course, preaching his own gospel. Paul and Peter preaching the gospel of
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:53.280]   Jesus Christ. They went about doing good, delivering people from demons, healing hundreds
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.760]   or thousands of people. We don't know exactly, but at least thousands of people collectively.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:04.000]   And did nothing good. All of the accusations that were brought against them were trumped-up
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.120]   charges. We have record of the trials of Christ and of Paul, and all of the accusations were
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:17.360]   false charges. They were lies that were brought against them in court. We don't know, we don't
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.440]   have the record of Paul's final trial, but we have the record of several of his trials before
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:28.000]   Festus and Felix, I think, before he ultimately went to Caesar. We have record of his defense
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.200]   before King Agrippa in Jerusalem. So, when you look at the, and study what these men were facing,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.680]   they certainly had a lot to be upset about with the government of their day. We don't have,
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.320]   of course, the record of Peter's trial, but we do know that he was executed by the government.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:55.680]   So, it seems a little bit difficult for those of us in the modern era who are frustrated with
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.440]   the immoral behavior of our governments to turn and appeal to the Bible as a defense and say,
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.160]   "Well, things were better back then." They just don't know what we're talking about. No,
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.680]   it's the exact opposite. You know, in those days you had Christians being doused in oil
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.560]   and used as human candle in candles in Nero's garden. It's hard to say that they didn't,
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.360]   they had it, you know, easier than we do. We have such an easy, cushy life that it's not
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:28.800]   even worth comparison. It's not even worth the comparison. So, but yet still you have this
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:35.040]   challenge, and I think a new challenge, especially a challenge that certainly Christians in half a
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:40.240]   dozen states at least are facing is, "How can I be complicit and involved in the abortion of
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:46.960]   children?" In general, your involvement of your tax dollars in the military empire of the United
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.720]   States is the same no matter what state you live in, or even if you live outside the country. If
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.000]   you're a citizen of the United States, your money is involved in that. But then, of course,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.400]   there's an increasing usage of tax monies to fund abortion. I find that issue particularly difficult,
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:06.640]   particularly challenging. There are a number of Christian tax protesters who are not paying taxes
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:12.000]   because of the state's involvement in abortion. And there's a very real chance that in the coming
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.200]   years there may be, if a Democratic president wins the presidency in the previous election,
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.680]   all of the Democrats, both, in that case it was Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders,
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.880]   pledged to repeal the Hyde Amendment. I haven't seen or noticed any public statements by this
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.760]   raft of Democratic candidates, but I would assume that in time they would make that pledge publicly
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:37.280]   as well. And so it can be, it may be very difficult. We may be in a situation a couple
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:43.120]   of years from now, if there is a change in the political party, where we face some difficult
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:49.200]   choices. And so I thought it'd be useful to talk about tax protesting, both big picture and then
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:55.040]   a little bit theologically, to give you an idea and get you thinking about the topic. Now, the
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.880]   first thing I want to point out is that there are different ways and models of tax protesting.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:10.080]   Oftentimes people assume that tax protesting means that I simply, I owe the IRS $15,000 and I don't
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:16.560]   pay it, right? And many people rightly have trouble with that. But in studying the issue over the
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.320]   years, I came to the conclusion there are a number of different ways that you could engage in tax
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:26.720]   protesting. I'll use David Gross as an example. David Gross practices two different methods of
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:34.240]   tax protesting. The first thing that he does is he keeps his earned income below a level of taxation
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:40.960]   for his federal income taxes. When he decided to become a tax protester, that was the first
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:46.320]   strategy that he chose to employ. Now, in the United States, based upon the way the tax code
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:53.600]   works, you can use the provisions of the tax code. And as long as your earned income is below
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:11:06.000]   the level of federal taxation, you can avoid owing any income tax. So David Gross is self-employed,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   he runs a business. And so of course, in a business you have your gross income. Let's
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.280]   say that you earn $50,000 of gross income. Funny, gross income, David Gross. You have $50,000 of
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:24.400]   gross income. Then you additionally have some level of business expenses. Let's say that you
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.680]   have $10,000 of business expenses that are associated with that. So now you have $40,000
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:35.840]   of net income. Then of course, you could do something like make a $10,000 401(k) contribution,
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:42.480]   which would then drop your income from $40,000 to $30,000 of income. And then for a single
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.520]   taxpayer in the United States, I don't remember exactly what the numbers are for this year,
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:50.080]   David does a good job of calculating it each year. But if you have $30,000 of annual income,
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:55.280]   then you're not going to owe any federal income taxes on that, waste upon the personal allowances
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.160]   and exemptions, et cetera. And so you could, in that situation, you could effectively earn
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:08.320]   $40,000 of net profit from your business and not pay any income taxes legally using those means.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:14.160]   You haven't broken any law. You haven't run the risk of going to prison. You haven't done anything
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:21.520]   except use the law that exists, but yet lower your earned income. That type of strategy is the type
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.320]   of strategy I think is usually the first place, especially that Christians would go. Because as
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:32.560]   you're seeking to balance honoring the emperor and being a good citizen of the king, while also
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.440]   registering your protest, you want to be careful about breaking the law. It's hard for Christians
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:45.120]   to be openly defiant and say, "I'm going to break the law." And so that's one thing that you could
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.520]   consider. And I think that a lot of what we talk about on Radical Personal Finance really could
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:56.080]   fit into those kinds of strategies. For example, if I wanted to become a tax protester, but I
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:02.480]   wanted to live in the United States, I could avoid most federal income taxes through putting these
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.680]   methods together. If you understand business taxes, if you are self-employed, if you understand the
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:15.200]   proper legal documented business expense deductions, if you understand how to live frugally,
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.760]   you're not going to be riding around in your private airplane, but you could live frugally,
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:27.920]   if you understand the various tax exemptions and the activities that are not tax intensive.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:33.760]   For example, maybe you build your own house. That gives you a distinct monetary value,
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.840]   but you wind up at the end of it with a debt-free house that you build yourself,
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.120]   and you can maintain a lower income but still have a high standard of living.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:46.080]   You garden. Well, the government doesn't tax the food that you harvest from your garden. They don't
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:50.480]   tax the rabbits that you raise in your backyard, so you can feed your family while needing a lower
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:57.040]   level of income. As long as you keep your income below the level of taxation, you could, in effect,
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:04.960]   pay no federal income taxes using that particular process. If you have children, you get some tax
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.280]   credits for those children, and so you have a slightly more generous ability to earn income,
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.800]   and you could always just adjust your income and just simply choose not to work. You could take
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:18.720]   your time, and instead of using your time to be engaged in paid activities, you could take your
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:24.000]   time and you could invest it into activities that you're not paid for. There are many productive
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.800]   ways for you to use your time and energy and not be paid, and yet still have an impact, still be
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:35.520]   busy, and still be productive while not paying federal income taxes. You can do that following
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.840]   the law. Well, that's a perfectly reasonable and acceptable form of tax protesting.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:47.360]   Now, David Gross's story is interesting. He went through a phase. He did that for a number of years,
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:51.040]   and then he ultimately decided to stop paying his self-employment taxes.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:56.960]   And this is the other wrinkle, because the challenge is that because of the multifold nature
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:02.240]   of the US tax system, you're going to have multiple taxes that you have to deal with.
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:07.040]   You have to deal with your federal income taxes. That's one set of tax planning. But then you have
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:12.400]   to deal with your employment taxes or your self-employment taxes. The employment taxes are
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:18.960]   the 15.3% that you pay of your income as a self-employed person that goes to fund Medicare,
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:25.200]   Medicaid, and Social Security. And then, or if you're an employee, it's the 7.65% of your income
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:30.240]   that you contribute from your paycheck and the 7.65% of your income that your employer contributes
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.000]   towards your Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. And this again brings in another
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.800]   interesting ethical dilemma. If you're protesting war taxes, you can make a decent argument that,
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:45.440]   "Hey, I'm not funding the war effort when I'm funding Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid."
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:50.080]   But if you have a different point of protest, for example, let's assume that you were protesting
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:54.960]   the use of Medicaid funds to provide for abortion. Well, now all of a sudden,
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:01.120]   your employment taxes are a lot more tricky. Well, David Gross, after a number of years of
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.520]   doing things with simply lowering his income, he went on and stopped paying his self-employment
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:11.120]   taxes. So he went all the way. And so his is a combination of tax protesting methodologies.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:16.720]   Part of his practice is to not pay federal income taxes simply because he doesn't owe them,
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.560]   but then he doesn't pay his self-employment taxes, although technically the government
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:25.920]   says that he owes those taxes. And that's where we cross the line. You cross into different
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:32.480]   strategies. Am I going to practice those techniques that are considered to be illegal,
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.360]   that I could be prosecuted, I could be sued for, or am I going to stay with techniques that are
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:43.280]   legal? Now, I don't know that there's a right answer on these things. It's a matter of conscience,
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:51.360]   and it is a difficult question because there seem to be things that are pooling in multiple ways.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:59.360]   First thing I guess is I would say you could, there's a decent strength to the argument that
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:07.280]   it's not your fault. For example, taxes are not optional. When you live somewhere,
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:12.880]   and when the government that has jurisdiction over where you live tells you you have to do this,
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:19.120]   you can make a very clear and strong and compelling argument that this is not optional.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:24.080]   This money is being stolen from me. And if it's being used to do things that I think are immoral,
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:28.720]   it's being used to fund a military empire, it's being used to murder babies, it's being used for
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:34.000]   medical practices that I think are immoral. Canadian Christians face far more challenges
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.520]   with this than US Christians. Many European Christians face bigger challenges with
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:44.640]   the medical practices that are practiced and paid for by the national healthcare systems.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.240]   But you could say, "Listen, the money was taken from me, and so I don't have moral responsibility
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:56.480]   for that. It was taken from me without my vote." So the analogy that I would compare this to would
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:02.400]   be to simply say, "Let's assume that you have a car, and the car is sitting in your driveway,
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:07.200]   but then one night a thief comes and takes the car, and then they use the car in a terrorist
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.200]   attack to mow over a bunch of people at the green market on Saturday morning in your town,
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:18.080]   and they kill a bunch of people using your car. Well, you're not morally complicit in the murder
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.560]   of those people by the terrorist because they stole your car. It's your car. You didn't do
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.680]   anything wrong. Your car was locked. It was protected. It was in your driveway. The guy
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.240]   stole your car, and he used that car to murder a bunch of people." So morally, you could reason
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:36.880]   and say, "I'm also no longer complicit in the murder of people with the government's war
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:42.160]   machine. The money was taken from me. It was stolen from me without my ability to resist.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.400]   It was taken. If I resisted, they'd put me in prison and take it anyway. Take my stuff."
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:51.280]   So it was taken from me without the ability to resist. The money was then used to fund this
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:56.800]   airplane that's dropping bombs on these people, and it was used to blow up a wedding,
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:05.280]   and now there's 10 people dead here in the compound, and my money funded it, but it wasn't
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:10.560]   my choice. I'm not morally complicit. I think that's a strong argument. I do. But for a lot
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.840]   of people, it doesn't feel quite right because just because you're not morally complicit doesn't
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.400]   mean that you're not actively fighting against something. And you look at the great atrocities
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:25.360]   that are committed over the years, and you think, "Shouldn't somebody have actively fought
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:33.520]   against this?" I recently read an interesting book called Unbroken, a World War II story of—was
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:39.920]   Unbroken, a World War II story of survival, resilience, and redemption. The author is Laura
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:46.640]   Hillebrand, and she wrote this book about the life primarily of a man named Louis Zamparini,
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:55.360]   who, among other things, was an American aviator who was shot down in the South Pacific during
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:01.840]   World War II and eventually became a prisoner of war in the Japanese prisoner of war camps.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.720]   And what's interesting is for those of—in general, those of us who are exposed to a general
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:12.880]   study of history, we don't really know much about the Pacific theater of operations during World
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:17.840]   War II. Because of the European—the importance of the European theater with D-Day and the
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.480]   concentration camps and Hitler, we're super focused on that history. And so we tend to go
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:27.920]   to concentration camps of Jews rather than thinking about the Japanese. But this book—and I would
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:32.480]   strongly recommend it to you, I really enjoyed it—but this book profiles and discusses, among
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:37.360]   other things, what happened in the Japanese prisoner of war camps. And it was interesting
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:45.360]   because it was, of course, just untold cruelty by the Japanese soldiers who were in charge of
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.760]   the prisoner of war camps. And yet there were people who were in those prisoner of war camps,
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.680]   and perhaps around, who were trying to help the prisoners in some way. There were a few people
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.720]   who were kind. And I've often thought, what if I had been Japanese and I had been living there?
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:05.280]   Would I have had the moral courage to stand up for the proper treatment of people? And of course,
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:10.240]   you'd think, well, probably not. You know, they didn't, and there was a reason they didn't,
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.800]   so I probably wouldn't have either. Like, I'm not special, I'm no different than anybody else.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.520]   I probably would have gone along to get along just like just about anybody does.
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.120]   So then you look at your own day and you bring it back and you say,
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:28.080]   but the fact that they didn't stand up when people were being tortured, when people were
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:34.400]   being abused, the fact that they didn't stand up is a stain on the Japanese culture of that day.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:41.280]   And yet, is there something that I should be standing up for right now that'll be a stain on,
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:47.360]   say, the American culture when it's reflected back on in 50 years? And, you know, the obvious
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:53.920]   examples are the American military occupations of other places and the untold hundreds of thousands
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.560]   of people, innocent civilians who've been killed in the various wars that the US government
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:04.320]   prosecutes, and the murder of hundreds of 60 million people in the United States with abortion.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:09.520]   And you think, how am I going to reflect back on this 40 years from now and say about what I've
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.600]   done today? Am I going to say, well, my money was taken from me and there was nothing I could do
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.120]   about it? Or is there something that I can do about it? And that's where you get into the,
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:22.080]   one of the strategies some people would go to would be tax protesting. And you say, well,
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:27.360]   I should actively do something active. So yes, the money's taken from me, but at least this would be
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.360]   one thing that I could actively do to try to starve the beast a little bit. And it seems,
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.080]   there seems like that's a good argument, seems compelling.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:41.200]   Now, let me just lay out for you briefly your options, because I thought a lot about this
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:48.400]   a number of years ago. And what's particularly difficult is when you look at the way that tax
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:54.240]   protesters are generally treated if they don't win, right? Because if you win, the victors write
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.680]   the history books and everything is fine. But if you don't win and you look at the way that
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:03.040]   protesters are treated, it's pretty tough. And one of the things that certainly has changed for me,
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.480]   they say that people who fight wars are young men with no families and old men, right? Who don't
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:15.920]   have anything to lose. But I'm in the stage where it's the least, I'm the least likely candidate to
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:22.000]   be an activist or a protester, etc. Simply because of my family responsibilities. And you think,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.920]   I'm not going to get involved in that, they'll lock me up. You look at the people who have been
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:33.360]   locked up over the years and who made well-meaning, I think, very sound arguments on many things,
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:39.040]   but yet doesn't matter. The person, the government has all the guns, wins. And if they have the guns
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.680]   and they have the general support of the population, they win. I always think of Erwin Schiff,
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:49.840]   locked up, died in prison. He made, I thought, pretty decent arguments, but it doesn't matter.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:54.320]   It doesn't matter how decent your arguments are, you still wind up locked up and dead in prison.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.320]   And so when you have young children, you think, "What good do I do? Anybody locked up in prison."
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:03.600]   Puts things into perspective and you say, "It doesn't seem like a particularly good strategy."
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:07.680]   So I thought a lot about it and I thought, "What are the options?" And so I'll just lay them out
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:12.800]   for you and then we'll talk a little bit about the theology of tax protesting. So far as I see it,
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:17.520]   you have two basic techniques or you have two basic choices first. The first choice is,
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:23.920]   do you want to stay in the legal jurisdiction of the taxing government or do you want to leave
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:30.240]   the legal jurisdiction of the taxing government? Because the reality is you always have a choice
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:36.160]   to stay or to leave. And for much of my life, I never thought you had a choice. And then one day
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:41.680]   I was thinking about it and I realized, no, you do have a choice. And a peaceful solution that
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:45.600]   almost anybody has available to them, if you're involved in something that could be a potential
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:50.880]   conflict, is to peacefully leave. And I think the strategy and the practice of leaving,
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:58.160]   of withdrawing your support, is one of the most effective strategies that in time can lead to
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:07.040]   change of an organization. So if you're part of a company that is not engaging in what you consider
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:13.360]   to be moral and ethical behavior or business practices, you can leave and that company will
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.840]   not have your services. Now you can try to change things from the inside first, and I think in
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.240]   general we probably have some responsibility to do that, or at least it's a good thing to do that,
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:27.440]   it demonstrates your care for other people. And so you might choose to become an advocate for
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.600]   something, try to be an outspoken person inside, and it might be that you can make some change
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.920]   from the inside, but ultimately if you judge that no change is going to happen, you can leave,
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:40.720]   you can leave that company. Similar thing, let's say you're involved in an organization and the
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:44.880]   organization is not doing something, or you're involved in church and the church is not doing
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:50.800]   what you believe is right to do. Well, your best option, often, I think especially in a church,
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:55.840]   you owe a duty of opening your mouth and seeking to correct the thing that is wrong,
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:01.840]   but you can just simply leave. And leaving is particularly powerful. First, leaving is obvious.
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:05.840]   Leaving shows that you're serious, you put your actions where your mouth were.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:13.520]   Your loss of your presence will be very clear. Your contributions will be gone, your money will
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:19.520]   be gone, your skills are gone, your talent's gone, your promotion is gone, and that makes a statement.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:24.400]   Now, you can never be sure that your particular statement will be the one that is heard,
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:29.760]   but it certainly does make a statement. And if other people don't come in and replace you in time,
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:36.160]   the leaving strategy is entirely peaceful, and yet it makes a difference. You can see companies that
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:41.520]   are hollowed out by employees leaving. You can see churches that are hollowed out by people simply
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:45.920]   leaving. You look and study the religious atmosphere. I follow it closely in the United
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.560]   States of different denominations, et cetera. And you can just see how the mainline liberal
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:57.360]   Protestant denominations just utterly hollowed out. You can see so many of the Catholic,
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:04.080]   what's it called, seminaries, totally hollowed out. The priests aren't coming. And that leaving
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:10.800]   has an effect. It leaves certain things. Now, you're not systematically destroying something,
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:15.840]   it's just leaving. And so you always have this choice, of course, with government, or you usually
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:20.560]   have this choice, again, with government, where you can just simply leave. You can leave the
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:26.080]   government or you can stay. Now, if you're going to stay and you don't want to pay taxes, you have,
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:31.040]   as I consider it, two basic options. You can use techniques that are so-called legal,
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:39.120]   use legal techniques to reduce or eliminate your tax bill, or you can conscientiously choose not
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:46.480]   to pay, even though you legally owe the tax. So legal techniques that you could use to reduce
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:50.320]   and eliminate your tax bill. First thing that you could do is you could use legal deductions
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:57.520]   and credits to lower your taxable income below the tax base. That is one practical, useful strategy.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:02.320]   Use the legal deductions and credits that are part and parcel staples of good financial planning,
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:07.760]   good tax planning, to lower your taxable income below the tax base. You can use legal investment
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.680]   techniques to lower your taxable income below the tax base. So you can just use investment
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:15.440]   techniques. There are many available. I've talked about a number of ways that you can generate tax
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:20.720]   free income. You can do tax free investing. It can range from the simple, you buy muni bonds
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:26.800]   instead of taxable stocks. You buy real estate and you make sure that you have the appropriate
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:31.280]   strategy in place to never pay taxes on your real estate. And it'd be very possible to do.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:37.440]   Or you can work less and/or earn less income to lower your taxable income below the tax base.
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:44.160]   So you can, instead of investing your time into activities that generate $150,000 of net income,
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:49.040]   you can invest your time into activities that generate $40,000 of net income and then invest
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:53.280]   the rest of your time into things that are productive but simply don't generate income.
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:58.720]   So those are your legal techniques to reduce or eliminate your tax bill. And I think here,
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:06.240]   everything that we talk about in radical personal finance lines up with those. Again,
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:12.160]   practice techniques with frugality, even extreme frugality. One of the things that,
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:16.640]   as I've profiled and talked about different kind of extreme frugalists, Charles Long,
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:22.240]   Jacob Lund Fisker, Amy Decision, and I studied their works and their commentary. What you find
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:28.800]   is that if you are committed to extreme frugality, it has the side benefit of allowing you to live
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:35.440]   a really great life without a lot of cost, which means you don't need much income. And it's very,
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:41.280]   very tax efficient. Interestingly, it can also actually be very profitable because
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.840]   if we go in the direction where welfare programs go, if you participate in those, which
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:52.080]   is its own moral quandary, do I participate or not? But if you do participate in those things,
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:58.000]   you wind up lowering your income is one of the best things. I shelved the show, I decided not
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.080]   to do it, but I did a whole analysis of how to live well and yet using all the government programs.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.800]   By somebody who is intelligent, but just simply knew how to work the numbers and chose not to
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:14.720]   invest their time into productive remunerated activities, but just simply to be a leech and
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:19.120]   live off the dole. I think it's bad for the character, which I don't really wish to popularize
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:23.600]   it, but you could study it and you could do the same thing. So those are legal techniques that
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:29.840]   you can use to reduce or eliminate your tax bill. The challenge there is some taxes are easier to do
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.080]   that with another. So federal income taxes is straightforward. Self-employment taxes or employment
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:39.280]   taxes is much more difficult. Now there are a few ways that you could do that, ways that you could
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:44.560]   legally eliminate self-employment taxes, but it's much more challenging. Then the second thing that
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:50.800]   you could do is you could conscientiously choose not to pay even though you legally owe. And there
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:55.600]   are different ways that this is done. So some people choose not to send a representative portion
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:00.480]   of their tax to the government. So they calculate their taxes and they say this percentage of my,
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:06.640]   I have a $10,000 tax bill, this percentage here, this thousand dollars is what would ordinarily
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:13.200]   fund the war machine. So as a point of protest, I'm not going to send you this thousand dollars.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:18.880]   I'm going to send you $9,000 and instead I'm either keeping the thousand dollars or I'm making
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:25.200]   a thousand dollar donation to an anti-war charity to try to counteract the military empire that
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.920]   you've established. That would be one strategy where you choose not to send a representative
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:34.800]   portion of your tax to the government. The second example would be you choose not to send any of
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:40.560]   your tax to the government and instead you keep it or you give it to a charity that actively
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:46.320]   counteracts the actions you oppose. Again, you owe $10,000, you say I'm not sending it to you,
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:52.000]   but I'm going to give it to my local church or I'm going to send it to a church that's in Iraq
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.400]   that needs money, that needs support, who's trying to minister to the people that you're bombing
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:01.600]   and we're going to send it there instead and things like that. But all of those things keep
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:06.560]   you in the legal jurisdiction of the taxing government. Or the second option is that you
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:12.560]   could leave the legal jurisdiction of the taxing government and then again by leaving using
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:18.640]   techniques discussed on this show, you can either legally reduce or eliminate the taxes that you owe.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:26.080]   When I talked about for US taxpayers, if I talked about moving abroad, you can use those techniques
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:33.440]   using the foreign earned income exclusion to eliminate the federal income tax on your first
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:39.360]   $105,000-ish of income. So now if you're going to be a tax protester, it becomes a little bit
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:44.400]   simpler for you to figure out how to earn a little bit more money so you're not left destitute earning
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:50.240]   $30,000 in the United States to follow the law. But by living outside of the United States,
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:56.160]   you avoid the income tax on your $105,000. It also clears up, if you work for a foreign corporation,
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:01.840]   it clears up the problem of owing those self-employment taxes. And so you can effectively
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:06.880]   live tax-free with regard to the United States. Maybe you move to a country where their government
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:13.040]   is not involved in some of the actions that you think are wrong or you move to a tax haven and
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:17.520]   you don't owe taxes to the tax haven or you live on a sailboat or whatever you do. You become a
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:25.840]   PT or however you handle it. But it's very doable for you to practice those techniques. Very, very
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:31.200]   doable. And so that may be one way that you can follow the law. And I've always found that some
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:37.200]   of those things are, at least I've found for me, that it solves, at least having that as an option,
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:43.840]   solves some of my moral consternation over those questions. Because in that way,
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:49.360]   you can engage in an effective form of tax protesting by not paying the taxes,
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:55.840]   but by not breaking the law, you can also satisfy your conscience of not breaking the law. And that
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:03.440]   to me is important. So I consider that. That's just an overview of tax protesting. It's not a
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.200]   particularly popular subject. Most people don't think about it. Most people don't care. Most
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:13.520]   people don't seem to even reason about the stuff. But there are some. And I really respect, I have
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:19.200]   a lot of respect for tax protesters. There are tax protesters from many traditions. There are
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:23.840]   some religious tax protesters, there are some that are not. David Gross is not a Christian,
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:29.920]   he's not religious at all. But you really appreciate, I really appreciate somebody who
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:37.520]   is willing to stand for their convictions. You really appreciate that. And so I admire people
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:45.040]   who feel that conviction. But as far as I can see, it's a matter of dealing straight with the
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:52.800]   scripture, and then also dealing straight with the scripture and dealing straight with your
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:59.360]   conscience. As far as I can see, there's a wide degree of individual saying of conscience. And
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:05.760]   then there's also a significant measure of wisdom being needed. Again, I think it's wisdom to stay
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:12.720]   out of prison. So you consider it. Now to the theology of tax strikes. I'm simply going here
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:18.960]   to read you an article that was published almost three decades ago, back in 1981, in the publication
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:26.160]   Biblical Economics Today. And the author of this publication was a popular author on these topics
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:32.640]   named James Jordan. And he wrote this article called "The Christian and Tax Strikes, Pros and
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:40.160]   Cons." And I've read other things on this, but I thought this was a fairly fair discussion and
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.840]   raised good points. So if you're a Christian and you've ever thought about tax strikes,
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:49.920]   again, to my experience, in general, my answer is, for me, is in general, Christians shouldn't
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:56.080]   participate in tax strikes. But I think there can be circumstances. And you study church history,
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:01.040]   and there are circumstances many times where you find a group of people that really wrestled with
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:06.240]   it and came to the conclusion, "No, we cannot, we can't do this." And they tried to find solutions
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:13.200]   to that. And so my personal opinion is that, in general, don't participate in a tax strike.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:17.760]   It's unwise, and I'll read these discussions and arguments to you in a moment. But there
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:24.240]   might be exceptions. And so it's not one of those very clear, all the way things.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:29.760]   So here's the article called "The Christian and Tax Strikes, Pros and Cons." The purpose of this
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:35.840]   essay is not to settle once and for all the matter to which it is addressed, but rather, hopefully,
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:40.480]   to set out some principles which will help the reader as he or she comes to grips with the tax
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:46.480]   rebellion of the 1980s. The basic thrust of the essay is this. The Bible clearly teaches that
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:51.680]   Christians are to submit to the powers that be and pay whatever taxes are required of them.
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:56.560]   But citizens of the United States of America, including Christians, may properly raise the
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:02.000]   question of just precisely what is required of them, and in raising this question may work for
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.440]   reform. That is to say, Christians are required to work within the system, as it were, even as
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:13.520]   they try to change the system itself. The bulk of this essay is devoted to reasons against engaging
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:19.440]   in tax strikes. By making the strongest possible case against tax rebellion, we will be unable to
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:25.520]   see clearly on what precise grounds we might possibly join the tax revolt. As the central
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:29.760]   government of the United States becomes more and more oppressive and evil, and as it takes more and
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:35.840]   more money from its citizens and uses that money to promote greater and greater evils, it is natural
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:40.000]   that the Christian conscience should rebel and should consider refusing to pay taxes.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.280]   The present civil government of the United States takes far more from its citizens in taxes than the
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:50.000]   blueprint for Christian society found in scripture allows it, and the present lords and bosses of
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.680]   America use that money to finance gross evils such as abortion and military aggression. Thus,
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:00.160]   it would seem at first glance that Christians should refuse to pay their taxes, both as a
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:05.200]   witness against these evils and as a means of avoiding complicity in their guilt. There are,
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:10.160]   however, strong scriptural considerations which lead to the opposite conclusion. The following
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:15.040]   lines of argument need to be taken seriously by anyone considering a refusal to pay taxes.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.400]   1. Tax strikes as a kingdom method are contrary to the teaching of Jesus.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:28.560]   In Matthew 22, verses 15-22, the Pharisees sought to entrap Jesus by asking him if it was lawful to
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:34.640]   give the pole tax to Caesar. Jesus rebuked their hypocrisy and declared to them that since Caesar's
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:39.840]   likeness and inscription were on the coins, they were to "render to Caesar the things that are
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:46.160]   Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." In context, that which is "rendered" is money,
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:51.680]   so the meaning is this, "pay your taxes to the state and your tithes to the Lord." Caesar's coin
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:57.840]   had on it an inscription which claimed that Caesar was divine. Jesus says that Caesar is due the tax,
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:04.080]   but not any divine honors. The issue is not to be fought over money, but over worship.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:10.880]   What this passage teaches is that although God's claim and God's law cover all of life,
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.480]   yet the proper point at which the kingdom of God is to be argued is the question of
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:20.480]   worship. It was wrong for Pharaoh to hold Israel in slavery in Egypt. Pharaoh was violating all
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:25.520]   kinds of divine laws by his action. All the same, when God challenged Pharaoh, he did not challenge
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:31.600]   him at the point of slavery or of oppressive taxation, but at the point of worship. (Exodus
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:36.800]   3.18 and following) Pharaoh was smart enough to know that if he granted Israel the right to worship
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:41.200]   their God and granted the legitimacy of that worship, then he could no longer claim to be a
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:46.880]   God himself. Pharaoh knew that all the cultural aspects of life are dependent on the fundamental
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:54.480]   question of "who is God?" Thus, Israel's liberation from Egypt was not fundamentally a political
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:40:00.880]   liberation. It was not gained by a work strike or a tax strike. True, lower taxes, righteous
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:05.840]   government, and Sabbath rest were the result of the deliverance, but they were not the means.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:11.760]   The issue was the gospel. Both the tax strike and liberation theology obscure this fact.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:19.600]   In Matthew 17, verses 24-27, it is not the Roman poll tax which is in view, but a temple tax which
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:25.120]   grew up during the intertestamental era, a variant of the Mosaic head tax in Exodus 30.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:30.320]   Jesus' teachings at this point is critical. He tells us that God's imposition of the head tax
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:34.880]   in the Old Covenant was a sign that the people were not fully sons of the kingdom,
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:40.320]   but in a sense were still strangers. "Sons of the household do not pay taxes," says Jesus.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:43.920]   Paul makes the same point in Galatians 4. In comparison to the privileges of the New Covenant,
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:48.400]   the members of the Old Covenant only experienced a kind of slavery. Of course, in comparison to
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:54.320]   the pagan world around them, ancient Israel was a nation of free men, sons of God. Having said that
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:59.920]   the sons of the kingdom do not pay taxes, Jesus goes on to say that they should be paid "to avoid
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:06.240]   giving offense." The tax money is provided in a miraculous manner which teaches us that all money
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:11.440]   is God's and we do not need to worry about coming up with more if we pay taxes to avoid giving
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:17.200]   offense. This passage constitutes a pledge to the sons of the kingdom that God will provide them the
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:22.720]   money to pay their taxes. Because the Christian is freed from bondage to money, he can pay taxes
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:29.520]   without worry. 2. Tax strikes as a kingdom method are contrary to the teaching of Paul.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:35.600]   For some well-intentioned Christians, Matthew 17 and 22 are not proof that tax strikes are
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:42.000]   unbiblical. They argue that all these passages pertain to are poll taxes, which is a far cry
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.440]   from the modern oppressive graduated income taxation. In Romans chapter 13 verse 7, however,
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:54.240]   we are told to pay to all "what is due them, tax to whom taxes due, custom to whom custom,
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:42:01.520]   fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor." This far more general command more clearly covers
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:08.800]   the modern tax situation. The general teaching of Romans chapter 13 verses 1 through 7 is unclear to
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:14.720]   many people and bears directly on our subject. In Romans chapter 12 verse 19, God commands us
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:20.000]   never to take our own personal revenge. But in Romans chapter 13 verse 4, God tells us that he
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.760]   has established the civil magistrate as his minister of vengeance. These two verses establish
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:31.760]   the important distinction between personal ethics and civil ethics. There are some things that it is
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:37.120]   right and proper for a civil magistrate to do, such as executing murderers, which are not at
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:42.880]   all proper for private persons to do, such as killing for revenge. In Romans chapter 13 verses
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:48.720]   1 and 2, Paul addresses private persons and tells them that it is their responsibility to submit to
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:56.320]   the powers that be. Even the worst rulers, Caesar, Staller, Stalin, Hitler, Idi Amin, Bokassa,
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:00.000]   are ordained by God and we are commanded to submit to them in the fear of God.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:07.520]   Those who resist rulers, we are told, are resisting God himself. This is the duty of private citizens.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:13.200]   On the other hand, in verse 4, Paul makes it plain that it is the magistrate's duty to submit to God
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:18.880]   and rule according to his law. Notice the difference. Citizens are to submit to rulers
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:24.240]   and rulers are to submit to God. We are not told that each Christian ought to obey God's civil law
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:28.800]   willy-nilly, trying to force the hand of the magistrate. Rather, we are told to submit to
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:34.160]   the existing order, pay our taxes, pray for the conversion of the magistrate, and proclaim the
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:41.280]   gospel to him and to all men. Paul does not say in verse 6, "pay taxes whenever rulers are servants
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:51.360]   of God," but rather he says to "pay taxes because rulers are servants of God," whether they know it
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:58.880]   or not. We pay taxes for conscience's sake, as unto the Lord, not as unto men. The only proper
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:04.480]   place for civil resistance is the proclamation of the gospel, Acts 5 29, and this includes
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:08.640]   proclaiming the gospel to our children and thus Christian schools. It does not include tax strikes.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:16.240]   Point 3. Tax strikes are disorderly. God is a God of order and it is sin which has brought disorder
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:21.680]   to the ordered cosmos that God set up. God's plan of redemption is designed to re-establish order
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:26.560]   in an orderly manner. This means that covenant headship must be respected as much as possible
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:31.360]   at all times. The theology of the Reformation recognized the distinction between the duties
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:37.040]   of citizens and the duties of officials as taught in scripture. Thus, the theology of the Reformation
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:42.080]   does not allow individual citizens to rebel against oppressive regimes. Rather, it is only
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:48.160]   an ordained civil magistrate who may, if all else fails, lead an insurrection against the regime.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:53.280]   This is because God has commanded the lesser magistrate to obey his civil law, and thus the
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:58.480]   lesser magistrate has a duty to perform in this regard. If he is forced to declare his independence
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:03.280]   from the larger regime, he does not do so in the interest of maintaining his own rights,
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:10.800]   but in the interest of fulfilling his duties. The "right of revolution" in Reformation theology
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:15.600]   is distinguished from modern humanistic revolutionary ideas then at two points.
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.960]   The question of who may revolt, only magistrates or anybody, and the question of the grounds of
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:28.000]   revolution, duties or rights. It is not surprising that the advocates of Christian tax strikes are
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.520]   mostly found in groups which do not adhere to the theology of the Reformation. American individualism
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:38.240]   has given rise to the belief that there are, in the New Testament period, no longer legitimate
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:43.520]   office-bearers on earth to whom we are to give rear. Thus, a large number of Christians today
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:48.320]   are convinced that there are no real offices in the church or state, but only people carrying out
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:53.520]   various special functions. This thinking is anti-covenantal and naturally is found in Baptist
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:58.000]   circles far more readily than in Reformation churches, where the concept of covenant headship
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.560]   and submission for conscience's sake has been better preserved. The Bible, however, is not
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:07.120]   individualistic but covenantal, and this has implications not only for the doctrine of
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:12.720]   baptism but also for the doctrine of the right of revolution. Point number four. Tax strikes
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:18.880]   ignore the New Testament principle of invisibility and cooperation. In the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:23.520]   Jesus told his people to be pleasant and cooperative with oppressive authorities, so as
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:30.880]   to remain invisible and thus able to work in peace. Nothing is clearer than his command, "But I say to
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:39.120]   you, do not resist him who is evil." Jesus illustrates this principle of cooperation and
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:43.920]   invisibility by saying, "And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:51.680]   coat also; and whoever shall force you to go one mile, go with him too." (5:40-41) Was it right for
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:56.800]   the Roman authorities to steal shirts from the local population? Was it right for the state to
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:02.480]   force men to leave their jobs and carry a soldier's weapons the first mile out of town? No, clearly
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:07.200]   such actions violate the eighth commandment. Well, then, shouldn't the citizen resist this evil?
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:12.160]   Shouldn't he make a witness for the truth by standing up and refusing to cooperate?
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:16.000]   Would it not be better if everyone became a martyr rather than put up with his gross wickedness?
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:23.600]   No, says Jesus. It is a sin for the state to steal, but it is a sin for the citizen to rebel.
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:30.720]   What is the cash value of cooperation? Well, first of all, peace is gained. The state tends
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:35.920]   to leave people alone who cooperate with it, and peace is an indispensable prerequisite for social
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:40.640]   progress and economic advancement. The longer the kingdom is left alone, the better chance it has
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:47.120]   to grow. Second, invisibility is gained, since the anti-Christian state tends to ignore people who
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:52.480]   are not in flagrant rebellion. Invisibility allows the Christian counterculture to develop to great
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:59.040]   strength, unnoticed. Third, evangelism is enhanced, since the soldier will marvel when you carry his
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:03.360]   armor a second mile, and you may get the chance to tell him why you are doing this for him.
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:08.400]   Here again, the kingdom of Christ is advanced. Of course, ultimately the humanistic state will
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:13.840]   attack the church regardless and over the issue of who is God, the issue of worship. This, though,
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:18.480]   is the real issue, and the proper point at which to draw the line. By this time, however, the
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:23.520]   underground Christians will hopefully be powerful enough to thwart such a move. Tax strikes, in
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:28.480]   contrast, go in the opposite direction. By refusing to pay taxes, the striker calls attention to
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:33.760]   himself. He may argue that he is making a witness for Christ and for God's law, but in fact his
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:40.000]   witness is questionable. Christ has told him to pay, not to strike. Moreover, few will take his
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.360]   witness seriously. Most will think he is refusing to pay because he does not want to lose the money.
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:50.480]   Most will assume that his refusal to pay is nothing more than selfish materialism and rebellion,
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:56.640]   covered hypocritically by religious excuses. That is how people will look at it, and so the witness
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:02.640]   is compromised and lost. Does this advance the kingdom? How much better to be able to say,
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:07.520]   "I disapprove of these modern taxes, and I hope to help change them, but I pay them for
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:12.880]   conscience's sake because I am more concerned with principle than with my own money"? That
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:18.240]   is a witness people will hear. Part of the problem for legitimate tax strikers lies at just this
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:24.160]   point. The vast majority of tax strikers are not acting out of Christian principle, but either out
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:30.400]   of an anarcho-libertarian philosophy or out of pure personal covetousness. "This is my money."
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:36.320]   It is hard, I do not say impossible, for the Christian witness of a constitutional tax striker
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:39.840]   to be received in this present-day social context.
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:48.240]   Point number five. Tax strikes partake of the illusion of political power. The biblical insight
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:55.360]   that culture is an effect of religion is implicitly denied by political resistance movements.
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:02.800]   Politics does not change things. Rather, political change is a response to more fundamental
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:09.280]   cultural changes. What this means is that resistance movements always fail. The only
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:14.000]   resistant movements in the history of the world which have had any semblance of success have been
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:20.400]   those financed and supported by outside powers, such as the French resistance during World War II.
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:28.000]   The Bible recognizes this and thus puts emphasis on proclamation and education as the primary
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:34.080]   means of cultural transformation, though not the exclusive means. At present, Christian politicians
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:38.960]   can accomplish little to change the course of events. They can, however, use their offices
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:44.720]   and their campaigns as opportunities to witness and educate. Once the consensus of opinion in
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:50.240]   the United States has once again become Christian, the political order and its taxation will change
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:57.040]   in response. Tax strikers often argue that in the United States, each citizen has some limited
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:04.000]   powers of rule, since each citizen is a voter and each citizen may challenge bad laws in the courts.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:10.320]   This is true and may form a rationale for refusal to pay taxes. In this case, the striker will make
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:15.360]   it plain that when push comes to shove, he will pay his taxes and submit, but that he is trying
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:21.120]   to get a test case before the courts. If, by its actions, the United States government shows that
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:27.760]   it is a pure tyranny, then we must submit to it as Israel had to submit to Rome. We are not to
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:33.440]   that point yet, however. Point number six. Tax strikes resist the judgment of God.
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:39.520]   As the United States has voted itself into sin, God has increased his judgments against us.
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:46.800]   One of his primary means of judgment is to put an oppressive state over a sinful people. If we
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:52.080]   recognize that we have sinned, the proper response is to be mute under the chastening hand of God and
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:57.760]   not rebel. If the United States is ruled by oppressors, it is because the United States
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:03.680]   deserves to be punished for its sins. The Bible recognizes that statism is the only proper
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:10.400]   condition for slaves. Thus, Joseph, an agent of God, helped reduce the population of Egypt to
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:17.920]   slavery (Genesis 47). It is a species of non-covenantal anarchy to assume that an evil
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:24.240]   population can be given the privileges of liberty or will even desire such privileges. What this
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:30.160]   means is that the virtues of free enterprise and low taxes will never be apparent to people until
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:35.920]   they have first changed their religious beliefs. If the tax revolt were successful, it would only
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:41.760]   lead to anarchy because of the immorality of the American populace. This is nothing to worry about,
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:48.960]   however, because most people want the "benefits" of big government more than they want lower taxes.
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:54.240]   They are slaves, and because of their lawless behavior, the only kind of civil order appropriate
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:59.760]   to them is a heavy-handed one. Modern Americans do not want to take care of their old people.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:04.080]   They want to chuck them off into old folks' homes. Because of this irresponsibility,
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:09.440]   the government steps in. That means higher taxes. The only way to change this is for people to take
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:14.160]   care of their grandparents as they used to. It will accomplish little to attack the matter at
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:19.600]   the point of taxation. When God brought judgment on the kingdom of Judah, Jeremiah warned the
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:24.800]   people to submit to the chastening of the Lord. He told them to submit to Nebuchadnezzar. The
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:30.160]   rebels in Jeremiah's day, however, viewed him as a traitor and as an immoral man. They accused him
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:36.560]   of being a false prophet who wanted to "sell out the truth" to the heathen. Unlike Jeremiah,
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:40.880]   they were going to be loyal to God. They would fight Nebuchadnezzar. They would resist the
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:48.960]   oppressor. And they were wiped out. Over and over, they were wiped out. Jeremiah was right.
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:54.960]   When God judges us, we must submit to his judgment and preach his word. If we do so,
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.960]   in time, the situation will change.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:04.720]   Point #7. Tax strikes work against dominion. There are varieties of tax strikers,
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:10.320]   and this criticism does not apply to all, but it applies to some. Some tax strikers are so
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:14.320]   concerned that the government not get any of their money that they restrict their dominion so as to
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:19.360]   avoid paying taxes. One talented man quit a job for which he had trained for years,
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:23.280]   just because the company he worked for insisted on the practice of withholding.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:29.360]   He makes much less money now as a result. Thus, his tithe is proportionally lower,
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:33.840]   and the work of the kingdom suffers proportionally. One even hears of some who have taken
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:40.560]   "vows of poverty" to avoid taxes. And others move from place to place, fleeing IRS agents,
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:43.840]   thus thwarting the dominion mandate and disrupting family life.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:48.880]   Now, this kind of thing strikes me as a great evil. The Bible commands us over and over again
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:53.760]   to take dominion over the earth. Those faithful in small things are put over larger things.
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:59.200]   Nothing is said about the state in all this. God expects us to work, to expand our work,
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:05.360]   to prosper, and to tithe, whether the state be good, bad, or indifferent. We do not do our work
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:10.640]   with reference to the state, but with reference to God. Those seeking to force the hand of the
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:16.160]   humanistic power state by limiting their work and dominion are not taking into account the fact that
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:22.480]   the heart of the king is in God's hands, and God can turn it whithersoever he wishes. (Proverbs 21:1)
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:27.040]   In the film "The Bridge on the River Kwai," the captured British soldiers are forced by the
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:32.320]   Japanese to build a bridge for them. Initially, the soldiers do very crummy work, seeking to
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:37.440]   obstruct the progress of the Japanese empire. The British commander, however, remarks that the
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:42.800]   bridge should be built to last forever, since someday the Japanese would be gone, and, by
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:48.320]   implication, the British would enjoy the benefits of the bridge. This is a future-oriented and
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:54.560]   positive view. Similarly, we must work hard, expand our dominion, and wait for God to put us
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:56:00.640]   in charge. This was Daniel's attitude. He did not try to obstruct the workings of the Babylonian
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:06.640]   empire, but sought to be a servant par excellence. As a result, he was trusted by Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:12.640]   and God advanced him to a position of power in the Babylonian empire. Daniel became "ruler over the
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:18.640]   whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over the wise men of Babylon" (Daniel 2.48). Then,
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:24.240]   God struck Nebuchadnezzar with insanity for seven years (Daniel 4), during which time Daniel was
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:29.920]   doubtless the effective ruler of the empire. After Nebuchadnezzar recovered, he was convened
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:35.360]   and served the Lord. A second benefit of a work orientation is positive morale.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:40.240]   The British commander in "The Bridge on the River Kwai" was concerned that his men find joy and
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:46.080]   pride in their work. The Japanese were not his concern. He left their fate to providence. People
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:52.080]   whose lives are dedicated to obstructing the enemy are building a negative outlook on life into
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:58.160]   themselves, whether they realize it or not. We are called to build. God will remove the enemy when
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:04.160]   he is ready. Alexander Solzhenitsyn makes the same point in "One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich".
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:10.000]   The day's labor consists of building a wall. At the end of the day, Ivan takes pride in having
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:15.760]   built a straight wall. Ivan's situation was blessed because he was permitted to engage in
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:21.280]   meaningful work, not simply moving stones from one pile to another and back again. The point,
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:28.320]   however, is that even in the Gulag archipelago, men can find satisfaction in work. Even if Ivan's
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:33.600]   wall is torn down the next day so that no one inherits the fruits of his labor, he is still
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:40.240]   a better man for having built it well. The Bible teaches many places that a work-oriented culture
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:45.520]   will overcome an oppressive statist culture. It is significant, for instance, that the judge
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:52.720]   Shamgar defeated the Philistines using an implement of work and that the evil Abimelech was
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:58:00.800]   crushed by an implement of work (Judges 3:31; 9, 7-15, 53). The principle is set out expressly
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:08.240]   in Zechariah 1:18-21. In that passage, Israel is oppressed by four horns and delivered by four
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:14.560]   craftsmen. The horn is a universal symbol for oppressive external power and force. To get the
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:18.960]   right picture, we need only think of the Vikings with their horned helmets, raiding and oppressing
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:24.160]   Christian civilization. God does not, however, destroy the pagan horns with four horns of his
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:31.600]   own. Rather, they are overcome by four craftsmen. Diligent, dominical labor overcomes oppression.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:39.920]   A culture based on work and capital will overcome a culture based on conquest and raping. It is no
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:45.440]   accident that Jesus Christ was a carpenter. If Christians will be faithful and expand their
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:50.960]   dominion, pay their taxes without thinking about it for conscience's sake, and pay their tithes to
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:55.680]   the work of the kingdom, this country will be turned around soon enough. The argument of the
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:59:01.360]   persecuted early church was this, we pay our taxes to Caesar and we pray for Caesar. In fact,
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:08.880]   we are Caesar's best and most law-abiding citizens, but we cannot and will not worship Caesar. Thus,
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:12.320]   they made the issue crystal clear, and they won the day.
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:18.720]   Finally, let us turn to some considerations more positive toward tax strikes. To this point,
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:23.360]   we have been dealing with scriptural teachings in the abstract. Citizens of the United States
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:27.600]   of America must apply these teachings to their own historical and cultural situation.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:34.240]   First, we need to ask a couple of questions. Do we live in a Roman Empire type of tyranny?
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:39.920]   If so, let us pay taxes and be as invisible as possible. Do we live in a period of judgment,
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:45.520]   like Jeremiah's? If so, let us submit to God's chastening rod and build for a future day.
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:50.800]   Given the behavior of the IRS, I think we live in a situation somewhat close to tyranny,
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:54.640]   and given the apostasy of the citizenry of the United States, I think we live in a situation
[00:59:54.640 --> 01:00:00.960]   rather close to Jeremiah's. For these reasons, we ought to approach tax striking with a great deal
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:06.080]   of care. Second, we ought to have a clear rationale if we are going to join the tax revolt
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:10.640]   in an open, public way. In general, the proper rationale runs something like this,
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:17.040]   "Caesar for the U.S. is the Constitution, and the IRS is engaged in unconstitutional activities.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:21.680]   I, as a citizen ruler in the United States, am engaging in a legitimate and constitutional form
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:27.760]   of protest. I am working within the system." There are, of course, a variety of specific
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.520]   arguments used within this framework. The question of what constitutes income,
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:35.040]   the question of what constitutes real money, the question of the Fifth Amendment, and so on.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:42.640]   Third, we need to count the cost. Luke 14, 28-32. Do we have an organization sufficiently powerful
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:47.840]   to take on the IRS? As more and more people join the tax revolt openly, the possibilities of
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:52.320]   rolling back the IRS increase. The point is to count the troops before declaring war.
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:58.400]   Counting the cost is also personal. The pioneers of the anti-IRS movement will emerge as heroes in
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:04.240]   due course during the 1980s. Not every person, however, is called or able to be such a pioneer.
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:08.720]   To fight the IRS, one needs to have a pretty sharp mind, a good acquaintance with the law,
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:14.320]   a tough and aggressive personality, a supportive family, and money. There is no doubt but that the
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:19.120]   IRS functions tyrannically. The question is whether the U.S. government as a whole is now
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:23.600]   a tyranny also. If you have a wife and small children, who will care for them when you are
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:28.320]   in jail? If your children are grown, keep in mind that the IRS will persecute them as a way of
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:33.840]   harassing you. Okay, you're tough and your wife is tough. Now how smart are you? How did you do
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:38.720]   in school? Do you know the law or do you have a sharp lawyer? Another question, how much money
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:43.600]   do you make? It will take lots of money to fight one court case after another. You may have to flee
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:50.080]   from state to state. Count the cost. Fourth, recognize that you are forfeiting a lot of
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:54.800]   present dominion. Your goal is to enhance future dominion for your children by rolling back
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:00.240]   oppression today. Also keep in mind that you are fighting a negative battle. The kingdom of Christ
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:06.080]   will advance through conversion and education. At best, your fight against the IRS, if moderately
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:11.440]   successful, will give a few more years for the Church to do her work. Face it, the people of the
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:17.520]   United States want the so-called "benefits" of big government. Only the gospel will change that.
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:24.640]   Fifth, recognize the right of other Christians to remain uninvolved. We all have costs to count.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:30.640]   Not everyone can be a tax warrior. Sixth, and finally, keep your Christian principles in mind
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:36.480]   and before the public. Don't fall into the myth of political power. Don't try to make it out that
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:41.600]   the Bible requires you to do this. Make it clear that you have limited goals and that you are
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:48.000]   fighting on the basis of the principles of English common law and the U.S. Constitution, which you
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:57.040]   maintain are Caesar. Yours is not a revolutionary, but a conservative movement. And thus ends the
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:04.000]   essay. Now what's interesting is to reflect on what has happened since that article was published
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:14.240]   in April of 1981. My understanding of the last 40 years of history is that in essence, every single
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:20.640]   one of those arguments that were being pushed forward in the courts, etc., were lost, legally
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:27.360]   speaking. You can, if you consider yourself to be competent at legal thinking, you can consider
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:32.000]   whether you think they should have lost or not. From time to time I get people who send me very
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:40.320]   interesting articles, discussions, etc., on the question of what does the law say, etc. As far as
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:44.400]   I'm concerned, it's not a matter of what the law says or what the law doesn't say. It's just a
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:50.720]   matter of who's got the guns and who wants the money. And the question is, what is the Christian
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:57.840]   responsibility towards tyrants? What do you do? So I thought that Jordan did a good job of
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:03.520]   discussing that. There are other, you can find other discussions, very active in the Mennonite
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:09.280]   community. You can find some discussion about war taxes and whatnot in the Mennonite community. You
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:15.120]   can find other things over history that many people have wrestled with these things. But as
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:20.080]   far as I'm concerned, I think Jordan's article does a good job of striking to the heart of the
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:29.920]   matter. I remain sympathetic and appreciate those who feel strongly about tax resistance. But for
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:34.560]   many of the reasons outlined in that article, and just simply the sheer practicality of it,
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:39.040]   does not seem wise. I do not think that it is something that people should engage in.
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:46.720]   I would say that if you want to follow the legal methods that avoids the risk of being imprisoned,
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:51.760]   which is of course incredibly important, you can think about whether it's worthwhile to reduce your
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:05:00.240]   income. As far as I'm concerned, it seems much wiser to me if you can make $400,000 a year.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:07.280]   It seems much wiser to me to make $400,000 a year and set up a charitable organization dedicated to
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:13.360]   whatever the specific cause are, and then fund it with $200,000 per year of your income,
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:18.240]   take a $200,000 per year tax deduction, let the US government keep the rest of it. That seems a lot
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:24.000]   more effective than lowering your taxable income to $40,000 per year so that you don't pay federal
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.560]   income taxes. When you look at it and you understand financial planning, I think there are
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:33.760]   enough answers and solutions in good financial planning where you can stay on the right side of
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:39.440]   the law, you can be ignored and quiet by the IRS, you don't wind up being on the front page of a
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:44.400]   newspaper, you don't wind up being imprisoned, you can follow the law, and yet you can make much more
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:50.160]   productive change. Even if you don't, like, let's say that you have the opportunity, you say, "I
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:55.040]   have the capacity to serve people effectively enough to make a half a million dollars a year,
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:06:01.440]   but that means I'm going to owe some tax." Well, do it. Owe the tax. But then again, set up the
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:07.360]   appropriate organizations to accomplish some appropriate change in the local community.
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:14.160]   And if you, I'd much rather stroke a check for $100,000 to the IRS, let's say, let me just give
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:20.640]   you a simple example. What is better served? Let's say that you can earn, you can live on $50,000
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:26.320]   tax-free for round numbers. And so you could become a tax protester, lower your income to
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:33.040]   $50,000 and live on that so that you don't wind up owing the tax. Or you can work hard, you can
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:37.600]   exercise the talents and the skills and the knowledge and the ability that God has given you
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:42.080]   effectively, and you can earn half a million dollars. Well, earn the half a million dollars,
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:48.720]   put aside the 50, live on 50,000, freeing up 450. If you have to write a check for 100 to the
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:53.840]   government, write a check for 100 to the government and put the other 350 to work doing something
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:58.880]   useful. Take care of the widows and the orphans that live in your community. Take care of the
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:04.560]   poor. Take care of the people who are hungry. Preach the gospel. Endow the churches. Endow the
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:11.760]   people who are busy, who are doing good work. And that $350,000 will go so much farther than your
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:19.200]   tiny little voice in a tax protest movement. So that's how I see it. All of us have to wrestle
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:23.920]   with these things and settle them before the Lord, but that's how I see it. Hope that was helpful to
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:27.760]   you. It's an interesting topic. I've never heard a personal finance show that talked about tax
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:32.560]   protesting in anything other than a mocking way, which I don't think is a...it's very insulting
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:37.680]   because many millions of people have legitimate crises of conscience when it comes to these
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:43.200]   things. And so I hope that I've done a good job of dealing with it seriously, being careful with
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:49.200]   my language, talking about the solutions and the opportunities. I'll close today by telling you
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:53.840]   about my How to Survive and Thrive During the Coming Economic Crisis course. One component of
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:08:01.600]   that course is international expatriation. And one of my reasons for expatriating internationally,
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:06.800]   among other things, was I didn't ever want to be in a position where I didn't have a chance
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:12.720]   to get out of the United States if I came to the point that my conscience wouldn't allow me to
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:18.240]   have my tax money going towards things that are immoral. I've thought about it a lot over the
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:22.800]   years. I've wrestled with it. I've come to the point that...come to the positions I've just
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:27.440]   described. But I didn't...I wouldn't want to be stuck in a position where I was forced to pay
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:32.480]   taxes to a government that's engaged in immoral behavior. Well, what do you do? If you want to
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:36.800]   stay out of prison, if you want to follow the law, if you want to have a good witness of being a
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:44.240]   loyal citizen and a good subject of the king, what do you do? Well, one of the few options I see is
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:50.880]   to leave. Peacefully leave. And you're not hurting anybody, you're not harming anybody, you're just
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:56.240]   simply exercising your right of withdrawal. And that seems to me to be a healthy thing to do.
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:00.960]   Well, interestingly, that doesn't have to be something to be done in a crisis. It's an effective
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:06.560]   way of solving...of planning for a crisis. But it's also an extremely effective way of planning
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:14.160]   for things like increasing taxation and using the tax code as it exists. If you're a U.S. citizen,
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:19.360]   you can, as I described...described elsewhere on the show, you can live outside the United States
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:24.480]   and you can earn $105,000 a year not owing any taxes to the United States government. So if you
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:27.920]   want to be in finance, go work in the Cayman Islands, go work in Dubai. You don't owe any taxes
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:33.040]   to those governments, any income taxes to those governments, and you'll take advantage of your
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:36.800]   foreign earned income exclusion to the U.S. government. And if you want to be a war tax
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:42.640]   processor, that seems to me to be a better thing than living in the United States. Right? Just
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:48.480]   seems like an effective solution. And if you're a citizen of other countries as well, you can always
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:54.400]   expatriate. I've spoken to people who were German. Germans don't allow their citizens to homeschool,
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:58.000]   so you can stay in Germany and you can homeschool your children. You can fight it out with the
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:04.800]   police and you can battle them out, as a Christian homeschooling family did a number of years ago,
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:09.280]   all the way to the German Supreme Court. Or you can simply leave and you can homeschool your
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:14.960]   children in any corner of the world where such practices are legal. And in fact, as a German
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:19.520]   tourist, you can pretty much go anywhere and nobody will bother you. So it seems more effective
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:25.840]   and wise to me to avoid those conflicts and exercise your option to leave. If you're interested
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:31.200]   in how to prepare for an economic crisis to stay, I cover that too. But if you're interested in how
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:36.320]   you can avoid an economic crisis by leaving and that economic crisis could be personal, could be
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:39.680]   other things as well, I think you would enjoy my course called How to Survive and Thrive During
