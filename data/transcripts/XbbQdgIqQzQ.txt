[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.660]   I know of Freudian psychoanalysis. I know of any number of different branches of psychology
[00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.180]   that have a clinical slant to them. There's cognitive behavioral therapy. What are the
[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.820]   core components of internal family systems? Yeah. So one basic assumption is that the
[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.740]   mind isn't unitary, that actually we're all multiple personalities, not in the diagnostic
[00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:35.920]   sense. But we all have these, what I call parts, other systems call sub-personalities, ego states,
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:43.160]   things like that. And that it's the natural state of the mind to be that way, that we're born with
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:51.400]   them because they're all very valuable and have qualities and resources to help us survive and
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:01:01.640]   thrive. But trauma and what's called attachment injuries and the slings and arrows we suffer
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:11.020]   force these little naturally valuable parts into roles that can be destructive. Often they don't like
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:18.120]   it all. But because they're frozen often in time and during the trauma and they live as if it's still
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:25.100]   happening, they're in these protective roles that can be quite extreme and interfere in your life.
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:35.020]   And yeah, so I just stumbled onto the phenomena of 40, now I think it's 41 years ago. And it's been,
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.860]   you know, amazing ride. So at the time were you already practicing as a clinical psychologist?
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.080]   I actually have a PhD in Maryland family therapy. So I was part of the movement in family therapy away from
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.860]   intrapsychic work. There was a polarization and we thought we could reorganize families and heal all these
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.740]   symptoms just by doing that. We didn't have to muck around in the inner world. And I went to prove that.
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:09.180]   And this was about 1983, by getting a group of bulimic kids together and their families and
[00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:17.660]   tried to reorganize the families just the way the book said to and failed. The kids didn't realize
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.140]   they'd been cured and they kept binging and purging. So out of frustration, I began asking why? And they
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.980]   started talking this language of parts. And they would say some version of when something happens, bad happens
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:37.420]   in my life. It triggers this critic who's calling me all kinds of names inside. And that goes right to the heart of a
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:45.100]   part that feels empty and alone and worthless. And that's so distressing to feel that the binge part comes in and takes me out,
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.980]   takes me away from all that pain. But the critic comes in and attacks me for the binge. And then
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:00.300]   the criticism goes right to the heart of that worthless part. So to me, as a family therapist, this sounded
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:07.180]   like what I'd been studying in external families, these circular sequences of interaction. And so I just got
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.980]   curious and just started to explore. Are these different parts that exist within each and all of us,
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:22.140]   are they represented by a clear and distinct voice from the other? Or do people typically experience them
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:31.420]   as just the self, like my inner critic? You'll give us the other names and titles. Or is this happening
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:39.420]   typically below people's conscious awareness? Some of both. So most people are aware they're a critic and
[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.540]   but other times you're not aware of these parts we call exiles that you've locked away because
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:54.220]   you didn't want to feel their feelings. They're stuck in these bad trauma scenes. And to survive in your life,
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.940]   you had to push them away. And so with those parts, a lot of people aren't really consciously aware of them
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:15.420]   until these protector parts give space and open the door to the exiles.
